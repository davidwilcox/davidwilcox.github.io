<p style="margin-top: -20px">	Good afternoon, brothers and sisters, and welcome to a new semester at Brigham Young
University-Idaho.  It is for me a blessing and a remarkable responsibility to stand before you
today.  </p>
<p>	I have long been fascinated by the vast variety of analogies, imagery, and parables used
by the Savior and by His apostles to teach the saving principles of the gospel.  Frequently,
common and ordinary experiences are used by these master teachers to help a learner relate to
and better understand a vital principle or doctrine.  Consider, for example, the use in the
scriptures of the sense of taste.  Please turn with me to Alma 32:28.  Alma, while comparing the
word of God to a seed, also employs the sense of taste to emphasize and enhance for his readers
the significant spiritual consequences of exercising faith in Christ.</p>
<p><em>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give place,
that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true
seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that
ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold it will begin to swell
within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye
will begin to say within yourselves -- It must needs be that this is a
good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my
soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it
beginneth to be <strong>delicious</strong> to me </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p><em></em>Please note how the good seed is described in this verse as enlarging, as enlightening, and
as <strong>delicious</strong>.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith used the sense of taste in a similar way to summarize a key
point in his King Follett Sermon, given in April of 1844. </p>
<p><em>This is good doctrine.  It <strong>tastes</strong> good.  I can 
		<strong>taste</strong> the principles of
eternal life, and so can you . . . . You say honey is <strong>sweet</strong>, and so
do&nbsp;I.  I can also <strong>taste</strong> the spirit of eternal life. I know it is good;
and when I tell you of these things which were given me by
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you are bound to receive them as
<strong>sweet</strong>, and rejoice more and more</em> (<strong>Teachings of the Prophet
Joseph Smith</strong>, Section Six, 1843-1844, p. 355, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Hence, the Prophet Joseph relates our ability to taste to the importance of pondering upon
and savoring the sweetness of the Savior's saving doctrines.  </p>
<p>My purpose this afternoon is to describe and discuss and testify of one of the most
delicious doctrines of the restored gospel -- the doctrine of the <strong><em>redeeming</em></strong> and the 
	<strong><em>enabling</em></strong>
powers of the atonement of Jesus Christ.  And I hope to place particular emphasis upon the
enabling power of the atonement.   I have been most prayerful and serious about preparing my
presentation for today.   I yearn and invite and pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost to
be with me and with you as we visit together for these few minutes about this sacred subject.</p>
<p><strong>THE JOURNEY OF LIFE</strong></p>
<p>The framework for my message today is a statement by President David O. McKay.  He
summarized the overarching purpose of the gospel of the Savior in these terms:</p>
<p><em>. . . the purpose of the gospel is . . . to make bad men good and
good men better, and to change human nature</em> (from the film <em>Every
Member a Missionary</em>, as acknowledged by Franklin D. Richards,
<em>CR</em>, October 1965, pp. 136-137; see also Brigham Young, <em>JD</em>
8:130 [22 July 1860]).</p>
<p>Thus, the journey of a lifetime is to progress from bad to good to better and to experience
the mighty change of heart--and to have our fallen natures changed. </p>
<p>May I suggest that the Book of Mormon is our handbook of instructions as we travel the
pathway from bad to good to better and to have our hearts changed.  Please turn with me to
Mosiah 3:19.  In this verse King Benjamin teaches about the journey of mortality and about the
role of the atonement in successfully navigating that journey.</p>
<p><em>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the
fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the
enticings of the Holy Spirit, and <strong>putteth off the natural man</strong> and
		<strong>becometh a saint </strong>through the atonement of Christ the Lord . . .</em>
(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Now I want to stop at this point and draw our attention to two specific phrases.  First,
consider "and putteth off the natural man."  Let me suggest to you that President McKay was
fundamentally talking about putting off the natural man when he said, "The purpose of the gospel
is to make bad men good."  Now I do not believe the word "bad" in this statement by President
McKay connotes only wicked, awful, horrible, or inherently evil.  Rather, I think he was
suggesting that the journey from bad to good is the process of putting off the natural man or the
natural woman in each of us.  In mortality we all are tempted by the flesh.  The very elements out
of which our bodies were created are by nature fallen and ever subject to the pull of sin,
corruption, and death.  And we can increase our capacity to overcome the desires of the flesh and
temptations, as described in this verse, "through the atonement of Christ."  When we make
mistakes, as we transgress and sin, we are able to overcome such weakness through the
redeeming and cleansing power of the atonement of Jesus Christ.  As we frequently sing in
preparation to partake of the emblems of the sacrament:</p>
<p><em>His precious blood he freely spilt;<br />His life he freely gave,<br />A sinless sacrifice for guilt,<br />A dying world to save.<br />
</em>&quot;How Great the Wisdom and the Love," Hymns of The<br />Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1985, #195)</p>
<p>Now, please notice the next line in Mosiah 3:19:  "and becometh a saint."  May I suggest
this phrase describes the continuation and second phase of life's journey as outlined by President
McKay.  "The purpose of the gospel is to make bad men good"--or, in other words, put off the
natural man--"and good men better"--or, in other words, become more like a saint.  Now,
brothers and sisters, I believe this second part of the journey, this process of going from good to
better, is a topic about which we do not study or teach frequently enough nor understand
adequately.</p>
<p>If I were to emphasize one overarching point this afternoon, it would be this.  I suspect
that you and I are much more familiar with the nature of the redeeming power of the atonement
than we are with the enabling power of the atonement.  It is one thing to know that Jesus Christ
came to earth to <strong><em>die</em></strong> for us.  That is fundamental and foundational to the doctrine of Christ.  But
we also need to appreciate that the Lord desires, through His atonement and by the power of the
Holy Ghost, to <strong><em>live</em></strong> in us--not only to direct us but also to empower us.  I think most of us know
that when we do things wrong, when we need help to overcome the effects of sin in our lives, the
Savior has paid the price and made it possible for us to be made clean through His redeeming
power.  Most of us clearly understand that the atonement is for sinners.  I am not so sure,
however, that we know and understand that the atonement is also for saints--for good men and
women who are obedient and worthy and conscientious and who are striving to become better
and serve more faithfully.  I frankly do not think many of us "get it" concerning this enabling and
strengthening aspect of the atonement, and I wonder if we mistakenly believe we must make the
journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves, through sheer grit, willpower,
and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the gospel of the Savior is not simply about avoiding bad in our
lives; it is also essentially about doing and becoming good.  And the atonement provides help for
us to overcome and avoid bad and to do and become good.  There is help from the Savior for the
entire journey of life--from bad to good to better and to change our very nature.  Indeed, this
doctrine tastes good.</p>
<p>I am not trying to suggest that the redeeming and enabling powers of the atonement are
separate and discrete.  Rather, these two dimensions of the atonement are connected and
complementary; they both need to be operational during all phases of the journey of life.  And it
is eternally important for all of us to recognize that <strong>both</strong> of these essential elements of the
journey of life--both putting off the natural man and becoming a saint, both overcoming bad and
becoming good--are accomplished through the power of the atonement.  Individual willpower,
personal determination and motivation, and effective planning and goal setting are necessary but
ultimately insufficient to triumphantly complete this mortal journey.  Truly, we must come to rely
upon "<em>the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah</em>" (2&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;2:8).</p>
<p><strong>GRACE AND THE ENABLING POWER OF THE ATONEMENT</strong></p>
<p>I now want to describe in greater detail the enabling power of the atonement.  Brothers
and sisters, please notice the use of the word "grace" in the verse from 2 Nephi to which we just
referred.  In the <em>Bible Dictionary</em> in our scriptures, we learn that the word "grace" frequently is
used in the scriptures to connote "enabling power."  On page 697, under the word "grace," we
read:  </p>
<p><em>A word that occurs frequently in the New Testament, especially in
the writings of Paul.  The main idea of the word is <strong>divine means of
help or strength</strong>, given through the bounteous mercy and love of
Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p><em>It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his
atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every
person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of
everlasting life.</em></p>
<p>Now, please note these next sentences:</p>
<p><strong><em>It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals,</em></strong><em>
through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of
their sins, <strong>receive strength and assistance to do good works that
they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own
means.  This grace is an enabling power </strong>that allows men and
women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have
expended their own best efforts </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>In my personal scripture study, I often insert the term "enabling power" whenever I
encounter the word grace.  Consider, for example, this verse with which we are all familiar in
2&nbsp;Nephi, chapter 25, verse 23: "<em>. . . for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we
can do</em>."</p>
<p>Now let's review this verse one more time:</p>
<p><em>. . . for we know that it is by grace</em> [the enabling and strengthening
power of the atonement of Christ]<em> that we are saved, after all we
can do</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ILLUSTRATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The journey of a lifetime, as described by President McKay, is to go from bad to good to
better and to have our very natures changed.  And the Book of Mormon is replete with examples
of disciples and prophets who knew and understood and were transformed by the enabling power
of the atonement in making that journey.  May I suggest, brothers and sisters, that as we come to
better understand this sacred power, our gospel perspective will be greatly enlarged and enriched. 
Such a perspective will change us in remarkable ways.</p>
<p>Nephi is an example of one who knew and understood and relied upon the enabling
power of the Savior.  In 1 Nephi chapter 7 we recall that the sons of Lehi had returned to
Jerusalem to enlist Ishmael and his household in their cause.  Laman and others in the party
traveling with Nephi from Jerusalem back to the wilderness rebelled, and Nephi exhorted his
brethren to have faith in the Lord.  It was at this point in their trip that Nephi's brothers bound
him with cords and planned his destruction.  Now please note Nephi's prayer in verse 17:</p>
<p><em>O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me
from the hands of my brethren; yea, even <strong>give me strength that I
may burst these bands</strong> with which I am bound (emphasis added).</em></p>
<p>Now brothers and sisters, do you know what I likely would have prayed for if I had been
tied up by my brothers?  My prayer would have included a request for something bad to happen
to my brothers and ended with the phrase "<em>wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren</em>"
or, in other words, "Please get me out of this mess, NOW!"  It is especially interesting to me that
Nephi did not pray, as I probably would have prayed, to have his circumstances changed.  Rather,
he prayed for the strength to change his circumstances.  And may I suggest that he prayed in this
manner precisely because he knew and understood and had experienced the enabling power of
the atonement of the Savior.</p>
<p>I personally do not believe the bands with which Nephi was bound just magically fell
from his hands and wrists.  Rather, I suspect he was blessed with both persistence and personal
strength beyond his natural capacity, that he then "<em>in the strength of the Lord</em>" (Mosiah&nbsp;9:17)
worked and twisted and tugged on the cords and ultimately and literally was enabled to break the
bands.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the implication of this episode for each of us is quite straightforward. 
As you and I come to understand and employ the enabling power of the atonement in our
personal lives, we will pray and seek for strength to change our circumstances rather than praying
for our circumstances to be changed.  We will become agents who act rather than objects that are
acted upon (2 Nephi 2:14).</p>
<p>Consider the example in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Mosiah as Alma and
his people are being persecuted by Amulon.  As recorded in verse 14, the voice of the Lord came
to these good people in their afflictions and indicated:</p>
<p><em>And I will ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders,
that even you cannot feel them upon your backs.</em></p>
<p>Now if I had been one of Alma's people and received that particular assurance, my
response likely would have been, "I thank thee, and please hurry!"  But notice in verse 15 the
process the Lord used to lighten the burden.</p>
<p><em>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon
Alma and his brethren were made light; yea,<strong> the Lord did
strengthen them</strong> that they could bear up their burdens with ease,
and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of
the Lord (emphasis added).</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what was changed in this episode?  It was not the burden that
changed; the challenges and difficulties of persecution were not immediately removed from the
people.  But Alma and his followers were strengthened, and their increased capacity and strength
made the burdens they bore lighter.  These good people were empowered through the atonement
to <span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span> as agents and imp<span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span> their circumstances--and "<em>in the strength of the Lord</em>," Alma and his
people were then directed to safety in the land of Zarahemla.</p>
<p>Now some of you may be legitimately wondering, "Brother Bednar, what makes you
think the episode with Alma and his people is an example of the enabling power of the
atonement?"  I believe the answer to your question is found in a comparison of Mosiah 3:19 and
Mosiah 24:15.  Let's resume reading in Mosiah 3:19 where we previously had stopped:</p>
<p><em>. . . and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through
the atonement of Christ the Lord, and <strong>becometh as a child</strong>,
		<strong>submissive</strong>, <strong>meek</strong>, <strong>humble</strong>, 
		<strong>patient</strong>, <strong>full of love</strong>, <strong>willing to submit
to all things which the Lord </strong>seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a
child doth submit to his father </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>As we progress in the journey of mortality from bad to good to better, as we put off the
natural man or woman in each of us, and as we strive to become saints and have our very natures
changed, then the attributes detailed in this verse increasingly should describe the type of person
you and I are becoming.  We will become more childlike, more submissive, more patient, and
more willing to submit.  Now compare these characteristics in Mosiah 3:19 with those used to
describe Alma and his people in the latter part of verse 15 in Mosiah 24:</p>
<p><em>. . . and they did <strong>submit</strong> cheerfully and <strong>with patience</strong> to 
		<strong>all the will
of the Lord</strong> (emphasis added).</em></p>
<p>I find the parallels between the attributes described in these verses striking and an
indication that Alma's good people were becoming a better people through the enabling power of
the atonement of Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the story of Alma and Amulek contained in Alma 14.  In this
episode many faithful saints had been put to death by fire, and these two servants of the Lord had
been imprisoned and beaten.  Please consider this petition contained in verse 26 offered by Alma
as he prayed in prison:</p>
<p><em>O Lord, <strong>give us strength</strong> according to our faith which is in Christ,
even unto deliverance (emphasis added).</em></p>
<p>Here again we see reflected in his request Alma's understanding of and confidence in the
enabling power of the atonement.  Now note the result of this prayer, as described in the latter
part of verse 26 and in verse 28:</p>
<p><em>And they</em> [Alma and Amulek] <em>broke the cords with which they
were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for
the fear of destruction had come upon them.</em></p>
<p><em>And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were
not hurt; for <strong>the Lord had granted unto them power</strong>, according to
their faith which was in Christ </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Once again the enabling power is evident as good people struggle against evil and strive
to become even better and serve more effectively "<em>in the strength of the Lord</em>" (Mosiah&nbsp;9:17).</p>
<p>Let me present one final example from the Book of Mormon.  In Alma 31, Alma is
directing a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites.  You will recall that in this chapter we
learn about the Rameumptom and the prescribed and prideful prayer offered by the Zoramites. 
Please notice the plea for strength in Alma's personal prayer, as described in verse 31:</p>
<p><em>O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me <strong>that I may have strength</strong>, that I
may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon
me, because of the iniquity of this people</em> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>In verse 33 Alma also prays that his missionary companions will receive a similar
blessing:</p>
<p><em>Wilt thou grant unto them <strong>that they may have strength</strong>, that they
may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of
the iniquities of this people</em> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Again we observe that Alma did not pray to have his afflictions removed.  He knew he
was an agent of the Lord, and he prayed for the power to act and affect his situation.</p>
<p>The key point of this example is contained in the final verse of Alma 31, verse 38:</p>
<p><em>. . . yea, and <strong>he also gave them strength</strong>, that they should suffer no
manner of afflictions, <strong>save it were swallowed up in the joy of
Christ.</strong>  Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this
because he prayed in faith </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>No, the afflictions were not removed.  But Alma and his companions were strengthened
and blessed through the enabling power of the atonement to "suffer no manner of afflictions,
save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ."  What a marvelous blessing.  And what a lesson
each of us should learn.</p>
<p>Examples of the enabling power are not found only in the scriptures.  Daniel W. Jones
was born in 1830 in Missouri, and he joined the Church in California in 1851.  In 1856 he
participated in the rescue of handcart companies that were stranded in Wyoming by severe
storms.  After the rescue party found the suffering saints, provided what immediate comfort they
could, and made arrangements for the sick and the feeble to be transported to Salt Lake City,
Daniel and several other young men volunteered to remain with and safeguard the company's
possessions.  The food and supplies left with Daniel and his colleagues were, to say the least,
meager and were rapidly expended.  I will now quote from Daniel Jones' personal journal and his
description of the events that followed.</p>
<p><em>Game soon became so scarce that we could kill nothing.  We ate all the
poor meat; one would get hungry eating it.  Finally that was all gone,
nothing now but hides were left.  We made a trial of them.  A lot was
cooked and eaten without any seasoning and it made the whole company
sick.  Many were so turned against the stuff that it made them sick even to
think of it.</em></p>
<p><em>. . . Things looked dark, for nothing remained but the poor raw hides taken
from starved cattle.  We asked the Lord to direct us what to do.  The
brethren did not murmur, but felt to trust in God.  We had cooked the hide,
after soaking and scraping the hair off until it was soft and then ate it,
glue and all.  This made it rather inclined to stay with us longer than we
desired.  Finally I was impressed how to fix the stuff and gave the
company advice, telling them how to cook it; for them to scorch and
scrape the hair off; this had a tendency to kill and purify the bad taste that
scalding gave it.  After scraping, boil one hour in plenty of water,
throwing the water away which had extracted all the glue, then wash and
scrape the hide thoroughly, washing in cold water, then boil to a jelly and
let it get cold, and then eat with a little sugar sprinkled on it.  This was
considerable trouble, but we had little else to do and it was better than
starving.</em>  (Daniel W. Jones, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Forty Years Among the Indians</span>, pg. 81)</p>
<p>All that I have read thus far is a preparation for the next line from Daniel W. Jones'
journal.  It illustrates how those pioneer saints may have known something about the enabling
power of the atonement that we, in our prosperity and ease, are not as quick to understand:</p>
<p><em>We asked the Lord to bless our stomachs and <strong>adapt them to this
food</strong></em><strong></strong> (Ibid., emphasis added).</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I know what I would have prayed for in those
circumstances.  I would have prayed for something else to eat.  "Heavenly Father, please send me
a quail or a buffalo."  It never would have occurred to me to pray that my stomach would be
strengthened and adapted to what we already had.  What did Daniel W. Jones know?  He knew
about the enabling power of the atonement of Jesus Christ.  He did not pray that his
circumstances would be changed.  He prayed that he would be strengthened to deal with his
circumstances.  Just as Nephi, Amulek, and Alma and his people were strengthened, Daniel W.
Jones had the spiritual insight to know what to ask for in that prayer.</p>
<p><em>We hadn't the faith to ask him to bless the raw-hide, for it was
"hard stock."   On eating now all seemed to relish the feast.  We
were three days without eating before this second attempt was
made.  We enjoyed this sumptuous fare for six weeks.</em>
(Ibid.,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;81-82).</p>
<p>Thus, for Daniel and his associates, this delicious doctrine provided both physical and
spiritual nourishment.  </p>
<p>The enabling power of the atonement of Christ strengthens us to do things we could never
do on our own.  Sometimes I wonder if in our latter-day world of ease--in our world of
microwave ovens and cell phones and air-conditioned cars and comfortable homes--I wonder if
we ever learn to acknowledge our daily dependence upon the enabling power of the atonement.  	The greatest lessons I have learned about the enabling power have come from the quiet
example of my wife in our own home.  I watched her persevere through intense and continuous
morning sickness and vomiting during each of her three pregnancies.  She literally was sick all
day every day for eight months with each pregnancy.  That challenge was never removed from
her.  But together we prayed that she would be strengthened, and she indeed was blessed through
the enabling power of the atonement to do physically what in her own power she could not do. 
Sister Bednar is a remarkably capable and competent woman, and over the years I have seen how
she has been magnified to handle the mocking and scorn that come from a secular society when a
Latter-day Saint woman heeds prophetic counsel and makes the family and home and the
nurturing of children her highest priorities.  In today's world, a righteous woman and mother in
Zion will need both the enabling power of the atonement and priesthood support.  I thank and pay
tribute to Susan for helping me to learn such invaluable lessons.</p>
<p>In Alma chapter 7 we learn how and why the Savior is able to provide the enabling
power, beginning with verse 11:  </p>
<p><em>And he shall go forth, suffering <strong>pains</strong> and 
		<strong>afflictions</strong> and
<strong>temptations</strong> of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled
which saith he will take upon him the <strong>pains</strong> and the <strong>sicknesses</strong> of
his people</em> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Thus, the Savior has suffered not just for our iniquities but also for the inequality, the
unfairness, the pain, the anguish, and the emotional distress that so frequently beset us. 
Additional detail is described in verse&nbsp;12:  </p>
<p><em>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of
death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their
<strong>infirmities</strong>, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to
the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor
his people according to their infirmities </em>(emphasis added).<em></em></p>
<p>There is no physical pain, no anguish of soul, no suffering of spirit, no infirmity or
weakness that you or I ever experience during our mortal journey that the Savior did not
experience first.  You and I in a moment of weakness may cry out, "No one understands.  No one
knows."  No human being, perhaps, knows.  But the Son of God perfectly knows and
understands, for He felt and bore our burdens before we ever did.  And because He paid the
ultimate price and bore that burden, He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of
mercy in so many phases of our life.  He can reach out, touch, and succor--literally run to
us--and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could
never do through relying only upon our own power.</p>
<p>Perhaps now we can more fully understand and appreciate the lesson of
Matthew&nbsp;11:28-30:</p>
<p><em>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.</em></p>
<p><em>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</em></p>
<p><em>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</em></p>
<p>I express my appreciation for the infinite and eternal sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
The atonement is not only for people who have done bad things and are trying to be good.  It is
also for good people who are trying to become better and serve faithfully and who yearn for an
ongoing and mighty change of heart.  Indeed, "<em>in the strength of the Lord</em>" (Mosiah 9:17) we can
do and overcome all things.  Brothers and sisters, truly this is precious and delicious doctrine.</p>
<p>Later this year I will celebrate my fiftieth birthday.  I can think of no person or
knowledge or influence or event that has had a greater impact upon me during my half century of
mortality than the doctrines I have attempted to discuss this afternoon.  I pray that you will learn
and understand and appreciate and apply this essential doctrine early in your lives.  I know the
Savior lives.  I have experienced both His redeeming and enabling power, and I witness that
these powers are real and available to each of us.  I know He directs the affairs of this Church.  I
know apostles and prophets authoritatively act for and in behalf of the Lord Jesus Christ.  These
things I know to be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege and a wonderful honor for me to be here, but I
must say that it has caused a certain degree of stress.  I love to teach the gospel.  I love to learn of
the Lord.  My biggest concern about giving this address is that I do not bring sufficient honor to
our Father and His Son Jesus Christ, not only today, but in my personal life.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I shouldn't feel that I am alone or without help.  I know many people are praying for me.  All the
religion faculty are praying that I won't embarrass the Religion Department with what I say or
how I say it.  Anyone who works at BYU-Idaho who knows me is praying that I won't bring this
institution into disrepute.  And, most of all, my wife is praying that I won't say some of the dumb
things that she has heard me say so many times before.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">However, as great as my efforts are to do well, I know that any success, or strength, or wisdom,
or revelation, or comfort, or appreciation that comes as a result of your being at this devotional
assembly, will occur as a direct blessing that we receive from the hand of God himself.  My
responsibility is to do all I can, to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in helping prepare
you for the reception of His Spirit.  You and I both know that it is the Spirit of the Lord, the Holy
Ghost who does the teaching in this Church.  Regardless of the charisma and charm, or the
deliberate and somewhat monotonous way in which a speaker presents his message, every one of
us can be uplifted, empowered, enriched, and blessed as we feel what the Lord would have us
feel and as we are attuned to that Holy Spirit.  Therefore, my responsibility and desires to be an
instrument in the hands of the Lord should be no greater than your responsibility and, hopefully,
your desires to hear the word of the Lord, not necessarily my words, but that which our Heavenly
Father would like you to hear and act upon.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, I am much older than most of you here today.  There are a few who are older than I.  For
example, President Bednar is older than I by, I think 2 months, though he looks much younger
and certainly behaves and acts much more dignified than I.  Perhaps some of us who are older
and who have had more of life's experiences than some of you, have a different vantage point
from which we look upon the works and glories and mercies of God.  It is my great desire to help
each of us gain the desire to develop what I will refer to as "True Devotion."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One dictionary defines devotion as <em>"great love or loyalty, enthusiastic zeal"</em> or 
	<em>"religious
worship"</em> (Oxford American Dictionary, 1980, p. 176).  From this same dictionary, we find that
the word "devout" is a derivative of the word "devotion."  Devout means "earnestly religious,
earnest, sincere."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have often wondered about my devotion to God, my earnestness in serving Him, my great love
to and for Him, my enthusiastic zeal for this great work in which we are all involved, first and
foremost by covenant, and secondly, by our faithfulness to the gospel cause.  I have tried to
determine some of the components that make up true devotion and will now share some of them
with you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To whom are we devoted?  Let us begin with Him to whom the greatest Being that has ever lived
on the face of this earth gave all glory, honor, credit, faith, and devotion; that Being to whom our
own Savior, Jesus Christ constantly referred as His Father.  Who is this Father to whom we have
been taught to address ourselves in sacred, sincere prayer (Moses 5:8)?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We use the name "God" most often to refer to our Heavenly Father.  Certainly that is appropriate
and right.  We know that He is the literal Father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9).  We therefore,
have the privilege and responsibility of communicating directly with our Father.  He is also the
literal Father of the spirit of Jesus Christ, but also the literal Father of the physical body of our
Lord.  This is why we refer to the Savior as "the Only Begotten of the Father" (D&amp;C 76:23),
because Jesus is the only person whose physical father is the same as the Father of His spirit.  No
one else has that distinction.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our Heavenly Father is also known as "Man of Holiness" (Moses 6:57).  He is a "Holy Man." 
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man,
and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!"  This truth has been captured in the famous couplet,
authored by Lorenzo Snow, which states: "As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man
may be" (Lorenzo Snow, Biography and Family Records of Lorenzo Snow, p. 46, Spring, 1840).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This Man of Holiness is, as was stated before, the Father of Jesus Christ, both spiritually and
physically.  Therefore, Jesus is appropriately known as "the Son of Man of Holiness," or "the
Son of Man" (see Mormon Doctrine, p. 742; also Topical Guide, "Jesus Christ, Son of Man", p.
256).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our Father is holy, as is His Only Begotten Son.  He was and is the focus of the Savior's love
and devotion.  The Savior taught, <em>"I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him
[meaning, the Father].   . . . as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  I do always
those things that please him.  I speak that which I have seen with my Father"</em> (John 8: 26, 28-29,
38).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If the greatest of all men felt that way about Heavenly Father, how much more should give
reverence, praise, thanks and demonstrate our love and appreciation to this God of Gods?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As the great prophet Enoch saw a vision of "all the inhabitants of the earth," he noticed that the
wondrous Being, the "God of heaven" who "looked upon the residue of the people" who lived
before the flood of Noah, wept (Moses 7:21,28).  Enoch couldn't understand why, knowing that
this great Being was "holy and from all eternity to all eternity" (Moses 7:29).  He was told:</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>. . . unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should
love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father: but behold, they
are without affection, and they hate their own blood </em>(Moses 7:33).</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe that, not only did the people before the time of the flood, hate each other, but they hated
their God and Father, as well as the Son of God, who spoke with these prophets.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We must not ever speak of our Father or His Beloved Son irreverently.  It brings shame to His
children, and especially to those of us who understand our true relationship with Him.  Speaking
irreverently is much more than taking His name in vain, although that is a very serious sin and
breach of our covenants.  Sometimes we speak a little carelessly about Deity.  We are taught very
clearly in the Doctrine and Covenants about the sacred nature of the name of Heavenly Father
and His Son, Jesus Christ.  We are taught the reason for naming the higher priesthood after
Melchizedek.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was
such a great high priest.  Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after
the Order of the Son of God.  But out of respect or reverence to the name of the
Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church,
in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek
Priesthood</em> (D&amp;C 107:2-4).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In our work, play, or anytime, we must communicate with others our love, respect, and devotion
to our Father in Heaven.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Who is Jesus Christ?  The Only Begotten Son in the flesh.  He is known as the Eternal Father of
heaven and earth (Alma 11:39).  He is our Brother, our Savior and our God.  He has created
worlds without number, including this one (Moses 1:33).  His sacrifice and atonement is infinite
and eternal (Alma 34:8-10).  He speaks like the Father.  He speaks as the Father.  He thinks like
the Father.  He acts like the Father (Hebrews 1:1).  He looks like the Father.  He and the Father
are united in all things, so much so, that we seldom feel the need to differentiate between
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ when we talk about how much the "Lord" has blessed us, or
how much we depend upon the "Lord."  What is their united purpose?  To bring to pass the
immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39).  We then have the same responsibility and
opportunity to speak as reverently, to love as devoutly, to appreciate as sincerely, our Savior and
Redeemer, as we do the Father of our spirits.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have sung hymns of praise all my life, not always realizing the significance of the words I was
singing, nor He to whom the hymn was directed.  The longer I live and the more I learn of the
majesty of our Father and His Son, the more I realize my dependence on the Lord.  There is an
interesting verse in Ether 12 which has taken on additional meaning for me.  It is verse 27.  You
are all very familiar with it.  You have heard it mentioned many, many times.  Very often it is
used to show how our weaknesses can be made strengths.  Let me suggest something.  Let's read
this verse very slowly, especially the first part of it.</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And if men come unto me. . .</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First of all, when men come unto Christ, something happens.  Ether 12:27 was written by
Moroni.  He teaches much more about coming unto Christ in the last chapter of the book of
Moroni, the third and second to the last verses.  Let's read those two verses.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all
ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with
all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his
grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in
Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.  And again, if ye by the grace of
God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ
by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the
covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
without spot </em>(Moroni 10:32-33).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is by "coming unto Christ" that we are made perfect and in no other way.  There is much more
to "coming unto Christ" than simply being a member of His Church and attending our meetings
each week.  When  men go through the process of coming unto Christ (denying themselves of all
ungodliness, loving God with all their might, mind and strength), then the grace of God is
sufficient to make us "perfect in Christ."  We can then be sanctified and made holy, without spot.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, back to Ether 12.  You see, to me, verse 27 is not a generic verse with application to
anyone who has a multitude of weaknesses.  It is directed to those who are truly making the effort
to come unto Christ.  Now, what happens "if men come unto me?"</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">I will show unto them their weakness.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Notice: the word "weakness" is singular, not plural (weaknesses).  You would think that if the
Lord is going to go to all the trouble of helping us make our weaknesses strong, He would at
least, suggest that we have more than one weakness to overcome.  But that is not what I think He
is trying to teach us.  He uses the same word, "weakness," singular, again when He says:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>I give unto men weakness that they may be humble</em>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What weakness can we possess that will help us more than any other to be humble?  And what
does it mean to be humble?  President Spencer W. Kimball once said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Humility develops through prayer and study.  Somebody asked me this morning,
'How do you keep humble?  Sometimes I am humble and sometimes I am
unhumble.  How do you keep humble?'  I think there is a formula that will never
fail.  First, you evaluate yourself.  What am I?  I am the circle.  I am the hole in
the doughnut.  I would be nothing without the Lord.  My breath, my brains, my
hearing, my sight, my locomotion, my everything depends upon the Lord.  That is
the first step and then we pray, and pray often, and we will not get up from our
knees until we have communicated.  The line may be down; we may have let it fall
to pieces, but I will not get up from my knees until I have established
communication--if it is twenty minutes, if it is all night like Enos.  If it takes all
day long, you stay on your knees until your unhumbleness has dissipated, until
you feel the humble spirit and realize, 'I could die this minute if it were not for the
Lord's good grace. I am dependent upon him--totally dependent upon him,' and
then you read the scriptures. Could you read these scriptures . . . and not be lifted
and inspired?  Can you read about the prophets--David O. McKay--and not feel
weak and small in comparison? Well, you can create humility, and humility has to
be fed, too, in the same way, with the right kind of vitamins. And when you have
success, you do not glory in it for you, you glory in it for the Lord </em>(The Teachings
of Spencer W. Kimball,  p. 233).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Kimball mentioned two things that I think answer the question I proposed about the
word "weakness" in Ether 12:27.  First, humility is the realization that without the Lord, we are
nothing, absolutely nothing.  Secondly, we must realize that we are completely and totally
dependent upon the Lord for our very existence, even the very air we breathe.  To me, this is the
meaning of the word "weakness."  The weakness the Savior gives to those who seek Him, who
come unto Him, is the recognition of their absolute and total dependence upon Him for
everything they have and are.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If we read Ether 12:27-28 in its entirety, we can see that the Lord desires us, (and we are
identified with the Gentiles--see D&amp;C 109:60) to be "brought unto [Christ]--the fountain of all
righteousness."  Why?  Because Jesus Christ is "the Way, the Truth and the Life" and "no man
cometh unto the Father, but by [Him}" (John 14:6).  " . . . there is none other name under heaven
given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).  Without Jesus Christ there is no joy,
no hope, no faith, no truth, no eternal family, no celestial life, no life at all.  Certainly, He is and
must be viewed as the focal point of our lives, our hearts and feelings, our minds and thoughts,
our acts and in every part of our lives.  Do we not even covenant, and renew that covenant
weekly, to "always remember Him."  (D&amp;C 20:77, 79)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The need for humility, the recognition of our total dependence and our sincere, heart and spirit-felt gratitude for the mighty and marvelous works of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ should be
evident to every living soul.  But I know that I do not "always remember Him" as I have
covenanted to do.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Mormon, the great editor of the Book of Mormon, almost seemed angry with the wickedness of
the children of men when they forsook the blessings of the gospel and the kindness of the Lord
and didn't realize what He had really done for them.  Notice what Mormon says in Helaman
12:1-2.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the
children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth
bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.  Yea, and we may see at the
very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields,
their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of
precious things of every king and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out
of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they
should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the
welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden
their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the
Holy One--yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great
prosperity</em> (Helaman 12:1-2).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have thought, on occasion, of Mormon's words that people "do trample under their feet the
Holy One."  How could anyone trample the Holy One of Israel under their feet?  It is almost
beyond comprehension that people would do such a thing.  And then I found a very conscience
crushing verse.  1 Nephi 19:7.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and
soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet.  Yea, even the very God of
Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would
speak in other words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his
counsels </em>(1 Nephi 19:7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You see, I have trampled the very God of Israel under my feet before, because I have set Him at
naught (meaning of no value, worthless) and have not kept His commandments.  I am sure that
when I have not kept His commandments I didn't think that I considered Him or His
commandments to be of no value.  That is just the problem--I didn't think!  I didn't remember
what He has done for me.  I didn't recognize or consider His pre-mortal stature as Jehovah--the
God of Israel, the creator of this earth and millions of earths like it.  I didn't think about His
divine, prophecy-fulfilling birth; His exemplary life; His soul-saving teachings; His compassion-filled ministry; His selflessness; His ever-present desire to save and exalt His brothers and
sisters, his children.  I didn't think of His excruciating pain and blood soaked clothing in
Gethsemane; His humiliating arrest and trial; His death and resurrection; His ministry to other
nations and people; His appearance, along with the Father, to Joseph Smith; the restoration of
His gospel to the earth for the benefit and blessing of you and me.  I had no idea or realization
that my very life and being depends upon Him.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">King Benjamin understood how much we need the Savior, and yet, how little we realize what He
does for us each and every day.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>I say unto you , my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise
which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you,
and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has
granted that ye should live in peace one with another--I say unto you that if ye
should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you
from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do
according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to
another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be
unprofitable servants </em>(Mosiah 2:20-21).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is a tremendous list of some of the countless things that we receive from the Lord each and
every day.  How often do we truly stop and appreciate our great blessings?  No wonder King
Benjamin told us that we "cannot say that [we] are even as much as the dust of the earth"
(Mosiah 2:25).  Mormon said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than
the dust of the earth.  For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither,
to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God
</em>(Helaman 12:7-8).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But the children of God (generally speaking) seldom even listen to Him, or consider His words
and the words of His prophets important enough, even to read and study, let alone obey!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I be bold enough to suggest that all the times I thought I had come up with such a good idea;
or on those occasions when I just happened to say the right thing, or be in the right place; or how
lucky I was to find something, had very little to do with my great abilities or luck, but everything
to do with the power and blessings of the Lord to one of His children.  Let us look at another
blessing, given by our Father to every soul that is born into this world.  Doctrine and Covenants
88 teaches us that Jesus Christ is:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>the light of truth; Which truth shineth.  This is the light of Christ.  As also he is in
the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.  As
also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by
which it was made; As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which
they were made; And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon
which you stand.  And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through
him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your
understandings; Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the
immensity of space--The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all
things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God
who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of
all things </em>(D&amp;C 88:5-12).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is very little, if anything, that we achieve or acquire on our own without the help and
blessings of the Lord.  I have come to know this and better understand it.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now with all of these truths about how we are so dependent on the Lord, so richly blessed
(beyond our imagination) with knowledge, truth, covenants, priesthood, blessings, temples,
commandments, the soft and tender feelings of the Spirit of the Lord, etc.; how can we possibly
not be a humble and a grateful people?  And yet, listen to another commandment given to us by
the Lord.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things 
		</em>(D&amp;C 59:7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save
those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments</em>
(D&amp;C 59:21).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am convinced that we as Latter-day Saints, indeed, of all the world can do better with regard to
showing our love and true devotion to God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We can better appreciate the beautiful surroundings where we live, no matter where it might be. 
Have you noticed the beautiful sunsets?  Do we appreciate the myriad hues of green, particularly
in the spring when the leaves first come out on the trees, that the Lord has chosen to color so
many living plants?  Do we acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our lives, the food we eat,
which grew without our toil and sweat?  Do we recognize the truly unfathomable blessing of
being members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ with all its attendant and eternal blessings
and possibilities, including eternal and forever families, spouses, children, etc.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Once we understand the unpayable debt we owe to such a philanthropic Father, how can we be
careless about covenants?  How can we be nonchalant about church callings and responsibilities? 
How can we be lackadaisical in taking advantage of such a wonderful opportunity to study at this
university?  How can we even think about being absent, or even late to a formally scheduled
devotional, whether it be offered here on Tuesdays or on Sundays, when we have the privilege of
showing our true devotion to a truly devoted Father?  Though we can never repay our Father for
all that He does for us, we could act as though it were possible.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have shared with you some very sacred and personal thoughts and feelings.  I have tried to
express, as best as I can, with all the weaknesses that I have the desire I have to be better; to be
more appreciative, to be more obedient, to be more devoted to the greatest cause and truth in all
the world.  I know that I will stand ashamed before the Lord at some future day, when I find out
all that He truly did for me while on this earth that I didn't appreciate, or even know about.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I humbly pray that I will not take the great mercy and grace of the Lord for granted.  I pray that I
will "always remember Him;" that I will do all in my power to demonstrate my love and true
devotion to my Lord and my God that I may not have to stand with shame and embarrassment,
when I find out how much more I have received from Him than I ever realized.  In the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">A week ago our daughter's best friend was baptized.  We have known Sheila since she and
Rachel were on the cross country team in middle school.  It has been exciting to see her embrace
the gospel and make the decision to become a member of the church.
</p>
<p>I think she decided she wanted to be married in the temple almost before she decided she wanted
to be a member.  She saw the examples of great families among her many Latter Day Saint
friends, and knew she wanted her future family to have the same blessings.  She is a young
woman who is wise beyond her years.  </p>
<p>Elder Boyd K. Packer said, "In the Church we build...buildings of many kinds.  In them we
worship, we teach, we find recreation, we organize.  We can organize stakes, wards and missions
and quorums and Relief Societies in these buildings or even in rented halls.  But, when we
organize families according to the order that the Lord has revealed, we organize them in the
temples.  Temple marriage, that sealing ordinance, is a crowning blessing that you may claim in
the holy temple."</p>
<p>After Sheila was baptized she received a gift that will be her greatest help in achieving her goal
to have a temple marriage.  That gift was the privilege to have the Holy Ghost as her constant
companion. </p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants Section 130: 22 we read, "The Father has a body of flesh and bones
as tangible as man's; the Son also: but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a
personage of Spirit.  Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us." Sheila has been
taught that because the Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead, her thoughts and actions will
determine the extent to which the Holy Ghost can dwell with her.</p>
<p>A great Relief Society teacher, Louisa Albrecht, taught the young women in the BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho 12th
Ward that while <u>we</u> may not think that the movie we are watching, or the music to which we are
listening is offensive, we need to ask ourselves if it would be offensive to the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>We must be careful to avoid the mistakes of the Nephites in Helaman 4:24,
		</p>
<p>"And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the
Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had
withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy
temples---"</p>
<p>It is good to constantly monitor our feelings to see if what we are feeling is the love, joy, peace,
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, and temperance that the apostle Paul taught were
the fruits of the Spirit.  </p>
<p>Elder David B. Haight and his wife Ruby attended a movie they very much enjoyed some time
before their call to serve as Mission President and companion in Scotland.  On the voyage home
at the completion of their mission, they attended a showing of the same movie.  They were
shocked to discover that there were  things in the movie that were distasteful and offensive to the
spirit.  What had happened?  Sister Haight wondered if those who had made the movie had added
these offensive things, but the truth was that the movie had not changed; the change was in Elder
and Sister Haight.</p>
<p>This is the way we are schooled by the spirit.  As we strive harder to keep the commandments
our spirits become more refined, and we find ourselves feeling uncomfortable and ill at ease with
what we may have thought was funny or entertaining at an earlier stage of our development.  
		</p>
<p>A word of warning.  If we do not heed the promptings of the holy spirit, we will lose its guidance
in our lives. King Benjamin taught his people in Mosiah 2:36-37, </p>
<p>"And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been
taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has
been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it
may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed,
prospered, and preserved-</p>
<p>I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion
against God: therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to
all righeousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in
unholy temples."</p>
<p>Every day we make choices that either draw us closer to Heavenly Father, or take us further
away.  The way we dress, the words we speak, the music to which we listen, the movies or
television we choose to watch, the very thoughts we think move us along our chosen path.  The
Holy Ghost is our teacher to help us know whether our choices are good or evil.</p>
<p>Choosing to draw closer to Heavenly Father brings us untold blessings.  King Benjamin further
taught his peole, "And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy
state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed in all things,
both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven,
that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.  O remember,
remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it." </p>
<p>This year our course of study in the gospel doctrine class in Sunday School is the Old Testament. 
I have always found it most surprising that Esau would sell his birthright to his brother Jacob for
a mess of pottage.  Esau has always looked so foolish and shortsighted to me. 
		</p>
<p>If we liken the scriptures unto us, we might see that mess of pottage as watching an episode of
"Friends" on TV.  Or trying to copy the immodest styles of some of the idols of our day, the
movie and music stars. </p>
<p>My dear young people, I pray that you will be wise that you may receive the promise given in
Doctrine and Covenants 45: 57-59 </p>
<p>"For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit
for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not
be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</p>
<p>And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply
and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.</p>
<p>For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will
be their king and their lawgiver." </p>
<p>I look forward to the day when I may worship at the feet of my Savior and bathe his feet with my
tears.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font size="2">January 29, 2002</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Thank you for that introduction.  It is a pleasure to be here at one of the greatest educational
institutions in the entire world.  Why do I call it that?  First, because of the faculty who put
students ahead of any other academic or professional considerations.  Second, because of the
students, you, who put the Church and kingdom of God first in your lives.</p>
<p>Before I begin my message to you this afternoon, I want to respond briefly to the request made by
President Bednar.  He asked that I share with you some thoughts regarding the First Presidency's
formation of the new Idaho Area. </p>
<p>I first heard about this last March, just before April conference.  I was at work when my 
secretary (who, incidentally, is not a member of the Church) buzzed me on the intercom and said,
"Boyd K. Packer is on the line for you."  I said, "I'll take it."  And I did.  President Packer said
something like this:  "Scott, we would like to make a change in your assignment.  Effective
August 15<sup>th</sup> the North America Northwest Area will be divided, and a new Idaho Area will be
created.  It will cover the boundaries of the Idaho Pocatello and Boise Missions and will include
about 100 stakes.  We are calling a new Area Presidency, composed entirely of Area Authority
Seventies.  We would like you to serve as the Area president."</p>
<p>He then went on to tell me who my two counselors would be, Elders D. Rex Gerratt and Ronald
L. Loveland.  He explained that we would continue our full-time employment while we carried
out the Area Presidency assignment on a Church-service basis, just like bishops and stake
presidents do. </p>
<p>It has been a wonderful experience for us.  We are thoroughly impressed with the caliber of
leadership of the Church in the Idaho Area and the faithfulness of the members in the area.</p>
<p>The stake presidencies of the six BYU-Idaho stakes are exemplary of that leadership.  You
students are outstanding examples of faithful Latter-day Saints.  It is an honor for me to be here
with all of you today.   </p>
<p>As I pondered what I should say here this afternoon, a flood of ideas passed through my mind.  I
have prayed fervently to know what the Lord would have me say to you.  I now pray that, as you
listen to my words, you will feel His spirit in your hearts and that impressions will come into
your minds that will bless you in this critical time in your lives.</p>
<p>You stand at a critical crossroad in your life.  The choices you have recently made and will make
in the next few years will determine how that future will <em>really</em> be. 
		</p>
<p>As much as the world might lead you to believe, you are NOT like other college kids. You are
the children of the promise, the Lord's covenant people, <em>"a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who
hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" </em>(1 Peter 2:9).</p>
<p>As a Latter-day Saint, you are not left in the dark.  You have apostles and prophets who give
spiritual direction that will help you overcome the world.  You have the gift of the Holy Ghost to
give you individualized guidance in your personal life.</p>
<p>You are under covenant.  All of you have entered into the baptismal covenant.  You young men
have taken upon you the oath and covenant of the priesthood.  Thousands of you have been
endowed from on high in God's holy temple, and hundreds of you have entered into the new and
everlasting covenant of marriage with the attendant promises of future <em>"thrones, kingdoms,
principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths"</em> (D&amp;C 132:19).</p>
<p>I decided that the most important subject I could discuss today is how to establish and maintain
an eternal family by following the counsel of the prophets.</p>
<p>On April 6, 1830, the day the Church was organized, the Lord gave a revelation to that handful of
Saints which applies to all of us today.  In the first verse of D&amp;C 21, he spoke to the Prophet
Joseph Smith saying, "<em>Behold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be
called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ . . . ."</em>  Then the Lord spoke to
us as members of His Church saying, <em>"Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto
all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in
all holiness before me; For his word </em>[Whose word?  The prophet's word.]<em> ye shall receive, as if
from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith" </em>(D&amp;C 21:4-5).</p>
<p>Consider those two descriptive words, <em>patience</em> and <em>faith</em>.  Prophets don't teach things that are
popular.  We may not understand why the prophets would ask us to do certain things (or not do
things); for example, cautioning you to choose carefully the music to which you listen; to avoid
pornography; or to not dress immodestly.  These may appear to be insignificant things.  But I
promise you that as you exercise faith in their words by following their counsel, there will come
a day when you will <em>know</em> that what they have spoken was for your protection and blessing. 
With the passage of time, and with patience, you will know that they have literally spoken the
word of God.</p>
<p>In the next verse the Lord gives us a promise, <em>"For by doing these things</em> [What things? 
Receiving the prophet's words as if from the mouth of God himself.] <em>the gates of hell shall not
prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you,
and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory."  </em></p>
<p>In these days of ever-present, all-pervasive temptations, doesn't it give you comfort to know that
as you follow the prophet's counsel, that God promises you that hell itself shall not prevail
against you, that God will disperse the powers of the adversary from before you, and that the very
powers of heaven will be moved for your good and His glory?  </p>
<p>Now, understanding the Lord's counsel and the blessings promised when we follow the teachings
of the prophets, I want to address five specific teachings regarding MARRIAGE AND FAMILY
that have been taught repeatedly by prophets of our day.  Like most teachings from prophets,
these teachings are not popular with the world.  </p>
<p>The <u>FIRST</u> is the counsel that we should not postpone marriage; 
		<u>SECOND</u>, that we should not
postpone having children, nor should we limit the number of our children; <u>THIRD</u>, the
encouragement that mothers not seek employment outside the home; <u>FOURTH</u>, giving spiritual
leadership in your home and family; and <u>FIFTH</u>, staying true and faithful to your covenants.</p>
<p>FIRST, regarding the counsel to NOT POSTPONE MARRIAGE, President Ezra Taft Benson
stated:</p>
<p><em>God has a timetable--a sequence or season for good things.  A mission, when its
time has arrived, takes priority over marriage and education.  And when one is
mature enough and has found the right companion, marriage should not be
delayed for education.  While all three--mission, marriage, and education--are
essential, there is a proper order to follow </em>(The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p.
192).</p>
<p>This concern regarding postponement of marriage is also addressed in the 
		<u>Church Handbook of
Instructions</u>, which is issued under the direction of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles.  Under the heading "Single Members in the Church," it states: 
		<em></em></p>
<p><em>Temple marriage--the sealing of husband and wife for time and eternity by the
authority of the priesthood--is a sacred privilege and <u>obligation</u> that every able
member of the Church should have as a goal.  The Church strongly counsels
members, <u>especially men</u>, not to put off or avoid marriage </em>(emphasis added)<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>The <u>SECOND</u> topic, regarding POSTPONEMENT OF CHILDREN AND LIMITING THE
NUMBER OF CHILDREN, was addressed by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the
Twelve in the Proclamation on the Family.  It states: <em></em></p>
<p><em>The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their
potential for parenthood as husband and wife.  We declare that God's
commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in
force.</em></p>
<p>Have you ever thought about what the world would be like today if Adam and Eve had decided
that two children were enough and then all of their descendants decided the same thing?  If they
had done so, they would have failed to keep God's commandment to REPLENISH the earth and
God's great plan of happiness would have been seriously affected.</p>
<p>President Benson addressed this topic in a Churchwide satellite broadcast to parents.  He said:
		<em></em></p>
<p><em>Young mothers and fathers, with all my heart I counsel you not to postpone
having your children, being co-creators with our Father in Heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not use the reasoning of the world such as, 'We'll wait until we can better
afford having children, until we are more secure, until John has completed his
education, until he has a better-paying job, until we have a larger home, until
we've obtained a few of the material conveniences,' and on and on.  </em></p>
<p><em>This is the reasoning of the world, and it is not pleasing in the sight of God. 
Mothers who enjoy good health, have your children and have them early.  And
husbands, always be considerate of your wives in the bearing of children.  </em>
</p>
<p><em>DO NOT CURTAIL THE NUMBER of your children for personal or selfish
reasons.  Material possessions, social convenience, and so-called professional
advantages are nothing compared to a righteous posterity.  In the eternal
perspective, children--not possessions, not position, not prestige--are our
greatest jewels</em>. (Address given at a Fireside for Parents by President Ezra Taft
Benson, 22 February 1987).</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley also addressed this topic.  Speaking to university students,
President Hinckley said: </p>
<p><em>You people who are starting out life together, you people who are working so
hard to try to keep up with everything, you people who have too much to do and
too little money, you people who are struggling to get an education .  .  . be
faithful in the Church, <u>begin your families</u> and go forward with your lives</em>
(emphasis added)<em> </em>(<u>Church News</u>, week ending November 9, 1996).</p>
<p>The <u>THIRD</u> topic, regarding marriage and family, is that of mothers not working out of the
home.  In "The Family, a Proclamation to the World," issued by the First Presidency and Council
of the Twelve Apostles, it states: <em></em></p>
<p><em>By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and
righteousness and are responsible <u>to provide the necessities of life</u> and protection
for their families.  Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their
children </em>(emphasis added)<em>.</em></p>
<p>Regarding this subject, President Ezra Taft Benson made the following observations: 
		</p>
<p>In October 1996 general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke extensively on this
subject.  He said: </p>
<p><em>Some years ago President Benson delivered a message to the women of the
Church.  He encouraged them to leave their employment and give their individual
time to their children.  I sustain the position which he took.</em></p>
<p><em>Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has
become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their
families.  To you I say, do the very best you can.  I hope that if you are employed
full-time you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to
indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries.  The
greatest job that any mother will ever do will be in nurturing, teaching, lifting,
encouraging, and rearing her children in righteousness and truth.  None other
can adequately take her place.</em></p>
<p><em>It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee.  I
know how some of you struggle with decisions concerning this matter .  .  .  .</em></p>
<p><em>To the mothers of this Church .  .  . I want to say that as the years pass, you will
become increasingly grateful for that which you did in molding the lives of your
children in the direction of righteousness and goodness, integrity and faith.  That
is most likely to happen if you can spend adequate time with them.</em></p>
<p>As you listen to those teachings by modern prophets, is it possible that a course correction might
be needed in your own life or in the attitudes that you have about these subjects.  It is so easy,
even for Latter-day Saints, to buy into the popular philosophies of the day.</p>
<p>How grateful I am for my mother who was always there when I was growing up.  How grateful I
am for a wife who chose as her full-time career the role of wife and mother.</p>
<p>The <u>FOURTH</u> principle that I want to discuss with you is that of GIVING SPIRITUAL
LEADERSHIP IN YOUR OWN HOME.  Now, I recognize that most of you are single.  But
based on our earlier discussion, we know that you will take care of that in the appropriate time.</p>
<p>The world talks a lot about men being "macho."  My wife has always taught our children that the
real macho man is not the guy with all of the muscles, but it is the man who provides a good
living for his family and gives spiritual leadership in the home.  </p>
<p>Young men, after you are married it is <u>your</u> responsibility to call the family together for family
prayer, family home evening, and daily family scripture study.  The Lord will hold 
		<u>you</u>
accountable for whether or not these things are happening in your home. </p>
<p>In 1999 the First Presidency issued two letters regarding these subjects to the members of the
Church throughout the world.  In the February letter they state, <em>"We call upon parents to devote
their <u>best efforts</u> to the teaching and rearing of their children in gospel principles which will
keep them close to the Church."</em>  They go on to say, <em>"We counsel parents and children to give
		<u>highest priority</u> to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and
wholesome family activities.  However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may
be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely-appointed duties that only parents and
families can adequately perform"</em> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>What does it mean to give your "best efforts" or to give "highest priority?"  I am confident that
each day you do the things that you <u>want</u> to do, even though these may not be things that you
know you <u>should </u>do.  As we talk about those things that really matter in your life, somehow you
have got to put the spiritual leadership in your own home at the top of the list.  Thus say the
prophets of God.</p>
<p>In October 1999 the First Presidency issued a letter entitled "Monday Night Activities."  This
letter states: </p>
<p><em>Monday nights are reserved throughout the Church for family home evenings.  We
encourage members to set aside this time to strengthen family ties and <u>teach the
gospel in their homes</u></em><u></u>&nbsp;(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Somehow, a tradition has developed in the Church.  In fact, you may have heard members say,
"We hold our family home evenings on Sunday, and on Monday nights we have activities."  Note
that the First Presidency letter says that <em><u>Monday Night</u> is the time for family home evenings.  
		</em>Also
note that Monday night is not for activities, but as they counsel, <em>"to teach the gospel in their
homes."</em></p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, I hope that you can have <u>vision</u> to see what the prophets are
seeing as they give us this counsel.  Satan is targeting our homes and families.  The day has
passed when we can be casual in holding family home evening, daily family scripture study, or
family prayer and still have real hope to hold our children close to the family and close to the
Church. </p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph F. Smith stated:</p>
<p><em>Oh [parents] salvation, mercy, life everlasting begin at home.  What profiteth it a
man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?  What would it profit
me, though I should go out into the world and win strangers to the fold of God
and lose my own children?  Oh! God, let me not lose my own.  I cannot afford to
lose mine, whom God has given to me and whom I am responsible for before the
Lord, and who are dependent upon me for guidance, for instruction, for proper
influence.  Father, do not permit me to lose interest in my own in trying to save
others.</em> </p>
<p>The prayer of that prophet should resonate with the feelings of our own souls as we give spiritual
leadership in our own homes.  </p>
<p>Now I come to the <u>FIFTH</u> and last principle, that of BEING TRUE TO YOUR COVENANTS. 
Last week I received a phone call from a sweet young Latter-day Saint wife and mother.  She was
distraught.  Her husband had just informed her that for the past several months he has been
unfaithful to her.</p>
<p>As I was finishing this talk last Friday, she called again.  She said that he had just told her that he
was going to divorce her, also leaving behind his young son and daughter.</p>
<p>She was devastated.  How could this be happening to her?  She had been so careful in her
selection of a husband.  He had been a faithful Latter-day Saint.  He had been an outstanding
missionary.  They were sealed in the temple.  She had been faithful to her covenants.  What went
wrong?</p>
<p>As I listened to this young woman, I was heartsick.  I felt so sorry for her.  I felt even more sorry
for him.  This young man had been one of my missionaries when I served as mission president.  I
loved him as my own son.  I took great joy in his successes.  Now I feel overwhelming sorrow at
his failure.</p>
<p>How could he throw away everything that he had believed in and lived for his entire life?  I wept
because of the tragedy of it all.  I feel distraught and sick at heart as I think of it now.</p>
<p>How could this happen?  We must first understand that there is opposition in all things and that
God has given us our agency.  God promises us eternal happiness as we keep the covenants that
we have made with him.  In contrast, Satan desires that <em>"all men might be miserable like unto
himself."</em>  Satan hates you and will do everything within his power to destroy you.  Your safety
lies in following the counsel of the prophets and in keeping your covenants.</p>
<p>When a young couple kneels across the alter in the sealing room, first and foremost, they enter
into a covenant with God; and, secondarily, they enter into a covenant with each other.  As you
are sealed for time and all eternity, Heavenly Father promises you exaltation and eternal life if
you live faithful to your covenants.</p>
<p>Inherent in that temple sealing is the covenant that you will be faithful to your spouse, both
mentally and physically.  Regarding the sin of adultery, President Hinckley has said the
following: </p>
<p><em>Was there ever adultery without dishonesty? . . . It is personal dishonesty of the
worst kind, for it becomes a betrayal of the most sacred of human relationships
and a denial of covenants and promises entered into before God and man.  It is
the sordid violation of a trust.  It is a selfish casting aside of the law of God, and
like other forms of dishonesty its fruits are sorrow, bitterness, heartbroken
companions, and betrayed children</em> (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley).</p>
<p>Immoral thoughts precede immoral actions. The Lord has said:<em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>He that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not
have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out</em> (D&amp;C 46:23).</p>
<p>When we lust, we put our souls in jeopardy. When we lust, the Spirit of the Lord withdraws, and
we are left alone.  Without the Spirit, we revert to the tendencies of the natural man, who King
Benjamin informed us, is an enemy to God.</p>
<p>When we are so tempted, we must repent and <em>"yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and
putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord"</em>
(Mosiah 3:19).  If we don't, then we are in danger of being overcome by Satan and losing all of
the blessings that the Lord has given to us.  This is what has happened to my former missionary.</p>
<p>The prophet Alma gave us counsel to help us avoid such sins.  He said that we must 
		<em>"watch and
pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by
the Holy Spirit"</em> (Alma 13:28).</p>
<p>Another safeguard to help you be faithful in keeping your covenants is daily study of the
scriptures.  In the tree of life vision, the prophets Lehi and Nephi saw that the only people who
partook of the tree of life were those who pressed their way forward, continually holding fast to
the rod of iron, or the word of God.</p>
<p>Each of us must resolve within our very souls that we will be true to the covenants that we have
made with God.  Regarding this, Brigham Young said:<em></em></p>
<p><em>Let the fire of the covenant which you made in the House of the Lord, burn in your
hearts, like flame unquenchable</em> (Journal history of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, 28 Sept 1846, 5).</p>
<p>Nephi said it this way when responding to his brothers who were ready to give up after failing to
obtain the plates of Laban.  He said to them, <em></em></p>
<p><em>As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the
wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded
us.  Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord</em>
(1&nbsp;Nephi 3:15-16).</p>
<p>Joshua stood firm in his resolve to be true to the Lord and challenged others to do the
same, when he said:  <em></em></p>
<p><em>Choose ye this day whom ye will serve, but as for me and my house, we will serve
the Lord</em> (Joshua 24:15).</p>
<p>May you resolve once again, here and now, that you will be true to the covenants you have made
and will make with God regarding yourself and your future families.  May you follow the counsel
of the living prophets, study the scriptures daily, and be sensitive to the prompting and
impressions that come from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me share with you my personal testimony as one ordained as a witness for
Jesus Christ.  I testify that this is the Church and Kingdom of God here upon the earth.  I testify
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that all of his successors including Gordon B.
Hinckley are prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>I bear you my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.  He has purchased us
through His atoning sacrifice.  He was crucified, died, and was resurrected from the dead.  He
lives today.  Jesus Christ is our advocate with the Father, pleading for our souls, saying:</p>
<p><em>Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast
well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed . . . . Wherefore, Father,
spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and
have everlasting life</em> (D&amp;C 45:4-5).</p>
<p>I pray that you and I, with our families, will live worthy of that divine intervention in our behalf
by the Son of God himself.  In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">This year in Sunday School our Gospel Doctrine classes are focused on the teachings of
the Old Testament.  In the coming weeks we will be studying about Abraham and the blessings
God promised to him through the Abrahamic covenant--a covenant of both blessings and
responsibilities.  In the writings of the Old Testament and also the Pearl of Great Price, we learn
much about Abraham.  We discover that Abraham was chosen in the premortal existence to be a
ruler on the earth.  We also learn that as Abraham sought for the blessings of his fathers, God
made a covenant with him.  In Abraham chapter 2 verse 9 we read:</p>
<p>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above
measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing
unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry [meaning
the responsibility to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ] and Priesthood unto all
nations.</p>
<p>In review, the Abrahamic covenant promised Abraham a great posterity.  The ordinances
of baptism, the priesthood, and celestial marriage were made available to him and his seed.  His
posterity was given the responsibility to share the blessings of this covenant with all the families
of the earth through missionary service.  These blessings were promised because the Lord knew
Abraham was worthy and faithful and would teach his children the ways of the Lord (see
Genesis&nbsp;18:19).</p>
<p><center><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Scriptural Account of the Abrahamic Covenant</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></center>
</p>
<p>I'm sure Abraham and Sarah must have wondered many times how the promises of the
Abrahamic covenant would be fulfilled and perpetuated through them.  Sarah, though fair and
beautiful, was barren.  As the years went by and she and Abraham grew older and older, the
fulfillment of the promise that they would have seed seemed less and less likely.  Can we
imagine how Abraham and Sarah must have rejoiced when the Lord answered Abraham's</p>
<p>faithful petition and made it possible for them to have a son when it was physically impossible
for Sarah to conceive because of her age?  We have to remember that Abraham was 100 years
old and Sarah was 90 when Isaac was born.  It really was a miracle wrought by God.  Now, think
how difficult it must have been when years later Abraham was asked by God to sacrifice this son,
Isaac, through whom the Abrahamic covenant was to continue.  Surely Abraham felt great relief
and gratitude when, at that crucial moment, the angel of the Lord prevented the sacrifice of Isaac
and provided a ram from the thicket in Isaac's place.  Because of Abraham's willingness to offer
his only son, he was called "the Father of the Faithful."  God renewed again his promise of the
Abrahamic covenant by saying:</p>
<p>. . . because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine
only son:</p>
<p>That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy
seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and
thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p>
<p>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou
hast obeyed my voice.  (Genesis 22:16-18)</p>
<p>Abraham understood the importance of the covenant God made with him.  He knew in
order for the blessings of baptism, priesthood, and celestial marriage to be passed on, Isaac would
need to marry a woman in the covenant.  You remember the scriptural account of how Abraham
sent his servant on a long journey to the land of his kindred to find a wife for Isaac.  As he stood
by the well, the servant prayed earnestly for help with this sacred task.  His specific request was
that the woman whom Isaac was to marry would give him a drink when he asked and then would
offer to water his camels.  The servant knew Rebekah was the appointed woman when she did
just as he had prayed.  She gave him a drink from her pitcher of water and afterwards offered to
draw water for his thirsty camels.  You will then recall how the servant went with Rebekah to
meet her family.  When Rebekah's family asked if she would leave her home and family and go
with the servant to a different land and marry Isaac, she answered simply and with faith, "I will
go."  Rebekah's willingness to marry Isaac in the covenant paved the way for the perpetuation of
blessings and responsibilities promised to Abraham and his posterity through the Abrahamic
covenant.</p>
<p>The scriptural account continues as Isaac and Rebekah are married, but Rebekah is
barren.  After petitioning the Lord, Isaac's prayers are answered and Rebekah gives birth to twin
sons, Esau and Jacob.  It was customary in those days for the firstborn son to be heir to a
birthright blessing.  The Bible Dictionary gives us insight about the birthright blessing.  We learn
that when a father died, it was usually the firstborn son who inherited the leadership of the family
or the authority to preside.  The firstborn son also received a double portion of his father's
possessions and was expected to care for his mother and sisters (see Bible Dictionary, Firstborn,
p. 675).  Since Esau was born before Jacob, he was supposed to receive the birthright blessing--
which would have been of considerable worth, for Isaac was a wealthy man.  But for some
reason, Esau despised the birthright.  Let's refresh our memory about the account of Esau and
Jacob by reading together in the scriptures starting in Genesis chapter 25 verses 27 through 34.</p>
<p>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and
Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.  [Notice the footnote at the bottom of
the page suggests that plain means whole, complete, perfect, and simple.]</p>
<p>And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah
loved Jacob.</p>
<p>And Jacob sod pottage [pottage is thick soup]: and Esau came from the
field, and he was faint:</p>
<p>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage;
for I am faint: . . .</p>
<p>And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: And what profit shall this
birthright do to me?</p>
<p>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold
his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
<p>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and
drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>
<p>We know from the scriptural account that Esau's path of poor choices continued as he
brought sorrow and grief to his parents by marrying outside the covenant.  Thus, Isaac gave Jacob
the birthright blessing and God renewed with Jacob the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant
because of his faithfulness.</p>
<p>What important principles do we learn from this account?  We learn that Abraham was
chosen before he was born to be a leader on this earth, to hold the priesthood, and to bless his
faithful posterity through the promises of the Abrahamic covenant.  We are reminded that the
blessings of the Abrahamic covenant are perpetuated by marrying in the covenant.  And we
determine that blessings of considerable worth can be despised.  Everything can be sold for
nothing.</p>
<p>I have asked myself many times: "How did Esau come to despise the birthright--to look
down on it and consider it to be of little worth?"  The fact that Jacob understood the value of the
birthright suggests that both sons were likely taught by their parents the importance of the
birthright.  Esau must have known the honor and responsibility associated with this blessing. 
Why then was he willing to forfeit his birthright for today's pottage--which would be a bagel
and a can of soup?  Think about it--everything to which Esau was entitled he sold for something
as insignificant as a piece of bread and a can of soup.  Why?  Were the promised blessings
associated with the birthright too far away?  Did he forget in that moment who he was as the
firstborn son?  Did he really intend to give up the birthright, or was it just a casual maneuver to
satisfy his hunger?  Was he thinking, "I can give it away now and get it back later?"  What series
of events, circumstances, and prior choices would have brought Esau to this tragic moment? 
From our own experience I believe we can conclude that a grave outcome such as Esau selling
his birthright is not usually the result of a sudden impulse, but rather the consequence of small,
incremental decisions made day by day.</p>
<p><center><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Likening the Scriptures to Us</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></center>
</p>
<p>Let's take time now to liken the account of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to us.  We've all
been blessed to come to the earth at a time when the fullness of gospel blessings and covenants
has been restored.  We are not here by chance.  Of the billions of people on the earth today, you
are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have been given the
opportunity for birthright blessings as the "seed of Abraham."  You might be wondering: "How
do I know that I am the seed of Abraham?"  Most of us have received a patriarchal blessing in
which our lineage is declared.  In fact, that is one of the primary reasons we receive a patriarchal
blessing.  We each discover at the hands of an ordained patriarch that we were born through a
chosen lineage--a royal lineage as children of Abraham, the "Father of the Faithful."  By literal
descent or adoption, we are the descendants of the prophet Abraham and entitled to the blessings
promised to his seed.  For purposes of illustration, who was Ephraim's father?  Joseph.  Who was
Joseph's father?  Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel.  Who was Jacob's father?  Isaac. 
Who was Isaac's father?  Abraham.  Every Church member in this room can trace his or her
lineage back through one of the twelve sons of Israel to father Abraham.  Imagine--as sons and
daughters of Abraham we are heirs to the Abrahamic covenant.  We've been offered the
blessings of baptism, ordination to the priesthood, and marriage in the temple.  We've also been
given a sacred responsibility to bless the families of the earth through missionary service and
gospel ordinances.</p>
<p>Now we understand our relationship with Abraham and this covenant, what are we going
to do with our spiritual birthright?  What can we learn from the experience of Esau?  Could his
despising attitude represent our sometimes casual or halfhearted devotion to covenants we have
made?  Could his faintness and hunger symbolize our hunger for acceptance, popularity, or a
false sense of security and belonging?  Could the piece of bread and the can of soup represent the
appeal of worldly temptations we face every day?  Will we sell our birthright blessings associated
with the Abrahamic covenant to satisfy telestial appetites, or will we be as Jacob and understand
that future promised blessings are worth living for? </p>
<p>As I share some real life examples from my experiences with students on this campus, I'd
like you to ponder these questions: What is my biggest temptation?  Could the daily decisions I
am making eventually cause me to sell my birthright for a bagel and a can of soup?  Are there
ways I could change my attitude and behavior to better demonstrate my understanding of and
appreciation for the blessings and responsibilities I have been given?</p>
<p>Now for the experiences.  Several years ago a young man who lived in an apartment with
all returned missionaries came to me with a problem.  He said, "Sister Bednar, I'm trying to
prepare for a mission.  But my roommates are attending R-rated movies, not living the standards
here at the college, and are giving me such a hard time because I don't want to do the things they
are doing.  What should I do?"</p>
<p>How would you respond?  I thought how some of you are so mature, even beyond your
years; yet others use your youth as an excuse for indiscretion and wayward behavior.</p>
<p>Here's another experience.  Recently a young man who was serving as an elder's quorum
president in his campus ward asked my husband, "President, we're having attendance problems
in priesthood meeting on Sundays.  What can we do to boost the attendance?"</p>
<p>What advice would you give this priesthood holder?</p>
<p>I'll tell you how President Spencer W. Kimball would respond.  This quote from a
prophet about breaking the oath and covenant of the priesthood should be good food for thought:
"One breaks the priesthood covenants by transgressing commandments--but also by leaving
undone his duties.  Accordingly, to break this covenant one needs only to do nothing" (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings
of Spencer W. Kimball</span>, p. 497).</p>
<p>Do we think we can be casual in our priesthood duties and not lose our birthright?</p>
<p>At the beginning of each new school year, my husband and I meet with apartment
managers and dorm assistants to discuss the importance of teaching and reminding students
about the expectations involved in their signing of the Honor and Dress Code.  I asked one
student apartment manager what was his greatest challenge.  He responded that the lack of regard
for the Honor and Dress Code by many returned missionaries in his complex was his biggest
problem.  I said, "RMs are giving you hassles?"  I was saddened when he responded, "Sister
Bednar, the title RM means nothing to some returned missionaries."</p>
<p>Let me share a sobering quote by President Harold B. Lee:</p>
<p>I fear there are many among us who because of their faithfulness in the
spirit world were "called" to do a great work here, but like reckless spendthrifts
they are exercising their free agency in riotous living and are losing their birthright
and the blessings that were theirs had they proved faithful to their calling.  Hence
as the Lord has said, "there are many called, but few are chosen," and then he
gives us two reasons as to why His chosen and ordained fail of their blessings:
First, because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and
second, they aspire so much to the honors of men that they do not learn that "the
powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of
righteousness" (D&amp;C 121:34-36).  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of Harold B. Lee</span>, p. 26) 
			</p>
<p>Now I realize that most of you do not behave this way.  Sadly, those who do are probably
not inclined to attend devotional and will not hear this message.  But young men and women, the
designation of "returned missionary" should mean something.  There are 3,626 of you on our
campus this semester.  I've had young men who are preparing to go on missions tell me how
many of you <strong>have</strong> helped them be so excited about preparing for their missions.  The righteous
examples you've set, the gospel discussions you've taught, and tender experiences you have
shared about your missions have been invaluable to these premissionaries.  Please wear the title
of "returned missionary" with honor.  Your two years of missionary work are only the beginning
of a lifetime of service in which you will proclaim the gospel and minister to the families of the
earth.  Remember who you are as the "seed of Abraham" and what you were called and chosen to
do.  Don't sell yourselves short after you come home.  Rise up, oh men of God!  Bless our
campus by your worthy examples and faithful priesthood service.</p>
<p>Are you still thinking what your temptations might be; what day-by-day decisions would
cause you to sell your birthright?  Let me share a few more experiences with you.</p>
<p>One night last fall my husband and I attended an outdoor campus function for new
students.  As we got in our car to leave the campus, a young couple walked by on the sidewalk in
front of us.  The young man had his arm around the young woman's waist.  Not long after
passing by us the young man's hand gradually slipped down from the young woman's waist to
her "tush."  I turned to my husband and said, "Did you see what I just saw?"  I thought to myself,
"If that young woman allows that young man to put his hand where she did when they are in
public, were does she let him put his hands when they are in private?"</p>
<p>Can we see how thoughtless decisions in everyday matters such as dating can lead us
gradually down a path where we would be willing to sell our birthright?  Surely, as men and
women on this campus, we can help lift and build and support each other in our efforts to remain
faithful and true to our covenant responsibilities.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago my husband and I attended the CES fireside satellite broadcast featuring</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott.  I was strengthened by the courage of a young woman who came alone to
hear an apostle of the Lord give counsel and share his testimony with the college-age young
adults of the Church.  But I was equally disappointed when I asked where her roommates were,
and she said they were home sleeping.  I could hear in my mind the voice of Esau saying, " I am
at the point to die from lack of sleep; and what shall this fireside profit me?"  
		</p>
<p>Did you know that as one of 475,493 Latter-day Saint young adults in the United States
ages 18-24, you have the privilege of being here at BYU-Idaho?  If we ran the numbers
worldwide, they would be even more impressive.  You've been blessed to be here at this time, at
this special place, as guests of the faithful tithe payers of the Church, to learn and grow and
develop.  During the time you are here at BYU-Idaho, you will have occasion to attend CES
firesides, Tuesday devotionals, and other functions where you are able to literally sit at the feet of
living apostles, prophets, and inspired Church leaders and drink of "living water."  These will be
once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.  Please take advantage of them.  Know the value of your
birthright.</p>
<p>We have so much to learn and so little time to prepare for our responsibilities as children
of the covenant.  President Benson told a group of young people:</p>
<p>God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days
before the second coming of the Lord.  Some individuals will fall away; but the
kingdom of God will remain intact to welcome the return of its head--even Jesus
Christ.  While our generation will be comparable in wickedness to the days of
Noah, when the Lord cleansed the earth by flood, there is a major difference this
time.  It is that God has saved for the final inning some of His strongest children,
who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly. . . .  Make no mistake about
it--you are a marked generation.  There has never been more expected of the
faithful in such a short period of time than there is of us.  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of Ezra Taft
Benson</span> [1988], pp. 104-5)</p>
<p>Speaking of expectations, let me share an experience I had several years ago when I
attended a missionary zone conference.  First of all, I'd never been to a zone conference, so this
was a new experience for me.  After reciting section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants, many
missionaries stood to bear their testimonies.  I must admit that I was both thrilled and a bit
disappointed by what I heard.  Lack of premission preparation by some missionaries was
evidenced by three occurring themes in the testimonies.  This is what I heard: "I am gaining such
a strong testimony of the Book of Mormon.  I'm reading it now for the first time."  Can you see
the reason for my concern?  These were young men and women who for the most part had been
blessed with the privilege of attending seminary, Sunday School, and priesthood classes.  Some
of them may have been former Ricks College students.  I don't know.  But whatever their
background, why were any of them reading the Book of Mormon for the first time in the mission
field?  Surely the Lord expects more of us.</p>
<p>Other missionaries said, "I am so glad to get out of the MTC.  There were so many rules
and restrictions in there--it felt like a prison."  I was astounded.  I had to chuckle as I wondered
if these young missionaries were acquainted yet with the missionary handbook.  I know there are
rules in the missionary handbook.  There are lots of rules.  There are even rules here at BYU-Idaho which, by the way, are endorsed by the Board of Trustees comprised of apostles and
prophets.  God has given us many commandments.  If we love Him, we obey Him--cheerfully.  I
am reminded of a statement by President Ezra Taft Benson which says:</p>
<p>I would hope that you young men and women would have the spiritual
maturity . . . to see that our Heavenly Father gave His commandments to bless
your life.  They are given so you will know how to achieve joy.  God is mindful of
you. His work and glory is to bring about your immortality and eternal life (see
Moses&nbsp;1:39).  He has given you commandments to discipline you.  He has also
given you your agency so that you could be proved "to see if [you] will do all
things whatsoever [He] shall command" (Abraham 3:25).  His kingdom is well
organized, and your leaders are dedicated to help you.  May you know that you
have our love, our concern, and our constant prayers.  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of Ezra Taft
Benson</span>, [1988], p. 559)</p>
<p>I can't remember a time in recent years when I have attended the temple that a prayer for
the youth of the Church was not uttered.  The necessity for you to recognize your covenant
relationship with God and to keep the commandments is so important that help from heaven is
requested in every temple session, every day, in every temple throughout the world.  I hope you
can feel the power and strength of these prayers as you strive to live faithfully to qualify for the
blessings and promises of the Abrahamic covenant.</p>
<p>Now, for the final theme I heard in that zone conference: "I love my companion" (with no
mention of loving the Savior).  Loving and getting along with a missionary companion is a
prerequisite for having the Spirit to teach.  But we don't go to the mission field only to declare
our love for our companions; we go to declare our witness of Christ--a witness of our Savior's
redeeming love, His divinity, and His power.  That witness was noticeably lacking in the
testimonies that day.</p>
<p>May I suggest to those of you who are preparing for missionary service, temple marriage,
future families, or life in general that much is required in your preparation.  We have so little
time to learn and so much to accomplish.  Read and study the Book of Mormon.  Live the
commandments now.  Seek for a greater understanding of the Atonement, and gain a strong
testimony of the Savior.  Know who you are so you can teach others who they are.  Remember
our duty is to bless the families of the earth, including our own.  It's what we have covenanted to
do as the "seed of Abraham."  Let's be like Jacob, not like Esau.</p>
<p><center><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Crowning Blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></center>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to talk about the crowning blessings made available in the
Abrahamic covenant through the ordinance of celestial marriage.  When I was a little girl I
remember watching a television series entitled, <em>The Millionaire</em>.  Mr. Tipton, a multimillionaire
tycoon, was urged by his doctor to find a means of relaxation.  The doctor's orders were filled in
an unusual way.  Mr. Tipton would identify an individual whom he thought could be benefited by
receiving a million dollars.  He then would send his executive secretary, Mr. Anthony, to deliver
the money to the home of the chosen recipient.  Each week Mr. Anthony, a good-looking man
dressed in a business suit and hat, would knock on the door of an unsuspecting individual and
mysteriously present him or her with a tax-free cashier's check for one million dollars.</p>
<p>A million dollars back then was an enormous amount of money.  You make the 
comparison.  In the late 1950s a loaf of bread cost 14 cents and the average yearly salary of a
U.S. worker was about $3,000.  The check would be worth considerably more today. 
		</p>
<p>I don't remember anyone ever declining the offer of the million dollars even though there
were conditions attached.  The recipient promised never to reveal the source of the money or the
amount of the money.  I sometimes imagined what it would be like if Mr. Anthony knocked on
my door.  What would I do with a million dollars?</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Anthony has never knocked on my door, but I have something worth far more
than a million dollars.  Like you, I've had the opportunity to make and keep sacred covenants.  I
have been the recipient of the blessings of Abraham--baptism, priesthood, and celestial
marriage.  These are of greatest worth to me.  It's humbling to think that our Heavenly Father
would allow us to receive the ordinance of celestial marriage where the covenants made with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are renewed.  By entering into and abiding by the covenant of
celestial marriage, we are promised, as was Abraham, a continuation of the lives--seed or
posterity as innumerable as the sands of the sea (see D&amp;C 132:19, 30).  We have the opportunity
to be an heir of eternal life which the scriptures describe as "the greatest of all the gifts of God." 
We shall inherit "thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and
depths (see D&amp;C&nbsp;132:19).  Scripture tells us that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1
Corinthians 2:9).</p>
<p>I have no doubt if Mr. Anthony knocked on our door, we would be willing to do whatever
was asked in order to accept the million dollars.  Yet, when our Father in Heaven offers to us all
that He has to give, are we just as anxious to abide by the conditions He sets forth?  He says:
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory.  For strait is the gate, and narrow the
way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it,
because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me" (D&amp;C 132:21-22).</p>
<p>We can't know Him if we despise the birthright, if we participate in worldly activities
that drive away the Spirit, or if we are not serious about keeping our covenants.  Can we
understand now why the adversary is working so hard to entice us to give up that which is of
greatest worth?</p>
<p>It's been my desire today for the Holy Ghost to inspire each of us to live for the promised
blessings of the Abrahamic covenant.  I hope that a remembrance of promises made to the fathers
has been planted in your heart today.  To be the "seed of Abraham" is both a blessing and a
responsibility.  And we don't have time to waste in figuring out who we are.  Where much is
given, much is required.  We were not sent to the earth in the most illustrious of all ages to sell
our birthright for a bagel and a can of soup.  We were sent to know and understand the nature of
the birthright covenant and use that understanding to bless the families of the earth, even our own
future families.  Surely, this is what we were born to do. </p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p>We made vows, solemn vows, in the heavens before we came to this
mortal life. . . .  We have made covenants.  We made them before we accepted our
position here on the earth. . . .  We committed ourselves to our Heavenly Father,
that if he would send us to the earth and give us bodies and give to us the priceless
opportunities that earth life afforded, we would keep our lives clean and would
marry in the holy temple and would rear a family and teach them righteousness. 
This was a solemn oath, a solemn promise.  (Devotional talk, University of Utah
Institute of Religion, 10 January 1975)</p>
<p>Oh, youth of the noble birthright, may this covenant be perpetuated from your generation
to the next because of the righteous decisions you make daily.  Be patient in your progress.  May
you feel the loving arms of our Savior around you as He enables and strengthens you in keeping
your promises, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><br wp="BR1" />I'm grateful to be here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho with President and Sister Bednar and each one of
you to speak at today's devotional.  When I received this assignment from the First Presidency
asking me to speak two days before Valentine's Day, I'll bet you can't guess what topic I chose
for my speech.  I'm grateful for Valentine's Day and that my valentine is here with me today.
		</p>
<p>Valentine traditions are fun.  As we explore some of them today, I pray that you will gain
some new insights and understanding that will both help you in finding your eternal sweetheart
and in enriching the life you share together afterwards.</p>
<p>There is nothing more powerful than love, nothing so motivating or that touches so many
lives.  There have doubtless been more books written, more movies made, and more songs sung
about love and falling in love than any other topic and, perhaps, all other topics combined. 
Finding your eternal valentine is the ultimate treasure hunt.  </p>
<p>"The Lord has ordained that we should marry," President Gordon B. Hinckley has said,
"that we shall live together in love and peace and harmony . . . .  The time will come when you
will <em>fall in love</em>.  It will occupy all of your thoughts and be the stuff of which your dreams are
made . . . .  You will know no greater happiness than that found in your home . . . .  The truest
mark of your success in life will be the quality of your marriage . . . .  
		<strong><em>This choice will be the
most important of all the choices you make in your life"&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>

<p>If you were to ask a child to draw a valentine, what shape would the child draw?  If you
are thinking of a heart, you came up with the same answer that I did.  Why a heart?  Well, one
reason might be for the artists, songwriters, and poets.  In old versions of the Bible the word
"bowel" was often used to depict love, such as in "let thy bowels also be full of charity towards
all men."&nbsp; <a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Can you imagine the headache for songwriters if the word "heart" had not replaced
the word "bowel"?  For example, "I left my bowels in San Francisco . . ."</p>
<p>Back to the question:  Why the heart as a symbol?  Is love something exclusively of the
heart--a feeling?   Another valentine tradition or drawing that we often see with the heart is
Cupid with a bow and arrow.  Why?  Is love something that you are smitten with, something that
strikes you like Cupid's arrow without any say so?  Is it a game of chance like the tradition of the
daisy--he loves me, he loves me not, he loves me, HE LOVES ME!!?  These are all interesting
traditions that lead people into thinking that love is not a choice, that agency plays no role in
matters of love.</p>
<p>If we live in a world of agency wouldn't it make sense that the most important decision
made in mortality would be our choice and not left in Cupid's hands?</p>
<p>Somewhere in the history of the English language the expression "fall in love" began to
be used to describe the Cupid experience.  While it is a beautiful idiom, there was inherent risk
involved in selecting the verb <em>fall</em> because it mostly means accidental, involuntary, with no
choice involved.  And subtly, it has also led to the use of its distressing corollary, "We fell 
		<u>out</u> of
love," an all too common phrase used nowadays as an excuse for a failed marriage.  "Falling in
love" and "falling out of love" are phrases that make love sound like something out of our
control.</p>
<p>Many who feel they are falling out of love with their spouse throw their hands up in
resignation as if they were victims of an outside influence that controls them.  They begin to
wonder, "Do I really want to be married to this man (or woman) for eternity?"  Having fallen out
of love, as they suppose, they begin to drift apart, often saying things to hurt one another.  "I
don't love you anymore" is a common assertion.  They tolerate one another for the children's
sake, resenting one another; or they separate, believing their differences to be irreconcilable.  The
result is a damaged or destroyed family, another casualty of Satan's assault on the home.</p>
<p>How could something so glorious and beautiful as falling in love end up in misery for so
many marriages?  What goes wrong?</p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard the marketing phrase that "people buy on emotion and then later try
and justify their purchase with facts"--or purchasing with their heart and not their head.  That
kind of purchasing often leads to what is known as "buyers remorse."  Sometimes that happens
with love.  For some people, falling in love is a magical encounter, something that seems to
happen at first sight, like that scene in the movie Bambi where Thumper becomes "twitterpated"
at the first sight of a beautiful little bunny rabbit.  He is instantly smitten by her lovely charm, 
his eyes become glazed over and dilate to twice their normal size in a hypnotic, enamored stare
and his little rabbit's foot begins to thump the ground at 90 miles and hour. You also see a huge
smile of contentment emerge on his face that even the cartoonists can't erase.  Bambi similarly
becomes twitterpated with a beautiful young doe named Faline.  I think cartoons may be able to
illustrate love at first sight better than poets.</p>
<p>For others, it isn't so much "falling in love" as it is "rising in love."  Their love is a
growing affinity and attraction toward another, like budding blossoms that flower into a beautiful
bouquet.  Though the "Thumper/Bambi" love at first sight may also "rise" and bloom like the
second, it is often merely glandular, a cotton candy kind of love that has no substance and later
dissolves away leaving nothing but decay and one more divorce statistic. </p>
<p>On the other hand, "divine" love, as President Spencer W. Kimball called it, "is not like
that association of the world which is misnamed love, but which is mostly physical attraction. 
When marriage is based on this only, the parties soon tire of each other.  There is a break and a
divorce, and a new fresher physical attraction comes with another marriage, which in turn may
last only until it too becomes stale.  The love of which the Lord speaks is not only physical
attraction, but also faith, confidence, understanding and partnership.  It is devotion and
companionship, parenthood, common ideals and standards.  It is cleanliness of life and sacrifice
and unselfishness.  This kind of love never tires nor wanes.  It lives on through sickness and
sorrow, through prosperity and privation, through accomplishment and disappointment, through
time and eternity."&nbsp; <a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Many popular songs and films make reference to loving forever or an everlasting love. 
For the world, these lyrics are simply poetic; for us, they are genuine expressions of our divine
potential.  We believe that eternal love, eternal marriage, and eternal families are "central to the
Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."&nbsp; <a href="#N_4_">
<sup>(4)</sup></a>  However, every couple will encounter
some struggles on their journey toward this glorious destiny.  There are no perfect marriages in
the world.  Do you know why?  Because there are no perfect husbands.  Actually, it's because
there are no perfect people.  But our doctrine teaches us how to nurture our marriages toward
perfection and how to keep the romance in them along the way.  No one need ever "fall out of
love."  Falling out of love is a cunning myth which causes many broken hearts and homes.</p>
<p>"The family is falling apart all over the world," President Hinckley said.  "The old ties
that bound together father and mother and children are breaking everywhere.  We must face this
in our own midst.  There are too many broken homes among our own . . . .  Can we not do better? 
Of course we can."&nbsp; <a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p>
<p>Have you ever seen that game show called Family Feud?  What a title!  That's a word
combination you won't find in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World."  Anyway, that's the
game where they say "100 people surveyed, top 5 answers on the board?"   When asked "what
are the most important things to look for in a potential spouse," how did the world answer that
question?  Do you want to see the top 18 answers on the board?  Here they are from the 
		<em>Journal
of Marriage and the Family </em>ranked both for men and for women&nbsp; 
		<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></p>
<p><u><center>What is most important to look for in a potential spouse</center></u>?
</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>How does  the world's list compare with your list?  Do you like this list?  While there are
definitely some good things on this list, did you notice where "similar religious background"
ranked?  (#15) or "pre-marital chastity"?  (#16)  I guess the world hasn't figured out what
chastity has to do with its #2 selection, "dependable character" or #3 "emotional stability," or
# 6 "good health."</p>
<p>Let's now look at the Lord's list and see how it is different from the world's.  While the
world's list has many desirable traits, it leaves out the more important elements that should come
first--that not only help prevent family feuds, but also lead to eternally happy families. The Lord
said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that
ye also love one another" (John 13:34).  To love as He loved is different from the way the world
loves.  Paul identified this same love as the love that should exist between sweethearts when he
said, "Husbands, love your wives, [How?] even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself
for it.&quot;<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  Let's look at the Lord's list of 14 behaviors showing how he loved the church and apply
it to the loving relationship that should exist between sweethearts.  We find it in 1 Corinthians 13
and Moroni 7.   By the way, if you would like to ponder this list in more depth refer to the
October 2000 <em>Ensign,</em> p. 16, under the title "Agency and Love in Marriage."</p>
<p>True love <strong>suffereth long</strong>.  Have you ever seen this word combination on those little
hearts?  The most important things don't make it to the world's list.  "Suffereth long" means
patient instead of impatient and tolerant of imperfections instead of intolerant.  Helpful instead of
critical of weaknesses.  It does not criticize, is not cranky, and does not complain.
		<strong>And is kind,</strong>
is happy, thoughtful, helpful, interested in others, is a good Samaritan, merciful, gives comfort. 
It is not mean or miserly; is not sarcastic or cruel or inconsiderate; is not indifferent, uninterested,
unresponsive or unconcerned.  By the way, can you "fall out of kindness?"  That's a question
worth pondering.  In fact, can you fall out of any of the attributes the Lord gives us in his
definition of love?  It <strong>Envieth not</strong>--is content, grateful for blessings by seeing the glass half full
and not half empty, is generous, lives frugally; is not covetous, resentful, jealous, or greedy;
avoids unnecessary debt; is a full tithe payer.  Is not selfish or vain and lives within income.</p>
<p><strong>Is not puffed up</strong>--is humble and teachable.  Does not seek attention. Praises others. Does not
murmur, and never belittles.  Does not treat spouse with a "holier" or "smarter-than-thou"
attitude.  <strong>Doth not behave itself unseemly</strong>--is courteous, well mannered, reverent, respectful,
and mindful; is clean, neat and considerate of other's property and feelings.  Is not crude or
indecent or improper.  <strong>Seeketh not her own</strong>--is tender hearted, caring, sharing, sensitive,
compassionate, generous, and united; sacrifices by putting desires of spouse first; considers
money ours and not mine; thinks we not I; listens; Seeks to please God and others; is not
demanding, controlling, or manipulative; does not blame; says I'm sorry; does not withhold
affection. <strong>Is not easily provoked</strong>--is forgiving, patient, calm, gentle, respectful; is a
peacemaker and does not get angry; is not irritable or vengeful; is not abusive in word or deed;
does not swear or quarrel.  <strong>Thinketh no evil</strong>--is not judgmental, but respectful and trusting,
pure and obedient; does not think evil of others by gossiping or finding fault; is modest in
thought, dress and speech; is not deceitful, cruel or dishonest; avoids inappropriate music,
pornography, and dirty jokes.  <strong>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth</strong>--has a
temple recommend and wants an eternal marriage; stays close to the Spirit through regular
scripture study and prayer; is responsible; is not light-minded.  <strong>Beareth all things</strong>--is bold and
patient with affliction and trials (this does not mean that abuse victims should silently bear
cruelty, or follow a spouse disobedient to God); is grateful; does not insult others; is not
defensive, irritable, touchy or grouchy; is not weary in well doing; is easily entreated or
approachable and willing to listen empathetically and communicate without any contempt. 
		<strong>Believeth all things</strong>--sees the eternal potential of spouse like Johnny Lingo saw in Mohana for
those of you who remember that story; makes the least of the worst and the most of the best;
shows by actions that there is a firm belief in eternal families; holds fast to the iron rod.  Has
goals, dreams, a vision and plans for a happy successful life together.  Is cheerful.
		<strong>Hopeth all
things</strong>--is an optimist and looks for the best; praises and builds up; expresses and shows
affection.  Spouse is best friend. Continues courting throughout marriage.  Is not a pessimist,
nagger, or faultfinder.  <strong>Endureth all things</strong>--doesn't complain or murmur; is steadfast; accepts
responsibility and is industrious, for the man a provider; shows initiative.  
		<strong>Charity never faileth. </strong></p>
<p>Repeating President Kimball again, "This kind of love never tires nor wanes.  It lives on
through sickness and sorrow, through prosperity and privation, through accomplishment and
disappointment, through time and eternity."&nbsp; <a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  Never failing means never flirting with others.  It
means that love is blind in yet another sense with no wandering eyes.  This love is committed by
covenant and commandment.</p>
<p>It should be obvious to you that the Lord is describing a love here that deals with
behavior on all 14 points.  And behavior isn't something you fall into or out of. Behavior is very
definitely something you control and decide.  Agency is obviously involved here.</p>
<p>We also know that any commandment by God involves agency.  We can obey or disobey,
but there is always a choice.  When the Lord uses the command form of the verb love in "Thou
shalt love thy wife with all they heart, and shall cleave unto her and none else" (D&amp;C 42:22), He
is not leaving this love in Cupid's hands.  His commandment is a directive, not
		<em>to</em> the heart, but
<em>with</em> the heart, and <em>to</em> the mind with an expectation of thought, reasoning, decision making and
obedience--you can't fall out of love if it's a commandment to stay in love.</p>
<p>Let me return to one of these 14 attributes.  Pure love <strong>seeketh not her own</strong>.  Look at the
cartoon of this couple in a bookstore.  There is a powerful story told in this scene.  You ought to
memorize it.  What do you see here?  The "spouse improvement" section is sold out, but the self-improvement section has scarcely sold a book.  What does that tell you about human nature?
Does it remind you of any of the Savior's teachings dealing with "motes" and "beams" in eyes?
You've heard of the cartoon "The Far Side," well, this cartoon could be labeled "The Selfish
Side."  Your success in marriage will largely depend on your ability to reverse this cartoon and
focus on improving yourself, rather than trying to reshape your spouse.  It will depend more on
being the right one--even more than finding the right one. "Don't just pray to marry the one you
love.  <em>Instead, pray to love the one you marry</em>."&nbsp; <a href="#N_9_">
<sup>(9)</sup></a></p>
<p>Your success in marriage will be enhanced if you focus on making your spouse happy
more than in hoping your spouse makes you happy.  There is greater power in giving than in
getting.  This is counsel that comes from  the wisest of all marriage counselors, "Pure love
		<strong><em>seeketh not her own."</em></strong>  The Savior is wise. His list is powerful.  His wisdom is beyond ours.  We
should trust Him.  He is never wrong.   </p>
<p>There is a story of a troubled young couple in a marriage counselor's office.  The
counselor reminds them of their marital vows saying, "don't you remember you married for
better or for worse?"  The wife says, that's right--he couldn't have done better and I couldn't
have done worse."  It would be a mistake to think that you are the perfect one while your
sweetheart is the source of any problems.  "The greatest of faults is to be conscious of none," said
Thomas Carlyle.&nbsp; <a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  I read that quote while reading the Miracle of Forgiveness.  It is the quote that
President Spencer W. Kimball chose to begin the third chapter titled, ". . . None Righteous, No,
Not One."  Pride is like bad breath, it is obvious to everyone but the offender.  It is pride that
keeps us from seeing our own faults.  Only the humble are teachable.  I loved Carlyle's quote and
used it for several years and then came across the story which perhaps inspired the quote.  Listen
to his story:</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle lived from 1795 until 1881.  He was a Scot essayist and historian. 
During his lifetime he became one of the world's greatest writers.  But he was a human, and
humans make mistakes.   </p>
<p>On October 17, 1826, Carlyle married his secretary Jane Welsh.  She was an intelligent,
attractive, and somewhat temperamental daughter of a well-to-do doctor.  They had their quarrels
and misunderstandings, but still loved each other dearly.  After their marriage, Jane continued to
serve as his secretary.  After several years of marriage, Jane became ill.  Being a hard worker,
Carlyle became so absorbed in his writings that he let Jane continue working for several weeks
after she became ill.  She had cancer, and it was one of the slow growing kind.  Finally, she
became confined to her bed.  Although Carlyle loved her dearly, he very seldom found time to
stay with her long.  He was busy with his work.  </p>
<p>When Jane died they carried her to the cemetery for the service.  The day was a miserable
day.  It was raining hard, and the mud was deep.  Following the funeral Carlyle went back to his
home.  He was taking it pretty hard.  He went up the stairs to Jane's room and sat down in the
chair next to her bed.  He sat there thinking about how little time he had spent with her and
wishing so much he had a chance to do it differently.  Noticing her diary on a table beside the
bed, he picked it up and began to read in it.</p>
<p>Suddenly he seemed shocked.  He saw it.  There, on one page, she had written a single
line. "Yesterday he spent an hour with me and it was like heaven; I love him so."  Something
dawned on him that he had not noticed before.  He had been too busy to notice that he meant so
much to her.  He thought of all the times he had gone about his work without thinking about and
noticing her.</p>
<p>Then Carlyle turned the page in the diary.  There he noticed written some words that
broke his heart.  "I have listened all day to hear his steps in the hall, but now it is late and I guess
he won't come today."  Carlyle read a little more in the book.  Then he threw it down and ran out
of the house.  Some of his friends found him at the grave, his face buried in the mud.  His eyes
were red from weeping.  Tears continued to roll down his cheeks.  He kept repeating over and
over again, "If I had only known, if I had only known."  But it was too late for Carlyle.  She was
dead.&nbsp; <a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps it was this experience that motivated Thomas Carlyle to write the phrase, "The
greatest of faults is to be conscious of none."  We would, indeed, be foolish if we saw no need to
improve ourselves to strengthen our marriages.</p>
<p>When praying over this most important decision, there are some principles to keep in
mind.  First of all there is no such thing as a <em>one and only</em>.  President Kimball continues, "Soul
mates are a fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with
all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and
beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and
a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  Looking for a soul mate is to make
yourself a victim of what has been called the Lois Lane syndrome-searching for Superman. 
Young women, he isn't out there.  Young men, Superwoman isn't out there either.  If she were
and you found her, she wouldn't want you.</p>
<p>A misunderstanding of this principle of looking for a soul mate can and has led to
divorce.  Let me illustrate.  It is almost humorous to observe a young unmarried couple in love. 
After spending an entire day together, they are back together again on the phone that same night. 
It's sheer torture for them to be separated.  Even in their thoughts they can hardly focus on
anything else.  Love begins to disrupt their studies or work.  Everything else in life becomes a
nuisance and an interruption that keeps them apart until they can be together again.  In their
minds there was never, in the history of the world, a truer love than theirs.  They often believe
they have found their soul mate.  We call this level of pre-marriage intensity "infatuation."</p>
<p>After they marry, this intensity tapers off.  Living under the same roof, they each begin to
discover a few peculiar idiosyncracies in the other that they had not seen before. The love that
was blind before now has its eyes wide open.  Some of these idiosyncracies are irritating.  He is 
no longer "Superman," but now simply Clark Kent and something less than "super."  The
infatuation begins to fade.  Those who have confused infatuation for love begin to worry and
wonder if they are falling out of love, and if they made a mistake, and that their one-and-only
must still be out there somewhere.  Their relationship is at a critical crossroad.  If they believe
they have fallen out of love, they may begin to drift apart.  Those who think they made a mistake
sometimes divorce to free themselves for a renewed search for their one-and-only.
		</p>
<p>It is at  this critical juncture when a dose of true love is needed to rekindle a relationship
that is being tested.  True love may not restore the same emotional intensity of early courtship or
change Clark Kent back into Superman, but it will help love remain alive and blooming.  Forty
years later, Grandpa can go fishing, love Grandma dearly, but more easily endure a short absence
from her than he could at a youthful age when smitten with infatuation.  Their love is stronger,
more mature, and still blossoming.</p>
<p>Do you remember the movie, "Fiddler on the Roof"?  You may recall that in this movie
about Russian Jews, Tevia and Golda met one another on their wedding day, the result of the
matchmaking tradition in their town of Anatevka.  With no time to fall in love they had
		<u>to learn</u>
to love one another.  With permission granted from MGM, please watch a 2Â½ minute segment of
"Fiddler on the Roof" to see if they did learn to love one another.   </p>

</font><strong>Golda</strong><font face="Times New Roman">: 	I suppose I do.<br />

</font><font face="Times New Roman">It doesn't change a thing, but even so--after 25 years, it's nice to know.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">While I'm not a proponent of matchmaking--that would deny agency--the story
illustrates the point President Kimball was making, that any good man and any good woman can
learn to love one another and have a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price.  If a
husband and wife are willing to apply the scriptural definition of love to their relationship, even a
stale marriage and romance can be revived.  Stephen R. Covey relates the following experience:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At one seminar, after I'd spoken of the importance of demonstrating
character within the family, a man came up and said, 'I like what you're saying,
but my wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other that we used to. 
I guess we don't love each other anymore.  What can I do?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Love her,' I replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He looked puzzled. 'How do you love when you don't feel love?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">My friend,' I responded, 'love is a verb.  The 
		<em>feeling</em> of love is the fruit of
love.  So love your wife.  You did it once, you can do it again.  Listen. 
Empathize.  Appreciate.  It's your choice.  Are you willing to do that?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, I was asking this man if he was willing to search within himself
for the character required to make his marriage work.  All our relationships follow
the contours of life; they have ups and downs.  This is why our families provide a
critical measure of our character -- and the opportunity, again and again to
nurture it.&nbsp; <a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The choice of an eternal companion is up to each individual. Father in Heaven respects
your agency, especially with this most important of all decisions.  He won't make the decision
for you.  He gives guidelines and principles, but the choice is ours.  Because there is no such
thing as soul mates or a one and only, it would be more appropriate in a prayer to ask Father in
Heaven if this is "a one," than to ask Him if this is "the one."  Ask Him to bless  you with the
wisdom to recognize the attributes of Godliness in your potential spouse.  Is this a good man who
will honor his priesthood?  Is this a woman who will nurture our children in loving kindness?  Is
this a man or woman enough like me that we can have a happy life together?  Be worthy of the
inspiration you seek.  You will not be exempt from the counsel the Lord gave to Oliver Cowdery
found in D&amp;C 9:7-8:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it [the
answer] unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.  But, behold, I
say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it
be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you;
therefore, you shall feel that it is right."  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After you have studied and fasted and prayed and feel like your potential spouse is the
kind of "good" person that President Kimball mentioned, then pray to the Lord for a
confirmation, remembering to ask if this is "a one" not "the one."  <u>After marriage</u> they will 
		<strong><em>then</em></strong> <strong><em>become</em></strong> your one and only with all other options left behind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another principle of revelation that applies here is that each person is entitled to their
own revelation, but not entitled to receive revelation for another.  The only exception to this
principle is for those who have been given a stewardship by God, that would authorize them to
receive revelation concerning individuals over whom they preside, like a father presiding over his
family or a bishop presiding over his ward.  If a young man receives confirmation that his
girlfriend would make a good wife, she is not obligated or bound by that revelation.  She is
entitled to her own revelation.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, the decision of who you marry is the most important of your life.  It is a
decision that will be made with both your heart and your head.  The decision will take into
account your feelings and your thoughts.  Isn't it interesting to note that this is the formula for
revelation as described by the Lord. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Yea, behold, I will tell you in <em>your mind</em> and in 
		<em>your heart</em>, by the Holy Ghost, which
shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.  Now, behold, this is the spirit of
revelation . . ." (D&amp;C 8:2-3).   In other words, your feelings and your thoughts will be in
harmony.  It will feel right in your heart and make sense in your mind. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">May the Lord bless you.  May you know and feel of His love and concern for each one of
you, and his desire for your success and happiness in life is my prayer and my testimony in the
name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font size="2">February 19, 2002</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">President and Sister Bednar, members of the administration and faculty/staff, and you wonderful
students of this great university, Brigham Young University-Idaho, I am humbled to be here
today.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I received the invitation to speak at this devotional from Brother Garth Hall.  Brother Hall served
on the High Council in the Orem Utah Canyon View Stake when I was stake president.  I often
gave him challenging High Council assignments.  Now, he is getting even!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the course of my career, I am often in a position of asking people for money.  I am not here
today to ask you for money.  So you can relax.  I might ask Brother Hall before I leave, but not
you.  Seriously though, my mission today is not to ask anyone for money.  I'm here to invite you
to embark on a great adventure, a journey that could last an entire lifetime.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As was mentioned, I work for LDS Foundation a department of the Presiding Bishopric.  It was
created by the First Presidency in 1973 with a mission to "correlate, encourage, facilitate, and
acknowledge voluntary philanthropic donations to the Church and its charitable institutions . . ."
such as BYU-Idaho, for example.  Specifically, these are donations beyond tithes and fast
offerings.  We tend to work quietly in the background.  However, as the mission of the Church
expands throughout the world, you will probably hear more of us as we strive to accelerate the
work of the kingdom by assisting members and friends of the Church provide additional financial
resources.  In any case, if you have ever received a scholarship, accessed library materials on
campus, or attended an activity at Badger Creek, you have probably been blessed by the generous
gifts of donors assisted by the LDS Foundation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1974, President N. Eldon Tanner spoke to those of us who were the first employees of this
new Church department.  He quoted two scriptures which he said articulated our purpose:</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets shall
be fulfilled; for I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel
among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel.</em> 
(Doctrine and Covenants 42:39)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Tanner said the Lord would bless the Saints and they would use their wealth to bless
the house of Israel.  His statement is so true.  Think of it.  Which nations of the earth, except for
the United States and Canada, have the ability to fund a world-wide missionary operation, the
construction of temples, and hundreds of chapels each year?  None.  The Lord's storehouse or
financial base has historically been North America.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Tanner went on to quote from the Doctrine and Covenants:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Tanner further noted that the Lord always seems to couple the words "<em>poor and needy</em>"
as well as "<em>sick and afflicted</em>."  He reminded us that "<em>poor</em>" does not always mean someone
without material wealth.  That "<em>needy</em>" could also include a person who needs the blessings of an
education or skill.  That "<em>afflicted</em>" could be someone who cannot read.  Our eyes were opened
that night to the many definitions and applications of these phrases in this scripture.  In all cases,
the Lord invites us to ease the burdens of His children.  This was the charge President Tanner
gave us that night so long ago.  It has not changed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Three months ago, President Bednar spoke at a BYU-Provo devotional.  The subject of his talk
was an often undiscussed aspect of the <em>atonement</em>.  Most of us hear speakers talk about the
		<em>redemptive power </em>of the atonement.  President Bednar focused on the
		<em>enabling power</em> of the
atonement.  This is the supportive power of the atonement granted to us by the 
		<em>grace</em> of Jesus
Christ.  It assists each of us in coping with the challenges and experiences of
mortality--challenges and experiences that are the direct result of the Fall.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Fall introduced into our lives such things as sickness and affliction, poverty and need,
suffering, pain, disappointment, discouragement, aging and death, as well as many other mortal
burdens.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I have passed through a half century or more of mortal existence, I have become more and
more conscious of the effects of the Fall.  Some I have experienced personally.  Some I have
observed in the lives of others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we pray and seek for the <em>enabling power</em> of the atonement in our own lives, and then assist
and bless the lives of others, we truly begin to understand  the meaning of the atonement in our
own lives.  We are blessed to be a blessing to others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we labor to <em>bring God's sons and daughters to Christ</em> through 
		<em>preaching the gospel</em>,
<em>perfecting the Saints</em>,<em> and redeeming the dead</em>, we find that the very act of service blesses our
own lives with the very same redemption.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Savior's invitation to each of us to join Him in His mission to rescue and bring to pass the
saving and sustaining effects of His atonement in the lives of His and our brothers and sisters is a
sobering, yet exciting opportunity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The scriptures are full of references to the purpose of His mission and His invitation to all of us
to join Him.  "Come follow me!" he said.  "Come follow me!"  The invitation stands today.  It's
a personal invitation to you . . . and to me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As Jesus gave His first recorded sermon in the synagogue at Nazareth, he outlined His mortal
mission in a few words:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was,
he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.  And when he
had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to 
			<u>preach the
gospel to the poor</u>; he hath sent me <u>to heal the brokenhearted</u>, <u>to preach
deliverance to the captives</u>, and <u>recovering of sight to the blind</u>, <u>to set at liberty
them that are bruised</u>,</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</font>
</em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. 
(</em>Luke 4:16-21, emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now listen for the same expressions describing the Savior's mortal mission, spoken by a servant
of the Lord in the Old Testament who by his actions showed himself to be a true disciple and
laborer in the Lord's mission.  His name was Job.</font> </p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the
street!</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</font>
</em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave
witness to me </em>(Job 29:7-11)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Why was Job so revered?</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Because I delivered the <u>poor</u> that cried, and the 
			<u>fatherless</u>, and him that had none
to help him.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the
			<u>widow's</u> heart to sing for joy.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">I was eyes to the <u>blind</u>, and feet was I to the 
			<u>lame</u>.</font> </em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>I was a <u>father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</u>"  
			</em>(Job
29:12-13, 15-16, Emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I like the phrase <em>"and the cause which I knew not I searched out."</em>  Job must have been a great
priesthood leader.  One actively interested in his fellow men.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me tell you of some others who, like Job, searched out "the 
		<em>cause</em> which I knew not" and
have been involved with the <em>changing and saving</em> of lives in the spirit of philanthropy.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Wait a minute," you say to yourself. "I haven't even graduated, and he is talking to me about
philanthropy?" "Isn't philanthropy something done by rich people?"  In the Greek language
		<em>philanthropy</em> means the "love of mankind."  I would propose that philanthropy is an activity for
all true followers of Christ.  King Benjamin's discourse in the third and fourth chapters of the
Book of Mosiah are instructive here.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The ancient and modern Jews have a concept of philanthropy that is best expressed by the
Hebrew word: Tzedakah.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The word has an astonishing range of definitions.  In Hebrew it means, 
		<em>Righteousness, Justice,
Charity, Alms, or Philanthropy</em>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To some Latter-day Saints this word has a familiar sound.  
		<em>Tzedakah.</em> <em>Tzedek.</em>  Where have we
heard this before?  <em>Melchizedek</em></font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><font color="#000080">Melchizedek</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">An analysis of the word Melchizedek will help us to better see the similarity.  The word 
		<em>Melech</em>
means <em>"King."</em></font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><font color="#000080">Melech = King</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Tzedakah = Righteousness, Justice,	Charity, Alms, and Philanthropy</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And the word <em>Tzedakah</em> means <em>Righteousness, Justice, Charity, Alms, or Philanthropy.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And so we have the meaning of <em>Melchizedek</em> which means 
		<em>King of Righteousness, Justice,
Charity, Alms, or Philanthropy</em>.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><font color="#000080">Melech - Tzedakah</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you remember the story of Abraham going all the way to the ancient City of Salem (now
known as Jerusalem)?  The scriptures indicate that the King of Salem was the great high priest<em>
Melchizedek</em>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So exalted and high was the position of Melchizedek in the eyes of the Lord and his people that
he stood as a prototype of the Son of God himself, the Son who was to arise after the similitude
of Melchizedek  (Hebrews 7:15).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here is the man who was so filled with <em>righteousness, justice, and charity</em> that our Father in
Heaven named the <em>"Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God" the Melchizedek
Priesthood</em>, after this great man.   How fitting that Abraham paid both tithes and offerings to this
righteous king and high priest, after whom the Melchizedek Priesthood was named.  (Hebrews
7:1-2; Alma 13:18).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many years ago while serving as a counselor in a full-time mission presidency, I was assigned to
be the traveling companion to the visiting general authority at a stake conference.  As he and I
talked about my work of assisting members of the Church make philanthropic donations, the
general authority reminded me of the words of the Lord regarding tithes and offerings recorded
by the prophet Malachi.</font> </p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Will a man rob God?  Yet ye have robbed me.  But ye say, Wherein have we
robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.</font>
</em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house,
and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the
windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough to receive it. </em>(Malachi 3:8-12)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The general authority then taught me an interesting principle; 
		<em>tithing</em> is the "law," and <em>offerings</em>
are the "gospel."  Both are found in our covenants.  We return to the Lord a minimum of a 
		<em>tithe</em>
or tenth of our annual increase as a fulfillment of the law.  However, our <em>offerings</em> are left to our
choosing.  It is as though the Lord is asking us what we will do, on our own with the material
blessings He has blessed us with?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In what ways has the Lord blessed us materially?  Our lives, our health, our family relationships,
the air we breath, our food and water, our clothes, cars, homes, employment--our all.  And
remember, we cannot claim to <u>own</u> any of these things ourselves.  The Lord has said:</font>
</p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork;
and all things therein are mine.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the
Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that
the rich are made low.</font> </em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things,
and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves. </em>(D&amp;C
104:14-17)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In these verses, the Lord reminds us that "all things" are his.  He will provide for His children in
His "own way."  Are we willing to help Him?  Are we willing to submit our desires to do it "His
way?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">God is watching to see if we will have the spirit of 
		<em>Tzedakah</em> in our lives.  <em>Tzedakah</em> was the
underlying, foundation concept for the establishment of a society that we call ZION.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What is our responsibility as stewards of these blessings?  How can we know what to do with
these blessings?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">We can listen to the gentle counsel and invitations from our priesthood leaders to assist in
blessings others.  We can pray to be blessed so that we might become a blessing to others.  We
can pray for health, education and employment that we might bless our companions, children,
extended family, the family of Christ (who are members of the Church), and the family of God
(those of Father's children who live in the world, but have not become members of the Church). 
President Kimball spoke of this process in the Welfare Session of the April 1978 General
Conference.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"Finally we consecrate our time, talents and means as called upon by our file
leaders and as prompted by the whisperings of the Spirit."</em>  (President Spencer W.
Kimball, Welfare Session, April 1978 General Conference)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Time, talent, and means or treasure</em> are three words which find their meaning in the admonition
to all of us from Jacob, in the Book of Mormon:</font> </p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with
your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</font>
</em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them;
and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed
the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the
afflicted.  </em>(Jacob 2:17-19)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have been privileged to come to know many true "philanthropists" both within and without the
Church who have used whatever the Lord has blessed them with to bless the lives of others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"<em>Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free
with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you."  </em>(Jacob 2:17)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How does one learn to be a philanthropist, one who loves mankind?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I remember coming to know Mr. Herb Cummings, of Phoenix, Arizona, and former owner and
CEO of Sara Lee foods. Mr. Cummings was born in Canada to a Russian immigrant Jewish
family.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When asked how he learned to become a great philanthropist, he told us that he first learned and
practiced the principle of philanthropy in the home of his grandmother.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Every Thursday, his grandmother would contact all of the married children in their family and
invite them to prepare for the Sabbath, by coming to her home on Friday night for Sabbath
dinner.  Herb said that he never remembered a Friday night, as they began their Sabbath, that his
grandmother had not found a homeless immigrant Jewish man or woman on the streets of Saint
John, New Brunswick, Canada and brought them home with her.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As she would contact her family for the Sabbath meal, she would ask one family for an extra pair
of shoes, a shirt, pants, money, or for knowledge of where there might be a job.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">She would feed, clothe, house and then find gainful employment for these immigrants.  She
sometimes cared for them up to eight weeks, as their self-esteem was built and made strong.  Mr.
Cummings saw hundreds of these people helped by his grandmother.  "I just grew up
understanding that I had a responsibility to take of my surplus and help someone else less
fortunate."  "I have just always practiced philanthropy."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now Herb Cummings was very wealthy.  He did wonderful things with his material wealth in the
true spirit of philanthropy.  What about the rest of us?  Can we be philanthropists?  What about
his sweet grandmother?  Was she a philanthropist - a lover of mankind?</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Recorded in Church History is the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith's reaction to the need of a
Church member.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Evidently, Joseph was working in his garden in Nauvoo, and several of the brethren were sitting
on the rail fence surrounding the garden asking questions and listening to the Prophet teach them. 
Another person approached them and commented to Joseph that a certain member who lived
some distance from Nauvoo had his house burn down the night before.  Nearly all of the men
expressed their sympathy for the man's loss. Joseph put his hand in his pocket, took out five
dollars and exclaimed, "I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars: how much do
you feel sorry?"  (Journal of Andrew Workman, Virgin City, Washington County, Utah)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The other brethren present immediately began to search their own pockets for spare money, as
the Prophet had shown them by example that "action speaks louder than words."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">That story reminds me of similar story of philanthropy that did not involve a wealthy person.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I recently heard President Eric Shumway, president of BYU-Hawaii, relate this story.  Last
summer President Shumway's mother died in Utah.  He traveled to Utah and then Arizona for
her funeral.  After returning to his home in Laie, Hawaii, he heard a knock at his door early one
morning.  Upon opening the door, he saw three humble Tongan brethren whom he had known for
years.  After inviting them into his home, one of the brethren spoke for the group:  "President
Shumway, we heard of the death of your dear mother and felt our need to mourn with you and
your family.  Please accept this gift as a token of our sorrow."  They handed President Shumway
an envelope.  After they left his home, he opened the envelope to find a nice condolence card,
and inside the card was $100.  Now, President Shumway did not need $100; but he knew from
living and associating with the Tongan people for years, that this $100 represented a great
monetary sacrifice and a "heartfelt token" of their grief.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Shumway's story reminds me of Alma's instruction to those who desired to become
members of the Church, before their baptism at the Waters of Mormon:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of
Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the
fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's
burdens, that they may be light;</font> </em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that
stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all
things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be
redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye
may have eternal life--  </em>(Mosiah 18:8-9)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How should we determine how much to give?  A speaker once said about Mormons, 
		<em>"They give
until it hurts, then they continue to give until it feels good!"</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I remember reading about a young Heber J. Grant being asked by the First Presidency to go down
to Provo, Utah, and ask Brother Jesse Knight to give the Church $5,000.  The Church was in very
serious financial trouble, and $5,000, along with some money being given by some other brethren
of means in the Church, would keep the Church financially solvent for a period of time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Grant made an appointment and visited with Brother Jesse Knight who was one of the
richest men in Utah and in the Church at the time.  Brother Knight had found a very rich silver
mine and had stated that the Lord had led him to it in order to bless the Church.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Grant told "Uncle" Jesse, as he was called, that the First Presidency needed $5,000.  Uncle
Jesse was not happy with the request, as the First Presidency was coming to him again and again
with such requests.  "Look, Heber" he said, "I've done about all I can do.  Now you had better
take your request elsewhere."  To which Elder Grant replied, "I only ask one promise: go home
and pray about it tonight.  In the morning, I'll be back and you can answer no or yes; but all I ask
is that you tell me what you really feel after you have prayed."  Brother Knight agreed to that.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">That night when he prayed, he heard a voice say, "Give my servant Heber $10,000."  "But Lord,"
he exploded, "Heber only asked for $5,000!"  "Give Heber $10,000."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Well, when Elder Grant showed up the next morning, there was a $10,000 check waiting for him. 
Brother Knight said, "Take it and go and don't ever ask me again to pray about a donation."</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As some of you might know, Brother Knight literally gave his entire fortune away before he died
to support the Church and BYU.  Without him, BYU would have closed its doors.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brother Knight was very generous in all of his gifts.  He made certain that whatever he gave to
others had quality.  We are asked to give of our "surplus" by the Lord.  Should the gift of our
"surplus" be the best we have to offer or something less?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A story which gives us a standard to follow is one told about President Heber J. Grant during the
great national depression.  The Church Relief Society was asking members of the Church to
donate clothes for those who were out of work and less fortunate.  President Grant asked the
Relief Society Presidency to come to his home as he had some shirts to donate.  At the appointed
time, President Grant met the Relief Society Presidency at his home and gave them brand new
white shirts, still in their original wrappers.  The sisters quickly explained that they were not
looking for new shirts, just good shirts.  "Well," President Grant said, "I always enjoy the look
and feel of a new shirt.  Don't you think that someone less fortunate would enjoy the same look
and feel?"  What a teaching moment for all of us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some people feel that they cannot make a donation now, in their present financial circumstance,
but when they have more money they will make a gift then.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Heber J. Grant reported that during his service as President of the Church he was
constantly reminded by a regular elderly patron of the Salt Lake Temple that he had dedicated his
all to the Lord.  This good brother always made it a matter to seek out President Grant in the
Temple and make his vocal commitment.  Because of this, President Grant decided to watch and
see if this member kept his commitment when he died.  Eventually the day arrived when this
elderly brother died.  Sadly, he had not properly planned his estate, and not one dollar came to
the Church.  When the report was given to President Grant he is alleged to have commented,
"This brother had so planned his estate that he couldn't take it with him into the Spirit World,
and neither could the Lord."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the wealthiest men in the Church today is Jon Huntsman.  Many years ago, just after Jon
and Karen were married and living in a small apartment in Los Angeles, they decided to donate
to charity a certain amount of money every month.  That amount of money represented a sizeable
percentage of their meager monthly income.  Brother Huntsman indicated in an interview that it
was this decision, early in their marriage, that prepared them to be able to give when they had
great wealth.  They continue today to be major philanthropists, often in quiet and confidential
ways.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Finally, the Tongans have another wonderful cultural philanthropic tradition which illustrates
that our gifts can take many forms and have many purposes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Eric Shumway told me last week that when he was inaugurated as President of BYU-Hawaii Campus, the Tongans brought twenty-seven (27) hand-made quilts and laid them on the
Cannon Center floor in front of the stands.  The audience was in awe as they watched this
ceremony.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the dignitaries sitting on the stand leaned over to President Shumway and asked him how
he and Carolyn would ever fit all of those quilts into their home?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Shumway then explained to this good brother that the quilts were not given to him for
his personal use.  The Tongans were honoring him, one of their own (President Shumway is a
Talking Chief to the King of Tonga).  They wanted President Shumway to be a great university
president, and be able to give great presidential gifts when acting in his office.  They gave him
the quilts to make him a great president.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Shumway told me that he and his wife had a wonderful experience giving the quilts
away to people who were less fortunate.  Their act of giving, honored the Tongan Nation and
people who made the quilts for the Shumways.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each of the stories that I have related today relate to the Savior's teachings about caring for our
brothers and sisters who are in trying circumstances as a result of the Fall.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Near the conclusion of the Savior's mortal ministry and just days prior to His final Passover
celebration, Jesus related to his disciples several parables about the <em>kingdom of heaven</em>.  In His
final parable, He defines who will be His true disciple at the time of His Second Coming.  The
parable is an invitation to participate in relieving the suffering and affliction of our brothers and
sisters.</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,
then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one
from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink:
I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye
came unto me.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred,
and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</font>
</em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as
ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</em> 
(Matthew 25:31-40)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My young brothers and sisters, begin now to give!  Make this a characteristic of your life.  Give
of your <em>time, talent, and treasure</em>.  Look for opportunities to give a generous fast offering;
participate in service as a student, as well as financially support causes which change or save
another's life.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many of us speak of the Law of Consecration and say that when it is restored, we will live it.  In
his conference address to the Welfare Session of General Conference in April 1978, entitled
"Becoming the Pure in Heart," President Kimball taught us that the Law of Consecration can be
lived now and that the Law of Consecration begins in our hearts.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith defined the gospel principle of 
		<em>consecration</em>:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"Now for a man to consecrate his property, his wife and children, to the Lord, is
nothing more nor less than to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the widow
and the fatherless, the sick and the afflicted, and do all he can to administer in
their afflictions, and for him and his house to serve the Lord."  </em>(Joseph Smith Jr.,
HC 3:230-231)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Come and join the Savior in His great work.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May the spirit of <em>"Tzedakah"</em> fill your hearts and your lives.  It was in that spirit that the Lord
gave His disciples a new commandment during His last night in mortality:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I loved you. 
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
another."  </em>(John 13:34-35)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Why?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"That they may be rich like unto you!"</em>  (Jacob 2:17)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I leave you with my witness that this work is the work of the Lord.  Your life will find real
meaning as you help others find meaning in their lives.  And I leave this witness in the sacred
name of the poorest of all men; the greatest philanthropist who ever lived, our beloved redeemer,
Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">My wife and I appreciate the opportunity to be on your beautiful campus today and to meet with
you in your devotional assembly.  I am impressed to see so many of you with your scriptures.  I
understand this is something President Bednar has instituted in your devotionals, and I commend
you for following his counsel.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">My topic today is looking at life "Through the Lens of Gratitude."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many of us have had the experience of having our eyes tested. You look through a complicated
machine that has multiple lenses.  After various adjustments are made, the correct lens is selected
that allows us to see most clearly.  The main point of my message today is that we can see our
life experiences most clearly by looking through the lens of gratitude.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Being grateful for who we are and what we have and for the many blessings we receive is so
important to the perspective we have for our mortal lives and to the commitments we make to
each other and to our Father in Heaven.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We read in Luke that as Jesus was journeying to Jerusalem, he passed through Samaria and
Galilee:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers,
which stood afar off.  And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master,
have mercy on us.  And when he saw them, he said unto them.  Go shew
yourselves into the priests.  And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were
cleansed.  And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and
with a loud voice glorified God, And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him
thanks; and he was a Samaritan.  And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten
cleansed?  But where are the nine?  There are not found that returned to give
glory to God, save this stranger.  And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy
faith hath made thee whole.</em>  (Luke 17:12-19)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How important it is for us to be like the one who returned to thank Christ for being healed, and
not like the other nine, who were also cleansed, but who did not return to thank Jesus for their
special blessing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Hinckley's counsel to the youth in November of 2000 included Six Bs.  The first was
to Be Grateful.  He said:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Walk with gratitude in your hearts.  Be thankful for the wonderful blessings which
are yours.  Be grateful for the tremendous opportunities that you have.  Be
thankful to your parents who care so very much about you and who have worked
so very hard to provide for you.  Let them know that you are grateful.  Say thank
you to your mother and your father.  Say thank you to your friends.  Say thank you
to your teachers.  Express appreciation to everyone who does you a favor or
assists you in any way.  Thank the Lord for His goodness to you. </em>(Ensign, January
2001)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I peer through the lens of gratitude, I see many, many blessings, personally and for my family.
As the popular Church hymn states:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Count your many blessings, name them one by one.  Count your many blessings
see what God hath done</em>.  (Church HYMNS:241)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Reflect with me, if you will, from an historical and scriptural perspective, on the many blessings
we receive.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let us begin our reflection with our pre-mortal life.  How grateful we are for the marvelous Plan
of Salvation.  That we had the opportunity to live as spirit children of our Father in Heaven in a
pre-mortal existence.  That we were given our agency and allowed to choose between Satan's
plan and God's plan.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Recall the words of Satan:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy Son, and I will redeem all mankind, that
one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.
But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the
beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</em>
(Moses 4:1-2)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that we chose God's plan, as championed and made possible by our Elder
Brother, Jesus Christ.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Having kept our First Estate, how grateful we are that God and His Son created this marvelous
earth, and has allowed us an opportunity to gain a physical body, exercise our agency, and be
tested during this earth life to see if we will keep his commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil.  They were told that if they did eat of that tree, they would surely die.
However, Adam and Eve were also commanded to be fruitful and to multiply and replenish the
earth.  How grateful we are that Adam and Eve chose to keep God's commandment to "multiply
and replenish the earth."  Without obedience to this commandment, even though it brought sin
and death as consequences, we would not have had the opportunity for this life on earth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Adam said:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened,
and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh shall I see God.</em> (Moses
5:10)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Eve also was glad, saying:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never
should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal
life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</em> (Moses 5:11)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This principle is made clear also in the Book of Mormon.  Lehi explained to his son, Jacob.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he
would have remained in the Garden of Eden.  And all things which were created
must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created;
and they must have remained forever, and had no end.  And they (Adam and Eve)
would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of
innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew
no sin.  But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth
all things.  Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy</em>. (2
Nephi 2:22-25)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Similarly, how grateful we are that Christ was willing to lay down His life so that we can all live
again.  That by Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, He being the firstfruits, we all can be
resurrected.  We read in Corinthians:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</em> (1 Corinthians
15:21-22)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, moving forward with our historical and scriptural perspective from the Creation and Adam
and Eve to Lehi and his family about 600 years before Christ was born on Earth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that Lehi was a "visionary man," and that he followed the Lord's direction,
taking his family into the wilderness.  How grateful we are that Nephi was faithful and believed
"all the words of his father."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that Nephi had the courage and faith to declare</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a
way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</em> (1
Nephi 3:7)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">By trusting in the Lord and following His direction, Nephi was able to secure the Plates of Brass
from Laban so that his people and the rest of us could have these precious scriptures.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that Nephi and the other prophets recorded the words of God on plates of
gold, which were preserved for our time so that the prophet, Joseph Smith, could translate them
by the power of God as our Book of Mormon.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that Lehi and his family were led by the Lord to this "land of promise." 
And that we now can live in this wonderful place, a land where we can be free to live our
religion, to worship our God and His Son, and to rear our families in peace.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we reflect on last September 11, we should be even more grateful for this great land of
America, and the blessings we receive from the freedoms we enjoy.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Alan Jackson, a country and western singer, has captured some of the feelings many of us have
felt since last September with the following words from a song he wrote:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day<br />Out in the yard with your wife and children<br />Or working on some stage in L.A.<br />Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke<br />Rising against that blue sky<br />Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor<br />Or did you just sit down and cry<br />Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones<br />And pray for the ones who don't know<br />Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble<br />And sob for the ones left below<br />Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue<br />And the heroes who died just doin' what they do<br />Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer<br />And look at yourself and what really matters.<br />
<br />Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day<br />Teaching a class full of innocent children<br />Or driving down some cold interstate<br />Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor<br />In a crowded room did you feel alone?<br />Did you call up your mother to tell her you love her<br />Did you dust off that bible at home<br />Did you open your eyes in hope it never happened<br />Close your eyes and not go to sleep<br />Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages<br />Speak to some stranger on the street<br />Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow<br />Go out and buy you a gun<br />Did you turn off that violent home movie you're watchin<br />And turn on I Love Lucy reruns<br />Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger<br />Or stand in line and give your own blood<br />Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family<br />And thank god you had somebody to love.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I'm just a singer of simple songs<br />I'm not a real political man<br />I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you<br />The difference in Iraq and Iran<br />But I know Jesus, and I talk to God<br />And I remember this from when I was young.<br />Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us<br />And the greatest is love.  And the greatest is love.<br />Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is too bad that it takes such a terrible tragedy to cause us to reflect on the many blessings that
come from living in this promised land, a land preserved and blessed by the Lord as a land of
freedom if the inhabitants will live righteously and follow the Lord's teachings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Continuing with our historical perspective of gratitude, how grateful we are that God heard and
answered the prayer of a young boy, Joseph Smith, and that he hears and answers our prayers as
well.  Joseph read in the Bible:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</em> (James 1:5)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that the Father and the Son personally appeared to the boy, Joseph,
establishing the true nature of the Godhead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that the Gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in its fulness,
and that we can belong to Christ's true Church in these latter days, participating in the saving
ordinances of the Gospel through the power of the Holy Priesthood of God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that the prophet Joseph was allowed to translate the Book of Mormon, that
we can read and study this wonderful book of scripture that testifies of Jesus Christ.  The Book of
Mormon helps establish the truth of the Bible, and with our other scriptures, helps us understand
the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  How grateful we are for the promise of the Book of Mormon as
recorded in Moroni.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God,
the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye
shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will
manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.  And by the
power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</em> (Moroni 10:4-5)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that the fulfillment of this promise has led to the strong testimonies and
changed the lives of so many members of the Church, including our own.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are that our pioneer ancestors had the faith and courage to establish Zion in the
tops of the Rocky Mountains; that Brigham Young had the vision to establish LDS communities
throughout the West; that he saw the need and benefit of an educational system, including
Brigham Young University.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are for a living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who continues to
receive revelation and direction from the Lord to guide us.  That President Hinckley has given us
the direction and support for BYU-Idaho as a four-year institution.  And that a great leader,
President David Bednar, has been raised up to carefully work through the transition and give
inspired direction for BYU-Idaho.  What a blessing it is to have the quality of the faculty and
staff who have stepped forward to assist this university reach its divine destiny for the benefit of
you wonderful students.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are for our families, for wonderful parents, for spouses, for those of us who are
married, who bring out the best in us and put up with the worst in us, for brothers and sisters and
extended families.  What a wonderful blessing--the family unit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How grateful we are for life itself.  Isn't this life wonderful!  Isn't it great to see the beauties of
nature, to see a beautiful sunrise or sunset, to smell the sagebrush after a spring rain, to see
beautiful Fall colors or the trees blanketed with new fallen white snow.  Hopefully, we take time
to see and appreciate these blessings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sometimes, some of us can't see or walk or run or speak our gratitude.  We may have some
physical limitations, such as being blind or deaf.  Often, other blessings are given to these
individuals, for which they are grateful.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Consider this example:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Robert Hunt has been totally blind since age 15, yet he refuses to let his blindness
impede him from achieving his goals.  Hunt, a senior from Pleasant Grove
majoring in psychology, carries a 4.0 GPA and is the 2001-2002 recipient of
Brigham Young University's annual Ford Motor Company/Golden Key
International Honor Society Undergraduate Scholarship.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Michael Lambert, professor of psychology, said Hunt works for him as a research
assistant on several projects.  Lambert said Hunt helps him with editing, has co-authored a book chapter, and works on a research team studying the effects of
psychotherapy.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Lambert goes on to say, "People complain of the amount of reading and workload,
but then there is Robert who outperforms everyone. I don't know how he does it."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Robert says "I'm trying to do as much as I can with what I've got. Happiness
doesn't depend on what we have, but on what we are grateful for."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And most of all, how grateful we are for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  For His sacrifice, His
love, His Atonement, and for His Gospel and doctrine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 2 Nephi, Chapter 31, we read of the Doctrine of Christ and the critical steps we must follow.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In verses 13 and 14, we are instructed that we must sincerely, with real intent, repent of our sins
and witness unto the Father that we are willing to take upon us the name of Christ and follow His
example by being baptized, first of water and then of fire and of the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In verses 15 and 16, we are told that we must then endure to the end to be saved.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The gateway to the straight and narrow path leading to eternal life is described in verses 17 and
18 as repentance, baptism, the remission of sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And then in verses 19 and 20 we read:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this straight and narrow
path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not
come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him,
relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect
brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press
forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life</em>. (2 Nephi 31:19-20)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, gratitude is more than good manners. Elder Marion G. Romney said this:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>The Lord puts the commandment to be thankful along with other strong
commandments. He said, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt
serve him. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  Thou shalt not steal; neither
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.  <u>Thou shalt thank the Lord
thy God in all things</u>' (D&amp;C 59:5-7) (emphasis added). It is perfectly evident from
this scripture that to thank the Lord in all things is not merely a courtesy. It is a
commandment as binding upon us as any other commandment.</em> (ACR (San Jose)
1977:12, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thus, expressing and showing our gratitude to Heavenly Father and His Son is a deliberate
choice we should make, similar to keeping His other commandments.  It is also a positive choice
we can make that will enrich our lives and those around us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is illustrated by a news commentary, the author of which is Michael Josephson. Mr.
Josephson said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Though I get special pleasure out of hosting Thanksgiving dinner for my large
extended family, the real burden of the holiday falls on the lovely shoulders of my
wife, Anne.  She's the one who deals with tenting the yard and organizing the
feast including three turkeys and a symphony of side dishes.  And she does all this
while juggling our four young children, a big dog and two new puppies.  So you
can understand if her enthusiasm for the holiday is more muted</em>.</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">There was a time when I thought she was going to resign.  It was a week after she
planned and hosted a business reception at our home for nearly 100 people and
she was weary.  She told me how she had come to dread the pressure and work of
Thanksgiving. Then, just as I was bracing myself to hear her renounce the job,
she completely surprised me by changing direction. 'This year,' she said, 'I have
a whole new feeling toward the holiday.  I've been thinking about it a lot and I've
decided to be grateful rather than resentful.'  Then she told me how lucky we are
to have such a large and close family and the space and resources to provide
Thanksgivings that our children will always remember.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Can you see why I love her so much? She has taught me that gratitude is not
always a spontaneous emotion; often, it's a matter of choice.  It's a perspective of
appreciation that doesn't necessarily make life easier, but it always makes it
better</em>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Choosing to be grateful will lead to a stronger commitment, a desire to try harder to be a better
person.  This, in turn, can lead to more fully keeping God's commandments.  And, as we have
been promised, if we keep the commandments, we will receive even more blessings, until we
receive "all that our Father has," even Eternal Life, the greatest of all gifts.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Hugh B. Brown, in an address entitled, "Gratitude is a Spiritual Attribute," said the
following:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">How rich and radiant is the soul of a man who has a thankful heart.  His
gratitude increases with his unfolding awareness of himself, the universe and his
Creator. Appreciation, like love, enriches both giver and receiver, and, when
spontaneously expressed in word or deed, reveals a depth and delicacy of fine-grain character.  True gratitude is motivated by a recognition of favors received. 
Its counterfeit is fawning anticipation of favors to come.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Serious consideration of the mystery of life, its vastness and incalculability, gives
depth to appreciation for blessings gratuitously bestowed.  They who have eyes to
see, ears to hear, understanding hearts, will see the bounteous love of God
everywhere manifest and will be inclined to reverently remove their shoes and
exclaim: 'For the rock and for the river, The valley's fertile sod, For the strength
of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God.'</em> ["For the Strength of the
Hills," Church HYMNS:35] ("Gratitude Is a Spiritual Attribute," <u>Instructor</u>,
November 1957, p. 332)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, I believe the lens of gratitude can give us a proper perspective on life. Being
grateful is a choice we can and should make. It will lead to happiness, today and tomorrow, and
into eternity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to conclude by publicly expressing my gratitude to a loving Father in Heaven and to
His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, for my many blessings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for life, for the health and strength that I enjoy, for the day-to-day occurrences that
bring me great joy--the opportunity to get on my horse and ride in the beautiful mountains
surrounding our ranch in Wallsburg; the opportunity to hear the squeals of happiness from our
grandchildren as they ride with me on the tractor or are pulled behind a 4-wheeler on a snow
sled; the opportunity to shiver quietly with my sons as we see the dawn break and hear the
majestic bugle of a bull elk.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for my family, for a beautiful and very patient wife who supports me, for our six
wonderful children and their spouses--all sealed in the House of the Lord, and our absolutely
beautiful grandchildren (currently 17, soon to be 19--and we, like other proud grandparents,
have pictures to show how really cute they are).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful to play a small part in the administration of Brigham Young University at Provo. It
is a thrill and a privilege to associate with the wonderful young people of the Church in their
educational pursuits. I firmly believe that Brigham Young University is an important part of the
Lord's work in building His kingdom on the earth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I am
privileged to hold the Priesthood of God and to have the opportunity to use my priesthood in
blessing the lives of my family and friends.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for a living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, for the wonderful person he is,
for the apostles and other leaders of the Church.  Having living prophets to guide us is no small
things; it is a great blessing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for my Savior, Jesus Christ.  I testify that He is the Only Begotten of the Father, the
Redeemer and Savior of the world.  I am so grateful for His love, for His atonement for giving us
the opportunity to live again with Father in Heaven and our families throughout eternity, if we
will but follow His perfect example and keep His commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I pray that each of us will take the time to count our many blessings, and give thanks to a loving
Father in Heaven for all He gives us.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">After sitting here in this reverent room and seeing in my mind the rest of you in the other rooms, I
am hesitant to break the spell.
</p>
<p align="left">Sir Winston Churchill, acknowledged as the greatest man of the Twentieth Century, gave a
graduation address.  He stood up and said, "Never, never, never, never give up!"  And then he sat
down.</p>
<p align="left">I could say: Never, never, never forget the feelings that you had when you were sitting here
surrounded and strengthened by all of the others who were here.  It is, in this noisy world, a very rare
experience to be sitting where you can just <em>feel</em> things.</p>
<p align="left">I very seldom entitle talks, at least before I give them, but this one is entitled, "The Twenty-Mark
Note."</p>
<p>That title comes from an experience that I had something over 30 years ago.  I was assigned with
then-Elder Thomas S. Monson to organize Servicemen's Stake Europe for the military servicemen
in all of Europe.  We met at Berchtesgaden, Germany, a resort high in the Bavarian Alps.  Originally
it was a headquarters built by Adolf Hitler in an incomparably beautiful place.  High on a pinnacle,
close to the other buildings, was an observation building that was called the Eagle's Nest.</p>
<p>When we had finished calling the leaders, we went to a downstairs room to ordain and set apart the
stake presidency.</p>
<p>The room puzzled me.  There was something about the size of it and the shape of it and the location
of it that seemed a bit unusual.  So I asked about it.  I was told that room had been built under orders
from Adolf Hitler.  It stood on the spot and was a duplication in size of a cabin that had once stood
there.  Here he had gone in the early days of his wanderings.  It was there he wrote
		<em>Mein Kampf</em>,
which you German scholars would interpret as <em>My Battle</em>.  That book caused the death of ten million
people.  Seldom has there been on this earth anyone who has duplicated in personality and purpose
the adversary quite as much as did Adolf Hitler.  I thought that we had come full circle where that
had taken place on that site, and now we were gathered there to organize a stake of Zion.</p>
<p>The word <em>stake</em> in the Church comes from the word <em>stake</em>--a stick pounded in the ground.  That
word, as we use it, comes from the scriptures.</p>
<p>The meaning of it goes back to the Old Testament when the Israelites, after being rescued from
Egypt, were wandering in the desert.  They built for themselves, under the direction of the Lord, a
tabernacle.  It was a prototype of a temple, and it was called the Tabernacle of the Testimony.</p>
<p>It consisted of a building in which there were two rooms, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.  In
the Holy Place there were certain ceremonies that took place.  There was a laver and some other
things.  Only the high priests went into the Holy of Holies.  In there was the Ark of the Covenant,
the breast plate, and the Urim and Thummin.</p>
<p>When they moved from one place to another, they could dismantle the tabernacle and move it about
with them.  When they set it up again, they put the tent-like building up, then they put a wall around
it to form an outer court.  The wall and the building were made of linen, leather, fabric, and acacia
wood.  In order to keep the building up and the wall up, they drove stakes into the ground.  A stake
was a supporting unit of their tabernacle or their temple.</p>
<p>When the Israelites had been in the Holy Land for generations, David was commanded to plan a
temple.  Later the Lord told him that because he had been a man of war he was forbidden to build
the temple, although he had planned it.  His son, Solomon, built it.  The temple followed the pattern
of the tabernacle that they had carried with them and then maintained for nearly 200 years.</p>
<p>After we had finished setting apart and completing that organization in Germany, we were assigned
to go to Berlin to a stake conference.  We needed to get from Berchtesgaden high in the Alps down
to Munich to the airport.</p>
<p>Captain Bernie Fisher, a member of the Church who was a Congressional Medal of Honor winner
in the Vietnam War, drove us down.  He was stationed there.  He drove us, my wife and myself and
his family, down to Munich.</p>
<p>When we got to Munich it was foggy, and we got lost.  We could not find the airport.  We could not
find anyone who spoke English.  Finally, there was a policeman.  Brother Fisher's boy, who I think
was about a third grader, had learned enough German to ask him where the airport was.  So the
scripture was fulfilled that a little child should lead them.</p>
<p>We got to the airport in ample time for our plane, which as I recall left at about 10:00 in the morning,
but it was fogged in.  We sat there listening to the announcements for nearly 12 hours.  They kept
saying they thought the fog would clear.  It did not clear.</p>
<p>That night near 10:00, two missionary elders came to the airport.  We knew then that the planes
would not fly.  They told us there was a train leaving Munich for Berlin at midnight.  They took us
to the mission home.  My wife rummaged through the kitchen, found some canned soup, and made
us a quick supper.  The elders took us to the train station, bought our tickets, and saw us aboard the
train which would take from about midnight until about 10:00 the next morning to arrive in Berlin.</p>
<p>As the train was pulling out, one young elder said, "Do you have any German money?"  I shook my
head, no.  He said, "You better have some," and, running along side, pulled from his pocket a
twenty-mark note.  He handed that to me.</p>
<p>At that time the Iron Curtain was very "iron."  The train stopped at Hof on the border between West
Germany and East Germany, and they changed crews.  All of the West German crew members got
off the train, and the East German Communist crew got on the train.  Then it set out across East
Germany toward Berlin.</p>
<p>They had just begun to issue five-year passports.  I had a new passport--a five-year passport.  We
went to have my wife's passport renewed.  They sent it back saying that the three-year passports
were honored as a five-year passport, that she still had more than two years left on her passport.</p>
<p>About two o'clock in the morning, a conductor, a military-type soldier, came and asked for our
tickets, and then, noting that we were not German, he asked for our passports.  I always hate to give
up my passport.  I do not like to give up my passport, especially in unfriendly places.  But he took
them.  I almost never dislike anybody, but I made an exception for him!  He was a surly, burly, ugly
man.</p>
<p>We spoke no German.  In the car, the compartment, there were six of us--my wife and a German
sitting to the side of her and then almost knee to knee in a bench facing us were three other Germans. 
We had all been conversing a little.  When he came in, all was silent.</p>
<p>The conversation took place, and I knew what he was saying.  He was denying her passport.  He said,
"Drei Jahren!"</p>
<p>And I said, "Five Jarhen!"</p>
<p>He went away and came back two or three times.  Finally, not knowing what to do, I had a bit of
inspiration and produced that twenty-mark note.  He looked at it, he took the note, and handed us our
passports.</p>
<p>The next morning when we arrived in Berlin, a member of the Church, who was the head of the
Central Intelligence Agency for the United States in Berlin, met us at the train.  I rather lightly told
him of our experience.  He was very sober, very suddenly.  I said, "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>He said, "I don't know how to explain your getting here.  East Germany right now is the one country
in the world that refuses to honor the three-year passport.  To them, your wife's passport was not
valid."</p>
<p>I said, "Well, what could they have done?"</p>
<p>He answered, "Put you off the train."</p>
<p>I said, "They wouldn't put us off the train, would they?"</p>
<p>He said, "Not us, her!"</p>
<p>I could see myself having someone try to put my wife off the train at about two o'clock in the
morning somewhere in East Germany.  I am not sure I would know what to do.  I am glad that
passed.</p>
<p>I did not learn until afterwards how dangerous it was and what the circumstances were, particularly
for my wife.  I care a good deal more about her than I do for me.  That intelligence officer convinced
us that we had been in very serious danger.  Those whose passports they would not accept were
arrested and detained.</p>
<p>All of this comes to this point: the elder who handed me the twenty-mark note was David A. Bednar,
a young elder serving in the then-South German Mission, who sits here on the stand as president of
BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>So, why was it that this young elder from San Leandro, California, handed me the twenty-mark note? 
If you understand that and understand what life is about, you will understand really all you need to
know about life as members of the Church.  You will understand how our lives are really not our
own.  They are governed--if we will and if we live as we should live--then we will be taken care
of.</p>
<p>I do not think he knew the consequences of what he was doing.  That twenty-mark note was worth
six dollars, and six dollars to an elder is quite a bit!  Perhaps he hoped to get it back from the mission
president.  But at any rate, it happened.</p>
<p>As you go through life, you will find that these things happen when you are living as you ought to
live.</p>
<p>In 1976, I was here in Rexburg with President Spencer W. Kimball.  Among my assignments then
was supervising the Church in Idaho.  On a beautiful Saturday morning the ordinary things were
going on in this area.  Here on the hill at Ricks College all was as it should be.  Then the bells and
sirens started to ring.  They wondered what was the matter.</p>
<p>One man, who was a professor here at Ricks College, had come in on a Saturday to do some work. 
He went to find out what was the matter and learned that the Teton Dam had broken.  The Teton
Dam up the valley had sprung a leak. A man with a large Caterpillar was trying to make repairs on
the dam when it broke loose.  He ran for his life.  That large DC Caterpillar--which is a very large
and very heavy piece of equipment--was found many miles down the valley.</p>
<p>This college faculty member, I suppose, inside turned pale, because he knew that his wife and
children were in Rexburg shopping except for one of the younger girls who was sick.  She was
upstairs at home, right in the path.</p>
<p>Interesting things happened.  There were 11 deaths.  One was a fisherman who was fishing just
below the dam.  Another was a 90-some-year-old woman who died of a heart attack.  Another was
a couple who were warned.</p>
<p>This old man said, "I have lived here for 60 years.  Nothing like that has ever happened.  You are
not going to scare me."  In due course, they could hear the thundering and the rumbling of the water
coming down the valley.  Seventeen miles of deep water had backed up behind that dam.  Then they
got in their car.  They were among those that were lost.  They found their bodies in their car, after
digging it out of the mud.</p>
<p>We had a lot to do with the emergency personnel in the United States.  By their rule of thumb--time
of day, population, size of the catastrophe--they estimated that there should have been 5000
casualties, and there were 11.  Why?  Because they were warned.</p>
<p>Many of them told us that they were unusually on edge.  When the warning came, they responded
immediately.</p>
<p>We held the meeting in this room with President Kimball.  He had talked to me.  He said, "I
understand you are going to Idaho.  Do you think I could go with you?"  And I let him come--he
being the President of the Church!</p>
<p>We held a meeting here with the survivors, the refugees.  There were two meetings, in fact.  One
meeting and then another later, in order to get them all in.  Here they were with whatever they had
on.  A lot of them were very muddy.  None of them were in Sunday clothes.  It was Sunday, but no
one was dressed in Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes.</p>
<p>President Kimball leaned over and said, "I cannot see an unhappy face among them."  I looked, and
that was true--not one unhappy face!  Why?</p>
<p>There is a scripture that says, "If ye are prepared ye [need not] not fear" (D&amp;C 38:30).  There are
other scriptures, more than one, that speak of warning, that we will be warned of danger.</p>
<p>As we visited with the people on that and other occasions, there were some things that emerged. 
They were alerted and had very little time, but they had the <em>feeling</em>.  The thing they grabbed first was
their family records and photographs.  Think of that!</p>
<p>One of the questions was, How did they react?  Speaking literally: someone heard about it, they
stopped at their neighbors and knocked on the door, knew they were home, could not get them to
answer.  They took a chair off the porch, and threw it through the window to get their attention to
say, "Run! Run!"  They warned one another.  That girl upstairs in that house was saved.</p>
<p>There were something like 900 homes that were destroyed or severely damaged.  Many were washed
for miles and miles down the Snake River Valley.  There was a warning, and they heeded the
warning.</p>
<p>Why did they heed the warning?  Why did they warn their neighbors?  "It [behooveth] every man
who hath been warned to warn his neighbor" (D&amp;C 88:81).  Have you ever read that in the
scriptures?  They acted on that!  It was just natural for them to warn the others.</p>
<p>And so, before the day was over, there were a large number of people here on the hill in Rexburg. 
The flood did some damage here in Rexburg, as well.</p>
<p>First we went to Wilford Ward and landed a helicopter there.  Wilford Ward Chapel was at the
mouth of the canyon.  There were three bearing walls in the chapel, one in the middle and one on
each end.  Over the bearing walls was slung what was left of a roof.</p>
<p>As we went down the road from the chapel, there was a railroad.  I marveled at the fact that it had
bent those rails.  The force of the water had literally bent them.</p>
<p>We stopped at the stake center in Sugar City.  The water had come in one side, picked up all the
benches and furniture and used them as an abrasive to churn the interior out of the building, and went
out the other side.</p>
<p>Across the street we looked at what once was a beautiful home.  There was the roof and the bearing
walls, and there was one ceiling left and a beautiful crystal chandelier hanging above mud in the
house.</p>
<p>That was a great experience.  We learned a lot from it.  We learned one thing that may surprise you. 
We learned that in one way the Church did not work at first.  </p>
<p>When the stake president got the warning, he went right to work without relying on all the help he
had.  A few days after it had happened, I had a call from one of the stake presidents.  He was not
making sense.  He had been up night and day trying to help people and now was wandering around. 
He got the bishops busy, but he did not call his high council together; he did not call the priesthood
together; he did not call the Relief Society.  The stake presidents and the bishops were going to do
it all themselves.  They could not get it all done themselves.</p>
<p>Now, this is the message: The Church did not work then as it should have.  The gospel did!  The
Spirit did!  The Spirit was operative.  It was the Spirit that warned them that they must act and that
they must act quickly.</p>
<p>One young man came up to me.  There he stood in some dirty old levis and a dirty t-shirt and some
tennis shoes.  He said, "I am supposed to leave on my mission tomorrow.  This is all we own."  His
mother was standing by him.  He said, "Everything is gone.  My scriptures and everything else is
gone."  That was easy to fix.  He was in the Missionary Training Center in Provo in a day or two,
completely outfitted, because finally the Church worked.</p>
<p>As you go through college and learn the difference between the Church--which is a container, a
vessel, a domicile for the gospel--and the gospel itself and concentrate on learning the gospel and
how the Spirit operates, then you will be wise indeed.</p>
<p>We do not have much time to prepare.  I did not write a speech, because I have an eye problem.  I
was in an automobile accident in Brazil about 15 years or so ago.  The most serious of the injuries
was a torn muscle in the back of one eye.  In due course, I began to see double.  I saw two stop signs. 
I would look down and see two pieces of paper.  I would see two words.  That didn't bother me until
I saw two wives.  Then I thought, I am going to lose my job!</p>
<p>We went through for a number of years doing all that the doctors could do by way of prisms in my
glasses.  In due time, they said they had run out of options.  I was going to have surgery.  T<font face="Times New Roman">hey
operated on that muscle in the back of my eye.  I will carefully spare you the details of that.  But
then, with causes incident to age, the same thing developed, and two weeks ago it had to be repeated. 
So if I had written a talk, I could not have read it anyway.  Tomorrow when I get my new glasses,
I will be able to read again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can learn what the Spirit is, then you never need to be alone.  In the 46<sup>th</sup> section of the
Doctrine and Covenants </font>verse two, it says, "Notwithstanding those things which are written, it
always has been given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct
all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>Let me repeat that for you.  If you can learn that:  "Notwithstanding those things which are written
[no matter what is written anywhere], it always has been given to the elders of my church from the
beginning [and it will always be that way], and ever shall be, to conduct all meetings as they are
directed and guided by the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>And so, I determined that I would rely on that.  I wondered in my mind what I could tell you that
would help you the most.  You would expect that I ought to teach you some doctrine.  The doctrine
generally explained in the scriptures, the revelations, tells us that we are dual beings.  We know there
is a spirit and a body.  "The spirit and the body [when they are eternally combined, become] the soul
of man (D&amp;C 88:15)<strong>.</strong>  So there are two parts of you sitting there.  There is a spirit inside of a body.</p>
<p>Your spirit is eternal--existed forever.  You have a spirit body; your intelligence existed forever. 
That is hard for even college students to get through their mind.  If you will shake your heads and
get your grey cells wiggling a little bit, you can understand that we are going to live forever.  You
believe that, don't you?  In the Resurrection, we will live eternally.  That cannot be unless that is true
of the past, too, that we lived eternally in the past.  We are in the middle of something eternal here.</p>
<p>The body and the spirit, eternally combined, constitutes the soul of man.  There are a lot of scriptures
and references that you can read about that subject.  There are a lot of things that you can read about
the carnal side of us and controlling it to make yourself behave.</p>
<p>I have wondered about when the day comes that my spirit will leave my body.  It will be quicker for
me than it is for you.  In a way, I am looking forward to that, but I am not urging it to come right
away.</p>
<p>When that "unwrapping" takes place and your body is set aside and we are looking at your spirit,
what are you going to look like?  What will your spirit look like?</p>
<p>Probably one or two of you here might be described as a perfect athlete--perfectly coordinated, able
to do anything!  So here you have a beautiful physical body.  If we separated your body from your
spirit, what would your spirit look like?  You will live to learn, if you will study and pray and feel,
that you could have a very beautiful body and a very shriveled, weak spirit.  On the other hand, you
can have a body that is limited in many ways, and yet in the eternal scheme of things, you can train
and teach your spirit so that it becomes of imperishable worth.</p>
<p>A man I knew--one of the great men I have known--was in a bunch of roustabout boys.  They were
always where they should not be and never where they should be.  Finally, a wise leader that was
resourceful got them into a Sunday School class.  There was this old man--just an ordinary, homely,
old man.  More than that, he was a convert from Europe, and he did not speak English very well. 
They giggled, "Our teacher?  Him?"  These boys, I suppose, had the reputation of running any
teacher out.</p>
<p>Then my friend said that something happened.  The teacher started to speak, and then it happened! 
They all began to listen.  This friend said, "You could warm your hands by the fire of his faith."<font face="Times New Roman"> 
That meant that in that older, worn-out body that did not seem to be able to erase an accent, there
was a powerful spirit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Resurrection, the body--the dust of the earth, the carnal part of us--can be renewed and made
powerful if it is to equal the spirit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When President Heber J. Grant was a young man, his bishop once said, "What are we going to do
with that Grant boy?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">His father, Jedediah M. Grant, had been a member of the First Presidency, and he had died early and
left a widowed mother to take care of this boy.  The bishop did not think he would amount to
much--but he became President of the Church!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was in school, an English teacher assigned the class to collect some examples of bad
English, to write down the mistakes.  He went to Church and heard a speaker who was an immigrant
and could not speak English very well.  He did not say two sentences until he had made mistakes. 
This young Heber Grant thought, "I'll fulfill my assignment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He did not have paper to write on.  In those days the boys and the men wore shirt collars and cuffs
that were made of celluloid, a kind of plastic.  You could write on them.  So he got his cuff out, and
when the man made a mistake, he wrote it down.  He was collecting mistakes in English.  Then the
same thing happened!  He forgot the mistakes and began to listen.  The power of the Spirit took over. 
He left the room both inspired and ashamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can understand how the Spirit operates, you will be all right.  There is not enough evil put
together--if it was all brought together as some kind of a dark, ugly laser beam and focused on you,
it could not destroy you, unless somehow you consented to it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You</font>, as Latter-day Saints, have a protection.  In the course of your learning, "wisdom is the principal
thing; therefore get wisdom [here at BYU-Idaho]: and with all thy getting get understanding"
(Proverbs 4:7).<font face="Times New Roman"></font></p>
<p>"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding." 
Well, get it!<font face="Times New Roman"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You do not know how fortunate you are.  Now, you are here.  You are greatly blessed.  Make sure
you learn the things that you are not taught overtly.  If all you know is what you read or what you can
hear, you will not know very much.  Learn to <em>feel</em> as we were <em>feeling</em> something during that reverent
period of time before the meeting started.  I hope I have not intruded into that spirit or erased it. 
Those moments of reverence are so precious when you <em>think</em> and <em>feel</em>.  That is why temples are so
important.  You can go to the temple and be out of the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone was asking me about that earlier today.  I said, "You have to learn to be alone in a crowd. 
You have to have such control."  That is so important.  We spend so much time in airports and in
other noisy places.  But I do not go there.  I might be standing there physically, but I am not there
spiritually, because I am thinking things and doing things in my mind.  If you will learn to do that,
then the Spirit will teach you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The promise is that when you </font>receive the Holy Ghost, "[it will] teach you all things, and bring all
things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:26).</p>
<p>You will be doing some things automatically, almost unwittingly.  Without thinking, you will find
you have been prompted and guided by the Holy Spirit.  That is why this young elder, without
knowing why, took a twenty-mark note out of his wallet as he was trotting along to the side of the
train and handed it to me as the train was pulling out.  He saved us from great danger.</p>
<p>That is how you will do things and then later look back and know that you were guided.  And also,
that is how you will be warned.  You will be warned, <em>Don't go there!  Don't do that!</em><font face="Times New Roman">  You will be
warned, <em>Don't go with him!  Don't go with her!  Don't be with them!</em>  And then, 
		<em>Do be in this
company!</em>  You will be guided, and the Lord will watch over you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I pray the blessings of the Lord upon you here in this wonderful school, under inspired leadership. 
I bless you that the Spirit of the Lord will guide you and help you to understand.  You can look
forward to the day when you are "unwrapped" and your spirit is separated from the body.  Your spirit
is young and vibrant and beautiful.  Even if your body is old and diseased or crippled or disabled in
any way, when the spirit and body are put together in the Resurrection, then you will be glorious,
then you will be glorified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I know that the gospel is true, that Jesus is the Christ, that He lives, that this is His Church.  Find a
place in the world where you can, without embarrassment, without any hesitancy, declare to yourself: 
first that you accept the gospel of Jesus Christ and that what you <em>are</em> is more important than what
you <em>do</em>.  What you <em>do</em>, if it is guided, will make you what you 
		<em>are</em> and what you can <em>be</em>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Church is on the right course.  It is righteously led.  The power of the Almighty is upon it.  As
you move forward, you can look forward to a very happy, safe life, notwithstanding what the world
is now and what it yet will be with trials far more than you face now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As a servant of the Lord, I invoke His blessings upon you.  I invoke the blessings first upon your
parents, who made it possible for you to be here.  Some of you come here with parents who are non-members.  Write and tell them that we invoked a blessing upon them--upon your father and your
mother and others who have made it possible for you to be here and are sustaining you with
sacrifices you will not know about until you in turn are sending your children and trying to bless your
children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I invoke the blessings upon you that you will understand the power that you have from having
received the gift of the Holy Ghost.  I bless you that you can listen to it and follow the prompting
thereof, that "[it may] </font>teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever [He
seeth fit that you should have].</p>
<p>I bear witness of the Christ.  You will come to know the meaning and the fulness of and experience
ultimately the fulness of the Atonement.  For this I pray and invoke this blessing upon you, in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman">Things are not always the way they appear to be. I learned this, in a very personal way, when I
was about your age.  I was 24, doing graduate work at BYU (Provo), wildly in love and engaged
to be married.  The young man seemed to be my absolute dream guy: Returned missionary, well
educated, employed, musical, handsome, great social skills, loved my family, and committed to
keeping the Lord's commandments.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">ALL the attributes and abilities, on my "husband-to-be wish list", were there!   He had them
all...or so it seemed.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And talk about a courtship!  He wrote me poems, songs, and letters of love.  What a guy!  A man
with the same desires for marriage and family-and for life-as I had.  Or so I thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I was teaching family history in my BYU ward at the time, and with some compelling insights
about the importance of the temple which I had gained through this calling, I chose to receive my
endowments a few months prior to the time I was to be married in the temple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What a blessing temple attendance was for me!  As I returned to the temple week after week, my
world view started to open up, to change.  And my view of myself and my fianc&eacute; followed.  I can
clearly see in my mind's eye the day that I walked out of the Provo temple, after having gone
fasting and praying, seeking an answer to a question that had started to haunt me: "Should I
marry this man?".  A friend who had accompanied me to the temple that day asked, "Well, did
you get your question answered?" I replied: "I didn't get an answer-but I know that everything is
going to work out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Freeze frame.  I've learned through subsequent experiences, that the Spirit of the Lord is
involved whenever I find myself saying:  "Everything is going to work out".</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Little did I know just HOW everything was going to work out!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It seemed that from the very minute I said those words, the Spirit whispered to my fianc&eacute;, who
was working in another state:  "Show her what you're really like."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As the days and weeks unfolded, his behavior changed.  His letters changed.  Our conversations
changed.  My experience with our relationship changed.  And, as I studied it out in my mind, I
became increasingly concerned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enter:  a servant of the Lord, my Bishop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In preparation for April general conference, which was just two weeks away, my Bishop taught
me a truth I had never known before.  Although I hadn't spoken to him about my engagement or
my concerns, when my Bishop offered this truth over the pulpit, he was speaking to me.  He
didn't use my name-but I knew-he was talking directly to me.  He even let others listen in.  But
clearly, he was speaking to me.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Here's the truth my Bishop spoke:  "If you have a question that you need answered, if you will
prayerfully and humbly listen to general conference, you will get it answered every time. 
Perhaps at the time, perhaps over time, but you WILL get your question answered every time!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Did I have a question?!!  Absolutely.  And I was desperate for an answer from the Lord.  
		</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I prepared myself for that general conference by fasting and praying-and by purchasing blank
audiotapes.  Now, I realize that audiotapes are not typically requisite for listening to
general conference, however this was in the days that not all conference sessions were broadcast to
Canada, and I wanted to audiotape the sessions for my Mom and Dad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I can still picture the Saturday of that April
general conference.  I listened eagerly to every talk. 
I listened with my ears, mind and heart poised and ready to hear the answer to my question:
"Should I marry this man?" </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I experienced this day of general conference unlike any other.  It was a highly unusual day of
talks, because each and every talk was on marriage!  Every single talk!  Multiple speakers-but
only one topic: marriage-or so it seemed.  And the most amazing thing to me was that at the end
of all those Saturday addresses on marriage, the clear answer I received was, "Don't marry this
man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I can still picture, at the conclusion of
conference, turning off the TV, shutting off the cassette
recorder, and walking directly and calmly to the telephone, and dialing my fianc&eacute;'s number to
cancel our engagement.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I wasn't nervous at all.  I was at peace.  I had asked.  And I had received my answer.  So, what's
a young woman to do when she has asked, and then heard and felt the voice of the Lord telling
her what to do? What's a young woman to do...but to follow through? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Fast forward several years.  My ex-fianc&eacute; is married and he appears to be happily involved in
family life.  I have completed my Masters degree, have worked a couple of years, moved to a
new city, dated some great men, and continued to be directed by the Lord to pursue further
education.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another fast forward a couple of years:  It is Christmas time and among the cards and letters is
something from my ex-fianc&eacute;.  It is a lengthy, hand-written letter from this now- no-longer-young
man, declaring that he is choosing a life-style inconsistent with Gospel teachings and Church
standards, and telling me of the sorrow that has come to his wife and family since their recent
divorce and his declaration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>My dear young brothers and sisters, things are not always the way they appear to be!</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Years ago on that Saturday evening when I ended my engagement, it seemed to many
people-many who chided me for the breakup, many who tried to convince me to change my
mind-that I was terminating a relationship with a marvelous young man-a man with whom I
could experience much love and joy, as we entered into the covenant of marriage, and
commenced raising up a family to the Lord.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">How unkind could I be?!  How cruel!  How unwise to turn away from this great man and his
love-especially at my age (I was 24 after all!!)  To many people, it seemed like I was throwing
away an opportunity of a life-time..  But-things are not always the way they appear to be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord knew this young man's heart, mind and actions.  And when I asked-with as much
preparation and faith as I could muster-and as I listened to the messages of
general conference-I was guided (some days it still feels more like "snatched") away from something
that<em> looked</em> good-but wasn't.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One last fast forward: It is now 6 months following receiving that Christmas letter of declaration. 
I am asked to prepare a Relief Society lesson on marriage.  Of course I will-and I know just the
audiotapes to review to find an excerpt from a general conference address on marriage, to
supplement my lesson.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember finding the clearly marked tapes, and with anticipation, pushing the "play" button on
the tape player.  And then, I remember listening and listening for hours, as the talks played on
and on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But something was different about the talks this time.  Something was missing.  To my dismay,
there was nothing-absolutely nothing....about marriage!  Not one talk-was on marriage!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It had been the Spirit of the Lord that had taught me as I listened to
general conference.  The
Spirit had helped me to hear exactly what I needed to hear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">General conference had been the vehicle.  The Spirit had been the messenger.  "Don't marry this
man" had been the message from the Lord.  And for that, I will be eternally grateful.  
		</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Things are not always the way they appear to be.  People are not always who they appear
to be.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Cases of mistaken identity abound</strong>.  Clothed in Laban's robes, Nephi looked like Laban (1
Nephi 4:21)-even to Laban's servant, who consequently heard everything that Nephi said, as just
more evidence that he was talking to Laban.  For eg., when Nephi spoke about taking "the
engravings which were upon the plates of brass to (his) elder brethren who were without the
walls" (1 Nephi 4:24), Zoram assumed Nephi was talking about the elder brethren of the church,
and happily went along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nephi also looked like Laban to Nephi's own brothers, and they were frightened and started to
flee when they saw Laban-or-who they thought was Laban-coming toward them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">People are not always who they appear to be.  As I was driving down the street one day, I
suddenly saw one of my friend's driving in the car next to me.  It was Susan.  I was so happy to
see her.  She looked great.  Then I realized, it couldn't be Susan, because-I was on my way to her
funeral!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">People are not always who they appear to be:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of those who looked like they were friends of the Prophet Joseph Smith, turned out to be
his enemies!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cases of mistaken identity abound:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Helaman chapter 9, we read about a pile-up of confusion-almost a comedy of errors-around
"who is really who?", when 5 people, who doubt Nephi's prophecy that the chief judge's brother
has killed him-find the chief judge dead!  They are "astonished exceedingly" and fall to the
ground.  Just then, some other people arrive.  Finding the five lying on the ground, next to the
chief judge's body, these people assume that the five are the real murderers, and that the Lord has
struck them down, so they can't leave the scene of the crime. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This case of mistaken identity continues, as the five-who came to see IF the chief judge was
dead-are now accused of being his murderers!!-AND are taken off to jail!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Things certainly are not always the way they appear to be!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>One reason why things are not always the way they appear to be is that two very different
things can look like each other</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A student who is listening attentively and pondering every word that her professor is saying, can
look just like the student next to her who is pondering how to start up a conversation after class
with that cute guy two rows over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Things are not always the way they appear to be:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A recent TV advertisement for an allergy medicine is built around the point that two different
things can look alike.  A woman is shown sitting on the bleachers at a ball game.  While all
around her are cheering the team on, she is looking down and not participating.  The caption on
the screen then reads: "Disinterest? - or, high pollen? ".</font></p>
<p>Things are not always the way they appear to be because two very different things can look so
much alike:  A man was taken to the emergency room.  All his signs and symptoms looked like
drug intoxication.  But the curious thing was, that when a sample of the man's blood was tested,
there was absolutely no evidence of any drug in his system.  Nothing made sense, until the man
roused enough to tell the physician that he had just returned from a hiking expedition in the
Himalayas.</p>
<p>Things are not always the way they appear to be: The signs and symptoms that accompanied the
adaptation of this man's body to a dramatically decreased elevation, following an extended time
at an intensely high elevation, looked just like drug intoxication-a very different kind of high!</p>
<p>Two very different things can look alike.  In Alma chapter 26, Ammon's brother accuses him of
boasting, when actually, Ammon is glorying in the Lord.  Ammon helps his brother understand
the distinction between the two by saying:</p>
<p><em>"I will not boast of myself" but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do
all things" </em>(Alma 26: 12).</p>
<p>Things are not always the way they appear to be:</p>
<p>One young man, away from home for the first time in his life, made friendships with people who
took him to places the Spirit could not remain.  He perceived the emptiness he felt when he was
with his new friends in these places, to be evidence of his complete lack of social ability.  He
started to believe:  "There must be something wrong with me.  I'm a complete social misfit.  I
don't even like being with people."  It was only years later, following other experiences with
friends where the Spirit was present, that he made the connection, that what was uncomfortable
to him, was not social situations, but was ANY situation where the Spirit was not present.</p>
<p><strong>Another reason why things are not always the way they appear to be, is that when we look
at a situation, we don't use a wide enough angle lens.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a picture that shows a young boy, looking down, and eating a very small piece of bread. 
This picture could be used effectively to solicit funds for assisting the poverty stricken children
of the world.  However, when we widen the frame, we see that this boy is sitting with family
members on a church bench-and then, we realize-that what looked like a sad situation is
actually, a sacramental moment!</p>
<p>Without a wide-angle lens, a relationship problem usually looks like the other person's fault.  A
husband complains that his wife nags.  Conversely, his wife complains that he is never home. 
Neither sees how his or her own behavior unwittingly contributes to the problem.  The wife's
nagging actually invites her husband to withdraw more-both physically and emotionally.  And
his withdrawal invites her to nag him more.</p>
<p>Without a wide-angle lens, it is almost impossible to see our contribution to a problem-to
consider how someone else might be experiencing our behavior, such that they are invited to do
the very thing we wish they would not!</p>
<p>So, the next time you have a relationship problem, or you find yourself saying:</p>
<p>"Our relationship would be so much better, if only the other person wouldn't....(you fill in the
blank), -ask yourself: "How do I usually respond when the other person does what I wish they
wouldn't? How might my responses unwittingly be inviting the very behavior I wish would
stop?"</p>
<p>When we don't use a wide-angle lens-a lens that lets us see how our actions, thoughts and
feelings may be involved-when we only zoom in on the behavior of another-things are not
always the way they appear to be.</p>
<p>Without a wide-angle lens, the intent behind another person's troublesome behavior, usually
looks negative.  For example, we think they are trying to hurt, undermine, disregard, or
embarrass us.  But again, things are not always the way they appear to be.</p>
<p>In the above example, the husband was amazed to find out that his wife's nagging (she termed it,
"repetitive encouragement") was her best effort to reach out to him, to let him know just how
important he was to her.  And the wife was delighted to discover that her husband's withdrawal
was his best effort to keep the peace.  His best effort to stop the conflict that happened every time
he came home.</p>
<p>In order to see the benevolent intent of another, we need a wide-angle lens!</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a wide-angle lens that allowed Pahoran to respond to Captain Moroni's false
accusations that he was withholding troops and was a traitor.  Instead of countering with anger,
Pahoran wrote the following healing words to Captain Moroni:</p>
<p><em>"Now, in your epistle you have censored me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice
in the greatness of your heart" </em>(Alma 61:9)<em>.</em>  Imagine!  Pahoran could see Captain Moroni's
great heart-even after Captain Moroni had falsely accused Pahoran of sitting upon his throne in a
state of thoughtless stupor!  (see Alma 60:7)</p>
<p>With a wide-angle-lens, we can see beyond the obvious-we can see things we otherwise could
not-things not observable with only a zoom lens.</p>
<p>For eg. with a zoom lens, forgiveness looks like something we do for the benefit of someone who
has wronged us.  For some victims, forgiveness can even look like a way to discount the horrible
acts perpetrated against them-almost a way of winking at what they feel has ruined their lives
forever.</p>
<p>With a zoom lens, forgiveness looks like a way to help the perpetrator's life-period!</p>
<p>However, with a wide-angle lens, we see that forgiveness is actually for victims!!  With a view of
the far-reaching effects of true forgiveness, we see that forgiveness is actually the gift that
victims can give to themselves!</p>
<p>One woman found that by forgiving her perpetrator, she was finally freed from agonizing
questions-questions that had held her mind and heart captive for years: Questions like: "Why did
he? Why didn't he? Why did I? Why didn't I?"</p>
<p>When she really prayed for power to forgive the person whom she felt had ruined her life, she
discovered that forgiveness was her "get out of jail free" card.  She was now able to free herself
from the prison of pain and suffering.  A prison that her un-forgiveness had built.</p>
<p>So, when you're really ready to do something for yourself-forgive someone!  A true slogan could
be: Forgiveness: It's not just for perpetrators anymore!</p>
<p>We also need a wide-angle lens to look beyond the obvious when is comes to apologies.  With a
zoom lens, an apology looks like something you offer to someone you have wronged.  However,
one man found that it was his apology TO someone who had wronged HIM, that was his key to
freedom.</p>
<p>The man was President George Albert Smith.  He offered what many would call a high level
apology-some would even call it, "an impossible apology" -to a man who had spread false
rumors about him.  He was in anguish over this, and filled with such an abundance of negative
feelings toward his perpetrator, that he felt unworthy to partake of the Sacrament.</p>
<p>George Albert Smith finally found freedom from his suffering, when he went to his perpetrator
and said, "I'm here to ask forgiveness for the hateful feelings I've had toward you." The man
became immediately apologetic himself, and the two became lifelong friends.  (see Truman G. 
Madsen audiotapes on Presidents of the Church).</p>
<p>When one couple used a wide-angle lens, they started to see their trial of cancer as a marital
intimacy gift.  The wife explained, "When my husband was diagnosed with colon cancer, we
were both devastated and in anguish.  However, cancer gave us permission to talk about things
that we had never spoken of before.  Travel to and from his treatments gave us uninterrupted
time together-something we had not taken for years.  Over time, cancer, this life-threatening
illness, actually brought life to our relationship!  Truthfully, I was a bit sad when my husband's
treatments were over, because we slowly shifted back into living our parallel lives, where
although we both felt love for each other, we didn't take time to express it in the very special
ways we had during those intensive cancer days"</p>
<p>With a wide-angle lens we can see that a person who is saying, "Leave me alone!", may really be
saying, "Please don't leave me alone".</p>
<p>We can see that a person who doesn't talk to us, and who looks like a snob, may actually be
feeling insecure, and needs us to reach out to him or her.</p>
<p>With a wide-angle lens, we can see that those times which look like we are sacrificing our lives
in the service of another, are actually times when we are growing more and more into
ourselves-and into the life we were meant to live.</p>
<p>So, who really is sacrificing for whose life?</p>
<p>What would look different in your life, if you used a wider angle lens?  What would you be able
to see, that you can't see right now?</p>
<p>Remember, things are not always the way they appear to be, especially without a wide angle lens.</p>
<p>The science of biology offers an intriguing explanation for why things are not always the way
they appear to be.  By rotating the eye of a frog 180 degrees, a Chilean biologist and his
colleagues at MIT discovered that an image of a worm was not transmitted by the frog's eye as
originally thought, but rather, was transformed by the frog's eye.  With the frog's eye rotated,
when a worm was held to the left, the frog saw it as being to the right-and threw out his tongue
in that direction to catch the worm.  When the worm was held to the right, the frog saw it as
being on the left-and threw out his tongue accordingly.  The researchers concluded that it was the
internal structure of the frog's eye, not the external stimulus of the worm, that determined what
the frog saw.  Thus, the experiment's report was titled, "What the Frog's eye tells the frog's
brain".</p>
<p>What are your eyes telling your brain?</p>
<p>Have recent experiences "rotated your eyes"?-so to speak.</p>
<p>Painful or confusing life experiences can rotate our eyes, so that things are not always the way
they appear to be.</p>
<p>One young woman left for college with the words of her father ringing in her ears, telling her that
she was "stupid, and not worth anything." She believed that no one would ever like her-that she
would never be good enough.  Her father's angry voice, and other demeaning experiences, locked
her eyes into a "rotated position" as it were.</p>
<p>What was the effect? In every encounter with roommates, professors, and boyfriends, her
"rotated eyes" saw more and more evidence that her father was right.</p>
<p>Lucifer is the quintessential evil eye surgeon who loves to "rotate our eyes".  Through his sinister
surgery, he can make right look wrong, and wrong look right.  He can make inconsequential
things look all important-and things that matter least?-well, he can make those things look like
they matter the very most!</p>
<p>He can make friends who are raised up to help you, look like enemies sent to constrain you-and
he can make those who are part of leading you carefully away from your mission here on earth,
look like long lost friends!</p>
<p>When your eyes are rotated by the adversary, sin looks like happiness.  But the truth is: You can
never sin enough to make you happy.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: You can NEVER sin enough to make you happy!</p>
<p>Can you think of a time when your eyes were "rotated" by the adversary? For example, if you
have ever seen or read sexually explicit material, you have invited the adversary to begin rotating
your eyes.</p>
<p>One young man at age 13 commenced having his eyes rotated, through the seemingly simple act
of opening-what looked to him to be-just another magazine.</p>
<p>But things are not always the way they appear to be.</p>
<p>Little did this little boy know, that he was opening a Pandora's box that would turn his life-and
his views of life and love-upside down!</p>
<p>Initially, he was repulsed by what he saw, but then, through repeated viewing, his heart and mind
began to crave what his eyes saw.  As he immersed himself in more and more pornography, he
barely noticed the rotating of his eyes-along with the twisting of his mind, and the hardening of
his heart!</p>
<p>He started to believe that everyone looked at love and at life the way he did.  He started to
believe that lust was really love, and that all love was, was lust.  His goal in life became to have
one intense lust-filled experience after another.  But, there was never enough lust to fill.</p>
<p>Because, remember: You can never sin enough to make you happy!</p>
<p>He participated in illicit sexual experiences prior to, and following, his mission-seeing them as
no big deal..  And besides- there was always repentance.  A quick confession to the Bishop every
now and then....and then, out the door for more and more lust-filled experiences.  But once
again....there was never enough.</p>
<p>Little did he realize just what sexual sin was doing to his views of himself, his life, his wife-to-be, and their relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> did he imagine that sexual sin was actually 
		<strong>decreasing</strong> his ability to identify, and really
know, true love and true marital intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> did he imagine that so many of the things the world was telling him to do, in order to
increase his enjoyment of sexual experiences-were actually making it almost
impossible for him
to ever experience true sexual intimacy!</p>
<p><strong>Never </strong>did he imagine that he was being duped by the adversary-so that real sexual fulfillment
would always be-just beyond his reach.</p>
<p>With his eyes so drastically and devilishly "rotated", he approached his wife on their honeymoon
in a manner that made her feel " like a thing".  He experienced his wife's refusal to participate in
certain sexual activities, as proof that she didn't really love him.  He was put off!</p>
<p>What was wrong with her? How cold and non-responsive could she be!</p>
<p>Rejection and loneliness became his constant companions.</p>
<p>And because of his severe "eye rotation":</p>
<p>Wrong looked right.<br />Right looked naive<br />Lust looked like love.<br />Love looked like control.</p>
<p>And pornography looked like his only fun, only friend, only refuge.</p>
<p>An anaesthetic to numb his intense pain and ever increasing loneliness.</p>
<p>With his continuing immersion in pornography-which riveted his eyes into their destructively
rotated position:</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But things are not always the way they appear to be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Over time, pain and confusion started to re-emerge.  He couldn't see, think, or feel straight.  He
couldn't tell what was real-and what was illusion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The day his wife put all his belongings out on the front lawn, and left a note indicating that she
was filing for divorce, was like a whack on the side of his head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A beneficial whack, that momentarily corrected his vision-reversing the adversary's "rotation"
process.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He saw his life for what it really was....a crying shame!  And he cried.  And he felt ashamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, sexual sin looked stupid...and he realized how stupid it had made him.  His past
choices-that had looked like freedom-now looked like chains.  His affair looked like one
gigantic death trap!  His wife looked loving and patient, rather than pushy and cold.  Prayer now
looked like the sure refuge from the storms of his raging emotions.  And so he prayed.  He prayed
as he had never prayed before.  He prayed for freedom from the lustful feelings that held him
captive.  And he fasted-for courage and for endurance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">His initial humiliation grew into true humility.  Regret, turned into remorse, and into a sincere
desire to thoroughly repent of his adultery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this state, the Spirit returned to his life, and started the process of permanently reversing the
adversary's rotation of his eyes, so that he could see things are they really are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But the process was not easy!  One main reason for the intense difficulty in correcting this man's
vision was that, although he had been immersed in the waters of baptism when he was eight, his
experience with the Gospel since that time, consisted only of a little sprinkling: a little sprinkling
of a quick prayer from time to time, a little sprinkling of a few scriptures here and there.  Church
attendance-but never a time of worshiping and seeking after God.  Fasting, only because his
parents demanded it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This intermittent sprinkling of Gospel truths in his life, gave this man only enough experience
with the Gospel to feel guilty, but not enough experience to feel joy-the kind of joy that comes
through immersion in the Gospel-regular immersion, for example, in prayer, scripture study,
temple worship, and fasting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Are you sprinkling your life with the Gospel-or are you immersing yourself in it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Tragically, the only thing this man had immersed himself in, since his immersion in the waters of
baptism, was pornography-which President Hinckley has termed, "the literature of Lucifer"
(GBH)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, this man didn't have a reservoir of experiences with the Spirit, from which to draw-a
reservoir that could have given him rejuvenating strength, for the rigorous days of change ahead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At one point, when the process of change became so intensely discouraging, this man turned all
of his feelings completely off!!  "I have to numb myself" he told me.  What a sad irony!  This
man, who had seen himself as being so passionate, was now unable to feel anything, for anyone. 
In every way, he was "past feeling" (Moroni 9:20).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It was only as he avoided <strong>everything and anything</strong> that was sexually explicit, or even
suggestive, and only as he regularly and relentlessly immersed himself in experiences with the
Spirit, that the evil "rotation" of his eyes was corrected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Slowly, he began to see that if he wanted real excitement in his life, obedience to the Lord's
commandments was the only way to go.  He had learned by sad experience that while sin looks
exciting, sin and its consequences are pathetically predictable!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He started to see that while obedience used to look so boring, he soon discovered that it is
obedience that unlocks the door to a thrill a minute.  He came to experience that when the Lord
knows He can trust you, it's almost impossible to imagine what magnificent experiences await! 
(See D &amp; C 76: 5).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He began to see that purity and passion go together.  That "pure passion"-meaning, that passion
which has been purified by the Holy Ghost-and therefore, is magnified, expanded and
enhanced--is always greater, in every way, than impure passion!  (See Purity and Passion:
Spiritual Truths about Intimacy that will strengthen your marriage).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Young men and women, you of a noble birthright, pray for the purifying
influence of the Holy Ghost, so that your passions are pure, and your vision, perfected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If your eyes have been rotated by the adversary, pray for the Holy Ghost to correct and perfect
your vision, to purify your feelings, to purify your passions.  And then live, so that He can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pray relentlessly: in the morning and in the evening, when you're driving, shopping, sitting,
studying.  Pray when you are riddled with temptations-and when you are peacefully focused on
life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is enough and to spare of power in the Atonement to correct and perfect our vision-and to
purify our passions.  When our passions are pure and we can see clearly, then, and only then, are
we ready and able to participate in marital intimacy that is out of this world-because, it is not of
this world!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are all preparing for true marital intimacy-whether we are single-never married, soon-to-be
married, recently divorced, sadly widowed , or happily married-And each and every one of our actions, thoughts and feelings either decrease or increase our
ability to experience true marital intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth is:</font>&nbsp; 
		<font face="Times New Roman">Anything that offends the Spirit-moves us away from true marital intimacy.&nbsp;
    And conversely, </font>a<font face="Times New Roman">nything that invites and sustains the Spirit, move us toward true marital intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It really is as profoundly simple as that!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each and every sexual experience a person engages in outside of marriage, moves him or her one
step further away from ever enjoying true marital intimacy.  While the adversary whispers- "just
this once won't hurt".. . remember, that things are not always the way they appear to be.    If you
could see the damage "just once" does-you would run screaming into the hills, at the very
thought of being unchaste!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each and every time we see or hear something that is sexually explicit, the Spirit is offended and
flees, and we take another giant step away from true marital intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, each and every time we pray with real faith and real intent for the Holy Ghost
to purify our passions, each and every time we open our scriptures and seek an answer to a
problem, each and every time we feast upon fasting, or help heal a wound we didn't cause,
when we are kind to someone who is cruel to us, forgive someone who has wronged us, betrayed,
belittled, or falsely accused us; when we forgive someone who has contaminated our lives with
their sins, when we seek to understand just a little bit more about the power that is in the
Atonement for US!-we take a giant step closer to true love.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each and every time we pray to fill the measure of our creation, to fulfill the wonderful mission
for which we were sent to earth, when we pray-to know how the Spirit speaks to us,
to be shown how the Lord feels about us, to be tutored about our premortal assignments and
commitments, when we pray-to know what else we should be praying for in our lives,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each and every time we <strong>pray with power</strong>... we take one giant step forward in increasing our
capacity for true marital intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Truly, things are not always the way they appear to be.  However, as we purify ourselves, we can
avoid the adversary's rotation of our eyes-that deadly rotation which skews our vision and
distorts our thoughts and feelings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If the adversary has rotated your eyes, what can you do right this week to stop him?  If you will
ask Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Spirit will tell you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And, what can you do right this week to invite the Spirit into your life, so that your correcting
and perfecting eye surgery can begin?  Again, if you will ask, the Spirit will tell you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To those whose eyes are presently devilishly rotated, sexual experiences look like sheer
entertainment.  But to those with eyes to see-those with Spirit-corrected vision and Spirit-enhanced lenses-sexual intimacy is 
		<strong>so much more</strong>!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pure eyes, with perfect vision, can see that a husband and wife are never closer to the Lord, than
when participating in true marital intimacy!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I promise you, you who are part of the most magnificent army ever on earth-the Lord's Royal
Army, that as you immerse yourself in more and more experiences with the Spirit, making Him
your constant companion, He will help you see things are they really are.  (Jacob)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And your increased companionship of the Holy Ghost, will increase your personal purity, which
will increase and expand your natural passions!!  What passions?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your passion to give and to receive love will enlarge, along with your passion for true marital
intimacy, for love and for life, and your passion to be who you really are and "who you have
always been" (Sheri L.  Dew)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your passion to complete your premortal assignments will increase, and you will desire more and
more not to be distracted by the honors of men, or the wiles of the world!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your passion to be ever increasingly pure will enlarge, and your passion to draw closer to the
Savior than you ever have before-to attach yourself to Him-will grow stronger and stronger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And what will become your most heart felt passion?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your passion to become more and more like Him!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">My beloved brothers and sisters, I promise you, that as your passions are increasingly purified
and magnified, and your vision increasingly perfected, that you will find love and happiness, joy
and light and peace that are <em>far</em> beyond your wildest dreams!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And you WILL see things as they REALLY are!&nbsp;
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p>	Brothers and sisters, I delight in this opportunity to be with you. </p>
<p>	None of us will ever forget what we saw and what we felt on the morning of
September&nbsp;11, 2001.  As I watched the events of that day unfold, I remembered the responsibility
I had to speak to the students at our first devotional of the fall semester at 2&nbsp;o'clock.  As I sat in
my office pondering and praying and considering that just a few hours before this devotional was
to begin these young people had witnessed one of the most tragic and traumatic events they
might ever see, a scripture immediately came into my mind:  Doctrine and Covenants, section 45,
verse 32.  I will not quote or read the entire verse, but the phrase that kept coming to my mind
was, "But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."  I personally
received great comfort from this passage of scripture; and at the devotional, I shared that theme
with the students and attempted to articulate some of its implications.</p>
<p>	I have been studying and pondering and thinking about that verse for the last six months. 
My desire this afternoon is to share with you just a few of the things I have learned about that
verse and the implications it has for us to stand in holy places and to not be moved.  I plead for
the assistance of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>	The first thing I did as I began my study of this verse was to look up in the dictionary
three words:  <em>stand</em>, <em>holy</em>, and <em>places</em>.  Here is what we learn about the word stand:  "To rise to an
upright position; to remain stable, upright, or intact; and to remain valid, effective, and
unaltered" (The American Heritage College Dictionary, 3rd Edition, Houghton Mifflin Co.,
Boston New York, 1997, p.&nbsp;1324).  Please think of those definitional elements together--upright,
stable, valid, effective, intact, and unaltered.  The word holy suggests "to be associated with
divine power" or "sacred" (Ibid., p. 649), and the word place refers to "a bounded area or a
portion of space" (Ibid., p. 1043).  Thus we are to rise to an upright position, to remain stable,
intact, valid, effective, and unaltered in a sacred, bounded area, i.e., stand ye in holy places and
be not moved.  These are the key elements that I first identified and tried to understand as I
researched those three words in the dictionary.</p>
<p>	Please consider those basic definitional elements as we read together from the 45th
section of the Doctrine and Covenants.  Verse 32 contains the theme for this weekend--<em>Stand in
Holy Places</em>.  The power of that specific verse, however, is evident only in the context of the
preceding verses.  Please read with me beginning in verse 26:</p>
<p>		And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole
earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall say
that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.</p>
<p>		And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound.</p>
<p>		And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth
among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel;</p>
<p>		But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their
hearts from me because of the precepts of men.</p>
<p>		And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
<p>		And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until
they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the
land.</p>
<p>		But <strong>my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved</strong>; but
among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die (emphasis
added).</p>
<p>	Clearly, in the 45th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we learn about the conditions
that will precede the second coming of the Savior, and in the midst of those terrible conditions,
"my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved."  Now remember the
definitional elements:  upright, stable, unaltered, intact, and valid in a sacred, bounded area.</p>
<p>	In the 87th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, again, we find a similar verse about
the importance of standing in a holy place and not being moved.  But again, separated from its
broader context, the verse does not have nearly the impact.  Please read with me beginning in
section 87, verse 6:</p>
<p>		And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth
shall mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of
heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of the earth be
made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God,
until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations;</p>
<p>		That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of the saints, shall cease to
come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be avenged of
their enemies.</p>
<p>		Wherefore, <strong>stand ye in holy places, and be not moved</strong> (emphasis added),
until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. 
Amen.</p>
<p>	These verses in Doctrine and Covenant sections 45 and 87 show very similar patterns of
events preceding the second coming of the Savior.  Now note this verse from Doctrine and
Covenants, section 101, verse 22: "Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and
worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, <strong>should gather together, and stand in holy
places</strong>" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>	Brothers and sisters, from these passages we learn that the instruction to stand in holy
places is most frequently preceded by a description of the conditions, both delightful and
devastating, that will attend the Savior's second coming.</p>
<p>	As I considered the admonition to stand in holy places and be not moved, I thought of the
movie <em>The Ten Commandments</em>.  And I thought of the Passover and the children of Israel, and
their placing of lamb's blood on the doorpost in response to the instruction from the Lord's
servants.  Do you remember the scene where Moses and his family are gathered together in a
room, the door is opened to allow Joshua to enter, and Moses says, "Eleazar, do not look.  Close
the door, and let death pass."  Then the door is shut.  Was Moses and were the members of his
family standing in a holy place?  What would have happened had they moved out of that sacred
place on that particular night?  Had they not remained within the confines of that special, holy
place, they would have been subject to the destroying angel just like anyone else.  But they were
in a holy place, and they were not moved out of that place!</p>
<p>	As I have thought about that Old Testament story and the latter-day verses we just read, I
want to suggest, brothers and sisters, that there will be a latter-day Passover.  And you and I must
be found standing in holy places and not be moved from those holy places as we anticipate a
latter-day Passover--different in its application, similar in its importance.  Would you consider
the notion of "be not moved" and the need to "stand in a holy place" as I share a most powerful
illustration presented by President Spencer W. Kimball in general conference.</p>
<p>		The forces of good are clearly and continually under attack.  There are
times when it seems the world is almost drowning in a flood of filth and
degradation.  And I want to cry out, "Hold on.  Hold on to what is right and true. 
Therein is safety.  Don't let yourself be swept away."</p>
<p>	Please keep in mind the imagery of "be not moved."  Again, this is President Kimball:</p>
<p>		In 1946 I visited Hawaii.  Shortly after a huge tidal wave where the walls
of water some forty feet high struck Hilo and the Hanakua coast, and I saw the
devastation that resulted.  Homes had been overturned and shredded, crushed into
splinters like toothpicks; fences and gardens were obliterated; bridges and roads
were washed away.  Bathtubs, refrigerators, and mangled autos lay strewn all
about the streets.  Where one of our little chapels had stood, nothing remained but
the foundation.  More than a hundred people lost their lives; as many more were
injured.  Thousands were left homeless.  I heard many stories while there of
suffering, of heroism, of salvation.</p>
<p>		One woman told how she received a telephone message from friends to get
out and to leave--that a tidal wave was coming.  She looked out to see and saw
the monstrous wave approaching like a mountain.  She and her husband picked up
the baby and ran for their lives up the hill.  However, two of their little girls were
away from home playing near a clump of lauhala trees.  They saw the wave
coming, ran into the trees, and held tightly with their arms around the tree trunks. 
The first gigantic wave washed entirely over them, but they held their breath and
clung with all their might until the water receded and their heads were again
above the water.  When the wave receded, they quickly ran up the hill before the
succeeding waves came.  Together, the family watched from the safety of the hill
as their home below disappeared under the pounding of the waves.</p>
<p>		We, too, are faced with powerful, destructive forces unleashed by the
adversary.  Waves of sin, wickedness, immorality, degradation, tyranny,
deceitfulness, conspiracy, and dishonesty threaten all of us.  They come with great
power and speed and will destroy us if we are not watchful.</p>
<p>		But a warning is sounded for us.  It behooves us to be alert and to listen
and flee from the evil for our eternal lives.  Without help, we cannot stand against
it.  We must flee to high ground or cling fast to that which can keep us from being
swept away.  That to which we must cling for safety is the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
It is our protection from whatever force the evil one can muster (Spencer W.
Kimball, <em>Conference Report</em>, October 1978, pp. 5-6).</p>
<p>	Can you see those two small children running into that small group of trees, grabbing the
trunks, and clinging tight, hanging on with all the strength those little arms could muster, and not
being moved by the power of that tidal wave?  Consider that image, and then consider from the
Doctrine and Covenants, section 124, verse 45: "And if my people will harken unto my voice,
and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say
unto you, <strong>they shall not be moved out of their place</strong>" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>	We shall not be moved if we heed the counsel we receive from the Lord through the voice
of his servants.  Consider this statement from the First Presidency comprised of Heber J. Grant,
Anthony W. Ivins, and Charles W. Nibley:  "To the members of the Church we say: Stand ye in
holy places.  Keep yourselves clean and unspotted from the sins of the world, <strong>that when his
judgments pass over the earth, like Israel of old you may be preserved</strong> (James R. Clark,
<em>Messages of the First Presidency</em>, Vol. 5, p. 254, emphasis added).</p>
<p>	What I have started to understand a little bit is that there is a type and a shadow and a
preparation in the story of the Passover.  It is a preparation for us in these latter days.</p>
<p>	Consider this teaching by President Benson:</p>
<p>		We will live in the midst of economic, political, and spiritual instability. 
When these signs are observed--unmistakable evidences that His coming is
nigh--we need not be troubled, but "stand in holy places, and be not moved, until
the day of the Lord come" (D&amp;C 87:8).  <strong>Holy men and women stand in holy
places, and these holy places consist of our temples, our chapels, our homes,
and stakes of Zion</strong>, which are, as the Lord declares, "for a defense, and for a
refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without
mixture upon the whole earth" (D&amp;C 115:6).  We must heed the Lord's counsel to
the Saints of this dispensation: "Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord"
(D&amp;C 133:10) (Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 106, emphasis added).</p>
<p>	The question that seems clear for all of us is:  Where and how do we stand in holy places? 
President Benson gave a very clear answer.  We stand in holy places in our homes, we stand in
holy places in our temples, and we stand in holy places in our stakes of Zion.  Remember the
definitional elements we discussed earlier:  intact, unaltered, rising to an upright position in a
sacred, bounded area.</p>
<p>	I suppose it would now be predictable for me to separately describe each of these holy
places and try to outline ways whereby we could most appropriately and effectively "stand" in
holy places in our homes, in the temples, and in the stakes of Zion.  But I am not going to do that. 
Could I recommend an exercise that you all might want to consider?  The exercise would be to
identify what is common in homes and temples and stakes of Zion as holy places.  What is it that
cuts across all three of these locations that makes them holy, sacred places where we would not
be moved?  May I simply suggest that if we will undertake this exercise, the Holy Ghost will
teach each of us individually and uniquely what we, in our circumstances and with our families,
ought to do to stand in holy places.</p>
<p>	Let me share with you just a few of the things that occurred to me as I went through this
exercise.  I do not claim that these are the "right" answers.  They are simply the answers that
occurred to me as I tried to think through common elements across those three very sacred
places.</p>
<p>	Brothers and sisters, I pray that I might be able to articulate this next thought most
clearly.  Perhaps our covenants, our sacred covenants that we always remember and consistently
and earnestly strive to honor, become the blood on our doorposts in anticipation of the latter-day
Passover.  In ancient Israel, protection against physical death was afforded to the obedient.  In
our latter-day Israel, protection is available through our covenants against the spiritual perils that
are so prevalent amidst the onslaught of sin and evil in an increasingly wicked world.  Consider
the last verse in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which we all know refers to the
Word of Wisdom: "And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall
pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.  Amen."</p>
<p>	This revelation is not talking about the children of Israel.  It is talking about us in this
latter day as we are obedient to the instruction we have received.  In the time of the children of
Israel, they offered sacrifice in anticipation of the infinite sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son and
participated in the feast of the Passover as a reminder of how the children of Israel were
protected from the destroyer on that fateful night.  In this latter day we are commanded to offer
the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and we feast at the sacrament table each week.</p>
<p>	Again, consider the setting, the context, the preparation, and the requirement to stand in
holy places and consider the following statement by President Joseph Fielding Smith:</p>
<p>		There are predictions by the ancient prophets to the effect that great
destruction will come and that the wicked will destroy the wicked.  Ezekiel has
given us the vision of the final destruction before the coming of the Lord, and the
Lord revealed a portion of this to the Prophet Joseph Smith which is found in the
Doctrine and Covenants, Section 45.  Zechariah also, in the closing chapters of his
prophesy, has described many of the scenes that will take place in this final
struggle and the coming of the Savior, in the midst of the turmoil, to the relief of
the persecuted Jews who have gathered to their ancient inheritance.  These are
very interesting revelations. They will all come to pass in their prophetic order
before the reign of peace shall be ushered in.  <strong>The righteous have been
commanded to stand in holy places while these destructions are coming upon
the world</strong> (Joseph Fielding Smith, <em>Answers to Gospel Questions</em>, Vol. 2, p. 190).</p>
<p>	There is a latter-day Passover.  There is blood for the doorposts.  And there is spiritual
protection available to those who honor and keep their covenants.</p>
<p>	Let me conclude with this experience with President Hinckley.  I began by describing
what took place on September 11, the responsibility I had to speak to the students, and the verse
that came into my mind.  At 10 o'clock on September 12, I was with the First Presidency, six
members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and other general Church leaders in a meeting
of the Board of Trustees that oversees the affairs of the entire Church Educational System.  As I
prepared to participate in that board meeting, I said to my wife, "What would any member of the
Church give to be in this setting with these brethren and these sisters today, given what took
place yesterday?"  Well, it is customary that we all arrive quite early.  I entered the room and
shook hands with all of the men and women who were there.  President Hinckley was not yet in
the room; he is always the last to enter.  There was not one word mentioned about the events of
the previous day--no speculating, no hand wringing, no commiserating, no nothing, not one
word.  President Hinckley came into the room, greeted everyone and shook our hands, took his
place at the head of the table, and sat down.  We sat down.  He looked up and simply said,
"Brothers and sisters, we live in troubled times.  Now let's get to work."  That is all that was
said.</p>
<p>	The day before what had come to my mind was the scriptural admonition to stand in holy
places and be not moved.  Less than 24 hours later I was in the presence of the Prophet of God
who stood in a holy place and was not moved--unaltered, valid, effective, rising to an upright
position in a sacred, bounded area.  "Let's get to work."</p>
<p>	In the midst of the predictions of what will come, there is peace.  There is reassurance. 
There is no need to fear if we simply heed the admonition and the instruction to place the blood
of the lamb on our doorposts.  In ancient Israel it may have been literally blood on a physical
doorpost.  In our day it is the doctrine of the Savior's atonement in our hearts.  If the Atonement
and our covenants are written in our minds and in our hearts, there will be peace.  There may be
devastation all around, but you and I will not be devastated if we stand in holy places and are not
moved.</p>
<p>	I testify that God lives.  I know that Jesus is the Christ.  I know that He directs the affairs
of this Church in this latter day through living apostles and prophets.  And I know that His
promises are sure as we stand in holy places and are not moved, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p>	I'm pleased to be here today and grateful for the support of family.  My mom and dad and
two sisters are here with me today.  Thank you so much for coming.  I want you mothers to
know it's the warmest day of the whole year!  God must love mothers!  I also want you to know
that your children--who are highly educated, have been identified as college material, and are
projected to do well at this university--wear sandals with no socks and no coats on days when
it's minus 17&nbsp;degrees.  Because it is so warm today, I know you won't believe me; but I have
seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>	I'd like to say thank you to the Associated Women Students on campus.  Girls, could you
stand--those of you who are wearing red jackets and helping with Mothers' Weekend?  You see
them scattered throughout the congregation.  I wore a red jacket today because I want to be like
these girls.  I'm a wannabe; I want to be like you.  Your dedication, your hard work, and your
example as beautiful women of God are extraordinary.  Thank you for all you have done.  I hope
you mothers will enjoy the weekend these young women have planned for you.  They've worked
hard.</p>
<p>	Our theme for Mothers' Weekend is "Stand in Holy Places."  How can we define the term
"holy place"?  The Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual suggests that "a holy place is any
place where a man enjoys the spirit and presence of Divinity" (p. 196).</p>
<p>	I've been reminiscing about opportunities I've had to stand in holy places.  I hope as I
share some of these personal moments with you today that the Spirit will touch <strong>your</strong> heart and
bring to <strong>your</strong> remembrance times when <strong>you</strong> have stood in holy places.  Then perhaps you can
share these special memories that will come to your mind with your son or daughter while you
are here together this weekend.</p>
<p>	I hope the first memory you mothers will have of standing in holy places is the day you
held your precious son or daughter in your arms for the first time.  Remember the thrill, the love,
the awe you felt as you participated in the holy miracle of his or her birth?  That was a long time
ago, and now my husband and I have the opportunity here at BYU-Idaho to observe another
miracle taking place as we watch your sons and daughters engage in the process of anchoring
themselves in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Opportunities are afforded almost every day for our
students to stand in holy places.  </p>
<p>	Just ten days ago the basketball arena in the Hart Auditorium was transformed into a holy
place as we prepared for our devotional speaker, President Boyd K. Packer.  At the conclusion of
President Packer's remarks, he invoked a blessing on both the parents and the students.  Did you
mothers know you were blessed by an Apostle of the Lord here at BYU-Idaho last week?</p>
<p>	This chapel is a holy place.  I remember sitting here on the stand the day the Taylor
Building was dedicated by President Faust.  Since that time I have noticed a peace and
tranquility associated with this chapel that you don't feel anywhere else on campus.  The students
use this area as a quiet place to meditate, ponder, and read their scriptures.  I pray the Spirit of
the Lord will be here with us today as we ponder about holy places.</p>
<p>Could an airplane be a holy place?  It was the day my husband and I flew back to the
United States with our son who had just completed his mission in Finland.  As the plane took off
from the runway, we looked across the aisle to notice a tear running down our son's cheek as he
peered out of the plane's window and reflected on his two years of faithful service in a choice
land with people he had grown to love.</p>
<p>	Imagine a football stadium being a holy place.  On July 24, 1997, our family attended the
Pioneer Sesquicentennial Spectacular in Cougar Stadium at Brigham Young University.  The
extravaganza, complete with fireworks, light show, music, dance, and song, depicted the journey
of faith of early pioneers.  The stadium was packed with tens of thousands of Church members
celebrating the courage of pioneer forefathers who had sacrificed all for the gospel of Jesus
Christ.  Hearts were touched as each person contemplated the legacy of devotion and
commitment handed down from generation to generation and the responsibility we have now to
take the gospel to all the world.</p>
<p>As the Tabernacle Choir began singing "Faith in Every Footstep," President Bednar
turned to me and said, "Susan, the missionaries are lining up in the corners of the stadium."  I
was incredulous.  Could it really be?  Our son who had been called to serve a mission in Bolivia
was at the MTC.  Would he be there with us?  The audience arose to their feet and cheered in
awe at the scene of 4,000 young men and women missionaries entering the stadium singing
<em>Called to Serve</em>.</p>
<p>	Though we never saw our son that night, this is a portion of the letter we received from
him a few days later:</p>
<p>		Well, last Thursday and Friday nights were by far the highlights of my
MTC experience so far.  The best word I can think of to describe it is "electric." 
It was so incredible to march toward the stadium and see row after row of
missionaries--a sea of white shirts ahead of me and behind me.  I think I have a
little bit of a glimpse of how it felt to march with the 2,000 Sons of Helaman.</p>
<p>		Then, as we walked in and started singing, it was such an incredible
feeling.  I thought of you, Mom, as I saw all those people and tried to imagine
what your reaction was.  I figured you probably got a little weepy, and I did too. 
But I was so excited and so happy to be out there.</p>
<p>	I realized for the first time what an incredible calling we have as
missionaries.  I think the reason people were so excited that we were there is
because we truly are representatives of Christ, taking His gospel to all the world. 
I've always known that, but Thursday and Friday night helped me start to "catch
the vision."</p>
<p>	A football stadium truly was a holy place that night.</p>
<p>The connection between catching the vision of missionary work and standing in holy
places was made by Wilford Woodruff when he proclaimed, "What the Lord requires at the
hands of these Apostles, and Elders and Latter-day Saints is to warn the world, to preach the
Gospel, to build up Zion, to carry out the purposes of the Lord, and to prepare ourselves to stand
in holy places while the judgments of God work in the earth" (Wilford Woodruff, October
Conference, Oct. 9, 1892).</p>
<p>	The home can be a holy place.  President Faust reminds us, "As we recall the
commandment to stand in holy places, we should remember that beyond the temple, the most
sacred and holy places in all the world should be our own dwelling places.  Our homes should be
committed and dedicated only to holy purposes" (James E. Faust, <em>To Reach Even Unto You</em>,
p.&nbsp;83).</p>
<p>	Since our children have grown and matured and left our home, we've started a tradition
during the times we are gathered back together as a family.  At these special times of reunion,
we hold a daily devotional where family members choose the day they would like to share a new
insight they have gained from their own personal scripture study.  What a thrill it has been for us
to see the depth of spiritual insight each child has gained from his own scriptural inquiry.  I must
admit I thought this could never happen as I remember the struggles we've experienced through
the years trying to have meaningful family scripture study.  But these exceptional devotionals
have been the sweet and delicious fruit of our labors.</p>
<p>	President Packer expressed this thought:  "I have always felt that we stand in holy places
when we are given entrance to the hearts of those we teach" (Boyd K. Packer, <em>Teach Ye
Diligently,</em> p. 303).  Gospel discussion in our home has facilitated entrance into each other's
hearts.  We have stood in holy places as we have tutored each other and witnessed the "power of
the word." </p>
<p>	A foreign land can be a holy place.  This past summer Elder Bednar and I had the
opportunity to take my parents with us on a trip to Switzerland.  After attending a most
memorable temple session in the Swiss Temple, we drove just a few kilometers out into the
nearby countryside to explore several tiny alpine villages where our ancestors had lived so long
ago.  I wondered if my great grandfather could have ever imagined a temple of God gracing the
landscape in such close proximity to where he had grown up as a boy.  We contemplated the
commitment and dedication to gospel principles of our ancestors who had forsaken family and
friends, wealth and prosperity, and all they possessed to seek refuge "far away in the West." 
And we could sense we were standing on holy ground.</p>
<p>	Perhaps the most obvious of all the holy places in which we stand is the temple.  Almost
a year ago our immediate family had the opportunity to be together in the celestial room of the
Idaho Falls Temple for the first time, just days before our youngest son left for his mission.  As I
looked into the faces of three worthy sons and a daughter-in-law, I felt so blessed the Lord had
allowed me the opportunity to be their mother.  We felt a bond of love made possible by
covenants that will enable us to be a forever family.  We discussed how the celestial room of a
temple, wherever it might be, would always be a place where we could feel that family
closeness. </p>
<p>	Two weeks after this temple experience we received our first letter from our missionary
son who had just arrived at the Missionary Training Center in Preston, England.  He wrote:</p>
<p>	The Preston Temple is so beautiful both inside and out.  I want you to
know that I am not homesick, but I thought about you while I was in the temple.  I
felt so close to you in the celestial room even though you were so far away.  It
was a special feeling of love and gratitude, and I am grateful the Lord has given
us a place on earth where we can feel like we are back home--and I don't mean
Idaho.</p>
<p>	There is a power associated with ordinances of heaven--even the power
of godliness--which can and will thwart the forces of evil if we will but be
worthy of those sacred blessings. . . .  Our families will be protected, our children
will be safeguarded as we live the gospel, visit the temple, and live close to the
Lord. (President Ezra Taft Benson, Atlanta Georgia Temple Cornerstone Laying,
June 1, 1983).</p>
<p>How grateful we should be for holy temples!</p>
<p>As I conclude with my testimony, I desire to take you back with me to a holy place where
I stood several years ago.  It's a place you may have experienced too--the Sacred Grove.  In the
quiet, peaceful stillness of a beautiful summer day, the Spirit reaffirmed to me once again that
God lives; that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph Smith restored the fullness of the gospel; and that
we are led today by a prophet of God.  May the way we live always reflect our desire to stand in
holy places is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">My brothers and sisters, My husband and I are grateful to be here with President and
Sister Bednar, faculty members and especially you students.  We love to come to this
campus.  Over the years we have been privileged to be here several times but the first
time was many years ago when Elder Eyring was the president of Ricks College.  I
remember the wind whipping through my hair and around my legs as we toured the
campus.  The wind is still here, that hasn't changed.   And there is something else that has
not changed.  Even though the student body has grown, the campus has experienced
remarkable expansion and even the name is different, the warm, welcoming, and uplifting
Spirit that permeates this university is still here.  We are delighted to feel it once again.
		</p>
<p>A few weeks ago while I was in Southern California visiting our daughter and her family,
I was picked up at their home by an airport van.  Usually there are several passengers
traveling, but on this day I was alone with the driver for an hour and a half as we drove up
the beautiful California coast.  The driver was friendly and asked where I was going. I
explained I was going to meet my husband who was speaking at a conference for
religious educators. </p>
<p>The driver seemed interested so I asked him if he had ever heard of the Mormon Church.  
I have to admit that my heart started beating a little faster as I thought about being a
missionary and sharing my testimony.  The driver explained that he didn't really know
much about Mormons except that his older sister had married a man who professed to be
one, but now they were divorced.  I gulped, hoping this would not be "strike one!" I
learned that the driver had grown up in Peru in a Catholic family, but now he attended the
Presbyterian Church with his wife. He acknowledged that he really didn't know much
about any religion.</p>
<p>I explained that in the Mormon Church there were religion classes for college-age people
to help them understand our doctrine and I added that my husband taught such classes at a
university.  And on this very day we would be attending a conference for such teachers in
Southern California.</p>
<p>He finally asked the question I was hoping he would ask.  "What <u>do 
		</u>Mormons believe?"</p>
<p>I ask you my friends. . .What would <u>you</u> have answered?</p>
<p>I knew the driver wasn't looking for a long explanation of doctrine--my response needed
to be short and yet meaningful.</p>
<p>I remembered that as a young Primary girl I had used the fingers on my hand to remind
me of the things I wanted to say when I bore my testimony. Five simple things that would
be easy to understand and would explain what I believed. As we rode along in the van I
looked down at my fingers in my lap to help me remember.</p>
<p>1.	We believe that God is our Father in Heaven and He loves us.</p>
<p>As I answered the driver's sincere question by sharing those five truths, I felt that warm
confirming feeling of the Holy Ghost whisper, "It is true, it is true."</p>
<p>I could tell that the driver sensed how strongly I believed what I shared, because he asked,
"Do all Mormons believe as you do?"</p>
<p>I struggled to answer his question because in my mind I saw many people who are dear to
me, who once believed those truths but who have let the light of their testimony die. I
thought of my college roommate who many years ago was baptized and received the gift
of the Holy Ghost when we were living together in the dorm.  But recently I learned that
she has drifted into inactivity and lost the light she once enjoyed.  I even know returned
missionaries who once were filled with the Holy Ghost and with conviction bore their
testimony every day for 2 years.  But after returning home they neglected to nourish that
precious testimony.  And what inevitably follows?  Little by little, the light that once
illuminated their souls has grown dim.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee said it this way.  "Testimony isn't something that you have today
and you keep always.  Testimony is either going to grow and grow to the brightness of
certainty, or it is going to diminish to nothingness, depending on what we do about it." 
He also said, "Testimony is as elusive as a moonbeam; it's as fragile as an orchid; you
have to recapture it every morning of your life."</p>
<p>After much thought and prayer, I have felt impressed that keeping our testimony alive is
what I would like to speak with you about today. I pray that Holy Ghost will be with me
and with you as we explore together how we might "recapture [our testimony] every
morning of our life" and keep its light burning brightly.</p>
<p><u>A little over a month ago </u>we finished the 2002 Olympic Season.  I imagine that many of
you followed the exciting events as I did.  Over and over we heard --"Light the Fire
Within," which was the Olympic theme. As the Olympic flame was carried across our
country, again and again those dramatic words were repeated "Light the Fire Within." 
Even our 7 year-old grandson wanted to make Olympic gold medal cookies for his
birthday treat for his school class and he wanted me, his Grandma, to write in frosting on
each cookie,  "Light the Fire Within."  I thought about those words as we wrote them
together.</p>
<p>There <u>is</u> a fire that has already been lit in each one of us who believe the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. It is the fire of testimony. The Olympic flame is extinguished at the end of the bi-annual games and is not rekindled for two years.  But we cannot put the light of testimony
away even for a moment. For Satan never sleeps or takes a vacation. He is relentless. The
subtle but alluring temptations of the Adversary are always present, especially at this
crucial time in your life.  He desires to overcome us with darkness and sin. He will do
everything in his power to weaken our testimony. He works ferociously to make truths
seem like error and wrongs feel right because as we read in 2 Nephi 2: 27 . . 
		<em>"he seeketh
that all men might be miserable like unto himself." </em></p>
<p>This, my university friends, is not an abstract concept.  It is personal to each of us.  We all
know someone, male or female, young or old, who has once been on fire with the gospel,
never suspecting that the light could dim or be snuffed out, and yet sadly, they have
succumbed to Satan's enticements and little by little the light has diminished. 
		</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, how is it that someone can at one time know the gospel is
true with conviction and certainty and then later lose that light?</p>
<p>Just as the fingers on one hand reminded me of the testimony I wanted to share, we can
use our other hand to remember five simple things we might do to keep that testimony
alive and growing. This hand will represent our testimony and this hand will represent
what we can do to keep it shining brightly.   Without a doubt, two hands will be better
than one.</p>
<p>When I told the driver that God is our loving Heavenly Father, I explained what is
expressed by our prophets in the Proclamation to the World: that "each of us is a beloved
spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents."</p>
<p>How can we nourish that understanding of who we really are?</p>
<p>May I suggest that we consistently pray to Him with gratitude. When we pray to our
Father with a heart filled with gratitude, we feel more deeply our love for Him. We
acknowledge that He is near, that we are His children and that we need His help. When
we pray and really talk to Him with perfect honesty and sincere gratitude, we can feel 
		<u>His
love</u> <u>for us</u> and we remember our paternal connection to Him. He is our Father.  He loves
us. It is no wonder that boys and girls, men and women, members and non-members, all
over the world are drawn to the words "I am a child of God, and He has sent me here."  In
every language it expresses our divine heritage and reinforces our eternal identity. 
		</p>
<p>As a parent nothing touches me more deeply than to hear my children openly express
their love to me along with their sincere expressions of gratitude. We seem to voice those
feelings naturally when we are very young.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons we are
commanded to become little children. Think about your earthly parents.  How do 
		<u>they</u>
feel when you express your love and gratitude to them?  And how do <u>you</u> feel?  Grateful
expressions between earthly children and their parents strengthen the bonds of love just as
prayers to our Heavenly Father strengthen our eternal connection to Him.</p>
<p>When traveling on assignment in Africa I met many of our brothers and sisters who have
very little in the way of this world's goods.  Some families live in humble one or two
room dwellings, eating mainly the food they grow and living a very simple life.  But
never have I heard more sincere and grateful prayers or met with happier people.</p>
<p>I have a clear memory of a training meeting in Kenya. A member of the Jinja Branch
opened the meeting with prayer.  He began each sentence by addressing Heavenly Father
with the most sincere and simple expressions. </p>
<p>"Father, we thank thee we could all come to this meeting.<br />Father, we thank thee we are strong enough to walk here.<br />Father, we thank thee it did not rain so the roads are dry.<br />Father, we thank thee for sending leaders to teach us.<br />Father, we thank thee we have fresh water to drink for our bodies and our souls.<br />Father, we thank thee we have received the truth from thy messengers." 
			</p>
<p>This good brother went on for several minutes with the most sincere and happy
expressions of thankfulness.  He was not multiplying words but rather his heart was
overflowing with gratitude and he joyfully expressed it.  And it was clear to everyone
present that he knew Heavenly Father was listening.</p>
<p>Many years ago I was challenged to set a timer for 15 minutes and instead of rehearsing
all of my problems and requests to Heavenly Father, I was to only express gratitude for
specific personal blessings in my life.  I was not to ask for anything, but rather to
concentrate on thanking Heavenly Father.  From my own experience, I can witness to you
that such prayers helped me feel closer to my Heavenly Father and gave me a greater
assurance of His love for me.</p>
<p>If you have your scriptures will you turn with me to Doctrine &amp; Covenants 10:5.</p>
<p>This counsel was given to the prophet Joseph Smith when the 116 pages of the translated
Book of Mormon were lost.  Have you ever felt like Joseph must have felt when he knew
that he had disappointed the Lord?  We each experience times when we feel unworthy of
the trust and blessings we have been given. This is when the flame of testimony begins to
flicker. In such situations Satan is ready to step right in and take advantage of our
discouragement and self doubt. He does not want us to pray and ask for reassurance and
help.  But the Lord's counsel to Joseph applies to each one of us.</p>
<p><em>"Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may
conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan
that do uphold his work."</em></p>
<p>If we want to keep our relationship with Heavenly Father alive and meaningful we can
follow the counsel of Amulek  <em>". . . to live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies
and blessings which he doth bestow upon you [us]."</em></p>
<p>Remember President Lee's words, "Testimony is as elusive as a moonbeam; it's as fragile
as an orchid; you have to recapture it every morning of your life."  I know of nothing so
effective in helping to recapture it as beginning and ending each day with a prayer of
gratitude. </p>
<p>The second element of is the knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, our Savior
and Redeemer.  He himself instructs us to always remember Him and keep His
commandments. "And if ye do always remember me" He said, "ye shall have my Spirit to
be with you."  That Spirit keeps our testimony shining brightly.</p>
<p>President Hinckley has told us that Jesus Christ is the central figure in our theology and
our faith. He reminds us, "That, every Latter-day Saint has the responsibility to know for
himself or herself with a certainty beyond doubt that Jesus is the resurrected, living Son
of the living God."</p>
<p>When we remember that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, that understanding
invites us to repent and partake of the Atonement.  We feel hope when we are reminded
of His infinite love for us--love so great that he was willing to give His life for us, that we
might overcome our weaknesses and sins, feel the sweet peace that comes with
forgiveness, and return to His presence.  When we remember Him we want to follow His
example and keep His commandments.  And when we remember Him and what He has
done <u>for us</u> we are more easily able to forgive others. </p>
<p>Elder Ballard reminded us last month in the CES fireside that "Our Sacrament Meetings
belong to the Savior."  This is the sacred time when we renew our baptismal covenant,
and witness to our Heavenly Father that we do always remember His son Jesus Christ and
keep His commandments.</p>
<p>Do we really think about the promise we are about to make as we listen to the Sacrament
Prayer each Sunday? Because it is so familiar to us, it is easy to become distracted and
think about the cute girl sitting two rows in front of us or the interesting boy we met at the
dance last night or the company that is coming after church. </p>
<p>Have you ever calculated the number of times you have heard the Sacrament prayers?  
Let's make a rough approximation by subtracting the age you were when you were
baptized from your current age. Do you have that number in your mind?  Now multiply it
by 100 to represent attending church about 50 weeks a year and hearing two prayers each
time. If you are 19 years old the number will be about 1,100.  When you have heard
something over 1,000 times, can you repeat it?  I can think of some television
commercials that I've heard only a handful of times, but I can't seem to get them out of
my head.</p>
<p>I remember a Sunday School lesson given by Elder Dallin Oaks before he was called to
be an apostle.  He challenged us, his students, to memorize the Sacrament Prayers so that
we could repeat the words in our minds each Sunday during the Sacrament service and
more fully concentrate on the covenant we were making.  Committing the prayers to
memory allowed me to silently say the words in my mind.  This has helped me ponder
how I can more fully remember Him and Keep His commandments.</p>
<p>I believe that when we truly remember Him, we <u>want</u> to keep His commandments and
follow His example. May I share with you the connection President Harold B. Lee made
between the relationship of keeping the commandments and the light we seek. </p>
<p>Jesus said,   "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."  That light--His light--is the light of our testimony.</p>
<p>The next element of testimony pertains to the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith, the
restoration of the Gospel and the translation of the Book of Mormon.  These truths
become more evident and relevant when we regularly study the scriptures. </p>
<p>A Primary song expresses what happens when we earnestly seek to learn from the
scriptures.  The verse says, "I love to read the Holy Scriptures, and every time I do, I feel
the Spirit start to grow within my heart, a testimony that they're true."  Another Primary
song teaches that 'the Holy Ghost testifies of God and Christ and makes our heart
rejoice." We feel their love when we consistently and prayerfully read the scriptures and
experience the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Our son Mitchell is serving a mission in England.  In a recent letter he recounted that
while standing at a bus stop, a man from Africa excitedly approached them.  The man
said that before moving to England he had met missionaries in Uganda so he recognized
their nametags.  The missionaries in Uganda had taught him twice before he moved to
England.  When he saw the familiar nametags on our son and his companion, he blurted
out this question. "Do you have the book?"  They were not quite certain what he meant. 
But he  explained that the missionaries in Uganda had read to him from a very profound
book.  He knew the words  in the book were true and he wanted to learn more.  He was
thrilled to receive his own copy of the Book of Mormon.  He held the book with
tenderness and reverence and promised to read it that very night. </p>
<p>This true seeker from Uganda responded to the Book of Mormon just as the prophet
Joseph Smith envisioned many years ago, when he said,</p>
<p><em>"I pray that the Lord may enable you to treasure these things in your
mind, for I know that His Spirit will bear testimony to all who seek
diligently after knowledge from Him. I hope you will search the
Scriptures. . ."</em></p>
<p>Our present prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley said, <em>"You may think you are too busy.  Ten or
fifteen minutes a day with the scriptures, and particularly with the Book of Mormon, can
give you marvelous understanding of the great eternal truths which have been preserved
by the power of the Almighty for the blessing of His children." </em></p>
<p>He further said, <em>"I promise you that if you will read the words of that writing which we
call scripture, there will come into your heart an understanding and a warmth that will
be pleasing to experience. . . .  Let the Lord speak for himself to you, and his words will
come with a quiet conviction that will make the words of his critics meaningless."</em></p>
<p>Studying the scriptures every day nourishes our testimony and invites the Spirit into our
life.</p>
<p>The fourth element of testimony that I shared with the van driver is that The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's true church on the earth.  Before we were
baptized we were taught the account of Joseph Smith when he was told by the Savior that
he should join none of the existing churches. He was instructed to restore the true gospel
and establish the Lord's church on the earth.  <u>It is my conviction </u>that in order to keep this
knowledge of the true church alive, we need to attend our church meetings, participate in
the programs, and serve in the kingdom.</p>
<p>I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom on the
earth. This marvelous organization was established on the principles that the Lord himself
laid down when he lived on the earth. </p>
<p>The familiar song says, "No man is an island."  It <u>is</u> hard to stand alone.  We need the
help of one another.  And that comes most naturally when we attend church together and
serve one another. The accumulation of the experiences we have in a gospel setting
deepens our sense of the divine origin and greatness of the Lord's Kingdom on the earth.</p>
<p>I grew up in an area where there were very few members of the church.  My brother and I
and a handful of others were the only members of the church in our large high school. 
We had many good friends who did not belong to the Church.  We enjoyed participating
in school and community activities.  But I always remembered the counsel in my
patriarchal blessing, which said,  "Be wise in choosing your companions.  Choose to
associate with those who have high ideals and who, with you, will strive to keep the
commandments of the Lord."</p>
<p>Though attendance at church is not a sure guarantee, activity in the church does provide
an opportunity for us to meet associates who feed our testimony.  And when we
participate, our testimony can help to strengthen theirs.</p>
<p>You may know that Elder Neal A. Maxwell ran as one of the official Olympic
torchbearers. Dressed in the designated white running suit, he carried the lighted torch
down North Temple to the Church Administration Building.  That evening was very cold
and as he rounded the corner the flame of his torch went out. The officials who attended
the runners quickly retrieved the little metal box that carried the fire that had been lit in
Greece. Immediately the flame was re-ignited and Elder Maxwell lifted the torch and
continued his run. Fortunately the Olympic support team was ready and waiting for just
such an emergency.</p>
<p>So it is with our brothers and sisters in the Church.  Our leaders, home and visiting
teachers, quorum members and Relief Society sisters are our extended support group. 
They too are close by, willing and eager to help us keep our flame of testimony burning. 
It is not an accident that we have the opportunity <u>every</u> week to come together to worship,
sing hymns, renew our covenants, be strengthened and uplifted by the Spirit and serve
one another.</p>
<p>In addition to attending our meetings, it is important to accept responsibilities and serve
in the Lord's Kingdom.  Sometimes we may feel that we are not ready or that we do not
have the time to accept assignments.  But I want to assure you that there are few, if any,
who have ever felt fully prepared and adequate to the responsibility when they accepted a
call to serve. But if we humbly accept callings from our priesthood leaders, and seek help
from the Lord through earnest prayer, and then give our very best efforts to fulfill our
assignments, we will feel the Spirit support us, magnify us and fill our hearts with an
awareness of the Lord's love and appreciation for our trying.</p>
<p>President Hinckley said, "(We) will not grow strong in the faith without exercise.  Faith
and testimony are like the muscles of my arm. If I use those muscles and nourish them,
they grow stronger.  If I put my arm in a sling and leave it there, it becomes weak and
ineffective." And so it is with testimonies.  Serving in the Lord's kingdom strengthens our
spiritual muscles.</p>
<p>The last part of my testimony that I shared with my driver friend, was my witness that this
church is led by a prophet of God who receives revelation for all of God's children.</p>
<p>This testimony is kept alive by simply following the living prophet. 
		</p>
<p>In one of our favorites hymns we sing, "We Thank Thee O God for a Prophet, to guide us
in these latter days."  I am thankful for a latter-day prophet who seeks to know the will of
the Lord, and when he receives that knowledge he shares it with us.  I appreciate a living
prophet who is not afraid to give us guidance and instruct us to correct our course. I
believe the words of the Savior found in D &amp;C 21:4-6.  Speaking of the prophet, he
commanded us:</p>
<p><em>. . .thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments
which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness
before me;</em></p>
<p><em>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all
patience and faith.  </em></p>
<p><em>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against
you. .</em></p>
<p>If the Savior himself asked us to avoid tattoos, and wearing more than one pair of
earrings, would we listen and obey?  The Lord has told us that the words of his living 
prophet are as if from his own mouth. </p>
<p>Last year Primary children around the world practiced a song about prophets.  You may
have heard the last verse:</p>
<p>"Now we have a world where people are confused.<br />If you don't believe it, go and watch the news.<br />We can get direction all along our way,<br />If we heed the prophets--follow what they say."</p>
<p>When we heed the living prophet and follow what he says, our testimony of his divine
direction is strengthened and we know that he is the servant the Lord himself has
appointed to lead us.</p>
<p>I grew up in Southern California.  Our family lived about an hour from the Pacific Ocean. 
I love the beach. I loved swimming in the ocean and riding the waves.  I have happy
memories of running over the hot sand, dodging umbrellas tilted to shade the sun, and
jumping across outstretched beach towels as we hurried from the car to the water.  We
could hardly wait to get to the firm wet sand that had been wiped smooth by the foaming
waves.  We eagerly anticipated splashing through the shallow ripples and then diving into
the cold dark water.  But always as we ran-we looked up at the tall white wood tower
where the life guard sat as the watchman. </p>
<p>The lifeguard had a chair shaded by an umbrella, on the top of the stand.  From that
vantage point and with his experience, the lifeguard could assess the condition of the sea. 
It was his responsibility to warn swimmers about the safety of the ocean.  He did this by
hoisting a flag.  If the flag at the top of the pole was blue, we knew that the water was
safe for swimming, but if the flag was red, we knew that there was a dangerous under tow
or rip tide and the ocean was not safe for swimmers. </p>
<p>My parents told us many stories of people who had been drowned in a rip tide or
undertow and they impressed upon us the foolishness of ignoring the lifeguard's caution. 
When we got older we often went to the beach with our friends, our parents were not
there.  They had taught us to follow the caution of the lifeguard. But the lifeguard was not
a policeman.  He was not there to enforce a law--he was only there to warn us.  We were
free to heed the warning or ignore it.</p>
<p>So it is with our prophet.  President Gordon B. Hinckley is the watchman on the tower. 
But unlike the lifeguard at the beach--our prophet does not rely on his own wisdom to
give us direction and warning. He receives revelation from the Lord and he passes that
information on to us. He warns us of the dangerous currents and deadly tides yet we are
free to heed his counsel or foolishly ignore it.   Every summer when I was young we
heard of someone who lost their life because they failed to heed the lifeguard's warning. 
I know we jeopardize our spiritual life and threaten our testimony if we fail to follow 
		<u>our</u>
watchman, the living prophet.</p>
<p>In college I had a friend who didn't know anything about our church.  I told her there was
a prophet on the earth who received revelation for his people.  She quizzically said, "Oh
really?" And then without hesitating she asked, "What has he told <u>you</u>?"  I was caught off
guard. But I vowed right then that I would learn what our prophet has told us.  This is
how I would answer her today.</p>
<p>He has told us to get out of debt.<br />He has urged us to pay an honest tithing.<br />He has encouraged us to seek education.<br />He has pled with us to reach out in love and kindness to all people.<br />He has asked us to be honest in all our dealings.</p>
<p>In just a few days we will be privileged to listen to our prophet in general
gonference.  I
urge you to be in a place where you can hear his words and the words of our leaders. And
then when their messages are printed in the Ensign, study them again and pray for the
confirming witness of the Spirit so that you will know of their truthfulness.  I can promise
that if you will listen to their counsel and earnestly follow it, your testimony of their
divine calling will be strengthened.</p>
<p>As students this is an exciting time in your life. It is one of the best times and one of the
hardest.  You are reading and listening, learning, trying out theories and testing.  It must
also be a time for faith and believing.</p>
<p>Let's review what we believe-- will you test yourself?</p>
<p>Recently our son who is serving as a Bishop received a late night call requesting that he
visit a man who was in deep trouble. The man had recently made some serious errors in
judgment that had precipitated trouble with the law and now he was in the hospital
seeking help. Though our son had known the man for sometime, he had not seen him for
several months.  When our son approached the hospital bed he saw a man whose
countenance had changed.  He had lost the light he once enjoyed.  As they talked together
our son asked, "When you made the choices that have caused you to be in this sad
situation were you praying each day?  "No," he sadly answered.  "When did you last read
your scriptures?"  With downcast eyes he said, "I guess I haven't read them in over a
year."  "Have you been attending church?"  "No, I have been much too busy."</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, can we be <u>too</u> busy to do the things that will keep our
testimony alive and well? You may think that your college days are <u>more</u> than filled with
significant papers to write, critical tests to pass, jobs to do, people to meet and places to
go. But there will never be a time in your life when it is more crucial to nurture your
testimony. For it is your testimony that will light your path back to Heavenly Father.  It is
one of the very few things that we will take with us when we leave this earth. It is not our
college diploma, not our dating record, not our wardrobe or our 20 inch biceps, but rather
the precious knowledge we have kept alive by praying each day, renewing our covenants,
keeping the commandments, studying the scriptures, attending our meetings and serving
in the kingdom.</p>
<p>When you are waiting for class to begin or you are walking home or just sitting in the
library, look down at your hands, use your fingers to take a personal inventory. On one
hand think about your testimony, and on the other, think about what you are doing right
now to keep it vital and alive.</p>
<p>I recognize that many who need encouragement probably are not here today. Perhaps you
have a roommate, or a sister or a brother or a cousin who has started to drift away from
the light.  Sometimes we feel helpless when see others making choices that will lead them
away from the testimony they once had.  Your example is probably the most important
help you can give. But will you do one more thing?  Will you ask your Heavenly Father to
help you find a way to bear your witness to them?  For when you do, the Holy Ghost will
cause the light to burn more brightly in you and perhaps you can help to rekindle the light
in their heart.  It may be a phone call expressing your love for them and assuring them
that Heavenly knows and loves them too.  Or maybe you will feel prompted to invite
them to go with you to an event or place where the Spirit of the Lord will be invited. 
		</p>
<p>I probably am not as creative as you are and I know I am not as creative as the Holy
Ghost.  He can guide you and prompt you to know how to reach out to someone who
needs your help.  We can be His emissaries of light if we are willing to seek his direction
and courageous enough to follow it. Someday you may  find yourself riding along with
someone who wants to know what you believe.  I have sent more material to the van
driver but I do not know the end of his story. But this I do know. Whenever we share our
testimony and bear our witness of the Savior, the light <u>within us</u> shines brighter than
before.</p>
<p>I bear my witness to you that Heavenly Father lives, that Jesus is the Christ.  He stands at
the head of this church, and He is our Savior and Redeemer. I know that through the
Prophet Joseph Smith the gospel was restored and the Book of Mormon was translated.  I
know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's church on the
earth and we are privileged to be members. I know that we are led by a prophet today who
receives revelation from God.  I know President Gordon B. Hinckley loves you, the
Savior loves you and your Heavenly Father loves you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">In preparing for this devotional, I have been thinking a lot about my own days in school.  I loved
being in school.  I loved being a student.  I trust that you understand what a wonderful part of
your life this is.  I hope you treasure every day, every week, and I hope that you would never have
the attitude, "I can't wait to be finished with school".  That would be unfortunate.  Remember,
"Live this day-today is the very life of life".  Too many students are looking for a better set of
circumstances to really be happy.  Don't wait for a different time of life when you have
graduated, when you are engaged or when you live in a place where the winters are warm.  Don't
fall prey to the "things will be better when" syndrome.  School is wonderful.  Graduation will
have its' own challenges.  George Plimpton, in a talk given to the Harvard Seniors in 1977, said
"Stop now.  Tell them you won't go.  Go back to your rooms.  Unpack!"  So-enjoy every
day-live this day-these are golden days. </p>
<p>This item once appeared in the lost and found column of a small Midwestern newspaper:  "Lost
dog-brown fur.  Some missing due to mange.  Blind in one eye.  Deaf.  Lame leg due to recent
traffic accident.  Slightly arthritic.  Goes by the name Lucky."  You are "lucky" to be here.  This
is true.  However, BYU-Idaho is much luckier to have you here.  This is true!  Just look at who
you are.</p>
<p>You are literally a son or daughter of God.  That is reality.  In other words, we might say that you
have a sort of spiritual DNA that is divine within you.  That is your true nature.  Furthermore, we
know that you were among the most faithful and valiant in the pre-existence.  That is clear from a
proper understanding of the scriptures and statements of modern prophets.</p>
<p>Therefore, your spirits know what it is like to be in the company of God and Christ and to be
righteous, honorable, and virtuous.</p>
<p>That is one reason, by the way, why, for you, wickedness never can be happiness.  You know too
much to be happy or comfortable with any degree of sin or wickedness.</p>
<p>Yes, you know too much.  Your spirits have experienced too much to be happy with anything
less than total honesty, total virtue, and total integrity.  You will not be comfortable and at peace
inside with anything less because of who you are.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have your freedom.  You are bright.  You are healthy.  Your potential is
unlimited.  What a magnificent foundation for achievement.  Yes-BYU-Idaho is indeed lucky to
have you.</p>
<p>With that promising pedigree, it is surprising to me that so many students lack confidence in
themselves.  It is surprising that so many of you don't understand how good you really are.</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson said <em>"What lies behind you</em> (in other words, mistakes that you may have
made in the past) <em>and what lies ahead of you</em> (in other words challenges that may lie ahead) 
		<em>pale
beside what lies inside of you."</em></p>
<p>In thinking about my own college experience I have thought about what was going on inside of
me when I was where you are.  I believe I spent way too much time worrying about my own
abilities, my mistakes, the long-term future, and even what was going to happen to me tomorrow. 
I was fearful about a good many things.  I hope that you are better than I was, but I believe that
too many of you worry that someone else is smarter, better looking or just plain better than you.  I
felt that way.</p>
<p>I believe that too many of us let fear influence our feelings about who we are and about what we
are capable of accomplishing.  This isn't right.  This isn't healthy.  This isn't as the Lord intends. 
In 2 Timothy 1:7, the Lord says "For God hath <u>not</u> given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of
love and of a sound mind."</p>
<p>God has not given us the spirit of fear-it comes from another source.  And, the Lord has said that
there is no need for us to fear.</p>
<p>Some of you may be fearful, for example, about past mistakes:  "How good am I really if I do
things like that" you say to yourself.</p>
<p>Some of you worry about your ability to handle future challenges that you see on the horizon and
this makes some of you fearful.</p>
<p>Now brothers and sisters there are serious challenges and significant trials that may come along. 
These are real.  I understand how some of you might have some fearful moments.  We don't
know for sure what is around the corner.  Uncertainty is indeed part of the fabric of life.</p>
<p>One of the greatest adventures that I have had was riding a raft on a five day trip through the
Grand Canyon.  I was fascinated by the wild scenery, the awesome rapids and the whole
adventure of it all.  I was also very interested as we traveled through the canyon to read excerpts
from the diary of John Wesley Powell, who lost his arm in the Civil War and was the first man in
modern times to take a boat through the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>One of the excerpts from his diary, dated August 13, 1869, portrays his apprehension about what
lay ahead, but in truth is not a bad summary of the uncertainty that is a part of 
		<u>all</u> of our lives.  He
wrote, <em>"We are now ready to start on our way down the great unknown.  We have got a month's
rations remaining.  We have an unknown distance yet to run, an unknown river to explore.  With
some eagerness, some anxiety and some misgiving we enter the canyon below and are carried
along by the swift water."</em></p>
<p>Isn't that a pretty good description of life.  We have some eagerness and we have some anxiety
and we really don't know what is up around the next bend.  It is a frightening experience to be on
a raft in a canyon and hear the low powerful roar of what you know are going to be huge rapids
just around the next canyon bend.  One of the rapids "the Crystal Rapids" had a 40 foot standing
wave at the time we ran it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rapids we encounter are of our own doing-and at other times the Lord gives us
rapids that Elder Neal Maxwell calls "customized tutorials" to help us grow in certain ways.  And
sometimes, the rapids are simply a result of being in the midst of mortality.</p>
<p>A psychiatrist friend of mine described life this way "We come from a climate controlled,
warmly cushioned womb where we are fully protected and every need is met automatically. 
From which we are thrust out rudely into a cold, harsh world where the first thing that hits us is a
firm slap on the fanny and from thence forth we have to fight for our own air.  Many of us spend
the rest of our lives with our thumb and blanket in hand, wandering around looking for a place to
plug in our umbilical cord."</p>
<p>As we face some of the harsh realities of life and the real obstacles that are there for us to
overcome, we often make matters much worse by imagining difficulties that never materialize. 
We are afraid of what might happen in the future, but it is unproductive to spend time fretting
and worrying about what "might" go wrong.  I love the story of Abraham Lincoln and the Fox
River.  Abraham Lincoln, as a young lawyer, was traveling through Southern Illinois on the
circuit.  In his own words, he tells the story "Many years ago when I was a young lawyer and
Illinois was little settled, I and other lawyers used to ride the circuit; from county seat to county
seat in quest of business.  Once after a long spell of pouring rain which had flooded the whole
country, transforming small creeks into rivers, we were often stopped by the swollen streams
which we with difficulty crossed.  Still ahead of us was the Fox River, larger than all the rest, and
we could not help saying to each other, if these streams give us so much trouble how shall we get
over Fox River?  Darkness fell before we had reached that stream and we all stopped at a log
tavern, had our horses put out, and resolved to pass the night.  Here we were right glad to fall in
with Methodists' presiding elder of the circuit who rode it in all weather, knew all its' ways and
could tell us about Fox River.  So we all gathered around him and asked him if he knew about
the crossing of Fox River.  Oh yes he replied, I know all about Fox River.  I have crossed it often
and I understand it well.  But, I have one fixed rule with regard to Fox River.  I never cross it
until I reach it."</p>
<p>Good advice.</p>
<p>Some of us are afraid of failure.  Donald Kennedy, a former President of Stanford, said at
commencement in 1986,<em> "Nothing is so corrosive to the spirit, nothing is so discouraging to the
development of human potential, as the fear of failure.  And conversely, nothing is so liberating
as the knowledge that failure and its most feared consequences are not so very dangerous to
your health after all.  That is the most reassuring single bit of experience that I have to share
with you.  Please believe it because more than any other single attribute, controlling the fear of
failure will allow you to control your destiny.  So, go for it."</em></p>
<p><em>"Wherefore be of good cheer and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will
stand by you..."</em>  (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 68:6)</p>
<p>President Kennedy also said, "Believe firmly in your own excellence"-Actually, he said 
		<em>"Believe
firmly in your own excellence-but keep it strictly to yourself."</em>  Confidence in yourself is a
wonderful trait.  It will help you to avoid the fear of failure.</p>
<p>I went to school with a young man who taught me a great lesson about self-confidence.  He was
not the smartest person in the class by any means.  He was not the hardest working member of
the class.  He had fun and I think probably wasted some time like the rest of us did.  But, he had
wonderful self-confidence.  I recall one day he said to me "Larry, if I don't believe I can do it-if I
do not have confidence in myself-how can I expect others to believe in me and have confidence
in me."  This student, who did not start out as a brilliant academician-went on to an outstanding
career in Academic Medicine, became Dean of the school and has risen to a very high office in
the church-a sign of the confidence that the Lord has in his abilities.</p>
<p>So, overcoming fear has a lot to do with building confidence in yourself.   
		<em>"Therefore be ye
strong from henceforth.  Fear not for the kingdom is yours."</em>  (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 38:15)</p>
<p>Don't feel sorry for yourself if you have a few trials and a few setbacks along the way.  It will
make you better.  If you realize what the Savior went through-a sinless man who never hurt
anyone and who never said anything wrong, but suffered the most incredible persecution and
torture-none of us ever have the right to say, "I don't deserve this."</p>
<p>And, don't compare yourself with others.  They may have had more or less opposition, more or
less trial, more or fewer hurdles than you.  Your mission is different than theirs.  Life is a
mission, not a career.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you two of the best ways I have learned in my life to build confidence
in yourself and overcome your fears.  (1)  I remember Dave Bennion.  He and I used to double
date in college.  We had some wonderful outings to the beach where we would make homemade
ice cream or to eat at Fisherman's Wharf .  Once after a double date, Dave pulled me aside and
said-not in any way boasting, "When I come home from a date it is a wonderful feeling to look
myself in the mirror and know that I have kept the standards of morality.  It is a great feeling
inside to know there has been no problem in crossing the line-that I am clearly on solid ground. 
It feels good just to look myself in the mirror and know that there are no problems with morality
and chastity."</p>
<p>Remember Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly -- then
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God".  This is a principle with a promise.</p>
<p>Thank heavens for the Dave Bennions of the world.</p>
<p>One of the most damaging ideas of our current culture is the idea that everyone is doing it, so it is
really all right.</p>
<p>Set your own standards -- don't let anyone else set them for you.  You are different!  You are the
salt of the earth.  How does the salt lose its' savor?  When it stops being different.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales said in an article in the February Ensign, <em>"As Latter-day Saints, we need
not look like the world.  We need not entertain like the world.  Our personal habits should be
different.  Our recreation should be different."</em></p>
<p>You have heard the story of the young man who said to the young woman "If you would lower
your standards I would go out with you."  She replied, "If I went out with you I would be
lowering my standards."</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin said "There are those who fear more the being out of fashion than being in
hell."</p>
<p>Remember, you know what it is like to live in celestial mansions.  You will never be content in
the shack of "everyone else is doing it".</p>
<p>So, personal virtue and maintaining high moral standards, I believe, is essential to self-confidence and overcoming fear.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that personal honesty is critical to your own sense of confidence, and
overcoming fear.</p>
<p>Early in my freshman year in college, I was feeling somewhat lost and inferior and sat down and
put together a list of the people I admired most.  As I looked at that list of the people I really
looked up to and tried to think about what character traits that they might have that I might
emulate, I came to the conclusion that the one most prominent common denominator among all
these people I admired was personal honesty!  We don't like to be around people who are
dishonest.  And, how can we like ourselves and feel confident about ourselves if we are not
honest inside.  Dishonesty brings about fear and then mistrust in personal relationships.  Being
honest builds confidence and self-esteem.  To feel good inside-to like what we see inside-to
have self-esteem and not be afraid of the future-we must be honest.</p>
<p>I remember an experience at the passport office in Dallas.  I needed a passport and didn't really
have time to go to the passport office, so I tried to squeeze a trip in during lunch hour.  I raced to
the passport office and was disappointed to see a long line.  I decided that I could save time by
filling out the application while I was standing in line.  I filled it out completely and was aware
that the line as moving fast enough that I was going to get my passport application certified and
get back to the office on time.  There was one blank that I had difficulty with.  It said "Write in
the name and phone number of someone who should be reached in case of emergency."  I had
already written in pen my brother's name, but realized that I didn't have his phone number with
me.  Fearing that an empty blank would prevent a faithful government employee from giving me
my passport I took my best guess at the number without a great deal of confidence that it was true
-and prepared to pay my money and hand in the application.  After all, nothing was going to
happen to me on the trip anyway.  All went well until the passport clerk took my money and said,
"Please raise your right hand.  Do you swear that everything on this application is completely
true."  I had a deep feeling of discomfort in the pit of my stomach.  I looked her in the eye and
replied ,"Everything is true except my brother's phone number."  She said "what."  I said I am not
sure my brother's phone number is correct.  I didn't have it with me so I guessed.  She burst out
laughing and called the other clerks and said, "Hey you have to hear this."  They all had a good
laugh.  The phone number was whited out and I did have my application approved.</p>
<p>You may have heard the story of the two medical students who took a long weekend to go off
together and study for a final.  Studying took a backseat to the fun they were having and
eventually they headed back for campus realizing that not only hadn't they studied a bit, but they
were going to be late for the final.  The two of them concocted a good story and then went to see
the professor.  They explained that they had been studying hard, away from campus, but they had
a flat tire on the way home.  They found they were without a jack, were unable to get help and
thus were late for the final.  Would it be all right for them to take the final in a few days?  The
professor thought carefully and then agreed that it would be all right.</p>
<p>At the agreed time he met the two medical students and put them in separate rooms with the test
booklets.  The first student turned over the first page.  First question, 5 points, name the two
branches of the left main coronary artery.  The student thought-this going to be easy-left anterior
descending and circumflex.  He turned over the page.  Second question, 95 points, "Which tire."</p>
<p>Keep your word.  Do what you say you will do.  This will build your self-confidence.  Sir
Thomas Moore said, <em>"When a man takes an oath, he is holding his own self in his own hands like
water.  And if he opens his fingers, then he needn't hope to find himself again."</em></p>
<p>So, be virtuous.  And, be honest.  And, if you do that, there is no need to be afraid and there is no
need to fear.  Do not let fear cloud your confidence and your vision.</p>
<p><em>"Fear not little children for you are mine and I have overcome the
world and you are of them that my father hath given me."&nbsp; </em>Doctrine &amp; Covenants 50:41&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chastity and honesty are two of the most important commandments, not only because they are
critical in building our self-confidence and self-esteem, but because they affect 
		<u>others</u> so deeply
if we do not live them.</p>
<p>But in reality, because of who you are, the only way for you to overcome your fears and be
confident and at peace inside of you is to live all of the commandments.  Not living the
commandments brings a deep insecurity.</p>
<p>The only true security in life comes from living the commandments.</p>
<p>Self-esteem, self-confidence, success, and happiness are all built on this simple foundation of
living the commandments.  In July of 1972, there was a single adult conference held in Denton,
Texas.  President Joseph Fielding Smith taped a message on Friday to be delivered at the
conference on Monday.  He died between Friday and Monday.  Thus, these are some of the last
words that he ever spoke in mortality.  I think that they carry tremendous wisdom.  "Now my
young friends, as I stand at the edge of eternity I want you to know that in my years on the earth I
have found great joy and happiness.  I have tried all my life to be a humble servant to the Divine
Master and to keep His commandments.  This has brought transcending happiness into my life.
As his shepherd, I counsel you to be obedient.  Keep the commandments."</p>
<p>And, then this counsel from President Heber J. Grant-even more firm.  
		<em>"There is but one path of
safety to the Latter Day Saint, and it is the path of duty.  It is not a testimony, it is not a
marvelous manifestation, it is not knowing that the gospel is true, that it is the true plan of
salvation.  It is not actually knowing that the Savior is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was
His prophet that will save you and me; but it is the keeping of the commandments of God, living
the life of the Latter Day Saint.  It is not a testimony, it is conversion!"</em></p>
<p>I am old enough that when I went on a mission all the missionaries were set apart by general
authorities.  A newly ordained apostle who had just been called to the Quorum of the Twelve in
October Conference of that year put his hands on my head and said among other things, "There
will be clouds-but the sun will come out."  When I am faced with another patch of dark clouds
on the horizon I am always grateful for that personal blessing and reminder given by Elder
Gordon B Hinckley.  The sun will come out.  There will certainly be times when things look
dark, but that is an opportunity to build your faith.  Without a little bit of darkness there is no
opportunity to build faith.  Remember, some uncertainty is part of the plan.  President Packer
said <em>"Faith, to be faith, must center around something that is not known.  Faith, to be faith, must
go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence.  Faith, to be faith, must go into the
unknown.  Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of the light and then a few steps into the
darkness."</em></p>
<p>Now back to 2 Timothy 1:7</p>
<p><em>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a
sound mind."</em></p>
<p>The most important reason we have no need to fear is because of the atonement.  We need not
fear physical death.  Because of the atonement, all of us will be resurrected.  No one will remain
in the grave.  And, we have no need to fear spiritual death.  Un-repented sin leads to spiritual
death which is a separation of our spirits from God.  Because of the Atonement, we can be as
clean and pure as the day of our baptism as we repent and partake worthily of the sacrament.  We
have no need, therefore, to fear sin or evil.</p>
<p>These verses from 2 Nephi chapter 9 give us great confidence in the future.</p>
<p><em>"Oh how great the goodness of our God who prepareth a way for our escape from
the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster death and hell, which I call the
death of the body and also the death of the spirit.  (i.e. physical and spiritual
death)</em></p>
<p><em>And because of the way of the deliverance of our God, the holy One of Israel, this
death of which I have spoken which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead;
which death is the grave.</em></p>
<p><em>And this death of which I have spoken which is the spiritual death, shall deliver
up its' dead which spiritual death is hell; wherefor death and hell must deliver up
their dead and hell must deliver up its' captive spirits and the grave must deliver
up its' captive bodies and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to
another and it is by the power of the resurrection of the holy one of Israel."&nbsp;
			</em>2 Nephi 9:10-12</p>
<p>And, we need not fear poor health or physical disability because of the atonement.  Alma 40:23</p>
<p><em>"The soul shall be restored to the body and the body to the soul.  Yea and every
limb and joint shall be restored to its' body; yea even a hair of the head shall not
be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame."</em></p>
<p>I know that the atonement is a reality.  I know that Christ has overcome physical death and
spiritual death.</p>
<p>Last year we went to Israel.  My wife was talking to one of her Jewish friends before we left. 
They were talking about some of the sites in Israel.  The friend said, "Even though I am Jewish I
did see some of the Christian sites in Jerusalem.  For example, I saw the place where Jesus is
buried."  Something inside my wife literally shouted in objection, but she answered calmly "He
isn't buried there anymore.  He isn't there."</p>
<p>We visited the empty tomb in the garden.  It is empty-He is not there-He has risen.  I know that
not because I have visited the garden tomb, but I know that because of a thousand sweet, sure,
confirmations through the Holy Ghost.  I do know that Jesus Christ lives and he is who he said he
is, the Son of God. I leave you that witness and a fervent plea to always remember who you really
are, and how good you really are, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">I want to thank President Bednar for this privilege to speak to you this day, and I want to assure
you that as I look over this large audience in this building and realize there are many in overflow
locations, I feel the overwhelming responsibility that is mine, to say something of worth.  I hope
that you will pray for me so that I can speak by the Spirit and that you can hear by the Spirit.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I want all of you to know how much I appreciate and love President Bednar. 
Like the sons of Helaman, he lives all aspects of his life "with exactness" and is an excellent
example to all of us.  He desires only the best for all who are associated with this great
institution, particularly you students.  His wife Susan's influence is also playing a very important
role in what this institution is becoming.</p>
<p>It has been noted that my dear wife Bonnie is here with me today as well. I want to 
		<u>pay tribute</u> to
her for her support in the many years of our marriage.  We met on a blind date on this campus
some 41 years ago, and it's been a wonderful 41 years. We will be celebrating our fortieth
anniversary this summer.  I am grateful for five wonderful children, four daughters and one son,
and for their spouses and soon-to-be 10 grandchildren.  All five of our children, four of whom are
married, attended this institution, and four completed their associate degrees as has one son-in-law and one daughter-in-law.  I also appreciate my brother Dick, who teaches in the Art
Department, for being here today.</p>
<p>This institution has been an integral part of my life for forty-six years since I was a freshman
student here.  I still pinch myself each morning to see if I am awake to determine if this
wonderful experience is real.  I've told my wife on more than one occasion that since I have had
my paradise experience working here, I wonder what awaits me in the next life?  This institution
certainly has brought great blessings into my life and to my family, and I'm sure most of you feel
the same as I do about your experience here at this university.</p>
<p>It's been several months since I was asked to speak to you, and I've thought of any topics that I
might address with you this afternoon that may be of value to you.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we all know that life is full of choices, and that is the topic I want to talk to
you about today.  Sister Ballard recently addressed the topic of <em>making correct choices</em> during
Women's Weekend and did so very well.  I hope you will bear with me as I add some additional
thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>You have made many choices that have resulted in your being here this very day.  Obviously,
most of you have been pretty good students and took your high school studies seriously or you
wouldn't be here.  Most of you have completed four years of seminary where you learned much
and gained testimonies of the gospel.  You chose to be active in church, which enabled you to
receive a bishop's endorsement to be admitted to this institution.  You also made a choice to
abide by the Honor Code or you wouldn't have been allowed to come.  Now that you are here,
you can choose to live by that personal commitment, which will allow you to stay here, and most
of you will.  I'm sure during your growing up years you have made wrong choices that have
required you to use the gift of repentance in your life to correct mistakes you have made.  I know
I have not always made right choices, and I'm so grateful for the atoning sacrifice of our Savior,
which makes it possible for me to correct those mistakes.</p>
<p>You are young and have many decisions to make in your future, and I pray that you will live
close to the Spirit so that He can help you make wise decisions when it comes time to decide to
serve a mission, particularly you young men who have not served as well some of us older folks
like my wife and I who may soon have the time to commit additional service to the Lord.  The
Spirit can assist you in choosing a spouse or in choosing a major in school in preparation for life. 
You need the Spirit to help you in all decisions that are in your future.  The most important
decision will be the choice to live the commandments of God.</p>
<p>The scriptures are replete with statements that tell us that we are free agents and that we can
choose for ourselves.  2 Nephi 2:16--<em>"Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act
for himself</em>Â…vs. 27 <em>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them
which are expedient unto man.  And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the
great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and deathÂ…."</em>  Hel. 14:30 
		<em>"And remember,
remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth
iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for
behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free."</em>  We read in the D&amp;C
29:36 that one third of the host of heaven used their gift of agency to choose death and follow the
plan of Satan.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you some personal experiences to illustrate the importance of making
right choices.  As a youth I was not a member of the Church, but I was raised in a very religious
home.  Dad was a minister and, of course, the Bible was very important to him and my mother. 
Dad passed away when I was four, leaving Mom the challenge of raising six of seven children
who were still at home.  In her efforts to teach us religious values, Mom would conduct, from
time to time, her own version of family home evening in our home.  I can remember when she
bought an old upright piano.  She had learned to play somewhat in her youth, and at times she
would gather us around this old upright piano and we would sing some of our family's favorite
protestant hymns such as <em>What a Friend We Have in Jesus, The Old Rugged Cross, Bringing in
the Sheaves</em>, and many more.  At times when I hear these hymns on the radio my memory drifts
back many years to those nostalgic moments when we gathered like chicks around a mother hen
while Mom played that old upright and we would belt out, not necessarily in harmony, those old
protestant gospel hymns.</p>
<p>At other times she would read Bible stories to us.  One of my favorites was the story of Jonah
and the whale.  At that time it was just a fun and exciting story without a lot of meaning, but
since I have read it several times with greater understanding and can see the application of the
story in my life.  To me, the story of Jonah is a story of making right choices.  Hopefully we will
start making correct choices early so we don't have to suffer some of the consequences of being
swallowed by a whale or something of equal significance to get us pointed in the right direction. 
You may want to turn to the Book of Jonah found on page 1147 of the Old Testament.  As you
can see, it is a very short book comprised of only four chapters.  I would suggest you to read it
sometime in its entirety.</p>
<p>In verse two in chapter one we see that Jonah is called to go to the great city of Ninevah to preach
the gospel to a people who have been described, according to some authors I have read, as a
rather rough and tough people who had a terrible reputation for being cruel.  Jonah, probably
knowing this, decided he did not want to follow the words of the song we often sing at
missionary farewells, <em>"I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,"</em> but rather decided he would
run from the Lord.  As we recall from the story, he made his way to Joppa, a seaport booking
passage on a ship with the intent of going to distant Tarshish, a city located in the opposite
direction from Ninevah and about as far as he could go in the then-known world.  It is believed
that Tarshish was located in Southern Spain.  Ninevah was located in what we know as present
day Iraq.  As we read further, we see that the Lord was serious about his call of this missionary
prophet and takes some rather serious steps to change Jonah's mind about the poor choice of not
accepting his calling.  His fleeing trip to Tarshish became a terrifying nightmare in the ship
where he experienced a horrible storm, was thrown overboard by the crew's sailors, and then
swallowed by a whale where he spent three miserable days.  Jonah's mind and heart are changed,
and we see in verse one of chapter 3 the Lord again calls Jonah to Ninevah.  Possibly some of us
in our own lives have lacked faith to face our callings to Ninevah and sought to go in opposite
directions to remote places like a Tarshish where we could escape our responsibilities or callings
and perhaps a perceived easier way of life.</p>
<p>I remember a time while serving my mission in the Samoan Islands that I received an assignment
that I wanted to refuse because of my lack of faith in my mission president and in the Lord.  If I
could have found a ship heading to Tarshish, I would have probably booked passage.  I had been
serving on the big Island of Savai'i in Samoa, a beautiful island in the South Pacific.  If you have
seen the movie <em>The Other Side of Heaven,</em> then you probably can get a mental image of the island
I was serving on in what I considered a very challenging and difficult assignment.  The village
was full of wonderful people; however, they belonged to the predominant local religion, not of
our belief.  They worshiped in a large cathedral right across the street from where my companion
and I lived.  We lived in a single room in the back of an abandoned store that was in the shadow
cast by this cathedral until; it seemed, well into each day.  That shadow seemed to somewhat
represent the spirit of this location.  We had a difficult time in our proselyting efforts within the
village.  To make matters more challenging for me, I was asked to be the branch president
because the members were fighting and the branch had divided into two factions.  My companion
and I had the assignment from the mission president to try to bring order to the branch until the
local priesthood could again provide the necessary leadership.  After serving several months in
this location in an effort to ready the branch for local leadership, and as I said before, doing an
assignment that I felt had been the most difficult challenge of my mission, I knew that I was
going to be transferred.  There were about 70 locations that I was aware of that I could be
transferred to, and I remember distinctly telling my companion I was more than willing to go to
any location but one.  The one location that I didn't want to be transferred to was another village
that, to me, was almost identical to the one I was leaving.  It was a community with the same
predominant religion, complete with a large cathedral and a leader who held his flock under a
fairly tight rein, making proselyting difficult.  To complicate things, it was the only other branch
left in the whole mission that needed a missionary to serve as a branch president as it had similar
problems to the branch where I had been serving.  Well, the time for the transfer came and I was
instructed to take a small diesel commercial boat to the island where the mission home was to
meet with the mission president.  You can imagine my excitement in anticipation of where the
next assignment would be.  That excitement quickly diminished when I received my assignment. 
I'll let you guess where I was going. You are right!  Ninevah!!  Then to compound the
assignment the mission president told me he was putting me with an elder who he was going to
send home but had decided to give one more chance.  I had the responsibility to do what I could
to turn this elder around.  Let me assure you, I was looking for a way to book passage to Tarshish
and run from what I thought was a burden I did not want to assume.  Besides, it would be my last
assignment of my mission and I had in my mind that there were many other assignments that
would have been much more pleasing to Elder Bird.  Lacking funds for a ticket to anywhere but
to what I was sure was Ninevah, I took passage to PagoPago, Western Samoa, to take on Nivevah
with little faith and even less enthusiasm.  To my surprise, I found the next seven months to be
the most rewarding experience of my entire mission.  The field was ripe and was ready to harvest
as we baptized 27 people into that small branch.  You will recall that Jonah had a similar
experience as many people of Ninevah repented and turned to the Lord.  The new converts in this
branch added such a spirit that the branch truly took on a new optimism and before long was
considered one of the strongest branches in America Samoa.  My previous challenging
assignment had prepared me well for this wonderful assignment.  Furthermore, my wonderful
companion, who became one of my closest friends not only served faithfully as my first
counselor in the branch, he completed an honorable and successful mission, a decision he made
on his own with very little need of my help other than some encouragement.  </p>
<p>Young brothers and sisters, you are special children of a Father who knows you and cares about
you.  Listen and follow the still small voice.  Live so you will be worthy to hear it.  Your
Ninevah may be your preparation from what lies ahead for you now.  It might be that dreaded
math class required for your major or that research paper you need to write.  Or it might be your
present Church assignment that will prepare you to be a teacher, a Relief Society president or
elder's quorum president or, who knows, a member of one the higher quorums of the Church. 
But whatever it is, it may be preparing you for important assignments in your life.</p>
<p>In the Book of Ecclesiastes 3:1-2, page 848, we read that there is a time and place for everything.
You will note that verse 2 states that, <em>"there is a time to plant and a time to pluck that which is
planted."</em>  In my youth I lived on a farm, as I'm sure some of you did.  Others of you are well
acquainted with the planting process in the family garden and understand the law of the harvest. 
Even though at this campus you are not in the garden planting business, you truly are in the
planting years of you're life, figurative speaking, while you are attending BYU-Idaho.  You are
preparing yourselves educationally, intellectually, and spiritually.  Some of you are preparing
yourselves for mission service.  Many, particularly you young men, are preparing to live up to
your charge of being the principle bread earners for your future families.  Many of you young
women are preparing to be mothers and nurturers of your dream families.  I plead with you not to
waste this season of opportunity to be ready for the responsibilities you may have in your
Ninevahs.  Plant seeds now that will produce rich and bounteous harvests.  Don't shirk your
responsibilities now to prepare by running off to Tarshish.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I directed an off-campus satellite state university program that enrolled
between 8 and 900 students.  Most of the programs were graduate programs, but we did have a
number of undergraduate programs.  I cannot count the number of individuals who came in for
academic counseling about what they could do to finish uncompleted degrees so they could
improve their job possibilities.  They had missed golden opportunities in their younger years to
properly prepare to take care of families in their later lives.  Most were great students but got
sidetracked by such things as new cars, maybe some riotous living, and were satisfied with a
pretty good job that met their immediate needs.  Now things were different with family
responsibilities.  And the job that looked good at one time and met the needs for one was not
good enough to take care of a wife and children.  These individuals needed to improve their
financial situation, and the completion of a degree was the obvious way to accomplish the goal. 
But times were different and opportunities were limited.  Their families and present jobs required
their time, so the process was much slower than if they had completed their preparation earlier in
their lives when responsibilities were so much less. Some got discouraged and soon dropped out
of school again because progress was too slow.  Many did go back to evening school and finished
their degrees even though it was difficult.  I admired them for their efforts.  Don't let yourselves
get into that situation but, rather, take advantage of your present opportunity.  Remember, Don't
run off to Tarshish when you should be accepting a responsibility in Ninevah.</p>
<p>The Lord admonishes us to prepare ourselves in the following revelation given to the Prophet
Joseph, <em>"And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of
the kingdom.  Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more
perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain
unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; Of things both in heaven and
in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must
shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the
perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of
countries and of kingdoms- That ye may be prepared in all things then I shall send you again to
magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have
commissioned you."</em> (D&amp;C 88: 77-80)</p>
<p>May I talk to you young ladies for just a few minutes and offer you some counsel that I often
shared as a stake president to the young brides-to-be.  It is no doubt your desire is to find your
prince charming some time in the future-for some of you, sooner than later.  Some of the
characteristics you may be hoping for in your prince is that he is kind, fun, handsome, smart, and
is a worthy priesthood holder who is magnifying his priesthood.  Hopefully, he is preparing
himself well now or is prepared to provide for the family so you can be a stay-at-home mom to
nurture those perfect children you are going to have.  I'm sure you can think of many other
virtues that you would want on the list.  You young men may also have such a list.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you the "rest of the story" about my mother, as there are several important
lessons we can learn from her story, particularly you sisters.  I'm sure my mother was looking for
her prince charming when she was about your age.  And she found him.  He happened to be the
young single minister in her church-a "man of the cloth."  He was her prince charming!  After
their marriage he worked in his honorable profession, moving from place to place, providing the
basic needs of the family even though times were tough in the depression years of the thirties. 
He was her true love, her provider, the father of her children, her friend; and they had a great
relationship.  And then he died at a relative young age, leaving her alone.  We were living in
Southern California at this time.  So what does a mother do in these circumstances with a family
to rear?  It was her righteous desire to continue on as the nurturer in the home.  She had no desire
or plans to do anything else.  But now things had changed drastically in her life.  It fell on her to
not only be the mother but to also be the bread earner.</p>
<p>To soften the blow of the possible loss of her husband, mom had invested in a "wonderful"
insurance policy to protect her against such tragedies.  However, it was not one that gave her
enough money to raise her children.  In fact, she barely got any money at all from the insurance
policy and only a few dollars from the Veteran's Administration to help bury her husband as he
had served in the military in World War I.  Fortunately in her youth, between the time she
completed her high school and when she got married, she had made some good choices.  She had
attended the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, at the time a women's college, and had
completed her baccalaureate degree in education.  <em>Young sisters, <u>pay attention to this next
statement</u>.  Her degree was her insurance policy.  </em>As difficult as it was, she was able to go to
work as a teacher, thus providing the basic needs of her small family as well as be the Mother. 
Again, young sisters, keep this in mind as you wonder if you should complete your education. 
You may be thinking that you want to always be in the home being a mom, however, you never
know what may happen that would require you to do what my mother had to do.  With her
teaching skills she was also well trained to help her children in their homework-another great
blessing to our family coming from her preparation.</p>
<p>Two years went by after dad's death, and Mom was adjusting somewhat to a routine of being the
provider and the mother.  My twin brother, Dick, and I, who are the youngest in the family, were
6 years old and in the first grade.  She was teaching in an elementary school a couple of miles
from our home.  Attending that same school were four of her children who were still living at
home.   Then came another tragic trial in her life.</p>
<p>One day as school let out and we were boarding the bus, someone approach our bus and told us
to get out of the bus as one of Mom's teacher friends, a wonderful Quaker lady, was going to
drive us home quickly as there was an emergency.  A neighbor had called the school to inform
Mom that our home was in flames.  My two brothers and I rode home in the rumble seat of the
old Model A.  As we approached our property, we could see no evidence of the home we had left
that morning but could only see smoke rising into the sky where the home once had stood leaving
only a pile of ashes.  That image of the pile of ashes is indelibly etched in my memory to this day. 
Everything was gone.  Nothing but ashes!</p>
<p>I can only guess the questions Mom had running through her mind.  What was this mother to do
who was still suffering from the loss of her husband?  Where were the children going to eat their
next meal, which usually was within an hour or two once they got home from school?  Where
were they going to sleep that night and the many other nights in the future?  What about clothes
as all they had was what they were wearing?  I'm sure she had these and more questions come to
her mind.  Had the God whom she had worshiped all her life deserted her?  Had he not known
that she was widowed when she needed her husband the most?  Why had He allowed that to
happen?  And now this.  What should she do?  She must have felt some of the same pain on a
smaller scale that the Prophet Joseph felt when he was in the Liberty jail and prayed, 
		<em>"O God,
where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?  How long shall thy
hand be stayed . . ?"</em>  She was to learn in times to come the blessings of the promises of the Lord
to the Prophet Joseph in answer to his prayer when he said,  <em>"My son, peace be unto thy soul;
thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well,
God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes."  </em>D&amp;C 121:7-8</p>
<p>As painful as those moments must have been for her watching the dying embers of ashes of the
remains of her home and the uncertainty of the weeks and months of hardship that would follow;
unbeknownst to her, there was looming a new dawn of hope because of this tragic experience
that she was not aware of and wouldn't be aware of for years to come.  Let me explain what I
mean about this new dawn of hope.  We were about to be introduced to some members of the
Church who would have a great impact on the direction of our lives.</p>
<p>My older sister Jane had graduated from high school and worked in town in Blythe, California, at
the time of our home burning down.  While in high school, she would catch a school bus every
morning to travel several miles to her high school.  She was a shy girl and was befriended by
another young girl, about her age, who also rode the bus each day.  They would sit together on
the bus and really became close friends.  This friend was a member of the Church.  Through this
friendship and other members of the Church who also became her friends, she was taught the
gospel and was baptized and was a member at the time we lost our home.</p>
<p>As Mom pondered what to do, she knew she had to make a quick decision, as the only
transportation available to someplace for shelter that night was this teacher friend.  Because the
LDS family had been very friendly to us since Jane had joined the Church, she decided to go to
their home for help.  We drove the two miles it took to get to their home, and Mom went to the
door and told them of the dilemma we were in.  They opened their door and their hearts to us. 
They were angels sent from God that day to help us who were practically strangers to them. 
They remind me of the scripture found in Matthew:  <em>"Then shall the King say unto them on his
right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world:  For I was an hungred, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and
ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye come unto me.  Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?. . .or naked, and clothed thee?  Or
when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and come unto thee?  And the King shall answer and say
unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me."</em>  Matthew 25: 34-40.  Never have I known a better example of
this scripture than this family.</p>
<p>We stayed with this family, the Art Lee family, for about a week and then were able to obtain
two large army tents and cots used by migrant farm workers during the harvest time, which we
sat up next to the pile of ashes.  We started cleaning up the mess that was the remains of the
home.  Not being satisfied that they had done enough, the Lee family engaged the small LDS
branch to come out to help us build another home.  Such love and kindness to non-members was
hard for us to believe.  (Parenthetically, I might mention that, that small humble home, which
was built more that 50 years ago, is still being used as my wife and I visited it a year ago when
we went to visit my father's grave in Southern California.)  Once we got into our new home, the
Lees probably thought they had set the stage sufficiently to send the missionaries over, and they
did.  We were kind to the missionaries and listened but were not very interested.  So later the
Lees sent them again with the same results.  But they never gave up on us and eventually, after
wearing out several sets of missionaries, including stake missionaries, we finally became
converted and all but one brother, who had left home prior to our becoming acquainted with the
Church, were baptized. Dick and I were just turning 13 years old at that time.  All six children to
this day are active members.  Mom passed away some 37 years ago, a very faithful saint. 
Brothers and sisters, <u>let that be a lesson to you</u>.  <u>Never give up</u> in your missionary efforts.  I am
so grateful that the Lee family and my sister didn't give up on us.  Furthermore, if you think you
may have been a failure on your missions because you have baptized only one soul while serving
your mission, <u>don't be discouraged</u>.  The conversion of one shy girl has resulted in more than
two hundred members of the Church, dozens of missionaries, many church leaders, and many
more to come in the generations in the future.</p>
<p>I'm so grateful for a mother who had prepared for events she never expected, but when the time
came to assume an overwhelming responsibility she was prepared to do so.  Let me again
reiterate to all of you, <u>use this season of opportunity today to prepare for your tomorrows.</u></p>
<p>President Hinckley in general conference in April of 1997 gave the youth counsel about choosing
goals when he said, <em>"You have come into the world in a great season in the work of the Lord.  No
other generation has had quite the same opportunities that you have and will have.  Begin now to
establish those goals which will bring you happiness - education in your chosen skill or branch
of learning, whatever it may be; a mission in which to surrender yourself entirely to the Lord to
do His work; future marriage in the house of the Lord to a wonderful and delightful companion
of whom you will be worthy because of the way you have lived"</em> (in Conference Report, Apr.
1997, 71; or <em>Ensign</em>, May 1997, 50).</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to bear my testimony that I know God lives; that Jesus is the Christ, our
redeemer; that the Prophet Joseph Smith was called to serve as the instrument in restoring the
Church in these last days.  I know that we are truly being led by a living prophet, even Gordon B.
Hinckley.  I bear this testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em>"Debt Management</em></strong><em>"</em></font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Brigham Young University - Idaho Commencement<br />
April 27, 2002<br />
Elder Henry B. Eyring</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Your problem is how to manage your debt rather than hope to erase it.  You can't repay your
benefactors.  You could not ever find them and they wouldn't take your money if you offered it. 
But you can from this day forward act so that your debt will be steadily reduced.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Let me give you three rules of managing the debts of gratitude you have accumulated here.  First,
wherever you may labor in life, give more than you take.  Second, whoever is around you in life,
find someone to help.  And, third, ask God to multiply the power of your efforts to give and to
help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Let me suggest some examples of how to do it, from what I have learned in this place.  In one of
the first years when I was the President here, a young man came to my office in the old Spori
Building.  He was dressed poorly and was ill at ease.  School was about to start in the Fall.  He
said that he was a convert to the Church, that he had arrived with just enough money for tuition
and nothing else, and that he wanted my help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">My mind raced to think of what aid I could arrange for him.  He had no money for food that day,
no money for a place to stay, and no way to buy books.  He was sleeping in his car.  When I
began to talk about what we could give him, he held up his hand to stop me.  He said, "I just
want to know the names of some people in town who might have some logs they want split for
firewood."  He had an axe in his car.  He said that he could make his own way, thanks.  And I
learned later that he split more wood than he was paid for at each place he found a job.  I watched
him over the years,  sure that he would forever more than pay his own way.  Like him, be more a
giver than a taker, wherever you are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"> During the years I was here,  we had a basketball player from Australia.  He had played for his
national team.  I understand he held the record for the most points scored by an individual in a
single Olympic game.  He later played in the NBA.  And yet I remember watching from this very
spot, after some function in this building.  The chairs were cleared and the basketball  team was
gathering for their practice.  Over there, to the side of the floor, I saw our star.  He was working
with another player, one of the obscure ones, one who the coach didn't play much.   He was
showing him, over and over, patiently, how to make a move with the ball.   I remember now the
admiration I felt for him.  He was thinking of someone else more than himself.  He was
remembering who had helped him.  He was trying to lift someone to where he was.   Like him,
whoever is around you, find someone to help.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Finally, you will need faith to get the help of God to give when you want to take and to help
others when you need help yourself.   I have seen that miracle here more than once.  You will
need it most when times are hardest.  I remember going into the home of a faculty member.  He
had just learned that his son had been killed in an accident.  He could only have known for a few
minutes or at most an hour.  Yet, he greeted me smiling.  He gave me comfort rather than taking
comfort from me.  And he had only concern for his other children, to help them see the hope of
eternal life that was so plain to him.  Like him, plead with God to multiply your efforts to give
and to help.  He loves you and is all powerful.  He will help you to give and to serve others, even
when it seems nearly impossible.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Then, you can rest assured that you have done your best to manage your debts of gratitude.  But,
of course, your debts will only grow,  since God always blesses bountifully His grateful servants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I testify that our Heavenly Father and the Savior live and that they have blessed us with gifts of
infinite worth.   In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong><em><font color="#000080">"AN ANTHEM AND THE LIGHT"</font></em></strong></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
April 27, 2002<br />
President David A. Bednar</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I have looked forward to and prepared for this day, I discovered some interesting and relevant
facts about the first commencement conducted at Ricks Academy--held almost exactly one
hundred years ago.  The first formal commencement exercises at the academy took place on May
14 and 15, 1902, amid an atmosphere of optimism.  Construction of the new academy building
was well under way, and the 1901-1902 academic year had started with an enrollment of 165
students--65 of whom stayed in school for the entire year.  Of those 65 students, one "graduated
from the two years normal course, 21 from the eighth grade, while 40 others received certificates
of promotion," noted an article in the May 22, 1902, <em>Deseret Evening News</em> of Salt Lake City.  At
that time the academy offered, as described in that same <em>Deseret Evening News</em> article, "a
preparatory course, seventh and eighth grades, a two-year high school, and a two-year normal,
and a missionary course, besides a course for the lady students in plain and art needlework"
(Source: Crowder, David L., <u>The Spirit of Ricks</u>, pg. 9).  You will be interested to know the
"entrance fees" or tuition for those respective programs of study were (as recorded in alumni
records contained in the papers of Hyrum Manwaring):</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">preparatory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	seventh grade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	eighth grade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	first year normal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $12.00<br />
	second year normal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	first year high school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $12.00<br />
	second year high school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	missionary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10.00<br />
	business&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $35.00</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The information available in our archives suggests that the first graduate of the normal course in
1902 was Mary Hewlett of Alta, Wyoming.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was also able to find and study a commencement address delivered by Nellie Edith Fogg.  Sister
Fogg was not a member of that first graduating class in 1902; rather, she received her degree in
1904.  As I studied Sister Fogg's longhand notes for her commencement speech, I noted that her
remarks on that occasion reach across the decades to us today and are both timely and timeless.</font></p>
<p> <i><font color="#000080">		Dear parents, teachers, classmates, and friends; the long looked for day has
come at last.  With beating hearts we say the triumph is ours.  The shore for which
we have battled with the waves is at last reached.</font></i></p>
<p> <i><font color="#000080">		But our work is not ended.  One shore has been reached in safety, but now
we must launch our barks [a bark is a small sailing vessel] out in different
directions, out into the great unknown from which no traveler can retrace his steps
or begin his life's course over.  But our sails are fastened firmly and we have no
fear when at the helm stands the counsils [sic] and the experience of those who
have traveled before.  Our adherence to the principles that have been taught
promises a voyage safe from billows and tempests while disregard of the same
will drift us to shoals and reefs where storms and breakers roar and dash to pieces. 
A successful voyage depends upon our choice, upon the ends we choose and
towards which we work.  Let us be guided by the light that has been reflected in
our way and may that light shine forth through the countless ages of eternity.</font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I found Sister Fogg's imagery of the vessel and voyage particularly interesting given my own
description of this institution and the transition in which we are engaged as a ship of curious
workmanship traveling in uncharted waters.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sister Fogg continued.</font></p>
<p> <i><font color="#000080">	Not one of us may achieve what men call greatness; but in the sight of God, of
angels, and of all good men, there is a greatness which we may win which will
forever last.  This greatness is greatness of soul, greatness of character.  For that
we will strive.</font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sister Fogg articulated in 1904 themes that apply equally well to each of us in 2002.  As
graduates and representatives of Brigham Young University-Idaho, I pray that we will indeed be
possessed of a greatness of soul and of character that will become the hallmarks of this
institution.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me now recount a recent experience with our BYU-Idaho combined men's choir that I hope
will communicate the expectation I have for you--as you strive to develop a greatness of soul
and of character.  Our combined men's choir was invited to sing in the Saturday evening
priesthood session at the Church's recent general conference.  Approximately 300 men
participated in the choir.  Our young men were all wearing dark suits, white shirts, and ties; and
they looked very much like missionaries.  As the choir members were waiting outside of the
Conference Center for a guide to lead them into the building, three men (claiming to be with
some other religious group) with large banners and megaphones approached them.  The three
men began to chide and harass the group.  With megaphones in hand, they blasted out degrading
comments.  The harassment became increasingly loud and more caustic and cruel.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The response of the BYU-Idaho men was noteworthy.  Rather than inappropriately react or
respond in any way to the men's verbal assault, the members of the choir simply banded closely
together and began to sing the hymns of the Restoration.  They sang loudly and with firmness, yet
with the voice of angels, until the three men could not be heard.  Many of the visitors on the
grounds of the Conference Center turned and smiled at these BYU-Idaho students with both
relief and admiration.  Our young men continued <strong>to sing</strong> and <strong>to smile</strong> as they were led by their
guide directly past the three antagonists and into the Conference Center.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brother and sisters, in this episode our students demonstrated greatness of soul and greatness of
character.  I believe in that difficult situation a few weeks ago at the Conference Center our
young men displayed precisely what Sister Fogg was talking about in her commencement address
almost 100 years ago.  And as you graduates of Brigham Young University-Idaho now go forth
into the world--to serve and to continue to learn and to make meaningful contributions--may
your demeanor, may your behavior, and may the totality of your life become <strong>an anthem</strong> that will
overpower the loud and taunting voices of an increasingly wicked world.  May your smile
produce <strong>a light</strong> that will chase away darkness and draw seekers of truth to inquire about the
source of your faith and hope.  May you march straight ahead and be true to the principles of the
restored gospel of the Savior and the things of righteousness you have learned and experienced at
BYU-Idaho.  As I believe Sister Fogg would say to us this morning, <strong>for that we must and will
strive</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, I would like to conclude on a personal note.  Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so
much enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your apartments, participating with you in
home evenings and eating ice cream together, talking about your challenges and opportunities,
answering your questions, and becoming better acquainted.  We will miss you.  And we would
love to hear from you--please be sure to let us know about the things that are happening in your
lives.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Today you graduates become the first official alumni of BYU-Idaho.  You now have the
responsibility to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at this remarkable
institution.  How you live, what you do, and what you become will ultimately define this
university.  May the Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and
diligence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As our sons have left our home for college and on missions, Sister Bednar and I have shared with
them the following counsel:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#000080">	Â• Remember that you represent the Savior.<br />
	Â• Remember that you represent your family.<br />
	Â• Remember that your represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#000080">	Â• Remember that you represent Brigham Young University-Idaho.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I express my love.  I declare my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the
gospel has been restored to the earth in its fullness in these latter days.  I so testify in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>
<br><br>
http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Graduation/2002_04_27_Hinckley.htm
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
April 27, 2002<br />
President Gordon B. Hinckley</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thank you very much for the honor you have accorded me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.
Thank you so very much.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we have been reminded this is the first commencement for BYU-Idaho, and it is a special
privilege to be the first recipient of an honorary doctorate from this institution.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I take just a moment to tell you about the change that has occurred at this school. As
Chairman of the Church Board of Education I have long been troubled over the fact that we are
educating an ever diminishing percentage of the young people of the Church. While reflecting on
this fact the thought came, and I am confident it was inspiration, that we could increase the
number touched by our higher education program if Ricks were to become a four-year school
offering baccalaureate degrees. There would be fewer transfer students and this would make it
possible for BYU in Provo to accept more students.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This would be a drastic move for Ricks, but it would be worth the effort. Hopefully, without
giving any offense to the Ricks family and their illustrious forebear for whom the college was
named, we could rename it BYU- Idaho, as we previously had changed the name of the Church
College of Hawaii to BYU-Hawaii.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I felt strongly that if we were to do this it should be done while President Bednar presided over
the school. We recognized that he has a unique capacity. He is not shackled by academic
tradition. He has an understanding of how computer learning can be used in such a situation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He has succeeded brilliantly. It has been a complex undertaking, and I do not know of anyone
else who could have accomplished this. I commend him and thank him for his remarkable work.
I likewise commend and thank the faculty who have been so cooperative, who have been so
enthusiastic, and who have been willing to give up certain prerogatives in order to accomplish
this.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We determined that we would have to give up intercollegiate athletics. They are so costly. I
recognize that many of you students feel this has been a terrible sacrifice, that it is almost
impossible to conceive of a four-year institution that does not have an exciting program of
intercollegiate sports.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But I assure you that this is not unique.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For instance, I suppose all of you have heard of Emory University in Georgia. It is an outstanding
institution, widely renowned. The president of that university recently wrote: "Emory University
is not known as an athletic powerhouse. It has no football program. It has no stadium. It is
without a<br />
basketball arena to hold thousands of spectators. Students are not attracted here by athletic
scholarships. Nor, on an Emory team, are they ever to achieve national fame in a bowl game or a
nationally televised final four in basketball."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Emory University essentially carries forward the same kind of program that you do. And there
are others who do likewise.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So much for that. And now to get into a commencement address.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am always impressed with two hymns which we sing in the Church. The first was written by
one of our own, Evan Stephens. It reads:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Shall the youth of Zion falter<br />
In defending truth and right?<br />
While the enemy assaileth,<br />
Shall we shrink or shun the fight?<br />
No!<br />
True to the faith that our parents have cherished,<br />
True to the truth for which martyrs have perished,<br />
To God's command,<br />
Soul, heart, and hand,<br />
Faithful and true we will ever stand.</i></font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">That is a wonderful declaration. All of us ought to sing it occasionally. We ought to sing it with
conviction and power and determination.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The other was written by Frederick W. Favor who lived long ago. It also concludes with a stirring
statement:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Faith of our fathers, holy faith,<br />
We will be true to thee till death!</i></font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">That, too, is a great declaration. To everyone who sings it. To everyone who utters those words it
is a statement, a resolution, of determination:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Faith of our fathers, holy faith,<br />
We will be true to thee till death!</i></font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">If there is anything that the people of this sad old world need it is to stand and make such a
declaration. How we need faith! How we need the strength that comes of it. How we need the
will to exercise it. How we need the determination to practice it.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Keep the faith. This is my message to you this morning. What a wonderful generation you are.
You are young and bright and forward looking. You are men and women of integrity, of high
hopes, of ambition.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Never before in the history of this Church has there been a better generation than you, not
withstanding all of the seductive voices that constantly invite you to abandon the faith of your
fathers and indulge in that which is faithless and empty.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I think of the 14-year-old boy, Joseph, reading in the family Bible those challenging words of
James:</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally,<br />
and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br />
"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a<br />
wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."</font></i> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">With that promise before him, he said: "Never did any passage of scripture come with more
power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. I reflected on it again and again,
knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and
unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I at length came to the determination to `ask of God,' concluding that if He gave wisdom to them
that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Think of the consequences of that act of faith.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On that spring day, after centuries of time, the curtains were parted and there appeared before
him God the Eternal Father, and the Risen Lord. From that grand event has come all that this
Church is today. You are here because of it. You would not be here if Joseph had not gone in
prayer in simple faith.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Someone, I think it was Emerson, has said that every great institution is the lengthened shadow
of a great man. I would add that it is the lengthened shadow of a man who acted in faith.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And so my challenge to you this morning is that throughout your lives you cultivate and act with
faith -- faith in yourselves, faith in your associates, faith in the Church, faith in God, your Eternal
Father.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><u>Keep faith with yourselves</u>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Channing Pollock, a great playwright in his day, once said: "We begin with a banner inscribed
Excelsior and gradually the dust of battle obliterates everything but the second syllable."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Think of that. So many players in the game of life get to first base. Some reach second. A handful
make third. But how few there are who get home and score.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I once read these challenging words in a national magazine: "Above all, let's cut out the rotten
excuse that we are only human. That we are entitled to some daily quota of error or indifference.
Only human? What an incredible denial of the human potential. Only human? This is the
ultimate insult.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>"Remember that man's greatness does not lie in perfection, but in striving for it."</i></font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">My beloved young friends, keep faith with the best that is in you. Shakespeare said: "This above
all: to thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night the day, thou canst not then be false
to any man."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">You did not come into the world to fail. You came into the world to succeed. You have
accomplished much so far. It is only the beginning. As you move forward on the trail of life, keep
the banner of faith in self ever before you. You may not be a genius. You may not be
exceptionally smart. But you can be good and you can try. And you will be amazed at what might
happen when in faith you take a step forward.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Never lose faith in yourself. Never lose faith in your capacity to do good and worthwhile things.
You cannot be arrogant. You cannot be conceited. You can be quiet and humble, and forward
looking and full of hope, the hope that blossoms into faith.</font></p>
<p><u><font color="#000080">Keep faith with your associates.</font></u></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">You will never be alone. In this world we work together to accomplish things. We marry and
have companions. We have children. We have associates in the Church. We work with others in
our daily pursuits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Never lose faith in your opportunity to lift those who are in need, to give strength to those who
are weak, to give encouragement to those who falter by the way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">You will have about you, throughout your lives, those who stumble and fall. You can lift them.
Said Paul to the Romans, "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak," And
then he added these significant words, "and not to please ourselves." We have an obligation to
assist one another, to build one another. Declared Jesus to Peter, "Simon . . . Satan hath desired
to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The Lord has admonished us through revelation: "Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office
which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and
strengthen the feeble knees." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Keep faith with your associates. You can help them and they can help you. The Almighty has
designed that we work together, that we assist one another, that we bless one another in our
association.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">In a complex and difficult operation the chief surgeon usually gets the credit. But in the operating
room he must have faith in those about him if he is to be successful. His assistant doctors, the
anesthesiologist, the skilled nurses who work with him-- they are a team. He could never do it
alone. Keep faith with your associates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><u>Keep faith with the Church.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">This Church is the way of truth and life and salvation. I care not what course you may pursue in
your future lives. I care not to what heights you may aspire. You will do better if you remain true
to the faith of your forbears. Last Saturday I set apart the presidency of the new Lubbock Texas
Temple. The president is a retired cardiologist, a good doctor who has saved the lives of many
people. He has been a man of great skill and great learning and great service. The first counselor
has been a dean in a large university, a man of learning and a man of capacity who has done very
well. The second counselor is a government employee, and a man who has won the esteem of his
associates and given great and distinguished public service. To me it is wonderful that while
climbing upward in their various professions they have remained faithful and true Latter-day
Saints. And now, to crown their lives of service comes a great and sacred opportunity to preside
over a new temple, a House of the Lord, where they will administer ordinances in the authority of
the holy priesthood whose power will reach beyond the veil of death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Be true to this Church. Keep faith with this glorious work which the God of heaven has restored
to the earth in this the wondrous dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the Church of God the
Eternal Father. It is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ whose name it bears. It is true, and I
testify of that. It is wonderful, and I bear witness of that. Those who have gone before you have
paid a terrible price for that which you have today. They have looked to you and hoped and
prayed that you would be ever true to the cause which was so precious to them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><u>Keep faith with God our Eternal Father and the risen Lord Jesus Christ.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I have seen in my lifetime those who started out walking in the sunlight of faith. But gradually,
through arrogance and conceit, through pride and a desire for the honors of men, they have
turned their backs on God and forsaken Him. They have literally traded their birthright for a mess
of pottage. They have thrown away that which was most precious and substituted a hollow shell.
Like the prodigal son who wasted his inheritance "with riotous living" until he would fain eat
husks with the hogs, they have sought satisfaction in the husks of life. Their lives have become
empty, unfulfilled. They have forsaken their God who gave them life, and their Redeemer who
bought them with His blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Declared Jehovah to ancient Israel, "I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Keep that humility which will cause you to get on your knees in prayer, in acknowledgment of
His power and goodness. He will not fail you. He will hear your prayers. He will answer your
prayers. In the stillness of the night, you will hear the whisperings of His Spirit to direct you in
your times of distress and need. Those times will come to you as they do to all. Keep faith with
God and He will never let you down. He will never turn His back upon you. To you He has said:
"Be still, and know that I am God." And His Beloved Son has declared, "I am the way, the truth,
and the life." There is none other to bless you as your Father in heaven and His divine Son will
bless you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Faith of our fathers, holy faith, We will be true to thee till death!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I lay upon you this charge, and invoke the blessings of heaven upon you as you leave this
institution to go forward in other pursuits, that you walk with faith, with sure and certain faith,
and may heaven smile upon you is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">Passing through the west entrance to BYU in Provo, you can observe the inscription
"ENTER TO LEARN, GO FORTH TO SERVE."  It is a unique motto in the general world
of universities where their philosophy may still be centered in learning but the expected result
be changed in "GO FORTH TO HELP YOURSELF"!</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The central part of this particular emphasis on gaining knowledge and then using it to serve
means that being part of this campus community, BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho, is to use your knowledge and
skills not only to enrich your own life but also to prepare you for service in the bonds of
eternal marriage and eternal families, to serve and support your community and nation, to
serve and bless lives by participating in the ordinances and covenants of the gospel of Jesus
Christ in His Church.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thomas E. Ricks is remembered, on this campus, with the words "The Spirit of Ricks,"
explicitly meaning service, hard work, friendliness, and compassion.  As your president,
David A. Bednar, has stated before: &nbsp;"The Spirit of Ricks is not found in a building.  It is not
in a place.  It is found in the people, the students, the teachers."  We need more than ever to
keep that spiritual perception alive and well all the time.  That's how we become spiritually-minded when we transform that perception into learning true knowledge to build a testimony
of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, live its principles, and serve our neighbor and our God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may
learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the
service of your God"</em> (Mosiah 2:17).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How do you, as students, as future husbands and wives and parents, as citizens, and as
members and future leaders of the Church perceive this responsibility?  How do you then
respond to your perceptions when you know the value of the word <em>responsible</em>, meaning
"able to respond" (reverse of the word).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Too many today, because of a wrong perception of this responsibility, become irresponsible,
meaning that they don't respond anymore to the righteous perception of things as they are,
and as they were, and as they are to come.  Instead, they respond to their own feelings and
inclinations.  However, you may remember, from your scriptures, that truth is knowledge of
things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come (D&amp;C 93:24).  To have a correct
perception of truth, let's read the following verses:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one
who was a liar from the beginning.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The Spirit of truth is of God.  I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore
record of me, saying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth;</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he
is glorified in truth and knoweth all things</em> (D&amp;C 93:25-28).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Divine, absolute truth comes only through revelation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let's first review the importance of what perception is in reality.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To perceive is defined as "to attain awareness or understanding of; to become aware of
through the senses."  This term is used quite frequently and most of the time is associated
with our physical senses.  Other synonyms express a similar meaning: to discern, to have an
insight, to observe.  You can perceive, or feel, sickness, danger, happiness, anger, or even
the weather by using your ears, eyes, or, for older people, arthritic aches.  But perception is
also used in a spiritual way and is associated with our spiritual senses, using the symbol heart
as the center of emotional perceptions.  The scriptures abound with such examples:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that
he would shew them a sign from heaven.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair
weather: for the sky is red.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and
lowring, O ye hypocrites, ye can discern (perceive) the face of the sky; but can
ye not discern the signs of the times?</em> (Matt. 16:1-3).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When the Savior was speaking to the multitudes, he stated: &nbsp;"I perceive that ye are weak, that
ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you
at this time" (3 Ne. 17:2).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Perception that is based strictly on our human senses can be true or false.  What we see may
not be the reality but simply an illusion.  Perception, using our temporal eyes only, can result
too often in what is called an optical illusion.  We do not see what is really in front of our
eyes, but what we see is an interpretation of it.  The act of seeing mainly takes place inside
one's head and one's heart, especially when we are looking at someone of the opposite sex! 
Let me share the following medical experience:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"The physicist Arthur Zajonc reports about a successful operation on an 8-year-old boy who was blind from birth due to grey cataracts.  The operation
was performed by the surgeons Moreau and LePrince in the year 1910. 
'Although the eyes of the boy were completely cured, his visual faculty was
practically zero.'  Moreau, 'One would be mistaken to believe that a person
born blind who regains his eyesight through surgery can see the world around
him after the operation.  The operation itself is of no other value than to
prepare the basis for sight; the main element, however, is education. . . .  To
teach a person born blind to see is more the task of a teacher than of a medical
doctor.  There is a difference between the ability to see and to recognize."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we are using our eyes and see with a spiritual mind and heart, we not only see but also
recognize and thus become spiritually-minded.  Let us look at what happened to those who
became witnesses of Christ:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">--	John the Baptist: &nbsp;"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the
Lamb of God!" (John 1:36).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">--	The two disciples who were with John and followed Christ were invited by
Him to "come and see."  They came and saw and then testify to others: &nbsp;"We
have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ" (John 1:41).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On the contrary, using only the eyes without the spiritual mind will lead to doubt and
hesitation:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where
Jesus had appointed them.  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but
some doubted"</em> (Matt. 28:16-17).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It applies also to visions recorded by others:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Usually we do not see things as they are but as we are!  True perception is, in reality, a
spiritual process starting with a correct spiritual analysis and resulting in a spiritual decision
affecting our temporal and spiritual life.  If based on false assumptions, it may affect us
negatively and even destroy us.  Here is an interesting example:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A speaker was trying to demonstrate the evils of alcohol.  On a table in front
of him were two glasses full of clear liquid.  He explained that one of the
glasses was full of water and the other full of pure alcohol.  He put a worm in
the glass of water, and it swam happily.  Then he put the same worm in the
alcohol, and it died.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"What conclusion do you reach?" he asked.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A voice from the back of the room replied, "I perceive, sir, that if you drink
alcohol, you'll never get worms.  (<em>New Era</em>, February 1989, 4-6.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Obviously, it is not only important to get the right perception but to also conclude correctly. 
The scriptures help us to understand this principle:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">"And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among
them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel;</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their
hearts from me because of the precepts of men"</em> (D&amp;C 45:28-29).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let's see how it may affect us with this scripture: &nbsp;"For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body"
(1&nbsp;Cor. 11:29).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This great spiritual principle, to perceive with your spiritual senses and to listen to and act
on the promptings of the Spirit, should be applied in all aspects of our lives if we are to
achieve the true purpose of life, which is eternal life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to direct my remarks to one particular aspect of this principle to those who, at
some time in their life, may have had an incorrect perception of themselves and their divine
identity.  Remember that an incorrect perception always leads to an incorrect conclusion.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some months ago I had a conversation with a young father.  He was desperately trying to
meet his financial obligations and at the same time graduate from college, work, support his
young family, attend church, read the scriptures, and do everything that was expected of him. 
He seemed like a boxer--half groggy, half conscious--listening to the countdown by the
referee.  He seemed almost relieved with the thought that, with the sound of the bell, it would
all be over.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">With a note of desperation in his voice, he said, "What's the use of continuing this crazy kind
of life, disciplining, working, sacrificing?  Anyway, I'm a failure at what I have been doing." 
His perception was wrong.  Again, the adversary was using his favorite weapon: &nbsp;to distort
the perception of our spiritual identity and potential and to transform us from agents to
victims of the system.  How can we face this constant challenge?  How could this young man
come out of this depression?  The answer is relatively simple.  Perceive correctly the Spirit
of the Lord and feel the companionship and influence of the Holy Ghost.  Do not turn your
heart from the Lord because of the precepts of man.  There is the power, the strength, the will
to overcome despair about one's responsibilities and role in this life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is not an isolated or unusual case.  Most of us experience this race for time in our lives
and constantly feel the pressures of unrelenting demands and expectations.  It is easier to give
up than to persevere.  It is easier to think of ourselves as a failure rather than a success.  It
is easier to avoid covenants than to receive them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But was the Master a failure because he uttered these words of despair: &nbsp;"My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46).  Was Peter a failure because he denied Christ in
a time of crisis?  Was Joseph Smith a failure because he sought divine help in praying "O
God, where art thou? &nbsp;And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Failure is not the purpose of life.  Failure may be a perception, but it should always be
temporary.  Failure can be cured if we apply the correct medicine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So is there a major problem affecting our spiritual perceptions today?  There is.  It is a
change in the perception of what is right and what is wrong.  It is perceiving righteousness
(OE right wise) as acting in accord with divine and moral law and not acting in accord with
human and immoral law.  It is keeping the commandments to receive truth and light to please
the Lord and not disobeying the law of God to please the world.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me use some quotes to illustrate what has happened to our society and continues to
happen.  John Howard, World Congress of Families:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"For thirty-five years, the New Morality has been tearing down and replacing
the accumulated wisdom of Western Civilization.  The cherished ideals and
standards of proper behavior were, it was said, outmoded nuisances that had
to go.  Previously, just as Americans would learn the language as an automatic
part of growing up, they also learned how to behave responsibly, living by
standards of right and wrong woven into the culture and taken for granted by
the citizens.  Now those standards have been so thoroughly trashed that many,
many Americans live their lives deciding for themselves how to live and
behave, oblivious to any sense of community responsibility.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"This transformation reflects the twilight of Christianity that has descended on
America.  The individual of deep religious faith begins with a fundamental
subordination of his desires to what the deity requires of him.  For that
individual, the subordination of his preferences to the well-being of the family
and the community is a natural and readily acceptable aspect of living. 
Santayana wrote that Americans had developed a comfortable Christianity
without thorns.  As churches have downgraded an individual's obligations
within his faith, parishioners tend to become indifferent to the obligations of
family and community."  What a contrast with the mind of the pioneers: &nbsp;"The
pioneers who settled and brought civilization to a continental wilderness had
no illusions about the dangers they faced and ordeals they must endure.  They
knew they faced a life of toil and hardship, but they were fortified for these
rigors by their determination to procure a better life for themselves and their
families, by a solid sense of community and mutual support with their
neighbors, and for a large majority of the populace, by a religious faith which
provided the fortitude to stand up to whatever came their way."  (Ibid.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">From a teen-age girl: &nbsp;"I am not religious, but I am spiritual."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">From a Belgian sociologist, Ron Lesthage:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"<em>Can the Family Survive in the 21st Century?</em>  "No," unless friends of the
family can unite in defense of the home.  A <em>revolution-in-values</em> shook the
Western world, starting near 1965.  Its primary characteristic was a militant
secularism, not a benign agnosticism, but a hostile rejection of religious faith. 
This revolution can be defined as a retreat from the values affirmed by
Christian teaching (such as 'responsibility, sacrifice, altruism, and sanctity of
long-term commitments' such as marriage and childbearing) toward an all-pervasive individualistic secularism centered on the desires of the self."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">From an American author, James Hitchcock:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"While the United States is recognized as one of the few industrialized
countries here religion is still strong, its culture often seems at odds with
traditional religious values.  In a recent editorial, he discussed this apparent
paradox and concluded: &nbsp;'. . . Americans tend to value religion insofar as they
regard it as supportive of their personal lives but not when it seems to interfere
in their lives or make demands on them.  They are deeply religious in a sense,
but their commitment proves fragile when it fails to provide the emotional
support they seek.'</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"In support of his argument, Hitchcock cites evidence from a number of recent
studies.  In one survey of Christian teens, Jesus ranked fifth on their list of
most admired persons (after Lincoln, Washington, John F. Kennedy, and
Martin Luther King, Jr.).  A detailed survey of Christians in Minnesota found
that 90 percent believed in life after death, but only 69 percent believed that
Jesus actually rose from the dead.  National surveys have found that 71 percent
of adults believe in heaven, but only 53 percent believe in hell.  Hitchcock
comments, 'The orthodox belief that human beings survive after death is
warmly accepted by believers primarily insofar as it promises personal
happiness, not insofar as it threatens punishment.'  Three-fourths of all
Christians think that people should determine their own beliefs independent of
any organized religion.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"The area in which traditional teachings diverge most from the beliefs of many
of the people in the pews is sexual morality.  In contrast to Christianity's
traditional teachings on the critical importance of chastity, the Minnesota study
of practicing Christians found that 85 percent of them accepted divorce, 60
percent abortion, 36 percent premarital sexual relations, and 39 percent
homosexuality.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"In his concern over what he perceived as the growing gap between traditional
Christian teachings and personal beliefs, Hitchcock averred:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The very religiosity of American culture is often turned against Christianity,
in that the entire world has not been made to seem like a spiritual garden in
which people can browse as they see fit, plucking the flowers that smell
fragrant.  Plucking them does not require accepting the church's
discipline--literally becoming a disciple--but merely savoring the scent and
leaving the rest.  The ultimate test of religious authenticity is now thought to
be personal feelings, which are among the few things the culture still regards
as sacred.  Religion has value insofar as it makes the individual feel good."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To better live his life is the new motto of the modern world of the 21st century.  In the words
of a French philosopher: &nbsp;"We are leaving 2000 years of Christian terrorism.  We don't have
duties, we owe nothing to ourselves."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you see and recognize the new image of the world?  Do you listen to Isaiah when he said,
"Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that
cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: That walk to go
down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength
of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!  Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be
your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion" (Isa. 30:1-3).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You students are entering this institution of learning to receive true knowledge about things
as they are, and as they were, and especially as they are to come in order to go forth to serve
your fellow men and your God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One perception of life and how to live a better life leading to eternal life must be based on
true knowledge of divine and spiritual things, which is absolutely essential for one's
salvation.  The scriptures and the living prophets are given so that the people might have
knowledge of things of God and "know how to worship, and know what you worship, that
you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness"
(D&amp;C&nbsp;93:19).  In modern language, the gospel is not a salad bar where you can pick and
choose what you like to have!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost and one of the gifts of the Spirit. 
That is why spiritual perception becomes vital associated with spiritual knowledge and
followed by obedience.  That is why temporal knowledge always needs to be associated and
guided by spiritual knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The very definition of the spirit of revelation helps us to understand this literal transmission
of divine truth: &nbsp;"Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord
liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge
of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall
receive a knowledge concerning the engravings of old records, which are ancient, which
contain those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken by the manifestation of my
spirit.  Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which
shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&amp;C 8:1-2).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But once revelation comes to us, it is to be safeguarded and applied; and it always must be
followed by service.  "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye
may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of
your God" (Mosiah 2:17).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord has warned us about the calamity that is affecting our world today as He did with
Isaiah: &nbsp;"And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will
not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the
words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; For they have
strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant; They seek not the
Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the
image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is
that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which
shall fall.  Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the
inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from
heaven, and gave him commandments; And also gave commandments to others, that they
should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was
written by the prophets--The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the
mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm
of flesh--But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of
the world; That faith also might increase in the earth" (D&amp;C 1:14-21).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Learning to seek God and to find Him is the beginning of faith and how to endure to the end. 
Atheists or sinners don't find God for the same reason that bank robbers do not find
policemen.  They work very hard to avoid Him.  If you do not seek by faith, you will likely
not find Him by faith either.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Learning how to perceive with a spiritual heart is a result of faith and changes behavior or
attitude.  Let me illustrate with the following story of a person of a different faith, a rabbi:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A Jewish rabbi . . . was conversing with two of his friends.  The rabbi asked
one of the men, "How do you know when the night is over and the day has
begun?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">His friend replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish a
sheep from a goat, then you know the night is over and the day has begun."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The second was asked the same question.  He replied, "When you look into the
distance and can distinguish an olive tree from a fig tree, that is how you
know."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">They then asked the rabbi how he could tell when the night is over and the day
has begun.  He thought for a time and then said, "When you look into the
distance and see the face of a woman and you can say, 'She is my sister.'  And
when you look into the distance and see the face of a man and can say, 'He is
my brother.'  Then you will know the light has come.  (Gordon B. Hinckley,
"BYU Experience," 64.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Learning how to speak and act in the name of Christ and to testify of Him is a blessing of
faith and transforms us into disciples of Christ.  Listen to the words of Christ addressed to
Hyrum Smith: &nbsp;"And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which
leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humble, to judge righteously; and this is my
Spirit.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit which shall
enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; And then shall ye know, or by this
shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of
righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive" (D&amp;C 11:12-14).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Learning to love Jesus and His gospel and learning to love our Heavenly Father and our
neighbor still represent the first and second greatest commandments: &nbsp;"Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of
Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.  Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (D&amp;C&nbsp;59:5-6).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">An Argentine writer embellished this thought the following way:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">4 loves to help man to grow and make him noble</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of God<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of country<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of wife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of friends</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">3 loves to embellish life</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of truth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of neighbor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love of work</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">(Victor Luis Funes (La Nacion 21 Oct. 1992) Arg., Truths learned from his father,
Elogio De La Ejemplaridad.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The work of the Lord is a work of love and is His power to immortality and eternal life:
"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  I am the life and the light of the world.  I am the
same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not; But verily, verily, I say unto
you, that as many as receive me, to them will I give power to become the sons of God, even
to them that believe on my name" (D&amp;C 11:28-30).  It is the greatest of all the gifts of God,
but it is a result of our obedience to His commandments and to endure to the end"
((D&amp;C&nbsp;14:7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May the Lord bless you with the gift of spiritual perception leading to be spiritually-minded
and followed by accepting the truth and light given by Christ.  Do not revile against the truth
even if it is sometimes difficult to admit, defend, or proclaim.  Nephi further said, "I know
that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for
they love the truth and are not shaken" (2 Ne. 9:40).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">These words are preceded by the warning: &nbsp;"Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and
to be spiritually-minded is life eternal (2 Ne. 9:39).</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">We live in a time of political, economic, physical and spiritual unrest.  Multitudes of people are
living in fear.  They are asking questions, seeking direction and struggling for strength to bear
burdensome afflictions.  For various reasons, peoples' lives have been drastically disrupted.  For
many, concern has replaced comfort and security has given way to anxiety.  The pollster George
Gallup, Jr. recently made the following observation:</p>
<p><em>"People are reaching out in all directions in their attempt to escape from the seen
world to the unseen world.  There is a deep desire for spiritual moorings - a
hunger for God."</em>  (<u>U.S. News &amp; World Report</u>, May 6, 2002, 42)</p>
<p>People do need anchors and some form of firmness to which they can cling.  Drifting without
direction develops desperation.  So we all must look for and determine for ourselves what
foundation we will choose on which to build and structure our lives.  Thankfully, we are free to
decide the degree to which our personal interests, gifts, talents and opportunities will be used to
determine the focus of our lives.  Unfortunately, we sometimes restrict our vision and lose our
balance. Please permit me to provide you with a few examples of how some people, without the
clear vision of the Spirit, seek satisfaction in temporal things only.</p>
<p>Most of us have known individuals who build solely on a foundation of academic attainment. 
They may make the assumption that enviable scholastic honors and recognition justify an
exclusion of efforts to develop structural strength on any other foundation.  Any other demand on
their time is viewed as an interference with the acquisition of various levels of  educational
certifications.  This kind of emphasis and thinking is altogether too common in many college and
university communities.</p>
<p>Some people center their lives on gaining appointments to positions of prestige or the acquisition
of monetary wealth.  Many seek tenaciously to increase and build on their foundation of
monetary assets.  In fairness, it should also be noted that some others with wealth, selflessly
share what they have in providing humanitarian assistance to needy causes and people.  Students
who struggle financially while seeking to reach educational goals can identify with the desire to
eventually obtain financial independence.  Some might even dream of a day when they can quit
working and just rest in the lap of luxury.  But what might be the cost of acquiring such
economic objectives?  How much is it really worth?  An interesting insight was provided in an
article written by two ministers serving in New York State.</p>
<p><em>"We once heard of a CEO who spoke at his retirement dinner to a group of young
executives.  He said, `I know you want my job, and I'll tell you how to get it.  Last week
my daughter was married, and as she walked down the aisle, I realized I did not know the
name of her best friend, or the last book she read, or her favorite color.  That's the price
I paid for this job.  If you want to pay that price, you can have it."  </em>("How Do You Find
God", <u>Reader's Digest</u>, April 2002, 97-98)</p>
<p>Many young people focus on the development of athletic abilities and seek to build on a
foundation of athletic opportunities with varying levels of accompanying rewards.  They see
talented athletes demonstrate their specialty skills under competitive conditions.  Vast audiences
applaud their accomplishments, their names are frequently mentioned in common conversation,
and their images are sometimes projected to unnumbered viewers worldwide.  Many gifted
athletes are recipients of accolades and adulation that might better be reserved for legitimate
heroes.  Because of their popularity, they become advertising spokespersons and role models in
social, educational and professional environments.  Sometimes emulation of athletes even
extends to dimensions of their personal lives that are not exemplary or praiseworthy but serve as
undesirable foundations that create an inappropriate influence upon unwary or unthinking youth. 
Many other people are obsessed  observers of sporting activities and, often at the expense of
personal, family or even spiritual needs, spend an inordinate amount of time and resources in
viewing,  reading and discussing current sporting events. </p>
<p>Certain other people effectively develop their talents in building on a foundation of music and
either perform or, by other meaningful ways, provide stimulating musical experiences for the
edifying enjoyment of themselves and others.  Such artists bless the lives of many of us as they
share their natural and developed talents.  But sometimes their own lives are so narrowly focused
on their foundation of music that they fail to frame another more essential structure on a more
sure and eternal foundation.
<br wp="BR1" /><br wp="BR2" />These and many other endeavors and objectives may be worthy of our dedicated efforts.  But a
legitimate and scriptural concern is that, by themselves, they must not be the more weighty
matters of our mortal lives.  They must not be on the top of our list of priorities.  Rather, they
should be secondary supplements to our personal commitments to divine directives that more
accurately define proper perspectives.</p>
<p>Listen to the words of  Helaman, as he counseled his sons on this critical issue:</p>
<p><em>"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our
Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that
when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no
power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of
the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
whereon if men build <strong>they cannot fall</strong>"</em>  (Helaman 5:12, emphasis added).</p>
<p>None of us want to fall or fail.  So it behooves us to know <strong>how to build</strong> on our Redeemer as the
only sure and safe foundation.  The scriptures are clear and the way is simple.  The way to build
on the Savior's sure foundation is to develop a faith and trust in His words and teachings.  We
then are certain of protection from the deceptive and spiritually destructive powers of the
adversary.  Let me share a few examples of this eternal principle.</p>
<p>One day a young woman came to my office wanting help with a problem.  I asked what it was. 
She said she was pregnant but not married.  Furthermore, she did not want to be pregnant or be
married.  She wanted an abortion.  She claimed to have prayed a lot about what she should do,
but didn't seem to get any answers to her prayers.  I told her the answer to her prayer was in my
file cabinet.  I took out a statement by the First Presidency and read to her what the Lord thinks
about His children aborting their children.  The Lord had already revealed through His prophet
the position of heaven on that subject.  All she needed to do was to trust Him and thereby avoid
the resultant regrets and sorrow that always accompany decisions that are contrary to the Lord's
teaching.  When she finally decided against the wisdom of having an abortion, she began at that
same moment to build on the only sure and safe foundation.</p>
<p>One time a young man wanted to talk with me about whether he should go on a mission.  His girl
friend didn't want him to go, suggesting instead that he should wait until after they were married
and retired and then go together.  She insisted that it would be selfish of him to go without her. 
In her eyes, such a decision would mean he didn't really love her and she wouldn't wait for him. 
He thought that he loved the girl and just couldn't decide what he should do.  I told him the Lord
had already declared through a latter-day prophet that "every young man is as much obligated to
go on a mission as he is to pay his tithing, attend his meetings, keep the Sabbath day holy, and
keep his life spotless and clean" (Spencer W. Kimball, <u>Address to Seminary and Institute
Faculty,BYU</u>. June 28, 1968).  To build his life on a sure and safe foundation, this young man
would need to trust the Lord's judgment, faithfully serve his mission, and ignore any opinion that
would persuade him to go contrary to divine counsel.  He subsequently told the girl he was
determined to follow prophetic counsel and would be going on a mission.  He hoped she could
support that decision because he would only marry a girl who honored those same commitments.</p>
<p>A Jewish lady had studied the gospel of Jesus Christ and struggled with the decision whether she
should join the church.  After considerable pondering and praying, she was converted to the
Lord, was baptized into His church, and then wrote the following summary of her experience:</p>
<p><em>"There are times when people feel that the best advice is to listen to their own
inner voice, moving with it as they are led by it, forgetting that their own
reasoning is not a divine voice and can never be a safe guide to behavior.  Human
reason is only what we have accumulated in knowledge about our morals and our
choices.  Even with experience of life, reason alone is never enough to guide us. 
We need divine help...."</em>  (<u>Notes of a Jewish Convert to the LDS Church</u>).</p>
<p>She discovered the value of trusting the divine voice as the only way she could build on a sure
foundation.</p>
<p>Sometimes we forget to apply this principle when we wrestle with some of the common
problems we all encounter while striving to keep our covenants and be worthy in the sight of the
Lord.  Here are four examples:</p>
<p>1.  How do we decide whether to participate in work and recreational activities on the
Sabbath or to worship the Lord and keep the Sabbath day holy?</p>
<p>2.  How do we decide whether to pay bills or tithing when there doesn't appear to be
enough money to do both?</p>
<p>3.  How do we decide whether to view certain videos and/or movies when there is
objectionable material in them?</p>
<p>4.  How do we decide whether to be honest in our exams and assignments when there is
pressure to receive a high grade and an opportunity to obtain information inappropriately?</p>
<p>We will always be found building on a sure foundation if we simply determine the will of the
Lord on these matters and then make His will our own.</p>
<p>Listen to the promises made to those who trust in the Lord as Alma bore his testimony to his son
Helaman.  He said:</p>
<p><em>"I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their
trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last
day."</em>  (Alma 36:3)</p>
<p>Some years ago, a dear friend in Southern California called me at my office in Salt Lake and
asked if I would give him a blessing the next time I came to his area.  We made arrangements to
meet and then he told me what his need was.  His wife was suffering with a terminal illness and
he needed to know from the Lord what kind of faith he needed to have.  He wondered if he
should seek to develop sufficient faith to heal his wife of her illness through the administration of
a priesthood blessing.  Or, if she was not to be healed, he would need faith to accept the Lord's
decision that he might plead for strength to comfort her and provide whatever assistance she
needed to get through the illness.  Either way he would trust the Lord's will - he just needed to
know what it was.  This brother built on a safe foundation.  I am a witness that he subsequently
received the support Alma promised.</p>
<p>There is an account in the Book of Mormon of the Nephite armies marching against a vastly
greater Lamanite force who were entrenched in cities built by the Nephites and previously
fortified by them.  Though they faced overwhelming odds, still the Nephites confronted their
enemies with unwavering confidence in a favorable  outcome.  Why?  Listen to their own words
of explanation:</p>
<p><em>"...we trust in our God...we trust God will deliver us, notwithstanding the
weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies."</em> 
(Alma 58:33,37)</p>
<p>Like the Nephites, many of you have faced challenges and made difficult decisions that dealt
with life-altering or even life-threatening consequences.  Even though we often don't see how
favorable results can be obtained, we should remember to build on the only sure foundation by
following the only safe course:  <u>Trust the Lord.</u></p>
<p>I am remembering a wonderful latter-day Saint woman who came seeking the Lord's counsel
through a priesthood blessing.  She explained that she was happily expecting her third or fourth
child but had been told by three different doctors that because of unsafe conditions that were
developing in her pregnancy, she must abort her baby.  She was told that failure to do so right
away would most certainly result in the death of her unborn child and most likely would take her
life as well.  After explaining why she had come, and prior to receiving the priesthood blessing,
she made the following statement: "God himself would have to tell me to destroy this baby
before I would do it."  Several months later, I was seated on the stand in a ward Fast and
Testimony meeting.  I watched, and wept, as this mother placed her baby in the arms of her
priesthood husband, who then gave that precious infant child a name and a father's blessing.  Do
you suppose she will ever regret having trusted God and followed His foundation-building
counsel?</p>
<p>There is another matter that has attracted the feelings of my heart.  Many single sisters in the
Church have despaired because they have not had opportunity to marry and be sealed to a worthy
spouse for time and eternity.  Though they live worthy lives, many feel they have been forgotten
and the Lord has failed to provide them the opportunity to experience family relationships with
husband and children.  Some of them think of themselves as second-class citizens in the Lord's
Kingdom and sometimes resent hearing sermons or testimonies on the subject of eternal families. 
They wonder how they can ever hope to enjoy the fullness of the gospel blessings.  Similarly,
some marriage partners find themselves alone in their faithful efforts to keep their marriage
covenants.  Though they strive to maintain the Lord's standards of celestial marriage, their
companion fails to live the covenants upon which eternal blessings are predicated.  Under these
circumstances the faithful spouse may also lose hope of ever  receiving the glorious blessings
promised at the sacred marriage altar.</p>
<p>It may not appear possible and we may not see how such problems can be resolved.  It would be
well for these dear saints to be reminded of the Lord's promise of Eternal Life to all who keep
the baptismal covenant. (See Mosiah 18:9)  Though all of us know that Eternal Life, or
Exaltation, cannot be obtained without entering into and keeping eternal marriage covenants, we
must remember that the Lord made that promise to His worthy and faithful covenant children. 
Trust Him to keep His covenant if we keep ours.  How or when the promises unfold may not be
apparent now.  But we do know that all faithful saints who build on that sure foundation are safe
in their anticipation of being glorified with their own loving family members throughout all
eternity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord's blessings are delayed until and unless we first do what we can do. Divine
intervention seldom precedes the fulfillment of our duties and responsibilities. Rather, the
bestowal of blessings commonly accompanies our own  efforts to accomplish worthy goals.  
		</p>
<p>Many of you will remember Nephi's testimony when he said:</p>
<p><em>"...we know that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do"</em>  (2 Nephi
25:23, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Among other things, that statement tells me that we must put forth our best effort in doing what
we can to bring about righteous results before we can expect the Lord to extend His efforts in
providing desired blessings.  First we place our trust in Him; then we heed and obey His counsel. 
We do what we can do with confidence that He will honor the promises He has made to us.</p>
<p>Many years ago, a bishop friend of mine took about a dozen scouts on a camping trip in
Yellowstone Park for several days.  They traveled in canoes across a very large lake to get to
their camp area on its far shore.  After being there a few days, they heard a radio message
warning campers of an early season storm moving into the area.  It would bring snow and cold
temperatures.  The bishop decided they should cut short their camp and leave for home the next
morning.  However, by morning, the winds accompanying the storm had already come and were
creating very dangerous water conditions on the lake, especially for young boys in canoes.</p>
<p>The bishop delayed their departure, hoping the wind would calm down.  He went into the woods
two or three times to plead for the Lord to calm the winds.  While pleading for this blessing the
bishop received a very distinct impression from the Lord.  It was simply, "Bishop, what are you
waiting for"?   He knew what to do.  He loaded the boys and their camp equipment into the
canoes and pushed the canoes out into the wind-whipped lake water.  As they left the safety of
the shore, the wind ceased to blow, the air was still, and the lake became calm.  After crossing
the lake and arriving safely on the other side, they all knelt to thank the Lord for His miraculous
assistance.  Each of them learned a valuable lesson.  When you trust in the Lord, He may expect
you to move ahead and take steps in the right direction before His blessing is bestowed.  There
wasn't any reason for the Lord to calm the wind on the lake while they were still sitting on the
shore.</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob described the efforts of the Nephites as they sought to
protect their people from their Lamanite enemies.  Note how they fulfilled their responsibilities
while they built on a sure foundation of trust in their God.  Jacob recorded:</p>
<p><em>"Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against [the Lamanites] with their
arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation;
wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies"</em>  (Jacob 7:25,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>I remember a saintly sister who once told me of her mother's experience as a young girl in
Switzerland before her family immigrated to America in the late 1800's.  The family had joined
the church and decided to come to Utah where they could mingle with the saints and be close to
the prophet.  As a result of their decisions, they experienced a lot of persecution from the people
who lived in their small town.</p>
<p>The night before their planned departure, the young daughter was walking alone up the hill to her
home.  As she walked by two men who were working alongside the road, she overheard one of
them say, "Isn't that the Mormon girl that is leaving tomorrow?  She's alone and we can easily
catch her."  She began to run but she could tell they were running faster and would catch her long
before she could reach her home.  As she ran, she poured out her heart to Heavenly Father, telling
Him that she had always kept herself pure and begged that He help her escape from the men who
were coming after her.  The next thing she knew, she was standing alone on the front porch of
her home.  She didn't know how she got there, but she knew some power had done for her what
she could not have done for herself.  As Helaman had promised his sons, this young woman
found that building on the Lord's sure foundation brought her a literal escape from the powers of
the adversary.  She, like Jacob's people, found that trusting in God made possible the conquering
of her enemies.</p>
<p>Frequently in our society, controversial issues arise involving the church.  With regularity, people
in and out of the church can be heard to criticize the church by saying, "The church is out of
line", or they refer to the church doctrine on the subject as being too strict.  It seems to me the
real problem is a lack of trust in God.  Instead of speaking of church doctrine, it should be called
the Lord's doctrine.  The church's position on a matter would be better described as the Lord's
position.  Then it becomes clear that one must take a stand either in favor of or in opposition to
the Lord.  Should we not be wise and build our trust on the rock of Christ, the one sure
foundation?</p>
<p>Now, may I refer you back to the four questions we raised earlier.  I will repeat each question and
then quote a statement from the Lord's anointed servants.  We are then free to determine our own
level of trust.</p>
<p>1.  How do we decide whether to participate in work and recreational activities on the Sabbath or
to worship the Lord and keep the Sabbath day holy?</p>
<p><u></u><u>From the First Presidency:<br /></u><em>"We sense that many Latter-day Saints have become lax in their observance of the
Sabbath day.  We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating
in other commercial and sporting activities that now commonly desecrate the
Sabbath.</em></p>
<p><em>"We urge all Latter-day Saints to set this holy day apart from activities of the
world and consecrate themselves by entering into a spirit of worship,
thanksgiving, service, and family-centered activities appropriate to the Sabbath. 
As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with
the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace." 
				</em>(<u>First Presidency Letter</u>, Sept. 28, 1992)</p>
<p>2.  How do we decide whether to pay bills or tithing when there doesn't appear to be enough
money to do both?</p>
<p><u>From Elder George Q. Cannon Assistant to the Quorum of Twelve:<br />
</u><em>"I think when people say they haven't money enough to pay tithing, they should
say they haven't faith enough to pay tithing.  It is my conviction that we pay
tithing with faith and not with money..."</em> (<u>Conf Report</u>, Apr `53, 111)</p>
<p><u>From President Joseph F. Smith:<br /></u><em>"By this principle [of tithing] the loyalty of the people of this Church shall be put
to the test.  By this principle it shall be known who is for the kingdom of God and
who is against it.  By this principle it shall be seen whose hearts are set on doing
the will of God and keeping His commandments,...by it it shall be known whether
we are faithful or unfaithful.  In this respect it is as essential as faith in God, as
repentance of sin, as baptism for the remission of sin, or as the laying on of hands
for the gift of the Holy Ghost."</em>  (<u>Conf Report</u>, Apr 1900, 47)</p>
<p>3.  How do we decide whether to view certain videos and/or movies when there is objectionable
material in them?</p>
<p><u>From President Ezra Taft Benson:<br /></u><em>"Consider carefully the words of the prophet Alma to his errant son, Corianton,
`Forsake kyour sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes' (Alma 39:9).</em></p>
<p><em>"`The lusts of your eyes.'  In our day, what does that expression mean?</em></p>
<p><em>"Movies, television programs, and video recordings that are both suggestive and
lewd.</em></p>
<p><em>"Magazines and books that are obscene and pornographic.</em></p>
<p><em>"We counsel you,...not to pollute your minds with such degrading matter, for the
mind through which this filth passes is never the same afterward.  Don't see R-rated movies or vulgar videos or participate in any entertainment that is immoral,
suggestive, or pornographic.  Don't listen to music that is degrading."</em>  (<u>Conf
Report</u>, Apr 1986, 58).</p>
<p>4.  How do we decide whether to be honest in our exams and assignments when there is pressure
to receive a high grade and an opportunity to obtain information dishonestly?</p>
<p><u>From President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br /></u><em>"Simple honesty is so remarkable a quality.  It is of the very essence of integrity. 
It demands that we be straightforward, unequivocal, in walking the straight and
narrow line of what is right and true.  It is so easy to cheat.  At times it is so
enticing to do so.  Better a poor grade than a dishonest act."</em> (<u>BYU Speeches of
the Year</u>, October 17, 1995, 53)</p>
<p>Might each of us remember, with King Mosiah, that the Lord extends His arms of mercy to those
who put their trust in Him.  (See Mosiah 29:20) Who amongst us does not need an extension of
His mercy?  I testify those arms are real.  I know they are extended in welcoming each one who
has trusted Him and has built upon the rock of His sure foundation.  As each day of our lives
comes to a close may I suggest that we reflect upon our life that day.  It is my hope that, as we
kneel in benediction before the Lord, we can raise our voices and declare as Nephi when he said,
		<em>"O Lord, I have trusted in thee..."</em> (2 Ne. 4:34)</p>
<p>While the world around us is in a terrible state of strife and turmoil, we all desire peace. The
world cannot currently experience peace but individually we can.  We can obtain it the same way
the Prince of Peace did.  And what was that way?  Listen to what I believe was the greatest
tribute ever paid to Jesus by mortal man.  It was inadvertently declared by His mocking and
reviling enemies as He hung on the cross in the closing moments of His atoning sacrifice.  They
said, <em>"He trusted in God..."</em>  (Matt. 27:43) May we do as He did, I humbly pray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">We are honored to be in your presence today on the campus of Brigham Young
University-Idaho.  My wife, Connie, commenced her college years here at Ricks College, just a
few miles from her hometown of St. Anthony.  Both of her parents graduated from this
institution, and two of our children attended Ricks College. </p>
<p><font color="#000080">We were privileged to have served with three marvelous mission presidents and their wives in
the Europe East Area who are members of this faculty: John and Carol Galbraith of the Russia
Novosibirsk Mission, Robert and Barbara Schwartz of the Russia Rostov a Danu Mission, and
Brent and Karolyn Strong of the Slovenia Ljubljana Mission.  These faithful and dynamic leaders
served under challenging circumstances as do all pioneers.  They truly loved their missionaries,
the local members and leaders, the countries and cultures where they served, and their
BYU-Idaho.  Immeasurable but everlasting are the contributions they have made in these nations
so recently opened to the ongoing restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">By way of introduction to the subject of my talk - the power and blessings from prayer - I would
like to share with you a recent experience.  Last November I received a telephone message that
one of our great Utah Provo missionaries and a superb missionary leader urgently wanted to talk
with his mission president.  I was informed that Aaron Alley would be undergoing major brain
surgery in a few days to remove a mass on his brain stem.  Reportedly his survival from this
complicated surgery was uncertain.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In a few moments I was able to reach Aaron's mother, Linda.  She informed me that he was a
second-year student at the University of Oklahoma Medical School earning straight A's.  She
gave me his telephone number, and soon Connie and I were talking with our beloved missionary. 
We then learned that the immediate surgery was intended to deal with a congenital defect
whereby the brain stem extends too far down to the spinal column causing dizziness, restriction
in head movements, and potential interruption of blood flow.  For the time being, the abnormal
brain tissue would be observed and dealt with in later surgery and radiation.  The surgeons now
needed to correct and realign the tilting brain stem.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As he faced this major surgery, Aaron turned to those nearest to him for counsel, encouragement,
and spiritual strength.  One of them questioned the intervening value of faith and prayer in his
behalf, saying, "If the Lord wants you here, He will keep you here; otherwise He won't.  What
difference can I make?"  Aaron quickly responded, "Am I going to make it, I don't know.  But I
do know that God will respond to people's faith and answer their prayers.  You are not leaving
room for the exercise of faith and the power of prayer."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The faith and prayers of those of us close to Aaron coupled with those offered in the temples of
the Lord and those of various faiths in churches throughout his relatively small hometown of
Woodward, Oklahoma, combined to prolong his life, enabled him to return to his medical school
studies, and look unafraid to the future.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">While we ponder upon Aaron Alley's confident response to his doubting friend, recall the
instruction Jesus gave as recorded in the Book of Mark. As Jesus and His disciples came to
Jerusalem, Peter noticed and commented about the now withered fig tree that Jesus had cursed
the previous day.  The Master then used this as a teaching moment:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">...Have faith in God.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall
believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
whatsoever he saith.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that
ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em> (Mark 11:22-24).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Angel Gabriel, when informing the startled Mary of her sacred calling that she would
conceive through the power of the Holy Ghost and the Highest and be the mother of the Son of
God, restated an eternal principle:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For with God nothing shall be impossible</em> (Luke 1:37).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On another continent distant from Palestine, the final abridger of those records that in latter days
would produce the Book of Mormon issued an assuring invitation.  Moroni promised us that
when we ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, and do so with a sincere heart, with
real intent, having faith in Christ, he will enable us through the power of the Holy Ghost, to know
the truth of all things (Moroni 10:4-5).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Recently in a Sacrament meeting at our Las Vegas, Nevada, ward, the speaker read a cute but
instructive poem from the December 28, 2001, issue of the <em>Intermountain Farm and Ranch</em>
newsletter entitled "An Ode to Jake the Frozen Rancher."  I would like to share its important
message with you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jake the Rancher went one day to fix a distant fence.<br />The wind was cold and gusty, and the clouds rolled gray and dense.<br />As he pounded the last staples in and gathered the tools to go,<br />The temperature had fallen, and the snow began to blow.<br />When he finally reached the pickup, he felt a heavy heart.<br />From the sound of the ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.<br />Jake did what most of us would do if we would've been there;<br />He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.<br />As he turned the key for the last time, he softly bemoaned his luck.<br />They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.<br />Now Jake had been around in life and done his share of roamin'.<br />He was shocked when he saw Heaven, it looked just like Wyomin'!<br />Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter.<br />Now this line ain't much needed, but it helps with rhyme and meter.<br />So they sat and talked a minute, or maybe it was three.<br />Nobody was keepin' score; in heaven, time is free.<br />I've always heard," said Jake to Pete, "that God will answer prayer.<br />But one time when I asked for help, He just plain wasn't there."<br />Does God answer prayers of some and ignore the prayers of others?<br />That don't seem exactly fair.  I know that men are brothers."<br />Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?<br />Maybe it's the time of day, the weather, or the season?"<br />Now I ain't tryin' to act smart.  It's just the way I feel.<br />I was wonderin', could you tell me what's the deal?"<br />Peter listened patiently and when old Jake was done,<br />There were smiles of recognition, and he said, "So you're the one!"<br />That day your truck, it wouldn't start, and you sent your prayers a flying,<br />You gave us a real bad time with hundreds of us trying."<br />A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,<br />But Jake, you know, we hadn't heard from you in quite a while."<br />And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota,<br />He didn't recognize you voice, so he started a truck in North Dakota!"<br />(<em>Intermountain Farm and Ranch</em>, 28 December 2001).</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Certainly we do not want to be prayer strangers to Heavenly Father.  It is essential that we keep
the lines of communication to Him open and free of static if we expect Him to respond to our
earnest pleadings in time of need.  If we have not been praying regularly, we will likely not be
capable of recognizing and hearing God's answer through the still, small voice.  By consistent,
frequent prayer, we learn how to dial ourselves into the finely tuned spiritual frequency through
which He communicates to us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">No one of us would ever want to endure the humbling experience of the ungrateful Brother of
Jared.  After having granted both of his requests: first, that the language of Jared, the Brother of
Jared, their families and friends, not be confounded, and second, that they be brought forth to a
land choice above all the earth, the Lord waited in vain for four years to receive an expression of
gratitude and communication from the Brother of Jared.  The Lord then uniquely initiated a visit
and for three long hours talked to and chastened the Brother of Jared "because he remembered
not to call upon the name of the Lord" (Ether 2:14).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then in words much stronger than Peter's admonition to Jake the frozen rancher, the Lord both
comforted and warned the now repentant Brother of Jared:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>...I will forgive thee and they brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin
anymore, for ye shall remember that my spirit will not always strive with man;
wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence
of God</em> (Ether 2:15).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What a tragedy it would be indeed if through our failure to daily utilize the gift of access to
Divinity we would deprive ourselves of that access in time of need.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One day a missionary and his companion came to my office to relate a special teaching
experience and daunting challenge.  Upon referral of a wonderful family in Provo, they had
taught the discussions to Viktoria, a foreign exchange student they said came from Russia.  This
remarkable family had welcomed Viktoria into their home where she was treated lovingly like
the other children.  At school Viktoria was introduced to their friends who likewise befriended
her.  Viktoria accepted the invitation to attend Church with them.  Again she was embraced with
inclusion and warmth.  A special spirit came upon Viktoria as she experienced newly-found
peace and happiness.  Wanting to know the source of this happiness so evident in her friends,
classmates, and the host family, Viktoria's inquiry led to meeting the missionaries and having the
restored gospel of Jesus Christ unveiled to her.  Enthusiastically, Viktoria accepted the invitation
to be baptized.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There was a major obstacle, however, that stood in the way.  Because Viktoria was under the age
of 18, and, additionally, due to a provision in the foreign exchange agreement, baptism could not
occur without approval of her parents.  Viktoria had written a letter to them twice requesting
consent to her baptism.  Her parents declined each request.  They did not want their daughter to
be taken in by what they believed was a strange American religious cult.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The missionaries informed me that the ward members, her friends, and the missionaries were
holding a special fast and prayers for Viktoria to soften the hearts of her parents so that they
would permit their daughter to be baptized.  I was invited to join with them and was pleased to
do so.  Monday morning the missionaries excitedly came to see me.  Victoria had received - not
a letter - but a telephone call from her father giving consent by her parents to be baptized and
also wishing her a happy birthday.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">We all knew that the Lord had responded to the fasting and prayers offered in behalf of Viktoria. 
Unbeknownst to us, we soon learned that the stake mission president in Provo had been
impressed to telephone the full-time mission president where Viktoria's parents lived and inform
him of the situation.  He requested that the mission president send two of his best missionaries to
try and meet with Viktoria's parents, tell them about the Church, and seek to resolve their
concerns.  The parents were so impressed with the personal appearance and message of the
missionaries who came to their apartment that they agreed to her baptism and called their
daughter to extend their approval.  There proceeded a wonderful baptismal service.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">About three years later, Connie and I were touring the Ukraine Donetsk Mission.  During an
evening meeting with members and visitors in the southern Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, I
felt impressed to tell this conversion and baptism story of Viktoria.  At the conclusion of the
meeting, a tall man came up to see me.  He said he enjoyed hearing the story of Viktoria and
thought I would like to know more.  He then introduced himself as Viktoria's father.  Confirming
all that I had said about the positive impression made upon him and his wife by the missionaries,
he then revealed further events.  They were so impressed with the feelings, attitude, and
happiness of their daughter when she returned home from America that they asked for the
missionaries to come to their home and teach them.  They too were baptized.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then, with tears in his eyes, Viktoria's father related another amazing event that had recently
occurred.  The father of the host family with whom Viktoria had lived in Provo, upon learning
that this good man would be receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, had traveled all the way from
Provo to Dnipropetrovsk to bestow it upon Viktoria's father and ordain him an elder.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This was truly a testament to the power of faith, prayer, and fasting that brought about everlasting
results for Viktoria and her family far beyond the expectations of those involved.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many years ago I was engaged in the practice of law with a small law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Though extremely happy and comfortable with life in Arizona and our special ward and dear
Church friends, Connie and I harbored a troubling concern.  How were we ever going to earn
enough money to provide a college education for our then five young children?  We were not
earning very much and future prospects were uncertain.  In this quandary of worry and
consequent unhappiness, we sought for direction from Heavenly Father.  For two years, Connie
and I fasted and prayed each month with a specific purpose seeking inspiration and an
employment opportunity to resolve our concern.  At the conclusion of each fast day of
supplication, we both received the same impression--be patient and it will all work out.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sure enough, over a two-year period an incredible sequence of amazing events occurred that
culminated in the uprooting of our family from the comforts of Phoenix to move across the
country to Midland, Michigan, and accept a position as an attorney in The Dow Chemical
Company Legal Department.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord generously blessed our family both spiritually and temporally as it expanded to eight
children.  Abundant opportunities to serve in our developing ward and stake as well as a
remarkable community permitted us to grow and contribute as valued members and citizens. 
During the ensuing twenty-seven years of working for Dow Chemical and living in Michigan,
Switzerland, and Italy, we often reflected upon the many experiences and blessings that had
transpired in our lives and knew of a surety that Heavenly Father had responded to our fervent
fasting and prayers.  We also knew that we had been transplanted to Michigan where the Lord
wanted us to be to assist in the growth and image of the Church in Michigan.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some of you may be familiar with the game of dominoes.  You may have also seen the beautiful
and interesting patterns that result when by creative arrangements and designs, hundreds of
dominoes stand and then fall in programmed sequence.  In our situation, all of the dominoes of
discontent, fasting and prayer, patience, and unfolding of amazing events had to occur in their
right sequence so that they could then fall into place and cause us to be where the Lord wanted us
to be.  The key domino or trigger was that we had to be sufficiently worried and unhappy in order
to be prepared to accept an unanticipated relocation that we in and of ourselves would not have
planned.  Had we been totally happy in Phoenix, the dominoes would have remained standing
and the blessings and opportunities awaiting us would have never been realized.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Several millennia prior to our humble but profound personal experience, the Lord caused his
purposes to be accomplished for another family through a similar process.  God wanted Joseph to
be in Egypt holding a high governmental position with the Pharaoh so that he could save his
family many years later from a future famine in the land of Canaan.  The series of events that
brought Joseph to Egypt and to the position of authority second only to Pharaoh were remarkable
and replete with adversities and trials of his faith in God.  Although beloved by his father, Jacob,
and his mother, Rachel, Joseph was intensely hated by his ten older brothers.  This did not make
for ideal family relations.  Most of the brothers sought to outright kill him, but did concede to
accept Reuben's alternative plan that Joseph be cast into a pit to slowly die of hunger.  The
mercenary nature of Judah then prompted them to remove Joseph from the pit and sell him
eventually into Egyptian slavery.  Though at first elevated in status to a prominent position by his
master, Potiphar, he was falsely accused of immoral actions by Potiphar's wife and unjustly
imprisoned for several years.  Nevertheless, during all of these difficult events and years, Joseph
grew in faith and favor with God, his fellow men, and important Egyptian leaders.  This brought
him position, prosperity, and power.  It also was accomplishing the purposes of the Lord.  Joseph
was placed in a commanding position not only to save his own immediate family from the
famine, but ultimately the children of Israel, their descendants.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Undoubtedly, Joseph had prayed for freedom from the pit, from the enmity of his brethren, and
from the Egyptian prison.  In responding to his prayers, God did so in His own way and for His
own purposes.  A great lesson to learn in life is that our plans are not always God's plans.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many centuries later in answer to the pleadings of a distraught latter-day Joseph who was
languishing in an obscure Missouri prison and separated from his family, Joseph Smith was
lovingly consoled and counseled by the Lord:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>...know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be
for thy good</em> (D&amp;C 122:7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a
small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou
shalt triumph over all thy foes</em> (D&amp;C 121:7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What a comforting and exhilarating message!  So it is and can be with each of us if we are
valiant and faithful and allow adversities and disappointments to ripen into blessings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Though we are expected to do all that we can do in preparing for and planning our life's pursuits,
we should remain flexible to allow unscheduled changes to occur in our lives so that the Lord,
the Master Planner, can use us as instruments in His hands to achieve His greater purposes. 
Paraphrasing God's words to Moses when taken to and transfigured on an exceedingly high
mountain:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>...I have a work for thee...my son</em> [or daughter] 
			<em>to do</em> (Moses 1:6).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Another illustration of this principle is drawn from the dreadful experience of Abraham while in
Chaldea, the land of his fathers.  The priests of Pharaoh sought to take his life upon the altar by
Potiphar's hill as a sacrifice to their false gods.  As the priest prepared to slay him, Abraham
prayed to the Lord and an angel from His presence unloosed the bands that bound Abraham.  The
Lord proceeded to destroy the altar and smote to death the priest of Elkenah.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Not only did the Lord save Abraham's life, but He blessed him far beyond his immediate request,
as He so often does for us in our lives.  Abraham was filled with a vision of the Almighty who
declared He was his God and informed Abraham that he would be taken to a land of which he
had no knowledge, that he would be guided by the Lord, that he would receive the priesthood,
that the power of the Lord would be over him, and that through the ministry of Abraham, the
Lord would be known in the earth forever (see Abraham 1:15-20).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Frequently as a mission president I had the opportunity to conduct pre-baptism interviews with
those choice souls who had received and accepted all of the pre-baptism missionary discussions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I well remember interviewing a 20-year-old young man from southern California who had moved
to Cedar City, Utah.  During the interview, past transgression was disclosed and discussed.  We
talked about the principles of repentance and the blessing of forgiveness.  I inquired as to
whether he felt he had been forgiven.  Hesitantly he replied that he thought he had been forgiven. 
Upon asking him who it is that forgives us for our sins, he correctly responded, "Jesus Christ." 
Then I asked him if he had asked Jesus to forgive him.  He frankly acknowledged not having
done so.  "Well, if Jesus is to grant your desire to be forgiven, don't you think you should ask
Him?" I inquired.  "I suppose so," was his reply.  We both agreed that he needed to have a few
days to take the steps needed to obtain forgiveness and feel the sweet relief that comes from
completed repentance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To assist the young man in this quest, we talked about prayer and Joseph Smith's first uttered
prayer in the Sacred Grove.  I pointed out the value of earnest, sincere, and concentrated prayer
when offered vocally.  Suggestion was made that he read from Joseph Smith's history in the
Pearl of Great Price and also the account of the appearance of the resurrected Savior to the
Nephites in 3 Nephi 11.  In particular, he was encouraged to focus upon and pray about Jesus's
invitation to be baptized as he sought to achieve complete repentance and gain forgiveness from
the Savior who had sacrificed His mortal life for our sins and transgressions.  My young friend
was anxious to follow the suggested course of action.  We set a date and time a few days later for
a followup visit and interview.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Soon the appointed hour arrived and we met again.  I asked the young man to review with me
what had transpired since our prior visit.  He stated that he first had sought a quiet place to pray
undisturbed.  Because he lived in an apartment building with other young men, there was no
quiet spot there to be found.  He decided to drive a few miles up the canyon.  There he located a
secluded place in the woods.  He sat down on a rock and proceeded to read the suggested
scriptures.  Then he knelt down and prayed aloud asking that Jesus Christ would forgive him and
that he would feel worthily prepared to be baptized.  Upon concluding his prayer, he resumed his
scripture reading and prayed again.  A warm feeling came over him.  He strongly felt that his
repentance was acceptable to the Savior, that he had been forgiven, and that he was now prepared
to be baptized.  I told him I shared his feelings and approved his baptism.  My young friend was
so happy and relieved that he had been provided the opportunity to be properly prepared for his
baptism.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I concluded by having him read from Doctrine and Covenants Section 58, verses 43 and 42 in
that reversed order:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins -- behold, he will confess them
and forsake them.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I the Lord,
remember them no more</em> (D&amp;C 58:43, 42).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Emphasis was placed upon the Lord's statement that he would forgive him and forget his sins. 
My young friend then realized and remarked that he too must forgive himself, forget the past, and
move on with his newborn life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This young man, as it is with so many others who navigate the path of repentance to forgiveness,
could personally rejoice in knowing that his pleadings had been answered by He who had invited
us to:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light</em> (Matthew 11:28-30).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When the Savior was in the Garden of Gethsemane enduring the agony of drinking the bitter cup
given Him by appointment from the Father and was thereby taking upon Himself the sins of the
world, He admonished the sleeping Peter:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">...What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: The spirit indeed is willing, but
the flesh is weak</em> (Matthew 26:40-41; see also Mark 14:37-38; Luke 22:40, 46).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Following His institution of the ordinance of the sacrament to the Nephites in remembrance of
His atoning sacrifice, the resurrected Christ instructed them in similar but warning words:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted
by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him</em> (3 Nephi 18:15).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Through the Prophet Joseph Smith following a conference in September 1830 of the recently
restored Church of Jesus Christ, the Lord succinctly repeated this exhortation:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Pray always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward</em> (D&amp;C&nbsp;31:12).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now and then a missionary or member would come to visit with me troubled with guilt.  As we
sought to rebuild confidence of worth in this person and give assurance of hope through the
repentance process, effort was made to fortify him against any repetition of sin.  A very simple
preventative measure was frequently suggested.  Whenever inappropriate thoughts, urges, or
desires come unto one's mind, find a quiet place, kneel down and fervently pray to Father in
Heaven.  It is virtually impossible to entertain unclean thoughts and pursue immoral acts when
on one's knees praying in the presence of God.  I would offer this same counsel to you noble
young people to apply not only in your personal lives, but also in your dating and courtship
activities with a choice son or daughter of God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do not despoil your life and future and that of others by permitting temptation to deprive you of
your eternal reward.  Keep your thoughts and actions focused upon that sacred sealing room in
the House of the Lord.  There kneeling opposite your eternal sweetheart at the holy altar you will
look into the eyes of each other and know that you have both come together to be sealed for time
and eternity in a condition of personal purity and worthiness, having reserved yourselves for each
other.  There is no sweeter moment to be cherished in your entire lives.  You will be forever
grateful that you hearkened to the counsel of the Lord and His servants to resist and not fall prey
to temptation.  You will have secured and not lost your reward.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let us now summarize these eternal prayer principles:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to receive blessings from God we must ask Him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith and prayer are the keys to unlocking the vast storehouse of blessings that the
Lord has prepared for each of us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular daily prayers empower us to be spiritually attuned to hear and understand
the still small voice of Deity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bounties of blessings that come from sincere prayer are far more extensive
than we might ever imagine or anticipate.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adversities are frequently a conditioning means to sufficiently humble us and
thereby permit the Lord to bring about changes in our lives to serve His greater
purposes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent prayer practices insulate us from deceptive seduction by Satan and
draw us within the protective and directive care of our Heavenly Father.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">7.	Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, will respond to the pleadings of a broken
heart and a contrite spirit and extend forgiving relief and hope through the
matchless gift of His atoning sacrifice that washes clean and sanctifies the
repentant soul.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Of these principles and the power of divinity through a living God, His Only Begotten Son, and
their divine work that extends to us their greatest gift of eternal life, I testify in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</font></p>

</font></font></p>
<p>	Good morning, brothers and sisters, and welcome to our BYU-Idaho Education Week.  I
am confident you will be both edified and enriched by your experience on our campus this week.  
I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with me and with you as together we learn about
eternal and essential truths.</p>
<p>	My objective this morning is not to inform and certainly is not to entertain.  My sincere
desire is that together we will be challenged to examine our lives, to move to a higher spiritual
plane, and to yearn and strive for what I refer to as <strong>heartfelt and willing obedience</strong>
(D&amp;C&nbsp;64:34).</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Spirit of Ricks at BYU-Idaho</span></strong></p>
<p>	Our theme for Education Week this year is "BYU-Idaho Celebrates the Spirit of Ricks." 
A distinctive and powerful spirit, frequently referred to as the Spirit of Ricks, has long been
associated with this institution of higher education in Rexburg, Idaho.  Many people, including
students, employees, and visitors not connected with the university, have told me that they
quickly discerned something different and singular about this place--even as they first walked
onto the campus.  This rare quality--the Spirit of Ricks--is frequently described using
characteristics such as caring, concerned, warm, close, friendly, and individually attentive.  And
though I agree with those descriptions, I believe they are incomplete.  Let me suggest that the
Spirit of Ricks is in fact the Holy Ghost operating through genuine and loving people in a set
apart and sacred place.  It is this vital spiritual component of the Spirit of Ricks that makes it so
influential, so strong, so memorable, and so enduring.</p>
<p>	I have learned in my years as the president of this institution that one and only one key
unlocks the door and provides access to the Spirit of Ricks--and that key is obedience.  Only by
linking the principle of obedience to the Spirit of Ricks can we truly begin to understand and
celebrate this remarkable feature of what was Ricks College and what is now Brigham Young
University-Idaho.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Youth of the Church and the Principle of Obedience</span></strong></p>
<p>	In October of 1997 Elder Neal A. Maxwell visited our campus to speak in a devotional. 
Sister Bednar and I provided transportation to and from the Idaho Falls airport for Elder and
Sister Maxwell, and we hosted them in our home for lunch.  The time we spent with this mighty
apostle and his lovely wife before and after the devotional was invaluable, and the lessons we
learned were priceless.  As we talked together about a variety of gospel topics in general and the
youth of the Church in particular, Elder Maxwell made a statement that greatly impressed me. 
He said, "The youth of this generation have a greater capacity for obedience than any previous
generation."  He then indicated that his statement was based upon a principle taught by Elder
George Q. Cannon in the early days of the Restoration.  Please listen carefully to the following
statement by Elder Cannon:</p>
<p>		God has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage
and determination to face the world and all the powers of the evil
one, visible and invisible, to proclaim the Gospel and maintain the
truth and establish and build up the Zion of our God fearless of all
consequences.  He has sent these spirits in this generation to lay the
foundation of Zion never more to be overthrown and to raise up a
seed that will be righteous and that will honor God and honor Him
supremely and <strong>be obedient to Him under all circumstances</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Journal of Discourses</span>, 11:230 [May 6, 1866], emphasis added).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span>	We frequently are reminded by our church leaders that the young men and women of this
generation have been reserved for this day and are some of the most valiant of Heavenly Father's
children.  But these additional insights by Elders Cannon and Maxwell help us further to
understand that today's young people specifically are to be valiant and ". . . obedient to Him
under all circumstances."  Thus, obedience is the principal weapon upon which the young
warriors must rely in the latter-day battle between good and evil.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Obedience Operates at Different Levels</span></strong></p>
<p>	In the 42nd section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses one and two, we read:</p>
<p>		Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled
yourselves together in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the
living God, the Savior of the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my
name and keep my commandments.  </p>
<p>		Again I say unto you, <strong>hearken</strong> and <strong>hear</strong> and <strong>obey</strong> the law which I
shall give unto you (emphasis added).</p>
<p>	Please notice that the word <em>obey</em> in verse two is linked to both <em>hearing</em> and <em>hearkening</em>. 
Hearing is the process of giving an ear to, and hearkening connotes applying the mind to what
one hears.  Obeying, then, results from hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17, Alma 32) and
pondering (1 Nephi 11:1, Moroni 10:3) and "studying it out in [our] own minds" (D&amp;C 9:7).</p>
<p>	Brothers and sisters, obedience operates at a number of different levels.  Elder Bruce R.
McConkie has taught:</p>
<p>		Obedience is the first law of heaven, the cornerstone upon which
all righteousness and progression rest.  It consists in <strong>compliance</strong>
with divine law, in <strong>conformity</strong> to the mind and will of Deity, in
complete <strong>subjection</strong> to God and his commands.  To obey gospel
law is to yield obedience to the Lord, to execute the commands of
and be ruled by him whose we are (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mormon Doctrine</span>, p. 539,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>	Note how Elder McConkie includes the elements of <strong>compliance</strong>, <strong>conformity</strong>, and
<strong>subjection</strong> or <strong>submission</strong> in his description of obedience.  Let me suggest that each of these
three elements can be considered as a progressive level of obedience.  Thus, obedience is not
simply a passive steady state; rather, obedience must grow and develop and deepen and increase
and expand.  Our experience with and understanding of the principle of obedience should change
as we develop spiritually and as we gain additional light and knowledge--line upon line and
precept upon precept.  Also, our spiritual expectations should increase and intensify as we
continue to faithfully obey God's commandments.</p>
<p>	Let me now present a series of comparisons that illustrate how obedience operates at
different levels.  It is one thing to obey in order <span style="text-decoration: underline">to</span> qualify for and <span style="text-decoration: underline">receive blessings</span>; it is quite
another thing to obey as a preparation <span style="text-decoration: underline">to give</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">to serve more effectively</span>.  It is one thing to
merely and perhaps mechanically <span style="text-decoration: underline">comply</span> with God's commandments; it is quite another thing to
obey and thereby fully <span style="text-decoration: underline">subject</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">submit</span> oneself to the will and timetable of the Lord.  It is a
good thing to obey out of a sense of <span style="text-decoration: underline">duty</span>;  but it is an even greater thing, a more spiritually
demanding thing, to obey through <span style="text-decoration: underline">love</span>.  It is one thing to reluctantly or grudgingly <span style="text-decoration: underline">conform</span> to
commandments; it is a different thing to joyfully ". . . obey and observe to perform every word of
command with <span style="text-decoration: underline">exactness</span> . . ." (Alma 57:21) and cheerfully ". . . to <span style="text-decoration: underline">observe strictly</span> to keep the
commandments of God . . ." (Helaman 13:1).  It is one thing to perform the <span style="text-decoration: underline">outward actions</span> of
obedience; it is quite a different thing to <span style="text-decoration: underline">become inwardly</span> what the commandments are intended
to help us become.   It is one thing to obey the <span style="text-decoration: underline">institutional</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">public</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">shared</span> commandments
associated with the Lord's kingdom on earth--commandments such as the law of chastity, the
law of tithing, and the Word of Wisdom; it is an even greater thing to receive and respond to the
<span style="text-decoration: underline">individual</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">private</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">personally revealed</span> commandments that result from continual and
faithful obedience.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Commandments Not a Few</span></strong></p>
<p>	Please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants section 59, verses three and four.</p>
<p>		Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who
have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward <strong>the
good things of the earth</strong>, and it shall bring forth in its strength.</p>
<p>		And they shall also be crowned with <strong>blessings from above</strong>, yea,
and with <strong>commandments not a few</strong>, and with <strong>revelations in their
time</strong>--they that are faithful and diligent before me (emphasis
added).</p>
<p>	We learn in these verses that those who have obeyed the gospel shall receive the good
things of the earth, blessings from above, commandments not a few, and revelations in their time. 
In particular, I want to draw our attention to the phrase ". . . and with commandments not a
few&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."  Brothers and sisters, for the past few minutes I have attempted to differentiate
between obedience that is predominately complying and conforming in nature and a higher level
of obedience that includes spiritual submission and enables us to receive ". . . commandments
not a few . . . ."  Obedience that is primarily complying and conforming is good and is truly
obedience.  But the higher level of obedience I am trying to describe--an obedience that stretches
beyond the letter of the law and to the spirit of the law--is both<strong> heartfelt and willing</strong>.  And it
brings an individualized gospel insight and perspective and power that are precious beyond
measure.  As we read in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 34:</p>
<p>		Behold, the Lord requireth the <strong>heart</strong> and a willing mind; and the
<strong>willing</strong> and <strong>obedient</strong> shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these
last days (emphasis added).</p>
<p>	Closely associated with obeying with a willing heart is reaching a point where we no
longer are driven or directed by <span style="text-decoration: underline">rules</span>; instead, we learn to govern our lives by <span style="text-decoration: underline">principle</span>.  To be
sure, we keep the rules; but we also begin to ask ourselves, "What is the principle involved
here?"  Such a person becomes less dependent upon external scaffolding and structure and more
dependent upon quiet and ongoing divine direction.  As the Prophet Joseph explained, "I teach
them correct principles, and they govern themselves" (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph
Smith</span>, eds. Larry E. Dahl and Donald Q. Cannon, Bookcraft, 1997, p. 32).</p>
<p>	Now you may be asking yourself, "What do different levels of obedience have to do with
celebrating the Spirit of Ricks?"  I think the answer to this question is really rather
straightforward.  Brigham Young University-Idaho is a set apart and sacred place where young
men and women, with a remarkable capacity to obey, can become acquainted with or further their
experience with <strong>heartfelt and willing obedience</strong>.  The true Spirit of Ricks is about progressing
to and through "letter of the law" obedience to public and institutional commandments and
toward the spirit of devoted discipleship and a private, personal, and individual change of heart.</p>
<p>	I find it fascinating that one of the greatest blessings related to keeping God's
commandments is additional commandments.  Now, individuals who find commandments
restrictive and constraining clearly will not regard more commandments as a blessing.  But the
Apostle John taught that for one who has come unto Christ and been born again, God's
"commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3).  Thus, individuals who have eyes to see and ears
to hear will readily recognize the consummate spiritual benefit that comes from extra direction
from heaven.  What are these "commandments not a few," and how do we receive them?</p>
<p>	The individual and personal commandments "not a few" we receive frequently tend to
focus upon the good things we can and should do to develop and deepen our discipleship--as
opposed to focusing primarily upon the bad things we must avoid or overcome.  Such
instructions typically are proactive and anticipatory in nature.  For example, many of us
remember the teachings of President Spencer W. Kimball concerning fast offerings.  He stated: </p>
<p>		I think that when we are affluent, as many of us are, that we ought
to be very, very generous . . . .  I think we should be very generous
and give, instead of the amount we saved by our two meals of
fasting, perhaps much, much more--ten times more where we are
in a position to do it (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1974, p. 184).</p>
<p>	Thus, an individual or a family may be prompted to freely and willingly and cheerfully
contribute to the fast offering fund at a level far beyond the routine and basic "letter of the law"
standards with which most of us are familiar.  The commandment "not a few" in this example is
gladly obeyed in order to bless and strengthen others with serious challenges and insufficient
resources.</p>
<p>	A few additional examples may be helpful.  As I proceed, please keep in mind, however,
that I am not attempting to provide a comprehensive list of what "commandments not a few" are
or should be.  Such commandments are individual and quite personal; nonetheless, a further 
illustration or two can help us to better comprehend this concept.</p>
<p>	I know a young man who was taught in his home to dress appropriately for his Sunday
meetings--and then to remain in his Sunday attire throughout the entire Sabbath day.  For this
young man, one of the "commandments not a few" is simply to align his dress and demeanor
with the spirit of reverence and worship he hopes to sustain on the Sabbath.  Likewise, a
priesthood holder may receive an individualized "commandment not a few" to always dress in
his Sunday best clothing to perform a priesthood ordinance or to act in any capacity as a
representative of the Savior, except of course in unanticipated emergency situations.  I am aware
of families where all family members dress in Sunday attire as children receive a father's
blessing or as other priesthood ordinances are performed.  And members of the Church may
receive a "commandment not a few" to dress appropriately for an interview with the bishop or
stake president as an indication of their respect for and of the dignity associated with these
important priesthood offices.</p>
<p>	Please listen to the following statements about the honor and dress codes at BYU-Idaho
contained in a letter I recently received from a student.</p>
<p>		I was never one for the rules.  I would keep them, as I found need
for them.  But the idea of having someone tell me what to do did
not thrill me.  I was already beginning to turn to the light of the
honor code when I heard Sister Bednar's talk about modesty.  The
story she related about the young man who would not date a young
woman because she refused to heed the Prophet's counsel and
remove her second set of earrings really impacted me.  I likewise
had refused to take out my three earrings.  I decided that I did not
want to be like the young woman in Sister Bednar's story.  After
the talk I took out my earrings.  I also was more cautious about the
skirts I wore, making sure I would not show any skin.  But
something more important happened as a result of listening to
Sister Bednar's talk and following her counsel.  I became more
susceptible to the Spirit.  And from being more obedient to the
smaller rules I was prompted to . . . .</p>
<p>	The things this young woman described in her letter after this final statement are things I
will not share in public.  Brothers and sisters, you will be interested to know that this young
woman presently is serving as a full-time missionary.  Note how her initially conforming and
complying obedience developed into <strong>heartfelt and willing obedience</strong> and led her into a
remarkable opportunity to serve and to assist in building the Kingdom.</p>
<p>	Let me repeat a statement I made earlier about the Spirit of Ricks.  Brigham Young
University-Idaho is a set apart and sacred place where young men and women, with a remarkable
capacity to obey, can become acquainted with or further their experience with <strong>heartfelt and
willing obedience</strong>.  The true Spirit of Ricks is about progressing to and through "letter of the
law" obedience to public and institutional commandments and toward the spirit of devoted
discipleship and a private, personal, and individual change of heart.  The letter from this young
woman provides a powerful example of the impact of the Spirit of Ricks.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Home is the Best Place to Learn About and Experience<br />
Heartfelt and Willing Obedience </span></strong></p>
<p>	We are all familiar with Nephi's introductory comment in the Book of Mormon about
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in <strong>all</strong> the learning of
my father . . ." (1 Nephi 1:1, emphasis added).  Clearly, the seeds of Nephi's consistent
faithfulness and willing obedience were planted in the fertile soil of his soul and cultivated and
nurtured in a gospel-centered home.  It is significant to me that the final words Nephi recorded in
his account, found in 2 Nephi 33:15, reflect both his life's experience and the powerful influence
of his home.</p>
<p>				For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the
judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and<strong> I must
obey</strong>.  Amen (emphasis added).</p>
<p>		The first thing I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling
me by name.  I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing
over my head, surrounded by light as before.  He then again related
unto me all that he had related to me the previous night, and
commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and
commandments which I had received.</p>
<p>	Brother and sisters, it is not unrealistic to assert that in the times in which we live parents
in Zion must strive to create and maintain homes like Nephi's and Joseph's--homes in which
parents and children alike learn about and gain experience with <strong>heartfelt and willing obedience</strong>. 
From such homes will come Latter-day Saints who are pure--certainly not perfect, but pure and
without spot.  And that purity produces a matchless power to do and be good and to literally
"chase darkness from among you" (D&amp;C 50:25).  There is an unparalleled power in personal
purity, and our homes are the places in which <strong>heartfelt and willing obedience</strong> and personal
purity bloom and blossom.</p>
<p>	May each of us have a greater desire and determination to obey God's commandments
with all of our hearts and with willing minds.  May we be blessed to qualify for and to receive
"commandments not a few."  May each of us also understand that this great institution and the
Spirit of Ricks exist to assist and to support--but never to act as a substitute for--gospel and
Christ-centered homes.</p>
<p>	Brothers and sisters, I testify that God the Eternal Father lives.  Jesus Christ is His only
Begotten Son.  And I witness that as our obedience becomes <strong>heartfelt and willing</strong> we will
increasingly become like them.  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Welcome to Education Week as BYU-Idaho celebrates the "Spirit of Ricks."  We hope you will have a
wonderful time here on our campus the next few days; that you will be uplifted, edified, and rejuvenated; and that
you will leave this place with the conviction that the "Spirit of Ricks" is alive and growing stronger at BYU-Idaho.  I
pray now for the Spirit to accompany me today as I deliver the message I have prepared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I don't know about you, but the transition to a new name has been a bit difficult for me.  Do you have
trouble referring to this institution as BYU-Idaho?  I know I still have a slip of the tongue once in a while.  I
remember when our name change became official last August.  My husband and I learned of the experience of one of
our campus employees who answered the phone on the first day we were officially known as BYU-Idaho by saying,
"Ricks . . . I mean BY&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I don't know who I work for!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I reflected back to a time many years ago when I was teaching first grade.  For most of the school year I had
been Miss Robinson, but after my wedding in March, I was all of a sudden Mrs.&nbsp;Bednar.  My little students had such
a hard time getting used to the change.  They would start calling me by my familiar name and then would get the
giggles and try in mid-sentence to change.  But you know, even though I had taken on a new name, I was still the
same young woman.  And the same is true here on our campus.  Even though we have changed our name from Ricks
College to BYU-Idaho, the values, principles, and characteristics for which this institution is legendary are still a part
of who we are.  We will always celebrate the "Spirit of Ricks" at BYU-Idaho!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Another interesting event took place that year I was teaching.  Shortly after school had begun in the fall, a
student brought a black and white and yellow striped caterpillar in a large, netted box to our class.  As we spent time
examining this unique creature, I explained to the students that this caterpillar had started out as a small egg laid by a
monarch butterfly on a milkweed leaf and would someday turn into a butterfly.  For now the cells of the egg had
been programmed with hormones that had enabled the egg to become a caterpillar--a hungry caterpillar with a
ravenous appetite.  Because these children were concerned about the well-being of this starving caterpillar, they
gathered milkweed leaves every day on their way to school and deposited them in the container for the caterpillar to
eat.  The caterpillar munched continuously and grew so much that it had to shed its skin several times during the time
we had it in our room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	One day when we came to class, we noticed that the caterpillar had spun a mat of silk on a twig in the
container, had attached itself to that silk, and was hanging upside down, perpendicular to the twig.  The final
metamorphic process was commencing.  The caterpillar's last layer of skin was shed and a beautiful emerald green
chrysalis accented with golden dots began to form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	We observed the chrysalis daily and soon noticed something unusual was taking place.  The chrysalis was
changing, and we could detect distinct orange and black patterns appearing inside the chrysalis.  One afternoon a
student exclaimed, "Teacher.  Look!  The chrysalis is turning into a butterfly."  During the day we watched in
suspense as the butterfly gradually slipped from the transparent casing that had enclosed it during this final change. 
The butterfly hung to the bottom of the casing with crumpled, moist wings pointing downward in preparation for the
drying, expanding, and pumping process that was necessary for flight.  We knew when the butterfly was ready.  We
carried the box outside, gently lifted the lid, and stood in awe as we watched this magnificent insect take flight. 
What an incredible change had taken place from egg to caterpillar to chrysalis to butterfly, each stage an integral part
of the process.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I have thought of my monarch butterfly experience several times over the past two years since President
Gordon B. Hinckley announced that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho.   Like the monarch butterfly, this
institution has undergone a metamorphosis.  From its humble beginnings as a small log cabin elementary school; to
an academy offering expanded academic opportunities for high school students; to Ricks College, growing slowly to
become the largest private junior college in the United States; we can discern that each of these developmental stages
has been a vital and important preparation for the most recent evolution that has transpired.  We now have Brigham
Young University-Idaho emerging as a four-year, baccalaureate degree granting institution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Two years ago my husband invited me to attend a meeting in Big Sky, Montana, for all  Ricks College
deans, department heads, and administrators.  As these men and women sat in a room and reviewed the changes that
had been announced just seven weeks previous by our prophet, I observed firsthand the metamorphic process of the
chrysalis.  These campus leaders deliberated on how they could best plan and then implement the changes that had
been briefly outlined by the Board of Trustees to make Ricks College a four-year institution.  New buildings and
additions needed to be designed, approved, and funded to meet the growing needs of academic and ecclesiastical
programs.  New four-year majors required the creation of hundreds of upper-division level courses.  The magnitude
of the details of this project were mind boggling.  It was like lining up rows and rows of dominoes that intersected
with one another.  A decision in one area could cause dominoes in another unrelated line to topple, generating an
unexpected chain reaction.  Over a period of days, I witnessed inspiration and heavenly direction attend and guide
those campus leaders.  From the chrysalis of that meeting room I saw the quiet emergence of a monarch butterfly as
it slipped out of its comfortable protective case, wet wings and all.   Though none could have ever predicted this
outcome from the small beginnings of Bannock Stake Academy elementary school, this institution was becoming
what it had been destined to become from the beginningÂ—a university known as BYU-Idaho!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The Board of Trustees' blueprint for change had programmed carefully within it safeguards to maintain the
"Spirit of Ricks." There is no faculty rank, and we have an innovative year-round calendar at BYU-Idaho.  The
enrollment for this present summer term is the largest ever as we serve an increasing number of worthy and capable
students.  We have hired 67 new faculty members the past two years and expect to hire even more in order to
maintain our low teacher/pupil ratio as we expand classes into four-year majors.  Students who leave this university
always comment about the meaningful personal relationships they have established with faculty members because, as
the students put it, "My teacher knows my name." We have an enhanced student activity program where this summer
students can "choose their own adventure" from a variety of outdoor activities.  These protections, in combination
with modest increases in enrollment, will ensure that BYU-Idaho can always celebrate the "Spirit of Ricks."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Most people who come to our campus can define what the "Spirit of Ricks" means to them.  The definition
differs with everyone you ask.  A woman I visited with last week said to her the "Spirit of Ricks" is kindness.  Not
long ago, a teacher on our campus related a heartwarming experience to me.  While he was working in his office last
semester, he was prompted to walk over to the Manwaring Center to grab a bite to eat.  While eating his lunch, this
faculty member noticed out of the corner of his eye a young man who appeared to be struggling.  He shrugged off the
thought to approach the young man and continued eating his lunch.  The impression came again.  "Go and visit with
this young man." Well, he got up from the table and walked over to where the young man was sitting.  After asking a
few questions, it was apparent the student was having trouble registering for courses in his major and was extremely
frustrated because he couldn't get his class schedule to work out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	This teacher happened to be the perfect solution to the student's problem because he not only advised
students but also taught classes in the young man's particular major.  After the teacher and student finished lunch,
they returned to the teacher's office and sat down for about two hours to work out a schedule.  The student left the
teacher's office feeling comfortable and confident in his choice of classes and his major.  This is not an isolated
incident on our campus.  In fact, it is an everyday occurrence.  We continue to celebrate the "Spirit of Ricks" here at
BYU-Idaho.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The "Spirit of Ricks" is a discernible feeling that permeates this institution.  Elder Bednar and I were aware
of this special spirit the day we set foot on this remarkable campus five years ago.  We feel it daily as we look into
the friendly and eager faces of the students we meet.  This spirit is magnified by the dedication of loyal employees
who are seeking to build the kingdom of God by serving students.  We notice this special feeling as we attend
campus events and activities with patrons and alumni such as you.  This spirit is real, it's tangible, it's a part of who
we are.  And we are committed to preserving, enhancing, and celebrating the "Spirit of Ricks" here at BYU-Idaho.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	In conclusion, I would like to return to where I
beganÂ—my experience with the monarch butterfly. 
Monarch butterflies don't like cold weather.  In the fall they migrate to warmer climates in California and then come
back to the Rockies in the spring, making only one round-trip before they die.  The great-great grandchildren of the
monarch who laid the egg make the trip south the following fall.  These future generations have designed within
them a type of homing device which assists them in finding their way south even though they aren't escorted by a
butterfly who has made the trip before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Students at BYU-Idaho have a homing device, too.  We call it the "Spirit of Ricks." It's embedded in those
who attend and work at this institution.  Past generations have experienced it, and future generations will possess and
perpetuate it too.  It's a power that moves us to learn and to grow and to serve, to recognize and develop our God-given potential, and to expand and strengthen our wings in preparation for our journey home.  It's our hope for the
future.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The "Spirit of Ricks" is also knowing that our Father in Heaven lives and is involved in the details of our
lives.  It is remembering that we have a Savior who loves us and cares that we return home to His presence.  It is
understanding that God speaks today through living prophets and that the chairman of the Board of Trustees for this
institution is His prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley.  May the "Spirit of Ricks" be a part of our celebration here
this weekend as we seek to become better servants, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</font></p>

Stephen D. Nadauld</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It's a special treat for us to be here with you this morning.  The city of Rexburg and BYU-Idaho
hold a special place in my heart.  I have always thought of Rexburg as my ancestral home.  My
father and his five brothers and three sisters were all born and raised here in Rexburg.  They had
a family band that played for dances up and down the Snake River valley.  I have fond memories
of visits to my grandparents home located not far from here on the north side of west main street. 
I myself was born in Idaho Falls on the banks of the Snake River, in the hospital, which some of
you may remember sat next to the temple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I love that river and have spent many happy days there.  What Washington Irving said of the
Hudson River explains well my feelings for the Snake.  Let me paraphrase his words: "I am
grateful I was born on the banks of the Snake! I think it an invaluable advantage to be born and
brought up in the neighborhood of some grand and noble object in nature: a river, a lake, or a
mountain.  We make a friendship with it; we in a manner ally ourselves with it for life."  I
certainly feel I have allied myself for life with the river, the fields, and the mountains of Idaho.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In fact I told my wife some years ago that since I was born on the banks of the Snake that I would
also like to be buried right along the banks of the Snake River in Island Park.  I explained that
she could mark my grave with a head stone that had a little bracket on the side where she could
place my fly rod. She could come up every memorial day and instead of putting flowers on my
grave she could tie a new fly on my line and read a few pages out of an LL Bean catalogue. I
think that would be a fitting remembrance that would help me rest in peace.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I want to tell you about the day when I began to love BYU-Idaho which as you may suspect was
called Ricks College on the day I started loving it.  In February of 1964 I had been serving for 28
months as a missionary in France and had six weeks left before returning home. On a Tuesday a
telegram came explaining that my father had died of a sudden heart attack. On Wednesday I sat
in a park and worked through the tears and confusion.  It was determined that I should go home
and be of whatever help possible to my mother. Thursday I caught a train to Paris.  Friday I flew
from Paris to Salt Lake and then rode the Greyhound bus all that night. I arrived home in Idaho
Falls at 6:00 AM on Saturday morning and attended my father's funeral at noon that same day. 
Monday morning found me here in Rexburg at the office of President John L. Clarke.  We visited
about my circumstances and desire for an education.  He offered to allow me to enroll a week
late and then after pausing a few moments said, "And we would like to help you with a
scholarship to pay your tuition."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That spring I took a chemistry class and a differential equations class among others and in May
when it was time for final exams I believe there was still three feet of snow on the ground. I went
on to receive a bachelors degree from BYU, a masters from Harvard Business School and a PhD
from the University of California at Berkeley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I remember on that day feeling deeply grateful to the President and to the institution for
providing both the opportunity and some of the resources needed to begin my educational
journey.  A journey that would ultimately lead one day to my own appointment as a university
president.  That sense of gratitude and appreciation remains with me to this day as I contemplate
the blessing that Ricks College - now BYU Idaho - has been and will continue to be to so many
thousands of young people.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the spirit of Education Week I would like us to visit together about knowledge and knowing.
More specifically, let me ask, what does it mean when we say we know someone?  You will
quickly realize that it is possible to speak of knowing someone in many different contexts. For
example, we may say I know her because we work together, or I've known him since he was a
little boy or I know the family.  Perhaps it may be said that we are only somewhat acquainted or I
hardly know him or I don't know them at all.  We may speak of how well a father or mother
knows their child.  Many years ago when our twin boys were infants Margaret was up most of the
night tending one that was sick.  In the morning we agreed that she should take the baby to our
family doctor who was also our brother-in-law.  Doctor Tom took the baby's temperature,
examined his ears, nose, and throat; and then paused for a moment in thought.  He then took out
his black pen and marked a big X on the baby's stomach.  He said, "Margaret, this baby is
perfectly healthy, take him home and bring back the one <u>without</u> the X on his stomach."  Sure
enough it was the other twin that was sick and Margaret didn't yet know them well enough to tell
them apart in the dark.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We may say that we know someone by reputation or we know their writings or their paintings or
their music.  Sometimes we infer that because we know someone we have influence with them. 
In fact we often impute great importance to knowing someone as in - to get something done you
have to know the right people.  So let me ask you two important questions.  In this life <u>what</u> is it
you would really like to get done? And <u>who</u> is the right person to know?  A scriptural answer to
these two questions is found in Mosiah 26 verses 24-27 as the Lord speaks to Alma.  He says
"For behold, . . . in my name are they called and <u>if they know me</u> they shall come forth, and shall
have a place eternally at my right hand."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> What wonderful and useful answers.  It would be a
glorious accomplishment to have a place at his right hand and each of us may wish for such a
place but the condition expected by the Lord is straightforward.  He says, quote "<u>if they know me</u>
they shall come forth and shall have a place eternally at my right hand." End quote.  Today I
would like to explore with you the concept of what it really means to know the Lord and how
that knowledge will be useful to us.  One way to know someone is to be acquainted with or to be
familiar with their attitudes and actions, to know how they would react in certain situations, to
know what they would say and what they would do. We may ask ourselves, in the context of
knowing the Lord, what was His attitude toward His friends? the poor? His mother? the
Pharisees? His apostles? little children? His Father? sin?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What were his acts? His teachings? His travels? His choice of associates? His dress and
demeanor? His management of the elements, the winds and waves? His acts of prayers? His act
of suffering in the garden? His act of atonement?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sometimes we speak of knowing someone because we know their background, we know where
they were born and where they grew up. We may feel we know the places described even though
we've never been there.  For example what images come into your mind when we speak of
Bethlehem? The scriptures say: "And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
people together, he [Herod] demanded of them where Christ should be born.  And they said unto
him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the
land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor,
that shall rule my people Israel."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Can you see in your mind's eye the gently rolling hills, the
shepherds keeping watch over their flock by night, the star in the sky, the babe in the manger, the
wise men bringing gifts?  Consider Nazareth, a beautiful little village nestled in a valley not far
from the Sea of Galilee.  If you walked there today you might look at the streets and the shops
and see a handsome little boy and be reminded of the carpenter's son who played in the hills, was
taught a trade and reminded his parents that he needed to be about his real father's business.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Can you imagine the Sea of Galilee?  In thinking of it I wrote these lines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How I would like to have been there that night,<br />
What an interesting place to be.<br />
Where the winds blew fierce and the waves arose<br />
On the Sea of Galilee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And there in the boat in a state of fright<br />
Trembling and sick with fear<br />
Sat the disciple fishermen<br />
Watching a spectre draw near.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It must be a spirit, it can't be a man<br />
Together they reasoned and said.<br />
But straight way he spoke, Be of good cheer<br />
It is I, so be not afraid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yes he walked on the water, he calmed the sea<br />
What an amazing sight.<br />
I've no doubt that it's true, I can witness to you<br />
Still I'd like to have been there that night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Truly one way we can come to know the Savior is to ponder in our hearts the places He lived. 
The scenes He saw and the experiences He had.  In our minds eye we can walk with Him.  Daniel
S. Twohig helps us do that with his beautiful and familiar verses:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I walked today where Jesus walked<br />
	In days of long ago.<br />
	I wandered down each path her knew<br />
	With reverenced step and slow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	There little leaves they have not changed,<br />
	A sweet peace fills the air.<br />
	I walked today where Jesus walked<br />
	And felt His presence there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	My pathway led through Bethlehem,<br />
	Ah memories ever sweet.<br />
	The little hills of Galilee<br />
	That know there childish feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The Mount of Olives hallowed scenes<br />
	That Jesus knew before.<br />
	I saw the mighty Jordan roll<br />
	As in the days of yore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I knelt today where Jesus knelt<br />
	Where all alone He prayed.<br />
	The Garden of Gethsemane<br />
	My heart felt unafraid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I picked my heavy burden up<br />
	And with Him by my side<br />
	I climbed the hill of Calvary<br />
	Where on the cross He died.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I walked today where Jesus walked<br />
	And felt Him close to me.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Often we speak of knowing someone because we know the family.  We may observe that a
person comes from a prominent family, or an old line family, or a generous family.  The story is
told of a woman who gave food and comfort to a homeless child.  The child in gratitude and
innocence asked if this very kind and loving woman was God' wife.  The woman replied that she
was not God's wife, just on of His daughters.  The child replied, I knew you must be related.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In John we read, "then said they unto him, where is thy Father?  Jesus answered, ye neither know
me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do we know the Father? Do we speak to Him?  Do we know other members of the family?  Do
we remember the injunction from the Lord that "in as much as ye have done it unto the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto me"?<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Two little brothers were learning to ride their bikes together.  As they came down the hill in front
of their home, one boy had a bad crash and ended up in the middle of the road tangled, bleeding,
and crying.  The accompanying brother jumped off is bike and carefully picked up and carried his
bleeding brother home where he knew there would be help.  When they reached the door it was
the unhurt brother who was crying.  When asked why <u>he</u> was crying he replied, "because my
brother hurts."  That day a father came to know the heart of a son.  Not because the son had done
something for the father, but because the son had done something for another of the father's
children.  Certainly one way we will be known to the Lord is through the reports that will come
to him from other members of the family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It's possible to know someone well because we have worked with them.  We may hear, I know
her, we work at the same company.  Or, I know him very well, we've been business partners for
30 years.  I know that person well, we've served together in United Way, or Boy Scouts, or Red
Cross.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The scriptures are wonderfully descriptive with respect to this manner in which we may come to
know the Savior.  We read in Mosiah 5:13, "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has
not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts . . . of his heart?"<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What better way to get acquainted--to really get to know someone--then to work side-by-side
on a project that is dear to the heart of each person.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do we work together with the master to accomplish his purposes?  Do we work with energy and
enthusiasm?  Will we be able to speak of both the quality and the quantity of our work with
Him?  Is our work done for His glory and in deference to his authority?  Remember He has said,
"many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then will I
profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How sad it would be if for any reason He were to say to anyone of us, "depart from me, I never
knew you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consider this: you may know someone so well that you wish to be named after them. Fathers and
sons have the same name.  Wives take the names of their husbands. We may be referred to as
Kiwannians, or Elks, or BYU-Idaho alumni or the son's of Mosiah or Helman's 2000 strippling
warriors.  However, we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, "Behold Jesus Christ is the name
which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be saved;
Wherefore, all men must take upon them the name which is given of the Father, for in that name
shall they be called at the last day; Wherefore, <u>if they know not the name by which they are
called</u>, they cannot have place in the kingdom of my Father."<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do we know the name by which we will be called?  Is it a name that our actions and attitudes
bring honor to?  Is it a name we revere and desire to be known by?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">King Benjamin expressed this concept so beautiful to his people.  "And now because of the
covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his
daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are
changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and
daughters.  And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be
made free.  There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye
should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God
that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.  And it shall come to pass that whosoever
doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall <u>know</u> the name by which he is
called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ."<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Each week as we partake of the sacrament, we have the opportunity to remind ourselves of the
name by which we may be called.  The words are very explicit: "and witness unto thee, O God,
the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of they Son, and always
remember him."<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  It should be enormously comforting to us that there is a formal mechanism
whereby we associate ourselves with Him, and get to know Him better as we pledge to take His
name upon us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An important connotation of the word to know is to be subjected to or to experience.  We may
say of someone, we are well acquainted, we have experienced many things together. One may
experience the support and sustaining influence of friends, neighbors, and loved ones and thereby
come to know them better.  This expression of knowing someone through experience is
especially tender in the context of knowing the Lord.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Alma tells us, "And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every
kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and
sicknesses of his people. . . . he will take upon him their infirmities."  He will "take upon Him
the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his
deliverance."<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Have you experienced relief from pain, sickness, infirmity?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Have you experienced Him bearing your burden, lightening your load, blotting out your
transgressions?  Often it is through our extremities that we come to know God.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">President David O. McKay once related that members of a class were criticizing Church leaders
for permitting the Martin handcart company to commence its journey so late in the season.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An old man listened and then arose.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"In substance [he] said, 'I ask you to stop this criticism.  You are discussing a matter you know
nothing about.  Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of
the questions involved.  Mistake to send the hardcart company out so late in the season?  Yes. 
But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited
was there too.  We suffered beyond anything you can imagine, and many died of exposure and
starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism?  Not one of
that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with
absolute knowledge that God lives, <u>for we became acquainted with him in our extremities</u>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"'I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I
could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a
hill slope, and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the
load through it.  I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I
have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew
then that the angels of God were there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"'Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart?  No. Neither then nor any minute of my life
since.  The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am
thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin handcart company.'"<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The prophet Joseph was told in Liberty Jail concerning his trials that, "all these things shall give
thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  I feel assured that the knowledge of the Lord that is
gained through our trials and tribulations is invaluable in this life.  But I'm equally convinced
that the experience of coming to know the Lord in this life has implications that reach beyond the
grave.  Let me explain it in this way:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sometimes when we say, I know that person, we wish to convey that we have influence with
them.  More specifically we infer that because we know them we can access their influence on
our behalf. We do not necessarily expect preferential treatment but hope that our motives will be
understood and that we may receive the persons best efforts on our behalf.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consider a modest parable I have written for the purpose of illustration.  A certain man found it
necessary to seek counsel concerning a legal matter. It was a very difficult problem and had
potentially serious consequences in terms of both time and money.  He was not sure how to find
someone who he felt would represent him before the judge in the most appropriate and sensitive
manner.  He researched law firms and asked questions of others who had needed legal
representation.  He narrowed his choice to two individuals. The first came highly recommended
because of his training, expertise, and knowledge of the law.  The man did not know the lawyer
personally but did appreciate how highly he was recommended. The second lawyer was an
individual the man knew intimately.  They had been acquainted since his youth. They had long
conversations about values, discussed important decisions through the years, knew each others'
families and had served together in common causes. The second lawyer's legal skills were equal
to the first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Which of the two individuals would best represent the man before the judge, someone who knew
him or someone who knew him not?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In fact each of us is in some kind of trouble with the law--the laws of God.  Each of us will need
an advocate to plead our case.  Will our advocate know us well enough to plead for us?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We read in the 45<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "Listen to him who is the advocate
with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--Saying:  Father, behold the sufferings
and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son
which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; Wherefore,
Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have
everlasting life."<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I believe the most critical issue in our discussions this day can be stated as follows:  Will the
Savior, who will be our advocate before the Father, know us well enough to plead our case with
conviction?  Will He know of our works?  Will His knowledge of the thoughts and intents of our
hearts cause our confidence to wax strong in His presence or cause us to shrink with shame and
despair?  Will we know Him well enough to ask for His influence on our behalf?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We can remind ourselves of the verses with which we began our discussion.  The Savior said,
"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; . . . and it is I that granteth unto him that
believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.  For behold, in my name are they called; and if
they <u>know me</u> they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Surely we are promised a place at His right hand but only if we know Him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brothers and sisters if we live our lives such that as we stand and listen to the Savior plead our
cause we hear, "yes we've met but only briefly," or "I hardly know them," or "I don't really
know him or her at all," we shall despair greatly at our lost opportunity.  Therefore, let us live so
that as we stand before God we may hear our advocate say, "We're good friends, we know each
other well, we've worked together, we've shared many experiences and been through tough times
together."  What a blessing it would be to hear Him say, "I've known her all her life, we grew up
together, he's spent a lot of time in my house."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let me conclude with these lines from Alma E. Gygi titled appropriately "All This I Know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	I have not seen the stable<br />

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">I add my greeting to that offered you by President Bednar. I am especially mindful of
those who are attending their first BYU-Idaho devotional.  I presume that many of you
graduated from high school a few weeks ago, and perhaps there are many who were
serving as full-time missionaries until recently. And now "You've found the place which
God for us prepared, far away in the west."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Whether you are a newcomer or an old timer, you love to receive personal letters, and
Sister Bednar just handed me a couple personal letters, and I think they must be for you.  I
can't make out the name exactly, but, yes, it is to you:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Dear (fill in your name here),</font></em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	Your mother and I are very pleased that you are attending BYU-Idaho. From the
time you were a youngster, we dreamed of the day. Great things lie ahead for you.  Of
course, the home seems a little empty without you here. It sure is quieter.</font> </em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	I'm writing just to remind you that we love you, we pray daily for your success,
you health and safety and spiritual well being. We have raised you to work hard and
remind you that your job, so to speak, now is university work. Study hard.</font> </em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	Be a good roommate. Don't steal their milk. And if they steal yours, work it out.
Your experiences with your brothers and sisters should help you there. By the way, they
send their love, as of course does your mother. Your sister says to tell you she loves your
room and wonders if you mind if she goes through your boxes looking for that blue
sweater. She doesn't think you'll need it in Rexburg. Right.</font> </em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">			Love,  Dad</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">P.S. Please send money. Ha, ha. Just kidding.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Look. Here's another one. This one looks a little more formal.</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Dear (fill in your name here)</font></em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	I'm so glad you decided to sign up for my class. As I said the first day of class, I
love teaching at BYU-Idaho.</font> </em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	Though we covered the introduction to the class the first day, I  wanted to drop
you a personal note.  First of all, I want you to know that I love you.  It may be a little
unusual to hear that from a university professor, but I don't think it's inappropriate to
tell you that I love and respect you for the righteous choices you have made in your life
and for your great potential. As the semester progresses I will learn to connect your
name to your face. I want you to know that I will pray for you by name this semester. I
hope you will avail yourself of my office hour to come and get help with the course or to
chat if you need advice or a friend.</font> </em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">I also think it's important to the spirit of our class and the university for you to know that
I have a testimony of our Savior and His church. Our primary work in class will be
working to master our academic subject, but I want you to know that the thing that gives
that subject its importance for me is the way it dovetails with gospel principles.</font></em></p>
<p><em> <font color="#000080">	I know that Christ lives and loves you and me.  I believe one of our chief goals is
to build a Zion classroom and a Zion university.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">I wish you a happy and successful semester, university career, and life.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Sincerely,</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">(The names of 406 BYU-Idaho faculty)</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">God's work and glory is, as you all know, "To bring to pass the immortality and eternal
life of man<font size="-1">." (Moses 1:39</font>)  So, wherein lies our work? I believe our work is to align
ourselves with God's efforts, to work ourselves toward those same goals. And how are
we to attain eternal life, or life with God?  Many scriptures address this question; but one
I keep coming back to is 2 Nephi 9:39:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"To be spiritually minded is life eternal"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A university is an institution devoted to expanding the life of the mind.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A Zion university is devoted to developing spiritual mindedness.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Spiritual mindedness can be defined as thinking as God thinks, valuing what he values,
and knowing what he knows.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I will begin by sharing with you three true BYU-Idaho anecdotes that to me illustrate
some of the attributes of spiritual mindedness as I have experienced it on this campus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Early last September as I approached the Faculty Office Building I saw a man about my
age with a backpack, a piece of paper, and a slightly lost look. No, he was not a faculty
member. I greeted him and asked if I could help him find something.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">"The Taylor?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I answered: "That the white brick building up beyond the Manwaring Center that looks
like a church."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He was orienting his map. "And the Clark?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Just down the hill from the Smith," I said, pointing. "And the Kirkham beyond that," I
said anticipating.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">He smiled. He had found himself.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"You've come back to school," I ventured.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Well, my son is released from his mission in about ten days. I registered for him, and I'm
attending classes in his place until he makes it here."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Good for you.  You're a very considerate father. How is it going?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Pretty well so far. I'm a little tired. I wish my roommates would let me get to sleep
before 1:30 in the morning."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We chuckled and parted. I was so impressed by that father and his efforts to help his son
make the mission to college transition. It seemed that he was performing a great act of
service for his son. He was being spiritually minded because he was consecrating and
dedicating his time to serve his son.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Not long ago at the end of fall semester, my advanced composition class decided to have
a gift exchange. Because we had worked hard to have the spirit of unity in the class, we
thought that we might stretch ourselves to give gifts in the spirit of the Zion classroom.
That semester in two classes we generated more than $200 for the Perpetual Education
Fund. One student, Aaron Bahn, gave me a gift I will always treasure.  It is a mission pin
from his mission in Peru. To it was attached a note: <em>Early in my mission in Peru,  my
native senior companion had only two or three pair of garments. I gave him a couple of
mine; he gave me all he had--this mission pin.  I would like you to have it in love and
memory.  </em>Aaron's gift, both to his companion and to me, illustrates spiritual mindedness
because to him service and giving exceeded the desire for personal possessions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A few years ago I was walking across campus and saw one of my fellow faculty
members. I greeted him. He had on a wonderful necktie. (There's an oxymoron, a
wonderful necktie.) Red and gold and green. I complimented him on it. He started to take
it off and give it to me.  "I said it had great colors; I didn't say I wanted it. Keep your tie
on."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">He said, "I would like you to have this tie."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"I can't take your tie."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Look, I'm giving you this tie.  You can take it or leave in that bush right there."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Humbled, I took the tie.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The next day I took to his office while he was in class a wooden box I had made. I had
written a note that said something like this: I do not give you this box in exchange for the
tie.  I give it to you in honor of our friendship. Long after the tie and this box have the
gone the way of all the earth, I believe our friendship will endure. Thank you, my friend.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I called that tie the consecration tie, and I wore it fondly on the most important occasions. 
One day, one of my fellow English faculty, a man who had once been a student of mine,
complimented me on a special red and gold and green tie. I put it in a manila envelope
with a note telling the story I am telling you, telling him how glad I was to pass the
consecration tie along, and how much I appreciated his friendship. When I saw him
wearing the tie, it made me happy. You guessed it. The next semester, a student of his
complimented him on the tie, and he gave it to him with a story of its history.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am not suggesting that you tell your teachers or even friends what wonderful ties they
have on. They are listening to this talk too, and they might think you have ulterior
motives.   This tradition of giving illustrates spiritual mindedness  because the unity born
of friendship is more important than individual ownership.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I move now from my anecdotes associated with practical spiritual mindedness to three
doctrinal principles of spiritual mindedness that I believe if you understand and practice
will be a great blessing to you personally as you begin your life at BYU-Idaho.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Idea 1:	The Holy Ghost is the great teacher.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let's try an experiment:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Step One</em>:	Reverently, open a notebook, and get out a writing implement.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Step Two</em>:	I will suggest the kind of prayer you could offer in your mind and then will
be quiet while you offer your version of it: "Heavenly Father, I desire to be
taught by Thy Spirit, to find comfort and insight during this hour. Please
reveal to my heart and mind what thou would have me do. I invite Thy
Spirit to be with us all here now.  In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Step Three</em>:	If you listen carefully to what the Spirit whispers to you, your prayer will
be answered.  You should write it down the prompting and act upon it
quickly.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#000080">		I love the example President and Sister Bednar set for us at devotionals
and other settings as they sit with their pens poised and their notebooks
open.  In case you don't know, they are not outlining my message; they are
listening for promptings from the great teacher, the Holy Spirit.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Step Four</em>:	Practice this process daily.  This should be an ongoing process. And if
guidance does not come to you during this hour it may come as you walk
to class or tonight as you brush your teeth. The point is that you seek the
influence of the Holy Spirit daily.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The scripture says "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings and he will direct thy paths for
good." Does this mean seek help with school problems, roommate challenges, 
relationship difficulties? Yes. <em>All </em>thy doings. What aspect of your life is the Holy Spirit
not interested in helping you with? None. To what inquiry would the Holy Ghost say,
"Boring." There isn't one. The Holy Spirit accompanies the Savior at the door of our
lives, knocking, wanting to be let in to help. What are his office hours? He is always
available. "The Holy Ghost over the bent world broods with warm breast and with ah!
Bright wings."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But there are a few principles that the Spirit does adhere to.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Amulek admonishes us to cry unto Heavenly Father for all things, but the Holy Ghost
does not cry back. His voice is still and quiet. Loud laughter, unseemly music or TV
shows will drown out his calm voice. So may a general lack of orderliness in your life, or
clutter in your space, or a frenzy of social activity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our Father has said that he cannot look on sin with the least degree of allowance. That
does not mean that the Holy Ghost will prompt us only when we are perfect. But sin does
tend to deaden our desire and ability to listen. If we want his help, we need to align
ourselves with his values and commandments</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And those values include obedience and work--even academic work.  Do you see the
irony of the great prayer of desperation offered sometimes outside the Testing Center:
"Heavenly Father, if you will help me pass this test, I promise to be better about
studying." The Holy Spirit, I imagine, is more impressed with this prayer, "Heavenly
Father, I am grateful for thy bounteous gifts to me, being here and being able to expand
my knowledge. I really want to use my knowledge is serving thee.  I have worked really
hard to master this material. I have completed my assignments and sought help from
those who have offered it. I went to bed early and slept eight hours last night. I am
working to love and serve my roommates. Please quicken my understanding and recall."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Does this prayer sound far-fetched?  There are those who are succeeding academically
and spiritually here who offer prayers very much like this one.  They are spiritually
minded because they have aligned themselves with the kind of thinking evident in the
scriptures regarding mental preparation and obedience.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Students who offer this prayer understand the parameters outlined in D&amp;C 88:123-125.
Please turn there with me.  I will not read the entire verses:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>"See that ye love one another. . . .Cease to be idle. Cease to be unclean, cease to find fault
one with another; . . . retire to thy bed early  that ye may not be weary; arise early that
your minds may be invigorated.  And above all clothe yourselves with the bond of
      charity&quot; (</i>emphasis added).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Most of the world's books on how to do well in college probably would not list charity
and love as part of their formula for success, but the Lord emphasizes it.  Those books do
emphasize getting enough rest.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If you were to see a faculty member or fellow student drink a cup of coffee, you would be
shocked and alarmed. But daily in all the housing units few seem alarmed at the
violations of  this law of physical and spiritual health as students stay up well past curfew
and then wonder why they next day they are weary, sluggish, and their minds are not
sharp. Sometimes I ask my classes how much sleep they received the night before.
Commonly much of the class has slept five or six hours or less.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Holy Ghost is always ready to help. But those who obey the outlined laws of
physical, mental, and spiritual health are more inclined to ask for and ready to receive his
help.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Idea 2: The Atonement of Jesus Christ enables and empowers spiritual mindedness.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">As you know, Christ's atonement enables life: "It was expedient that an atonement be
made. . . all are hardened yea, all are fallen and are lost and must perish except it be
through the atonement which is expedient should be made." (Alma 34:9)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Christ's atonement gives us the hope of the resurrection. We will live again.  He also paid
a vicarious payment of mercy to satisfy the demands of justice " and bringeth about
means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance." You know the "great and
eternal plan of redemption."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I ask, how can the atonement help us achieve spiritual mindedness and succeed at BYU-Idaho?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I have contemplated his question, I have found it helpful to distinguish between The
Atonement with at capital A and atonement with a small a.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Atonement (Capital A) is that transcendent act at the center of all human history and
beyond, the crowning act of obedient sacrifice whereby Christ met the demands of justice
in our behalf and wrought the great resurrection.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We avail ourselves of that great gift by believing in him, repenting, keeping the
commandments and enduring to the end.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>The center of being spiritually minded is loving and living the doctrine of the
Atonement</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How may this be done? We can participate in The Atonement by striving to understand
and live the principle of atonement. Atonement with a small a is the unifying principle of
service and sacrifice embodied by our Savior.  He wrought The Atonement the last days
of his life as he suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the Cross of Calvary. I
believe he prepared for that great event on behalf of all of mankind as he lived the
principle of atonement every day of his life, loving and serving the individual souls he
encountered in Galilee and Judea.  I believe that in the extremity of the Atonement he
somehow was conscious of each of us--our names, our faces, our lives.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">But as he did not receive a fullness at first, but learned grace for grace, he must have
practiced atonement one individual at a time, learning the great lessons of empathy and
service daily.  We avail ourselves of his Atonement as we emulate him one act at a time,
as we serve and sacrifice for, empathize with and strive for unity with his children line
upon line, hour by hour, one act at a time.</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">"For Christ plays in ten thousand places,/ Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his/To
the Father through the features of men's faces."</font> </em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In other words, part of seeing the love God has for us and for all of our brothers and
sisters is to see the family resemblance, to see Christ in the faces of those around us. And
to treat them accordingly. Learn their names, find ways of serving them, certainly saying
kind words, controlling moments of irritation and impatience.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I want to suggest a practical application of the principle of  atonement and building a Zion
University. The Lord says, "If you are not one ye are not mine." I know of an apartment
where the roommates took a picture of their group and put it in a frame that said,
"Friends."  A picture alone will not bring apartment unity, but thinking of yourselves as
friends is a start. I know that when roommates will be as much like a righteous family as
possible, they practice the spirit of atonement. Praying together, reading scriptures
together, holding family home evening, keeping curfew and other commandments, doing
random acts of kindness with and for each other--these are the building blocks of spiritual
mindedness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Idea 3: Heavenly Father's love is especially evident in the temple, the central place for
spiritual mindedness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What is the relationship between the classes you are currently enrolled in and will be
enrolled in at BYU-Idaho and the holy temple, the Lord's university? Is there a sense in
which the turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers
finds application in the classroom and wards of this university?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Of course it is possible that you might meet your future spouse in one of the classes you
are taking.  I understand it has happened before.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sometimes students come to me and say, "I don't know what to do with my life," they
almost invariably are speaking of a career, vocational, major choice.  Once I felt bold and
said to an advisee, "Yes you do. You want to be a husband and a father." I then went on to
help him with his educational plan, but the real education is closely associated with
family.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The temple teaches us to keep the long view and to see the central place of family in our
lives and in the kingdom. I encourage you to do as the prophets have admonished: set
your sights on the temple. Let the temple be the grand symbol of your life. You may say,
"But how am I to balance my academic demands with my desire to attend the temple,
receive my endowment, and be sealed?" Acknowledging that "to everything there is a
time and a purpose under heaven"--a time to study and a time to attend the temple--let me
suggest to you in the striving for that balance lies a possible source of great blessings. 
Many BYU-Idaho students attend the temple weekly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am very grateful for my academic training--my degrees and experiences.  But I join with
President Packer in stating that the most important lessons I have learned in life,
especially in relationship to my Heavenly Father, I have learned in the walls of my home. 
May I solemnly proclaim my wonder and awe for the gift of love with which I feel
blessed in relationship to my wife and children.  It is a thing of such transcendent beauty
and power and magnitude that I speak of it in the greatest of reverence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So when the Lord enjoins the saints to establish a house, a house of order, a house of
learning, a house of prayer--is he speaking of the temple, the school of the prophets, or
your BYU-Idaho apartment? I think the answer to that question is "yes." Our homes and
our classrooms need to be more temple like.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe our success as students, teachers, and as children of Heavenly Father is directly
related to the seriousness with which we take our prophet's lead in taking temples to the
people.  We need to take our temple worthiness more seriously, and we need to link it to
our being at BYU-Idaho:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To think more of the temple, to attend more often, to strive more diligently to understand
and practice principles of vicarious service is a key to spiritual mindedness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I move from these three doctrinal ideas to a personal story that illustrates a time in my life
when I learned of the inadequacy of my spiritual mindedness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was a freshman at Brigham Young University. My friend Ken and I had built a simple
two-man kayak out of plywood ribs and covered it with canvas that we then
waterproofed.  It was a crude affair, but it worked, and it matched our level of knowledge
concerning river running.  We didn't know much.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We decided that spring to run the Provo River from the mouth of the canyon to Utah
Lake. As we put in, there seemed to be plenty of water, maybe too much, I thought , but,
of course, didn't want to say so. A ways down the river, we hit a shallow spot. Our kayak
hung up on the bottom. We turned sideways and started to roll.  We did manage to get
out, but in the process I dropped my paddle. It floated away, and we never found it.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">We were stuck. I held the boat against the powerful cold current about knee deep while
Ken, using his paddle to steady himself explored all around us to see if we could get to
shore.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">As he explored down stream, I though it would be great fun and a way to relive tension to
pick a rock from the bottom on the river with the hand that wasn't holding the kayak,
throw it at Ken and splash him. After the first splash he tried to swing and hit the water
back at me with the paddle. I pick up another rock and since he was in a baseball like
swinging stance, I threw him a strike. He swung and hit it. The rock didn't go anywhere,
but half the paddle did. We had broken the other paddle. We were, literally, up the creek
without a paddle.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To our credit perhaps, we bowed in prayer and offered a petition for help. We were stuck,
and we knew it.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I pause in this narrative to tell you a little about my mental state. I had been in some tight
places rock climbing, but not what I would call real trouble.  It seemed that every year
people drowned in Provo River.  The spring run off was very cold and the pressure of its
flow against us very strong.  We couldn't stand against it long and we were in an out-of-the-way part of the river.  Not many people came there.  One or both of us could easily
fall prey to the power of the river.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I consciously remember saying in my mind, "I know that I should have faith in Jesus
Christ. He could help me. Help us get out of here, help us to transform our fear into
action. And I don't have that kind of relationship with him.  I lack faith.  I have never
needed him like I need him now, and I am afraid."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It was clear that we were in trouble with the river, but I realized as I never had before that
I was in trouble with my spiritual preparedness. I was weighed in the balance of the swift
current, and I was found wanting.  And I sensed keenly my spiritual inadequacy.  I wanted
to be able to call upon the powers of heaven and receive comfort and deliverance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It seemed that we were left alone long enough to get really scared and sense our
dependence on Heavenly Father.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">A young man came along the road skirting the river, fishing pole in hand.  He was
puzzled to see us standing in the middle of the river with a kayak but with no paddles. On
each end of the kayak we had a rope for tying up; we took the one off and tied it to the
other rope. The fisherman cast us his line; we hooked the line to the end of the rope. By
moving the craft as close as we could toward the shore into the deep, fast water, he could
grab the end of the rope. Hanging precariously close to the river, he held on. We held on
to the side of the boat, and the current swung us against the shore where we scrambled up
and drew the kayak after us.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I doubt that when that young man, who I think I  recall said he was a BYU student, set out
fishing that day, he thought about being spiritually minded, but I am glad he came along
that road at that time. I believe he was led.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, we all face our moments of extremity. Someone says, "Did you hear
about. . . ." and they tell us about something unthinkable that has happened. The phone
rings and your mother sounds more solemn that usual and says, "There's been an
accident." Or "Your father went to the doctor today." Or <em>you</em> have the accident or go to
the doctor. Or have a friend confides something in you that shakes you to your
foundation. I can promise you that such experiences will come to you. Many of you
already know the sinking feeling that comes in the face of tragedy or potential tragedy.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">What do you do when the bottom drops out, as it were? If you have cultivated habits of
spiritual mindedness, if you are no stranger to the workings of the Holy Ghost, the
Savior's Atonement, and the love of an Eternal Father, you will find it easier to cope. You
may still find yourself on the brink and stretched to the limit, but you will have resources.
You will know Him because you have been a frequent visitor in His house.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I review with you:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To be spiritually minded is life eternal, to be carnally minded is death.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You are greatly loved by those around you; they yearn and pray for your success.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Spirit is the great teacher. The atonement enables spiritual mindedness.  Heavenly
Father's love is temple centered.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"And this is life eternal that that might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom thou has sent." (John 17:3)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I express gratitude for the opportunity to share these ideas with you.  Many a time in the
last months and weeks I have prayed for spiritual mindedness or have thought in time of
decision, what would a spiritually minded person do.  I pray that you will find success in
your attempts to be more spiritually minded.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I testify that</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord is extending the saints' understanding.<br />The knowledge and power of God are expanding.<br />The veil o'er the earth is beginning to burst.<br />We through our faith may begin to inherit<br />The visions and blessings and glories of God.<br />Let glory to them in the highest be given<br />Henceforth and forever.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">To introduce my topic I'd like to share a personal experience. I grew up in Bountiful, Utah. One
day as a little boy, maybe five, and before I was accountable, I sat in church beside my father. I
must have been young because I remember having to lean my big head way back to speak to my
dad. My mom dressed in a wool sweater. I hated those sweaters. I said to my dad, "Dad, is church
your favortist?" He seeing a great teaching moment replied as any good father would, "Son,
church is my favortist." I replied back with the wisdom of a bright five year old, "Well, it's my
dumbest!" Since then, Dad, I've tried to submit to the Lord and church is my favortist.</p>
<p>The theme of my talk today centers around this quote by Ezra Taft Benson:</p>
<p>	Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that he can make a lot
more out of their lives than they can.  He will deepen their joys, expand their vision,
quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings,
increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends and pour out peace.
Whosoever will lose their life in the service of God will find eternal life.</p>
<p>In the following talk I want to describe the importance submitting to the will of Heavenly Father,
and how we submit through our thoughts, actions, and in our heart.</p>
<p>Please turn to Abraham 3:25. One of the purposes of this life is to be tested. "And we will prove
them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command
them." To whom will we submit?</p>
<p> On my mission I read an article in the December 99, New Era which drew parallel between a
craftsman shaping pottery and how our lives become shaped by Our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p> The article begins with this scripture in Isaiah 64: 8. It says, "O Lord, thou art our father; and we
are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand."  </p>
<p><strong><em>Quoting from the New Era article:</em></strong></p>
<p>	In its natural state, clay is common and far from beautiful but in the hands of a master
potter, it takes on a pleasing personality, becoming a thing both of usefulness and unique
beauty.</p>
<p>	But before clay can be made beautiful and useful, it must be centered on the potter's
wheel.  As the wheel spins, the potter molds, shapes and lifts the clay into the desired
form.  If the clay is not centered, it cannot be shaped properly. Eventually, natural forces
fling it from the wheel. Our lives are like that.</p>
<p>	We must become centered on Christ--and remain centered on Him.  Only then can our
Father in Heaven shape and mold our lives to His grand design for us.</p>
<p>This is a piece of pottery that I made when I was in kindergarten. When I was five years old, my
kindergarten class was given the opportunity to make pottery. Each student in the class was given
a lump of sticky clay. As my teacher explained the process of making pottery, she took great care
to warn us about removing each air bubbles. At first I didn't understand how an air bubble could
be harmful, but my teacher's urgent words soon explained. Any air bubbles left inside the pottery
would cause it to explode when placed in the heat of the kiln. I worked and reworked the soft
clay to make certain that each bubble was removed. After the kiln, I was relieved to see that my
piece had surveyed and was rigid and unchangeable.   </p>
<p>We are much like a soft piece of clay. Who will we allow to shape us--will it be the master
potter, Our Heavenly Father? I like the words of the prophet Omni in the Book of Mormon.
Please turn to Omni 1:26. I believe that he gives us great insight on the subject of submission. He
writes: "And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the
Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come
unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him . . . and as the Lord liveth ye will be
saved." </p>
<p><strong><em>Quoting again:</em></strong></p>
<p>	But a vessel that has integrity comes from the fire stronger and more beautiful than ever.
In life, too, we pass through fiery trials that test our faith and integrity.  Then if we have
remained centered on Christ, and if through true repentance we have let him make us
whole and sound, taking from us our flaws and mistakes, we come forth from the fire as
beautiful, useful vessels in His hands.</p>
<p>God can make much more out of our lives than we can. To the degree we allow, He will shape
our hearts with life's events in the same way the master artisan shapes his clay.</p>
<p>Speaking of the heart, the leading cause of death in United States is cardiovascular disease.
Diseases of the heart kill 40% of the 2.4 million Americans who die each year. As serious as it is,
I would like to propose an even worse heart condition which affects more than just the physical
body--Spiritual Heart Disease.</p>
<p>This is a rock with a heart painted on it. This is a sponge with a heart painted on it. As you have
guessed they represent the contrast of a hard heart and a soft heart. Comparing some of Nephi's
action with Laman and Lemuels' illustrates these two types of hearts.</p>
<p>Laman and Lemuel ". . . did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a
visionary man . . . and had lead them out of Jerusalem . . . because of the foolish imaginations of
his heart." (1 Nephi 2:11.)</p>
<p>In contrast, Nephi shows a healthy heart condition. Nephi wrote, "Laman and Lemuel would not
hearken unto my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, I cried unto
the Lord for them" (1 Nephi 2:18.)</p>
<p>Nephi writes further, "I did cry unto the Lord and behold, he did visit me and did soften my heart
that I did believe all the words of my father, wherefore, I did not rebel like unto my brothers" (1
Nephi 2:16.)  Nephi's counsel given to Laman and Lemuel was "hard to be understood, save a
man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look
unto the Lord as they ought" (1 Ne. 15:3).</p>
<p>If you put a rock in water it absorbs almost nothing.  Only the surface gets wet.  Laman and
Lemuel complained, murmured and rebelled.  They had no faith, were negative, depressed and
critical of others and being "past feeling" that they could not feel the still small voice. (1 Nephi
17:45.)  They weren't interested in praying to find a solution to life's problems.  We could liken
Nephi's heart to a sponge that when is placed in water, will absorb it.</p>
<p>In The Book of Mormon, here are a few examples from The Book of Mormon that identify
references to spiritual trouble:  </p>
<p>The danger of allowing our hearts to experience symptoms of hard-heartedness is limiting our
ability to feel the promptings of the spirit. Section 8, of the Doctrine and Covenants verses 2 and
3, is a revelation to Oliver Cowdery given through the prophet Joseph Smith. It states "Yea,
behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon
you and which shall dwell in your heart.  Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation."</p>
<p>Can you see the difference between a soft heart (sponge), and a hard heart (rock.)?  How much
inspiration can a hard heart receive?  How much molding or sculpting can the Lord do?  Hard
hearts, leads to unhappiness, and ultimately to the destruction of the soul and entire nations.</p>
<p>We begin to submit our will to Heavenly Father by controlling our thought. Learning to control
our thoughts helps us to control our actions. President Lee said the following, quoting E. D.
Boardman:  </p>
<p>	Sow a thought, reap an act,<br />
	Sow an act, reap a habit,<br />
	Sow a habit, reap a character,<br />
	Sow a character, reap an eternal destiny<br />
	(E. D. Boardman, in Conference Report, Apr. 1962, 7)</p>
<p>Our thoughts lead to our actions. When we control our thoughts and actions we are in the process
of turning our lives over to God. </p>
<p>In Neal A Maxwell's talk "Willing to Submit," he said, "While events often induce
submissiveness, one's development need not be dramatic or tied to a single moment. It can occur
steadily in seemingly ordinary, daily settings." Truly turning unto God usually happens ". . . line
upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little . . ." (2 Nephi 28:30).</p>
<p>In order for our Heavenly Father to mold us to our true potential, our heart has to be right.  We
must be willing to be tested as Abraham was. We must submit to the will of the Lord.  Our best
example was the Savior who did the will of the Father in all things. </p>
<p>In Conference 1985 Neal A. Maxwell spoke of how we can get our hearts in the right condition.</p>
<p>	The Savior gave the first requirement.  (1 Matt 18: 3) 'Except ye . . . become as little
children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>	To become as a little child, (Mosiah 3: 19), a disciple must be submissive, meek, humble,
full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him,
even as a child doth submit to his father.'  Hence the softening of the heart-to be flexible
to the Lord's will.  We cannot do it half-heartedly, for this produces only half the growth,
half the blessings, half a life really.</p>
<p>Hugh B. Brown, a member of the Quorum of the twelve who is now deceased, had a pivotal
experience that helped him realize the value of submission to the Lord's will. He later told of the
experience in the following story:</p>
<p><strong>THE CURRANT BUSH</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Quoting:</em></strong></p>
<p>You sometimes wonder whether the Lord really knows what He ought to do with you. You
sometimes wonder if you know better than He does about what you ought to do and ought to
become. I am wondering if I may tell you a story. It has to do with an incident in my life when
God showed me that He knew best.</p>
<p>I was living up in Canada. I had purchased a farm. It was run-down. I went out one morning and
saw a currant bush. It had grown up over six feet high. It was going all to wood. There were no
blossoms and no currants. I was raised on a fruit farm in Salt Lake before we went to Canada,
and I knew what ought to happen to that currant bush. So I got some pruning shears and clipped
it back until there was nothing left but stumps. It was just coming daylight, and I thought I saw
on top of each of these little stumps what appeared to be a tear, and I thought the currant bush
was crying. I was kind of simpleminded, and I looked at it and smiled and said, "What are you
crying about?" You know, I thought I heard that currant bush say this:</p>
<p>"How could you do this to me? I was making such wonderful growth. I was almost as big as the
shade tree and the fruit tree that are inside the fence, and now you have cut me down. Every plant
in the garden will look down on me because I didn't make what I should have made. How could
you do this to me? I thought you were the gardener here."</p>
<p>That's what I thought I heard the currant bush say, and I thought it so much that I answered. I
said, "Look, little currant bush, I am the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. I didn't
intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and someday, little
currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, 'Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for
loving me enough to cut me down. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.' "</p>
<p>Years passed, and I found myself in England. I was in command of a cavalry unit in the Canadian
Army. I held the rank of field officer in the British Canadian Army. I was proud of my position.
And there was an opportunity for me to become a general. I had taken all the examinations. I had
the seniority. The one man between me and the office of general in the British Army became a
casualty, and I received a telegram from London. It said: "Be in my office tomorrow morning at
10:00," signed by General Turner.</p>
<p>I went up to London. I walked smartly into the office of the general, and I saluted him smartly,
and he gave me the same kind of a salute a senior officer usually gives--a sort of "Get out of the
way, worm!" He said, "Sit down, Brown." Then he said, "I'm sorry I cannot make the
appointment. You are entitled to it. You have passed all the examinations. You have the
seniority. You've been a good officer, but I can't make the appointment. You are to return to
Canada and become a training officer and a transport officer." That for which I had been hoping
and praying for 10 years suddenly slipped out of my fingers.</p>
<p>Then he went into the other room to answer the telephone, and on his desk, I saw my personal
history sheet. Right across the bottom of it was written, "THIS MAN IS A MORMON." We were
not very well liked in those days. When I saw that, I knew why I had not been appointed. He
came back and said, "That's all, Brown." I saluted him again, but not quite as smartly, and went
out.</p>
<p>I got on the train and started back to my town, 120 miles away, with a broken heart, with
bitterness in my soul. And every click of the wheels on the rails seemed to say, "You are a
failure." When I got to my tent, I was so bitter that I threw my cap on the cot. I clenched my fists,
and I shook them at heaven. I said, "How could you do this to me, God? I have done everything I
could do to measure up. There is nothing that I could have done--that I should have done--that I
haven't done. How could you do this to me?" I was as bitter as gall.</p>
<p>And then I heard a voice, and I recognized the tone of this voice. It was my own voice, and the
voice said, "I am the gardener here. I know what I want you to do." The bitterness went out of my
soul, and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for my ungratefulness and my
bitterness. While kneeling there I heard a song being sung in an adjoining tent. A number of
Mormon boys met regularly every Tuesday night. I usually met with them. We would sit on the
floor and have Mutual. As I was kneeling there, praying for forgiveness, I heard their singing:</p>
<p><em></em><em>"But if, by a still, small voice he calls<br />
To paths that I do not know,<br />
I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:<br />
I'll go where you want me to go."<br />
</em>("I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go," Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, 1985, # 270)</p>
<p>I arose from my knees a humble man. And now, almost 50 years later, I look up to Him and say,
"Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for cutting me down, for loving me enough to hurt me." I see now
that it was wise that I should not become a general at that time, because if I had I would have
been senior officer of all western Canada, with a lifelong, handsome salary, a place to live, and a
pension, but I would have raised my six daughters and two sons in army barracks. They would no
doubt have married out of the Church, and I think I would not have amounted to anything.</p>
<p>Many of you are going to have very difficult experiences, disappointment, heartbreak, and defeat.
You are going to be tested and tried. I just want you to know that if you don't get what you think
you ought to get, remember, God is the gardener here. He knows what He wants you to be.
Submit yourselves to His will. Be worthy of His blessings, and you will get His blessings. </p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer had an experience where he had to submit his life to God's will. He
had just been called as an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve and moved to Salt Lake City to
find a permanent home.  He located a home that was ideally suited to his family's needs.  Elder
Lee was helping President Packer make his choice and advised him "By all means, you are to
proceed."</p>
<p>President Packer felt that he could not proceed.  He had just completed the course work on his
Doctorate Degree and with supporting a wife and eight children, had used all his resources on his
education.  They could barely get into the house let alone make the payments. And even though
he borrowed on his insurance, and after gathering on every resource, he still didn't have enough.
Elder Lee continued to insist saying "Go ahead. I know it is right."</p>
<p>President Packer was in deep turmoil because he was being asked to sign a contract without the
resources to meet the payments.  He had never done this before.</p>
<p>Sensing Brother Packer's feelings, Elder Lee sent him to David O. McKay, the president of the
church at that time. Listening very carefully to Elder Packer, Pres. Lee advised him saying "You
do this, It is the right thing" without offering any additional resources to meet the payments. This
made Elder Packer very uneasy.</p>
<p>Elder Packer said the following "I was still not at peace, and then came the lesson." President Lee
taught him the following when he said, "Boyd, do you know what is wrong with you -you always
want to see the end from the beginning."  President Packer quietly replied that he wanted to see at
least a few steps ahead.</p>
<p>President Lee quoted the 12<sup>th</sup> Chapter of Ether, verse 6.  "Wherefore, dispute not because ye see
not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith."  Then he added, "My boy, you
must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and perhaps a few steps into the darkness, and you
will find that the light will appear and move ahead of you."</p>
<p>We will find that we do not always need to see the end from the beginning. If we submit to the
will of the Lord, we can trust that he knows the end from the beginning. "For my thoughts are not
your thoughts, neither <em>are</em> your ways my ways . . .For <em>as</em> the heavens are higher than the earth, so
are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8-9). </p>
<p>Our hearts are shaped by the Lord, if we are willing to submit through our faith in him.  One of
my favorite bible stories in Daniel verse 3:17-18, is about the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar
set up in the plain of Dura. All were commanded to worship when the music was played.  It was
reported to King Nebuchadnezzar that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego would not worship
the golden image.  They were summoned before the King and told that they would be thrown into
the fiery furnace if they did not worship it.  I love the courage and faith that they demonstrate.
They responded to the King's reply "Our God is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace,
BUT IF NOT, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy Gods."   These great
young men were willing to trust God regardless of the outcome. </p>
<p>I like to think of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego as BYU-I students because they have the
same character.  They trusted in God because they knew that he could deliver them. They were
obedient while facing an unknown outcome, submitting their hearts to God. Elder Maxwell said:
<strong>"YIELDING ONE'S HEART TO GOD SIGNALS THE LAST STAGE IN OUR
SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT."  God did more for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
than they ever could have done for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon tells of the 2000 stripling warriors who put their trust in God and were
protected in the midst of armed conflict.  We just celebrated the fourth of July and remembered
those who defended our freedom. Our modern day soldiers have had to put their trust in God
while going into battle. According to God's plan some did not return and others did. The book,
"Saints at War" records the experiences of some of these men.  I would like to use a couple of
examples of LDS men submitting to the will of the Lord in the face of death.</p>
<p>Alden Maynes was a copilot on a B-17 bomber.  He had completed 25 successful missions over
Germany when his luck ran out.  The crew had just released six bombs over Berlin when the tail
of the airplane was shot away, throwing the plane into a barrel roll. As Brother Maynes tried to
make his way to the escape hatch, his parachute caught on something and was pulled open.  He
attempted to close it without success and was forced to bail anyway.  At 27,000 feet without
oxygen, he lost consciousness as he fell through the air.  When he came to, he was still falling
and the war was going on around him.  Planes were still dropping bombs and antiaircraft guns
were still being fired.  Falling toward a mass of fire and destruction, with his parachute trailing
unopened above him, he gyrated in 25 foot circles. He tried to draw it down in hopes he could
force it open, but the effort proved impossible.  At this point, he talked to the God and told him
that he had done all that he could do and that it was now in God's hands.  Alden Maynes
submitted completely trusted in the will of the Lord.  Immediately a calm and peaceful feeling
settled over him and he knew that whatever happened would be all right.</p>
<p>As he continued to fall, he drifted away from the bombed area. As he fell past a six-story
building, his chute caught hold of the roof, holding him briefly and then tore loose. Barely
missing the building, his parachute caught again, this time on a street lamp--saving his life,
suspending him feet three feet above the sidewalk.  Though he was taken prisoner, in his heart
knew that God had spared his life.  <strong>God did more for Alden Maynes than he ever could have
done for himself.</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Banks was also a B-17 crew member whose plane was shot down over Germany.  He was
taken prisoner and decided along with three of his buddy's that they would escape.  They made
their break from the prison, but now had to get out of Germany to obtain freedom.  Trusting in
the Lord, Joseph Banks made his way through a darkened town.  The three had split up and were
creeping about ten feet apart when to the left of brother Banks, he heard a voice in the darkness. 
As he instinctively turned to look, a door opened. The light from inside the house shined on him
and blinded him temporarily.  He stood like a deer caught in headlights unable to move or do
anything.  Suddenly a German soldier came striding out of the house straight for him. The
darkness hid his companions and they were able to take cover.</p>
<p>As the soldier got closer, his shadow shielded Brother Banks eyes so that he could see a large
German tank beside the house.  He didn't know whether to run, put his hands up or beg for
mercy--so he just stood there in his tattered prison clothes. They had bright white letters painted
on his shirt and pants making it very obvious that he was a prisoner of war.  At this point all he
could do was submit to the will of the Lord.  When the soldier reached him he shouted something
unintelligible to him in German. Before he could think of what to do, Brother Banks heard
himself respond with a calm, confident, German phrase that obviously was appropriate to what
he'd asked.  The German replied to whatever Brother Banks had said with an almost cheerful,
"Ya, Ya, Ya."  Then he put his arms around the woman and went back in the house.  His buddies
asked, "What on earth did he say?"   "I don't have a clue", he replied, but in his heart he felt a
burning that the Holy Ghost had interpreted what the German said and granted him the gift of
tongues to reply.  The spirit must have also transformed his appearance to prevent his being
recognized as a prisoner of war.  The Holy Ghost bore witness to Joseph Banks that his life had
been spared as he submitted to the will of the Lord.<strong> God did more for Joseph Banks than he
ever could have done for himself.</strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow we celebrate the pioneers entering the Salt Lake Valley on the 24<sup>th</sup> of July, 1847. 
Many us have ancestors who made that historic trek to the west.  My own fourth great
Grandfather Cheney came into the valley with a company of Saints, but some of my ancestors
stayed behind in Nauvoo.  My 5<sup>th</sup> Great Grandfather was Ezekial Johnson of Nauvoo, Illinois. 
He and his wife, Julia Hills Johnson, had sixteen children and learned about the church shortly
after it was founded.  Julia and the children joined the church while Ezekial was away. He was
greatly offended so he hardened his heart and remained a nonmember while his family became
actively involved in the church.  When Joseph Smith was martyred, Ezekial's heart began to
soften.  As the saints departed Nauvoo, Ezekial and his two sons remained behind to guard the
Nauvoo Temple, under direction of Brigham Young. Ezekial saw the injustice of the mobs and
decided it was time to join the church.  But before he had an opportunity to act on his desire,
Ezekial's life took a sudden turn. </p>
<p>During a time there was intense Latter Day Saint persecution. One night Ezekial was guarding
the temple, and was all alone. He had only a rifle for protection when he saw a mob coming
down the street, determined to burn the temple.  He thought quickly, and as they made their way
closer, Ezekial stopped them, warning that if they took one step further, he would signal an entire
militia of Mormons to attack them.  The mob retreated, and again came back, this time using a
different route. Again, they met Ezekial standing in their path and again they backed down.  Two
weeks later after the mob had learned of his bluff, they caught hold of Ezekial and beat him so
severely that he was bedridden and eventually died. Though he was never baptized in this life,
Brigham Young said upon learning of his death that Ezekial would one day stand at the head of
his large and growing posterity.  Ezekial's son, my fourth great grandfather wrote the Hymn,
High on the Mountain Top" after arriving in Salt Lake and seeing an ensign on the mountain
above the city.  Other sons settled colonies throughout southern Utah including Santaquinn and
St. George just to name a few.  Ezekial's heart was softened and he committed himself to
submitting to the will of the Lord, giving his life in the process.  <strong>God has done much more for
the posterity of my Great Grandfathers than they ever could have done for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith said the following:</p>
<p>Life is a grindstone and whether it grinds a man down or polishes him up depends on the stuff
he is made of. </p>
<p>The administration of this University has been a great example to us, by submitting to the will of
the Lord as they have changed this school from a two year College to a four year University. 
Sacrifices have been made, peoples lives altered, new faculty hired and resources stretched to
implement God's plan for BYU-I.</p>
<p>We as students have the opportunity to submit to the will of the Lord to continue to make this
University great. Elder Henry B. Eyring emphasized the importance of the students role in
making this university great when he visited this campus in September of last year. He said, "I
need to talk first to the students because the Lord cares about you and would want me to
recognize what has always been recognized at Ricks College, that the institution is largely
determined by you."  </p>
<p>As a student body, we reflect what BYU-I is.  For that reason, we need to analyze our lives and
attitudes.  Are our hearts right before the Lord? Are we willing to submit to the Lord, obey his
commandments, and serve him with all of our hearts?  In my very first devotional attendance at
this institution, in August of 99, President Bednar said the following:</p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>Quote
 </em></strong></p>
<p>Conversely, casualness about or the breaking of covenants and commitments, failing to pray and
study the scriptures, and inappropriate thoughts and actions and language and dress cause the
Holy Ghost to withdraw or to avoid us altogether.  Can you begin to understand why abiding by
the Honor and Dress Codes are so important to your success at Ricks College?  These codes are
not about curfew and clothing; rather, they are about commitments and obedience.  Most
importantly, the Honor and Dress Codes are about inviting the presence of the Holy Ghost into
our lives, into our classrooms, and to this special campus.</p>
<p>I know that it is by abiding the Honor Code we can add to the legacy of this institution.<br />
Remember what President Benson said about how God can shape your life:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE - Ezra T. Benson</strong></p>
<p>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that he can make a lot more out
of their lives than they can.  He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds,
strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities,
comfort their souls, raise up friends and pour out peace. Whosoever will lose their life in the
service of God will find eternal life.</p>
<p>"O Lord, thou art our father; and we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of
thy hand" (Isaiah 64:8).  </p>
<p>Only by submitting fully to the will of the Lord do we reach our full potential.  God can do more
for us than we could ever do for ourselves.</p>
<p>May we allow God to sculpt and soften our hearts that we may achieve all that God has planned
for us.   I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman">What a blessing it is to belong to a Church that has a prophet who receives direction from God
for the benefit of His children.  One of the most remarkable examples of this direction was the
establishment of the Perpetual Education Fund in April 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I can see how this might have come about.  Envision a hypothetical Personal Priesthood
Interview between President Hinckley and the Lord sometime in late 2000 or early 2001--before
April Conference.  President Hinckley is reporting his stewardship as the President of the
Church.  He is explaining what has been accomplished in the last 10 years:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	The Church has reached 11 million members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	In the last 10 years, more than 7000 wards and 700 stakes have been created to
accommodate the growth of the Church. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	Thirty-five temples were dedicated in 2000 bringing the total temples in use to over 100.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	For the first time there are more members outside the US than inside.In the last ten years,
the number of missionaries in the field has increased almost 50% to about 60,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	In 2000, more than 5 million copies of the Book of Mormon were distributed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	Church curriculum is available in 175 languages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	The Family:  A Proclamation to the World was released in 1995.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	In 2000, plans are underway to introduce the Church to more than 3 billion viewers
through 10,000 reports for the Winter Olympics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	There is unprecedented acceptance of the Church in most parts of the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I can hear the Lord saying, "That's wonderful progress!  I commend you, but you need to do
more.  I see some major areas that need your attention.  First, what are you doing about the poor
among you? And second, what are you doing to prepare for leadership in the Church as it grows
outside the United States?"  The prophet announced to the world the Perpetual Education Fund at
April Conference in the spring of 2001 and this program addresses these needs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me share with you a portion of a film that has been prepared by the Perpetual Education
Department to explain the Program:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Elder Eyring quoted the 38<sup>th</sup> Section of the Doctrine and Covenants illustrating that the Lord is
just.  There are many more scriptures that refer to our need to take care of the poor. Consider the
following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that
doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple. (Doctrine and Covenants 52:40)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord,
have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are
made low. (Doctrine and Covenants 104:15-16)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	And the Lord called his people ZION, because they were of one heart and one mind, and
dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them. (Moses 7:18)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I
may have eternal life?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good?  There is none good but one, that is,
God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack
I yet?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great
possessions. (Matthew 19:16-22)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the years the Church has a solid history of taking care of the poor.  In 1839, during
Brigham Young's leadership in removing the saints from Missouri, he moved<em> "</em>that we this day
enter into a covenant to stand by and assist each other to the utmost of our abilities in remaining
from this state, and that we will never desert the poor and worthy till they shall be out of reach of
the exterminating order of General Clark, acting for, and in the name of the state<em>."</em>  (Edward
Tulliege, History of the Church, Salt Lake City, 1884, p. 636).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, the Saints decided to migrate to the Rocky
Mountains.  In a conference in the Nauvoo Temple, President Young made the motion: "that we
take all the Saints with us, to the extent of our ability, that is our influence and property."  This
motion was carried unanimously, whereupon President Young prophesied that God would bless
them with the means to accomplish the resolution.  As a result we have no record of anyone
being left behind because they had no means to get to Utah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1849 there were about 6000 members in the Salt Lake Valley but many more members were
abroad, primarily in England.  Under President Young's leadership a plan was devised to help
these mostly poor members, but with valuable skills, come to Utah.  This plan was called The
Perpetual Emigration Fund.  Under this plan, money was loaned to members that had no means
to get to Utah.  It was expected that when they got here they would pay off the loan.  This was a
revolving fund; as the money was returned it would then be reloaned to the next family of worthy
saints to permit them to emigrate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">By the end of 1855, almost 22,000 members had been helped and by 1870 when the
transcontinental railroad was completed, it was estimated about 50,000 people had been assisted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The principal sources of funds were contributions of labor, produce, cash, livestock, and
equipment by Church members in the Great Basin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it any wonder that when Brigham Young died, the first thing mentioned of his long list of
achievements was:  "He has, under God, rescued thousands from poverty and raised them to
independence." (Deseret News, August 20, 1877.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On a more modest scale, the Church established the Education Fund on May 27, 1903.  Under
this program, loans were made, at a low interest rate, to assist in the promotion of advanced
learning among the young people of the Church, and especially to help Church schoolteachers
obtain a higher education.  Church schoolteachers agreed to contribute Â½ of 1% of their salaries
to start the fund and the Church General Board of Education matched this contribution.  As is
turned out, this program helped many prominent leaders in the Church.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Given the scriptural and historical foundation of the Program, it is little wonder that when the
Perpetual Education Fund was announced it literally resonated with the saints.  I remember my
own reaction as I sat in that Priesthood Meeting and the confirmation of the Spirit that I was
hearing the prophet describe an inspired program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Everywhere we go the Saints respond with warmth and enthusiasm, with favorable sentiment and
general good will.  People want to hear about the program in detail.  Invariably, they indicate full
support.  Why?  Because our people recognize this program is inspired.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I want to read a letter from a missionary that illustrates the feelings we see everywhere we go in
the Church:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Dear Brothers of the Perpetual Education Fund:</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>This donation has been long time in the waiting.  I promised myself on my mission that I would
donate this amount to the Perpetual Education Fund on returning.  However, for the past two
months, temptation has kept me from it.  Here is my meager donation made with a heart filled
gratitude for all the Lord as done for me.  If you don't mind I would like to share the story
behind this letter.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>When I was about a year into my mission I was in an area where we could not watch General
Conference.  Although we listened to a small portion via Internet we missed the session when
President Hinckley announced the Perpetual Education Fund.  About two or three weeks later I
had the pleasure of training a new missionary from the MTC.  With the new assignment of
trainer come many responsibilities but also news from home.  One day while waiting for lunch
we began discussing General Conference.  Out of the blue my companion began telling me of
this new program the church had announced that would make possible for the poorer returned
missionaries to go to school and receive an education.  As soon as he described the fund to me, I
broke down and cried.  I mean I really cried.  I felt an incredible sensation burning within my
chest and I knew in an instant that it was from God.  I knew in that instant that Gordon B.
Hinckley was a prophet of God, and it came by way of revelation directly from our Heavenly
Father.  There was no doubt.  I began to understand the love God has for all his children and his
desire to help them in their struggles.  I am not a rich man.  I come from a good family that has
what it needs.  My parents through their hard work have set aside money to pay for my school.  I
decided that I could work to pay for a semester or two and donate a small portion to help my
brothers from Latin and South America that I have grown to love with all my heart.  The Lord
has blessed me so much.  I love Him with all my heart.  May the Lord continue to bless you all as
you continue to serve Him.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This letter was accompanied by a check for $5,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Saints have opened their hearts and made contributions in many unique ways.  The Fund has
a wonderful start but we've got a long way to go.  Let me share with you some of the letters that
have accompanied the donations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One family wrote saying that their dad made a deal with them that if each of the five children
would each earn a specified amount for snowmobiles, then their dad would pay for the rest. 
After the Perpetual Education Fund was announced, they had a family council and talked about
sacrifice and how richly they had been blessed.  Together they decided to make a contribution to
the Fund and forego the snowmobiles.  The letter was accompanied by a sizeable check--the
equivalent of five snowmobiles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One woman came by the office and left an unusually valuable diamond ring.  It was accompanied
by a letter that said:  Please have no alarm at this as we are extremely blessed in all ways.  This is
a gift from both my husband and myself, freely given and will not be missed.  I could never wear
this as I always felt it was 'too much' and am so pleased to have it here with you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there's the handwritten letter from the 92-year-old sister together with a nice check.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Dear Brethren:</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em></em></font><font face="Times New Roman"><em>I am a 92-year-old widow and have turned over in my mind many times the desire I've had to
contribute to the Perpetual Education Fund ever since it was announced by President Hinckley. 
Certainly it is a worthy cause and I do have a lot of compassion for all who have less than I do. 
My 5 girls feel I should do what I like.  Somehow making the decision to contribute to the Church
seems to make me the happiest.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>I have seen the poverty in some of those countries and know that the situation there has not been
over-estimated.  I spent 2 years in the mission field over the very same period of time as
President Hinckley was on his first mission.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>My conscience insisted that I send it so I hope it will be worthwhile.  I do pray for the success of
this Program.  I wanted to do this myself, so hope you'll overlook the mistakes in my writing and
having to use lined paper.  I neither see or hear very well but give thanks for all that I have and
pray the Lord's blessings on all.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I could go on and tell you about:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">An institute in New Mexico that gave each student that wanted to participate a dollar and then,
consistent with the parable of the talents, sent them out to make it grow.  They raised an amazing
amount for the Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps you've noticed in obituary notices the request:<em> </em>In lieu of flowers, please make a
contribution to the Perpetual Education Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The wonderful thing about the program is that it is more than a loan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me illustrate what I'm talking about by telling you of Isis Avila, a 23-year-old returned
missionary from Brazil who is becoming a computer network technician through a PEF loan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>When I was 15, I met the Church and it made me very happy.  But my parents did not agree with
my baptism and forced me to leave the house.  It was hard because we had a very good financial
situation.  But I left and stayed with a member family.  I never had a relationship with my family
again.  I never turned back, and worked very hard to have money to go on a mission.  That
helped me value my mission more than anything.  When I returned, however, I did not have a
penny or a place to live.  I suffered much in those first few months.  Would I ever have anything,
any hope in my life?  I fasted and prayed for the opportunity to help myself and others.  Then I
heard about the Perpetual Education Fund.  It is such a blessing!  I have learned much already
in my courses and I believe I will be able to compete in the workplace.  I intend to pay back my
PEF loan as fast as I can so others may be blessed.  I'm grateful to the members who donate
funds.  I have a strong feeling of gratitude for President Hinckley and I know that his love and
concern are evidence of the sacred nature of his calling.  I know that despite all challenges, we
have to go forward with the hope of a better world.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We have many more stories like these.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let me tell you what has been accomplished to date with the earnings on the funds with
which we have been entrusted. We cannot loan the principle; we can only loan the earnings on
these amounts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let me now show you a profile of the participants:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This program is going to have a profound impact on the Church; perhaps more of an impact than
any of us realizes.  It will bless families; it will bless the Church and it will bless the community. 
But, we are not there yet.  The program is not fully funded, and we need the continual support
and sacrifice of the saints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I want to close with something that President Hinckley said in 1978.  "I heard a man of
prominence say the other day, 'I have amended the language of my prayers.  Instead of saying
bless the poor and the sick and the needy, I now say, Father, show me how to help the poor and
sick and needy, and give me the resolution to do so."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I think we have been shown how we can help the poor and the needy.  I pray that we'll have the
resolution to do so!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the name of Jesus Chris, amen.</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><b>"LESSONS LEARNED FROM AN ELASTIC BAND"</b></em></p>
<p align="CENTER">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
August 23, 2002<br />
Roger G. Christensen</p>
<p>Elder &amp; Sister Haight, President &amp; Sister Bednar, Brothers &amp; Sisters; it is an honor for
me to be here at this first August Commencement at BYU-Idaho.  On behalf of the Board
of Trustees and particularly from Elder Eyring, as the Commissioner of Education, I bring
love and greetings to all of you.</p>
<p>I, like you, am looking forward to hearing from one of Idaho's native sons and an apostle
of Jesus Christ, Elder David B. Haight, so I will keep my remarks brief this morning.</p>
<p>I would like to share a few thoughts about lessons learned from an elastic band.  In order
to appreciate my qualifications to address this topic, you need to know that I grew up in
Northern California.  We had early morning seminary there that began at 6:30 am every
weekday morning.  During my senior year in high school, I delivered 500 morning
newspapers to apartment buildings and newsstands in our town and had to be finished
early enough to get home and get ready to go to seminary.  My days started very early and
I saw a fair number of elastic bands that year.  At the time, I didn't think much of elastic
bands.  In fact, when I did think about them at all it was generally with some level of
disdain.</p>
<p>However, some lessons of life are not always learned or appreciated at the moment.  But
with the passage of time and some reflection, greater insights can be gained.</p>
<p>As you consider an elastic band by itself, it is not worth very much.  An elastic band can
only fulfill the purpose for which it was created when it is stretched.  In the stretching
process, its value increases.</p>
<p>In that sense, our lives are similar to elastic bands; our value increases as we are
stretched.  Think about some of the stretching moments and experiences you may have
had so far in your own life.  Most of you probably grew up in a home where you were
taught and cared for by loving parents.  Leaving the comfort and security of home to go
off to kindergarten may have been a stretching experience for some of you.  Facing
unknown surroundings and unfamiliar people and activities can cause great anxiety.  You
may have been stretched beyond your comfort zone.  Over time, however, you became
accustomed to the new routine and your circumstances did not seem as challenging.</p>
<p>The same cycle probably occurred when you left elementary school and entered junior
high.  Ah, the memories of seventh grade!  Then came high school.  At each step, you
have been stretched a little more, your perspective has been broadened and your life has
been changed.</p>
<p>As pre-college students, you likely had to stretch some to qualify to be admitted to this
university.  As students here, hopefully you have had many new and challenging
experiences; you have been stretched to think new thoughts and experience new things.</p>
<p>Now as you leave this place and go on to other opportunities, you will be leaving the
comfort and security of a familiar place and be going into a world that is sometimes cold
and harsh.  Hopefully, you will continue to stretch and make a difference wherever you
are.  Because you have an eternal perspective of who you are and who others are, you can
have a powerful influence in the lives of your friends and colleagues, those with whom
you will associate throughout your life, if you will stretch beyond your own comfort zone
and really strive to make a difference.</p>
<p>Some of you either have served or will serve a mission for the Church someplace in the
world; others have had or will have the opportunity to add an eternal companion to your
life.  Others may experience broken hearts, birth of a child, loss of a loved one, loss of
employment, unfulfilled dreams or expectations, or some other new or challenging phase
in life.  Each of these stretching moments helps you look not only inward, but also
heavenward to find out who you really are.  As the Lord allows these stretching
opportunities, you find how dependent you are on Him for all things.</p>
<p>The ultimate stretching that ever took place occurred in the Garden of Gethsemane and
then at Calvary.  The Lord's heart, soul and body were stretched to include all of us.  He
understands our worries.  He understands our joys.  He understands our trials.  He
understands the stretching that is taking place in each of our lives.  The prophet Alma
declared, "He shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind;
and this that the word might be fulfilledÂ…that he may know according to the flesh how to
succor his people."  (Alma 7:11-12)  Jacob tells us that the Lord "remembereth and
stretches forth his handsÂ…all the day longÂ…with his arm of mercy extended towards you." 
(Jacob 6:4-5)</p>
<p>Regardless of the circumstances in our lives, His love is all encompassing.  He will not let
us be stretched to the breaking point when we are obedient to His commandments, for
"GodÂ…will not suffer you to be tempted [or stretched] above that ye are able."  (1
Corinthians 10:13)  </p>
<p>If we want to become like He is, we need to be stretched even if it feels unpleasant. 
Sometimes it may even hurt.  But in the stretching process, we will grow and increase in
value to Him and to our fellow beings.</p>
<p>May we be appropriately elastic in our daily efforts as we stretch to become anxiously
engaged in doing His will and to fulfill the purpose of our creation.</p>

<p align="CENTER">&quot;<b><i>LOVE LIVING YOUR RELIGION"</i></b></p>
<p align="CENTER">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
August 23, 2002<br />
President David A. Bednar</p>
<p>Today you graduates are participating in a most significant and historic event--the first ever
August commencement at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  We are especially honored to have
Elder David B. Haight presiding at this ceremony.  Today is a day you will long remember and a
day about which you will tell your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>In Seattle, Washington, I recently participated in a meeting of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy. 
Elder L. Tom Perry presided at our quorum meeting, and he was accompanied by Elder&nbsp;Earl C.
Tingey of the Presidency of the Seventy.  The instruction provided by these Brethren was timely
and powerful, the sociality among my associates of the quorum was strong and warm, and the
spirit we felt was edifying and inspiring.  All in attendance were blessed to share in a wonderful
learning experience.</p>
<p>After our quorum meeting was concluded,  I was privileged to spend several hours with Elder
Perry and Elder Tingey waiting in the Seattle airport for a flight to Salt Lake City.  We talked
about a wide range of topics, and I had the opportunity to ask these Brethren a number of
questions.  Elder Perry's answer to one of my questions is the basis for my remarks this morning.</p>
<p>During our time together I asked the following question: "Elder Perry, I will be with
approximately 150 BYU-Idaho students tomorrow night in a home evening.  Is there anything
you would have me teach or convey to those students from you?"  He responded without
hesitation, "Teach them to live their religion.  This is a much different world than it was 10 or 15
or 20 years ago.  There is a critical need for leadership in so many places and in so many aspects
of today's world, and the Latter-day Saints need to live their religion and provide that leadership. 
Please teach them to live their religion." </p>
<p>I conveyed Elder Perry's message to the students in that home evening the following night, and I
have pondered his answer a great deal since then.  My brief message to you this morning as you
graduate from Brigham Young University-Idaho is a simple one: Live your religion.  In a world
that grows increasingly dark because of distrust, cynicism, and unethical behavior, employees at
and graduates from Brigham Young University-Idaho must live their religion and radiate the light
of the gospel and be an influence for good wherever we may be and in whatever we may do. 
Please consider Elder Perry's counsel in light of these verses from Matthew 5:13-16:</p>
<p> <em>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it
be salted?  it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden
under foot of men.<br />
	Ye are the light of the world.  A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br />
	Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick;
and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br />
	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
your Father which is in heaven.</em></p>
<p>Can we see the influence of this campus in the world as graduates armed with both gospel truth
and ability assume roles in families, in the Church, in business, in government, in education, and
in other spheres of activity?  Can we recognize that the world will come to this campus to find
young people who can create opportunities and solve problems and teach and discover and
innovate--and who will do so from a foundation of moral strength and correct principles?  In a
world increasingly filled with darkness, the image of Christ in the countenances of graduates
from BYU-Idaho will radiate a light that will literally ". . . chase darkness from among you"
(Doctrine and Covenants 50:25).  Can you students see and feel on this day of graduation that
your responsibility is increasing and that </p>
<p align="CENTER"><em>The harvest is great and the lab'rers are few;<br />
But if we're united, we all things can do.<br />
We'll gather the wheat from the midst of the tares<br />
And bring them from bondage, from sorrows and snares.<br />
</em>("Ye Elders of Israel,"<em> Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>, #319)</p>
<p>Let me also suggest that we must not only live our religion, but we must <strong>love</strong> living our religion. 
Adherence to gospel principles and obedience to God's commandments are not drudgery we
must somehow suffer through during mortality.  Rather, gospel truth and obedience to eternal law
are the very source and the very cause of true happiness.  As the Prophet Joseph Smith plainly
taught:</p>
<p> <em>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if
we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness,
faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.  But we cannot
keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to
know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we
have already received.</em>  (<u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, Section Five,
1842-43, p. 255)</p>
<p>And as King Benjamin counseled his people in Mosiah 2:41:</p>
<p> <em>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy
state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed
in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end
they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these things are true; for
the Lord God hath spoken it.</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please listen to and heed the counsel I have shared with you from a latter-day apostle and prophet:  "Live your religion."  You and I must be careful not to let the simplicity
of the teaching cause us to "look beyond the mark" and to seek for things that we cannot
understand (Jacob 4:14).  I testify that as you and I love living our religion we will be blessed,
prospered, and strengthened and that we will become evermore effective instruments in the hands
of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to conclude on a personal note.  Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so
much enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your apartments, participating with you in
home evenings and eating ice cream together, talking about your challenges and opportunities,
answering your questions, and becoming better acquainted.  We will miss you.  And we would
love to hear from you; please be sure to let us know about the things that are happening in your
lives.</p>
<p>Today you graduates become official alumni of BYU-Idaho, and you now have the responsibility
to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at this remarkable institution. 
How you live, what you do, and what you become will ultimately define this university.  May the
Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and diligence.</p>
<p>As our sons have left our home for college and on missions, Sister Bednar and I have shared with
them the following counsel:</p>
<p>	Â•	Remember that you represent the Savior.</p>
<p>	Â•	Remember that you represent your family.</p>
<p>	Â•	Remember that you represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>And as you now are leaving Brigham Young University-Idaho, may I add one more item to the
list?</p>
<p>	Â•	Remember that you represent Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>I declare my witness that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.  He lives.  He is real.  He knows
each of you.  And I testify and promise that He will guide, direct, protect, and strengthen each of
you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><center><strong>Brigham Young University-Idaho Faculty Meeting<br />
</strong></center>
<strong><center>August 27, 2002<br />
President David A. Bednar
</center></strong>
</p>
<p>It is a weighty matter when the president must fill a vacancy in the President's Council.  It is a
prayerful matter, and there is help from heaven as recommendations are made to the Brethren.  I
want to share one insight about Brother Checketts.  This particular episode was recorded by his
father:</p>
<p>	When my three oldest boys were six, five, and four years old, they were playing in
our basement.  I was working outside near the back door, so I heard what was
going on.  My wife hollered at them, "You boys come up here."  No answer.  She
hollered again, and a third time she hollered.  Still, no answer and no boys.  The
fourth time she said, "You boys get up here, or I am coming down there and I'm
going to spank you all good."  Here came the three boys on the run.  "Why didn't
you boys come sooner?" she asked.  "Oh, we didn't hear you the first three times,"
came the reply.</p>
<p>The four-year-old boy spoken of was Dr. Max L. Checketts.</p>
<p>Second, I want to express how much I appreciated being in the temple with so many of you
yesterday.  To sit on the stand, to look into your faces, to see you dressed in white, to know why
we were there, and to be able to talk about what we learn in the temple in relation to what we do
here at BYU-Idaho is a remarkable experience--one that we ought to have more often.  Thank
you for your worthiness and your preparation to be there yesterday.</p>
<p>I also express my gratitude for the questions you asked Elder Haight last Friday.  We should let
prophets be prophets.  And your questions the other day allowed a prophet to be a prophet.  I
hope we had eyes to see and ears to hear both what he said and how he said it.  Do you realize
that within another week or so he is going to begin his ninety-seventh year?  He stood at this
pulpit for 1 hour and 45 minutes.  What you would not know perhaps is that he has had his hip
replaced, he needs to have both of his knees replaced, and he did not attend April conference
because of difficulty he is having with his Achilles' heel.  Can you imagine him standing for an
hour and 45 minutes, teaching and responding to questions, and speaking at commencement that
morning, and teaching and instructing at the banquet that night?</p>
<p>One of the things you may not have detected is the interchange between Elder Haight and his
wife.  Elder Haight would be the first to tell you that he has some difficulty keeping track of
time.  He and his wife and his secretary have worked on a number of devices to help him
recognize when it is time for him to conclude his remarks.  Their latest attempt is that Sister
Haight begins to cough.  I do not know if any of you noticed this, but after Elder Haight had
talked for a while, Sister Haight leaned over and asked me, "President, are we about done?"  And
I said, "We are going to let him teach just as long as he wants."  So she kind of took control and
began coughing intermittently.  And he just kept right on speaking.  So she coughed a little
louder.  She is a very gracious lady, with an angelic quality to her voice.  And here she sat belting
out coughs essentially saying, "David, it is time to conclude . . . ."</p>
<p>We hosted Elder and Sister Haight in our home between commencement and the faculty meeting
and between the faculty meeting and the banquet.  As we were walking into our home following
the faculty meeting--Sister Haight's son Robert was walking with her--she said, "I am so tired
of coughing!"  And her son said, "Mom, is there something wrong?  Can we get you some
medicine?"  And she said, "No, I just cannot get your dad to stop talking!"  But part of what
invited his extended answers was the quality of your questions.  So thank you very much.</p>
<p>Two more things before I get to my message:  If you have any lingering uncertainty about what
this institution is and what it will become, then please read, reread, and read again Elder Eyring's
devotional message given one year ago.  I would simply suggest that his message should be read
by every employee on this campus at least once a month.  I suspect most of you have already
figured out that you should do that.  But if you have not, you will find inspiration and
impressions coming to you each time you read that declaration of what BYU-Idaho will become. 
We are in the process now of printing Elder Eyring's message in booklet form.  You will each
receive a copy of the booklet shortly, but for now it is available on the Web site.  I encourage you
to read it.</p>
<p>I also invite your ongoing attention to the current climate of critique in the world of higher
education.  There is a stunning article coming out this month focusing on the ineffectiveness of
business education in institutions of higher education.  It will create a significant debate and
discussion in higher education, and the debate will not be restricted to the business discipline. 
The nature of the critique is stinging.  And as we consider the foundational principles of this
institution, the ongoing critique and commentary about the effectiveness of higher education, and
then note where we are headed, it is simply confirmation that the hand of heaven is involved in
what is taking place here.</p>
<p>Please listen carefully to this critique of secular institutions by Russell Ackoff, the father of
operations management and one of the premiere scholars in the field of statistics:</p>
<p>	The purpose of a university, and I'm talking here about what it is, not what it
should be, is to provide faculty members with the quality of work life that they
want.  Teaching is the price they pay; and, like any price, they try to minimize it. 
You can't understand a university if you think it's about education.  It's about
providing the faculty with a chance to do what they want to do.  Unfortunately, I
think this definition helps you better understand the behavior you see in a
university than the traditional definition that focuses on education.</p>
<p>	For a while I collected evidence to support this thesis.  When I was at Wharton,
which is the business school at the University of Pennsylvania, I spent two years
as a faculty representative to the College of Engineering.  At the time, every
college at Penn had a representative on the senate of every other college.  So for
two years I sat in on engineering faculty meetings.  It was so . . . boring that after
the first couple of meetings I started keeping records on the topics discussed, and
in two years I found that the word <em>student</em> only came up once.  In fact, the
meetings had nothing to do with students; they had to do with benefits, academic
freedom, teaching loads, and schedules and so forth.  I guess that's what you
would expect if the purpose of the university was to provide a comfortable
environment for the faculty.  It was about the faculty; it was not about the
students, nor was it about education.</p>
<p>There is increasing sharpness, increasing frequency, and a decidedly pointed tone in these current
discussions about what universities are and what they really do.  So please consider who we are
and what we are doing in the midst of this climate of critique.  I would suggest that it is a very
faith-promoting experience to make such comparisons and contrasts.</p>
<p>Yesterday in one of the temple sessions, Brother Noel Zaugg talked about wanting to be able to
see into the hearts of his students.  That is the topic I want to talk about today.  In a few minutes a
booklet will be handed out that I hope will facilitate your understanding of my message.  I am not
going to try to entertain you.  In fact, given that you have been here for a while already this
morning and are probably getting tired, you may think the way I am going to present this material
is highly ineffective; but there is nothing in the style of presentation that really matters.  It is the
content and the substance of the message that I hope you will get.  To facilitate this process, you
will have a booklet.  The booklet includes all of the visuals I am going to use today.  It also has
places for you to jot down impressions and feelings as we work through the content.</p>
<p>I have previously visited with this group about the role BYU-Idaho will play in advancing the
scholarship of learning--primarily learning--and also of teaching.  We will make that progress
both on this campus and throughout the world.  I have also suggested in a fall 2001 issue of
<em>Perspective</em> that we at BYU-Idaho can and must use the language of the gospel to facilitate our
understanding of learning and teaching processes.  I have also indicated that we, at this
institution, will not accomplish what we are destined to accomplish if we rely exclusively upon
the conventional language used in secular literatures to describe and discuss the processes of
learning and teaching.  We must be conversant with both the language of the gospel and the
language of our respective disciplines.</p>
<p>Today I want to take full advantage of the academic freedom we enjoy at a church-affiliated
university and discuss the spiritual gift of discernment and its impact on the processes of learning
and teaching.  Over the past several years, I have participated in the process of interviewing and
hiring about 185 of you--in a faculty of approximately 400.  I have also talked with almost all of
the rest of you on some occasion about how you came to Ricks College or BYU-Idaho and why
you came here.  Many of those stories do not make rational or logical sense.  So I have pondered,
and I have asked myself, "Why this particular group of faculty at this particular time at this
particular place?"  I certainly do not claim to have a complete answer.  I do believe I have part of
the answer, and that is what I want to discuss today.</p>
<p>In October of 1997 Elder Neal A. Maxwell visited our campus to speak at a devotional.  As
Sister Bednar and I had an opportunity to talk with him, he made a statement that I recorded and
have thought about frequently.  Please look at the first slide.  I believe this is a statement you will
not find cited in the <em>Ensign</em> or any other source; this was simply an observation that Elder
Maxwell made as Sister Bednar and I were visiting with him.  He indicated, "The youth of this
generation have a greater capacity for obedience than any previous generation."  Elder Maxwell,
in part, based his observation on a quote from Elder George Q. Cannon, which is slide&nbsp;2 in your
booklet:</p>
<p>	God has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage and
determination to face the world and all the powers of the evil one, visible and
invisible, to proclaim the Gospel and maintain the truth and establish and build up
the Zion of our God fearless of all consequences.  He has sent these spirits in this
generation to lay the foundation of Zion nevermore to be overthrown and to raise
up a seed that will be righteous and that will honor God and honor Him supremely
[now please note this important line] and <strong><em>be obedient to him under all
circumstances</em></strong><em></em> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Clearly, Elder Cannon's statement was made in the early days of the Restoration.  It is not talking
exclusively about the youth of this particular day; it is talking about all of the faithful spirits in
this dispensation.  But to have this statement by Elder Cannon extended by Elder Maxwell to the
youth of this generation is noteworthy.  So those two statements are very important.  You have
heard me say on other occasions that I frankly grow weary of hearing speakers state that the
youth of today are so wonderful and that they have been reserved for this time--because what the
young people typically do not hear is the great responsibility that goes along with this birthright
blessing.  Yes, they have been preserved.  But why?  <strong>To be obedient in all circumstances.</strong></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, these teachings by prophets do not refer just to young students; they also
refer to us.  They apply to you and to me, and they apply to the young people.  So if we will
simply consider this collection of people--faculty, employees, and students--and this hallmark
characteristic in the latter days, then this institution truly is a set-apart and a sacred place of
gathering--a gathering place for people with great capacity to obey.  Young men and young
women with remarkable capacity to obey come here to become acquainted with or further their
experience with obedience--obedience that is heartfelt and willing, not just conforming and
complying.</p>
<p>I would suggest that the true Spirit of Ricks is about progressing to and through and beyond
letter-of-the-law obedience and moving toward the spirit of devoted discipleship and a private,
personal, and individual change of heart.  Such are the people with whom we are blessed to work
as colleagues and as students, and obedience is one of the essential elements of this place and of
the gathering that occurs here.</p>
<p>Then the question is:  Why do so many LDS scholars who love to teach come to this institution? 
I believe there are several reasons.  Primarily, I think the answer relates to the spiritual gift of
discernment.  I think people who love to teach, who have powerful testimonies of the
Restoration, and who have a propensity for and a proclivity toward the spiritual gift of
discernment are drawn to this place.  I am not suggesting that every person at BYU-Idaho
possesses this gift.  That is why I use the words <em>propensity</em> and <em>proclivity</em>.  But there is a pull;
there is a tug at the heart and the soul among a particular kind of LDS scholar that brings him or
her to this place.  Why else would these new faculty leave prestigious institutions of higher
education and the private sector?  They come, and they come eagerly.  I think the spiritual gift of
discernment is key.</p>
<p>There are three questions we will address today:  (1) What is the spiritual gift of discernment? 
(2) How does the spiritual gift of discernment operate?  and (3) How do each of us appropriately
seek for the gift of discernment?  There are two major objectives in my mind as we now work
through the booklet.  As teachers, each of us must learn about, come to understand, strive to
personally qualify for, and appropriately use the spiritual gift of discernment to assist and serve
students.  The hallmark of this institution is readily apparent when visitors come to our campus
and say, "I can't believe how student-focused the faculty are, the staff are, all of the employees
are."  Think of that scenario, given what we have heard about the climate of critique in the
secular world wherein students frequently are considered a "bother."  Here at BYU-Idaho, the
students are and always will be the focus of everything we do.</p>
<p>The second major objective is that we must do all within our power to help students to also
understand and appropriately seek after the gift of discernment so that they can become
discerning disciples.</p>
<p>We will now move through a number of statements by prophets and apostles.  The content of
these statements and the sequence we will follow are very powerful.  So the first question:  What
is the spiritual gift of discernment?  Slide number 8 begins with a statement from the
Encyclopedia of Mormonism:</p>
<p>	The gift of discernment consists of the spiritual quality or skill of being able to see
or understand, especially that which is hidden or obscure.  This ability is shared in
a general way by all of God's children, but "discerning of spirits" is one of the
gifts of the spirit that comes under certain circumstances, specially from God (1
Cor. 12:10; D&amp;C 46:23).</p>
<p>	The fuller gift of discerning in all spiritual matters--to know whether their
occurrence is of God or not--is given by the Lord to "such as God shall appoint
and ordain to watch over the Church" (D&amp;C 46:27).</p>
<p>	To possess this gift is to receive divinely revealed understanding of opposing
spirits--the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil.  Persons possessing such a
gift also correctly perceive the right course of action (D&amp;C 63:41).</p>
<p>	Not only can the power of discernment distinguish <strong><em>good from evil</em></strong> (Moroni&nbsp;7:12-18), the <strong><em>righteous from the wicked</em></strong><em></em> (D&amp;C 101:95), and <strong><em>false spirits from divine</em>
</strong>(D&amp;C 46:23) [I would emphasize the word <em>false</em>--not evil, but false], but its more
sensitive operation can also make known even <strong><em>the thoughts and intents of the
heart of other persons</em></strong><em></em> (Hebrews 4:12, D&amp;C 33:1, emphasis added).</p>
<p>I am going to move through a number of statements with little commentary, and then I will try to
tie several things together.  The next statement is from George Q. Cannon.  My appreciation for
Elder Cannon has grown remarkably this summer as I have spent a great amount of time studying
his teachings and his writings.  This quote is far too long for an oral presentation, so I provided it
for you in writing because it is so worthwhile.  I anticipate that you will want to go back and
study this statement frequently:</p>
<p>	One of the gifts of the Gospel which the Lord has promised to those who enter
into covenant with Him is the gift of discerning of spirits--a gift which is not
much thought of by many and probably seldom prayed for; [See, there is great
counsel for us.  We ought to think about it, and we ought to pray for it] yet, it is a
gift that is of exceeding value and one that should be enjoyed by every Latter-day
Saint.  <strong><em>No Latter-day Saint should be without this gift</em></strong><em>,</em> because there is such a
variety of spirits in the world which seek to deceive and lead astray.  In a
revelation to the Church upon the spirits which have gone abroad in the earth the
Lord says:  Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits which are
false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth deceiving the world (D&amp;C 50:2).</p>
<p>	The Lord warns the Saints and says:  "Beware lest ye are deceived" (D&amp;C&nbsp;46:8). 
And that they may not be deceived, He commands them to seek earnestly the best
gifts.  The Apostle John says:  Behold, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world
(John 4:1).</p>
<p>	This counsel of the beloved Apostle applies as much to us in these latter days as it
did to the Saints of his age.  All manner of spirits have gone forth to deceive, to
lead astray, and to obtain possession of the children of men; and many people
yield to them because they are invisible and cannot, perhaps, think that they can
be possessed by invisible influences.  Anger, backbiting, slander, falsehood, and
various passions are manifested by people under the influence of false and
deceptive spirits.  Now, the gift of discerning of spirits not only gives men and
women who have it the power to discern the spirit with which others may be
possessed or influenced, [Now, brothers and sisters, please note this line] but <strong><em>it
gives them the power to discern the spirit which influences themselves</em></strong>.  	They
are able to detect a false spirit and also to know when the Spirit of God reigns
within them.  In private life this gift is of great importance to the Latter-day
Saints.  Possessing and exercising this gift they will not allow any evil influence
to enter into their hearts or to prompt them in their thoughts, their words, or their
acts.  They will repel it; and if perchance such a spirit should get possession of
them, as soon as they witness its effects they will expel it or, in other words,
refuse to be led or prompted by it.</p>
<p>There is great importance in this teaching from Elder Cannon.  And we will link his teachings to
the teachings of other Brethren in just a moment.</p>
<p>	The gift of discerning of spirits, also, is one that is of great importance to the
Elders who are laboring in the ministry.  We have known Elders who become so
filled with zeal and so desirous to do good, or what they supposed to be good, that
they exposed themselves to the influence of the adversary.  They would be filled
with the species of what has been called "wildfire," and carried away by zeal, they
would go too far; they would say and do imprudent things and yet, being
prompted by the purest and best motives, would feel entirely justified in their
course.  In the history of the Church there have been many illustrations of this. 
Elders can work themselves up beyond that which is proper and wise and be led to
say and do many imprudent things and overstep the line of propriety.  Now, the
gift of discerning of spirits is necessary to keep these kinds of feelings in check. 
The gift of discerning spirits is not only necessary for this purpose, but it is
necessary in the branches of the Church.  Newly baptized members, anxious to
obtain the gifts, are liable sometimes to be taken advantage of by the adversary
and to imbibe or yield to a wrong spirit.  A newly organized branch of the Church,
where the gifts are manifested, especially the gift of tongues, has to be watched
with great care.  The Elders laboring in the branch or presiding in the conference
must be in a position to discern between the Spirit of the Lord and other spirits
that may seek to steal in . . . .  In all the situations in life, therefore, in which
Latter-day Saints can be placed there is great need for them to possess the gift of
discerning of spirits.  Fathers and mothers need it for their own benefit.  They
need it in their families, in the training of their children.  All Saints need it to
enable them to escape from the many evil influences that are abroad.  The Elders
need it for their own sakes; they need it also in the government of the branches, of
the conferences, of the wards, of the stakes and, indeed, the entire Church.  <strong><em>It is a
great and blessed gift, and it should be sought for by all</em></strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>The next quote, which comes from President Stephen L. Richards, adds an additional dimension. 
He gave an address in 1950 in general conference about the spiritual gifts available to the Saints,
and he spoke in detail about the gift of discernment.  I believe this statement helps us understand
why a particular kind of LDS scholar is drawn to Rexburg and BYU-Idaho:</p>
<p>	First, I mentioned the gift of discernment embodying the power to discriminate,
which has been spoken of in our hearing before particularly as between right and
wrong.  I believe that this gift when highly developed arises largely out of an acute
sensitivity to impressions--spiritual impressions, if you will--<strong><em>to read under the
surface as it were, to detect hidden evil, and more importantly </em></strong><em></em>[and this is the
key phrase]<strong><em> to find the good that may be concealed.  <u>The highest type of
discernment is that which perceives in others and uncovers for them their better
natures, the good inherent within them</u></em></strong><strong></strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>What is the capacity of these young people and the capacity that we have?  A greater capacity for
obedience.  Why would a distinctive type of LDS scholar with a propensity for and a proclivity
toward the spiritual gift of discernment be brought here?  To assist young people in finding the
best within themselves.  Think of the legendary stories about this institution and the Spirit of
Ricks.  We all know the stories about Lyle Lowder.  Brother Lowder taught biology, and one of
his students was struggling and had decided to drop his class.  Lyle Lowder visited with this
student and simply said, "You're not dropping the class.  You sit here, and you do your
homework.  I'll help you do it.  But you are not dropping out of this class."  And that young
student persevered and completed the class and today is in the twilight years of a respected career
as a medical doctor.  I think people with a proclivity toward and a spiritual sensitivity for this gift
are brought here by the Lord to work with a generation of young people who have a remarkable
capacity for obedience--to help them become devoted and discerning disciples.</p>
<p>If we take the elements taught by Elder Cannon and by President Richards, the gift of
discernment operates basically in four major ways.  First, it helps us <strong>detect hidden error and
evil in others</strong> as we "see beneath the surface."  Second, and perhaps more importantly, it helps
us <strong>detect hidden errors and evil in ourselves.  </strong>It is not just discerning these things in others,
but as Elder Cannon taught, it is discerning error and evil within ourselves.  Thirdly, it helps us
<strong>find the good that may be concealed in others</strong>.  And fourthly and interestingly, it helps us <strong>find
the good that may be concealed in us</strong>.</p>
<p>The next question:  How does the spiritual gift of discernment operate?  We will move rather
quickly now.  First, from the teachings of President Benson--this should be slide 28:</p>
<p>	One reason we are on this earth is to discern between truth and error.  This
<strong><em>discernment comes by the Holy Ghost</em></strong>, not just our intellectual faculties
(emphasis added).</p>
<p>From David O. McKay:</p>
<p>	From birth to death men differ.  They vary as much as do flowers in a garden.  In
intellect, in temperament, in energy, and in training some rise to one level and
some to another.  The successful teacher is one who, with a spirit of discernment,
can detect to a degree at least, the mentality and capability of the members of his
class.  <strong>He should be able to read the facial expressions and be responsive to
the mental and spiritual attitudes of those whom he is teaching.</strong>  The great
teacher had this power of discernment in perfection as is well illustrated in his
conversation with the woman of Samaria whose interests he not only interpreted,
but whose soul he also read by virtue of her past deeds.  Too few teachers have
this gift, even to a limited degree, but every teacher has the responsibility of
determining how best to approach the members of the class in order to make
appeals that will be lasting (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Again, from President Stephen L. Richards:</p>
<p>	The gift of discernment is essential to the leadership of the Church.  I never ordain
a bishop or set apart a president of a stake without invoking upon him this divine
blessing, that he may <strong><em>read the lives and hearts of his people and call forth the
best within them</em></strong>.  [I emphasize that phrase:  And call forth the best within them.] 
The gift and power of discernment in this world of contention between the forces
of good and the power of evil is essential equipment for every son and daughter of
God.  There could be no such mass dissensions as endanger the security of the
world, if its populations possessed this great gift in larger degree (emphasis
added).</p>
<p>The next question:  How do we appropriately seek after the spiritual gift of discernment?  This is
from an earlier address by President Richards:</p>
<p>	The power of the Priesthood is a spiritual power.  We know that there is efficacy
in it.  We have seen its power manifest.  We know, too, that <strong><em>these spiritual
powers are not developed except through goodness and righteousness</em></strong>.  We need
today the great gift of discernment to be able to proceed with an intelligence and a
wisdom that transcends our finite powers in the courses which we are to pursue
(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Again, from the teachings of President Benson:</p>
<p>	Brethren--especially you priesthood leaders--would you counsel those under
your watch-care to be prayerful and watchful, lest these deceptions take root in
our midst.  Counsel them to seek the gift of discernment <strong><em>which comes by prayer
and living the commandments of God</em></strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>From Elder Cannon:</p>
<p>	There is a gift in the Church of God which if obtained enables us to escape
deception, and detect all kinds of spirits and evil.  It is the gift of discernment of
spirits.  The Lord has promised unto us this gift, so that we shall be able through
that gift to discern the spirits of men and women who may be brought in contact
with us, so as not to be deceived by them.  Some persons have this gift.  It is
natural to them while others seem to be utterly destitute of it and, therefore, easily
deceived because they have not discernment.  [I think one of the distinctive
qualities of this community of Saints is a collection of people who have been
blessed with a propensity for this gift.]  <strong><em>Now we ask God for this gift and have it
bestowed upon us.  If we seek for it in faith it will be given us</em></strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>A last quote from President Richards:</p>
<p>	There is a class of people now grown sizeable in the world who should possess
this great gift in large degree.  They know how the gift is attained.  They have
been educated in its spiritual foundations.  They have been blessed with the
counsels which foster it.  They know how to order their lives to procure it.  You
know who they are, my brethren and sisters.  <strong><em>Every member in the restored
Church of Christ could have this gift if he willed to do so</em></strong><em></em>.  He could not be
deceived with the sophistries of the world.  He could not be led astray by pseudo
prophets and subversive cults.  Even the inexperienced would recognize false
teachings, in a measure at least.  With this gift, they would be able to detect
something of the disloyal, rebellious, and sinister influences which not
infrequently prompt those who seemingly take pride in the destruction of youthful
faith and loyalties.  Discerning parents will do well to guard their children against
such influences and against such personalities and teachings before irreparable
damage is done.  The true gift of discernment is often premonitory.  A sense of
danger should be heeded to be of value.  We give thanks for a set of providential
circumstances which avert an accident.  We ought to be grateful every day of our
lives for the sense which keeps alive a conscience which constantly alerts us to the
dangers inherent in wrongdoers and sin (emphasis added).</p>
<p>There is great spiritual substance in the teachings I have shared this morning.  Let me review and
conclude.  Young people with a remarkable capacity to obey come to this institution.  Employees
come here with that same remarkable capacity to obey and a propensity for the spiritual gift of
discernment, which in its highest and noblest manifestation is detecting and helping to develop
the good within a person that he or she may not see within himself or herself.  That is, in large
measure, the Spirit of Ricks.  I would summarize it this way.  <strong><em>Brigham Young University-Idaho
is a set-apart and sacred place of gathering wherein the spiritual gift of discernment operates
powerfully to assist young men and young women with a remarkable capacity to obey to
become devoted and discerning disciples.</em></strong></p>
<p>There are important implications in these teachings for each of us--the most powerful of which
will not be spoken by me.  They will be taught to us individually by the Holy Ghost in relation to
our stewardships as men and women, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, teachers, in
whatever capacity we may serve.  Let me just suggest a few brief ones.</p>
<p><em>Number 1:</em>  We talk much about the need to ratchet up as we become a university.  And that is
true--intellectually, socially, and in other ways.  Most importantly, we need to ratchet up
spiritually.  So I extend the call to all of us to improve our personal worthiness.  I am not
suggesting that we are bad.  I am suggesting that we must become better.</p>
<p><em>Number 2:</em>  We should have an increasing desire for the spiritual gift of discernment.</p>
<p><em>Number 3:</em>  We should appropriately seek after this gift.  As Elder Cannon said, "It's not much
thought of and perhaps not often prayed for."  Every employee on this campus should be praying
earnestly for--not routinely, not mechanically--earnestly learning about and seeking to qualify
for this spiritual gift.</p>
<p><em>Number 4:</em>  We need to cultivate an element of personal discerning so that we can better serve
others.</p>
<p>A part of the meaning of the word consecration is "developed and devoted to a holy purpose." 
Brothers and sisters, we can and should seek the spiritual gift of discernment to detect those
things within ourselves that must be improved so we can be more fully developed and devoted to
a holy purpose--assisting and serving these young people who come here with a remarkable
capacity for obedience.  The world and the adversary work ever harder to distract these young
people.  We must work ever harder and be more worthy and more earnest so that we will have
this gift to help detect good and help it to be developed.</p>
<p>I hope the Holy Ghost has kept you awake.  There is nothing in my presentation that has been
entertaining.  I do, however, feel very strongly about the importance of the timing of this content
for us as we continue the transition to become Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>I conclude by simply expressing my love for each of you, my appreciation, and my admiration. 
And I extend the invitation to all of us to prayerfully consider these teachings about the spiritual
gift of discernment, to apply them, and to thereby more effectively bless the lives of these
precious young people.</p>
<p>I  declare my witness that I know God lives.  I know Jesus is the Christ.  I know there are living
apostles and prophets.  I know the Savior in this latter day directs the affairs of this living Church
through true messengers.  I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">I'd like to extend a sincere welcome to all of you who are here today.  Thank you for coming. 
Each time I stand at this podium, I'm touched with an increased sense of love for you.  I also
have a greater awareness of your challenges as well as the joys you experience.
</p>
<p>My message today isn't flashy or new, so I ask you to pray for me as I invite the Spirit to be here
with us during the few moments we will share together.</p>
<p>As many of you know, my husband and I have three sons.  We've spent scores of Friday nights
sitting on bleachers with other parents watching our sons play high school football.  Perhaps this
will explain why many years ago a newspaper article in our local paper captured my attention.  I
saved the article, not because it was so amusing to me at the time, but because it sparked a
serious and important question in my mind.  Let me share this piece "From Off the Wall" with
you.  It's entitled "Army paratroopers miss game" and was written by <em>The Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p>Kennewick, Washington.  It was a stunning entrance--to the wrong event.</p>
<p>Three Army paratroopers who planned on delivering the game ball for a high school football
game Friday night landed on another high school field five miles away.</p>
<p>Fans and players from River View and Granger high schools didn't know what to think as
helicopters hovered and parachutists descended during warm-ups.</p>
<p>"Nobody knew what was going on.  Someone even asked me if they were terrorists," said John
Doran, River View's assistant principal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players from Kennewick and Pasco high schools stood in the end zones and fans
scanned the sky for parachutists who were to land in the giant "X" that had been painted in the
middle of the field.</p>
<p>"We kept looking in the sky and they never came down, and this is after they had us listen to one
of those Army commercials," said spectator Bob Woehler.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ed Traylor blamed the mistake on "a new pilot that lost track of his marker."</p>
<p>Let me pose the question that came to my mind when I first read this article.  How did this pilot
lose track of his marker when the point was clearly marked and well defined?  This was a simple,
uncomplicated mission.  All the pilot and his comrades had to do were a few routine checks and
then look for the X!</p>
<p>The Old Testament describes an incident where the children of Israel refused to look at their
marker.  As you may recall, dissatisfied Israelites constantly murmured and spoke out against the
Lord and Moses for leading them out of Egypt.  Fiery serpents were then sent by the Lord to
destroy the complainers.  Recognizing their sin, the people begged Moses to save them by taking
away the poisonous serpents.  In answer to Moses' prayer, the Lord instructed Moses to fashion a
fiery serpent from brass and attach it to a pole.  Those who desired to be healed from the deadly
bites were told to look at the brazen serpent which represented Christ and his ability to heal,
redeem, and bestow the gift of eternal life.  The request to "look" was simple, yet many perished
because of the hardness of their hearts and the simpleness and easiness of the way (see Numbers
21:6-9, Alma 33:19-22, 1 Nephi 17:41).  Those who refused to look certainly made a stunning
entrance to the wrong event!</p>
<p> Do we sometimes harden our hearts and underestimate the value of incorporating simple gospel
principles in our lives because we feel they won't assist or heal us?  Please allow me to share
with you an incident from my life where I refused for a time to look.</p>
<p> When I was not much older than many of you, my husband was enrolled in a demanding
doctoral program at Purdue University far away from our families and familiar surroundings.  We
had two small children, very little money, limited time to spend together as a family, and we
were having difficulty balancing the rigors of graduate school, family responsibilities, and church
assignments.  Does this situation sound familiar?  Well, this daunting task began to take its toll,
and I found myself feeling very overwhelmed with my responsibilities as a wife and a "stay-at-home mother."  The feelings I felt were not necessarily unique to me or my circumstances. 
Many of you may experience some of these same challenges and emotions while you are here at
BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho.</p>
<p>After considerable contemplation, I remember asking my husband for a priesthood blessing.  In
this blessing I was promised that I could begin to better cope with my difficulties if I would
exercise consistently, get more sleep, eat properly, have meaningful prayer night and morning,
and engage in daily scripture study.  The reason I remember so vividly the instruction I received
is because I thought afterwards: "This is going to solve my problems?  These are standard
'Sunday School' answers.  Besides, I'm already doing some of these things."  Does this attitude
sound a bit hard-hearted?  Maybe if the message had been to take a vacation to the beach, or sign
up for an art class, or have my nails done, I would have been more receptive to the counsel.  I
guess I was searching for different solutions, and I balked at the banality of what I had been
counseled to do.</p>
<p>I pondered the blessing, and over a period of time I came to know and understand that these
inspired admonitions were plain and simple, yet profound.  As I moved from casual observance
to a more steadfast and heartfelt implementation of these principles in my life, I discovered a
sense of emotional peace, a feeling of physical well-being, and a spiritual confidence that brought
tremendous blessings to my life.  Like those in Moses' day, all I had to do was to "look!"</p>
<p>I invite you to ponder how you can make these gospel principles a part of your daily life.  Instead
of thinking of all the reasons why you can't exercise regularly, go to bed at a reasonable hour, eat
a balanced diet, pray morning and night, or study your scriptures daily, please consider the
emotional, physical, and spiritual blessings that will come if you do apply these teachings with
full purpose of heart and real intent.  Don't be blinded by the seeming simplicity or easiness of
the way.  You, too, can be assisted in your challenges and have the strength to accept the
vicissitudes of life with assurance.  All you have to do is "look!"</p>
<p><em>". . . be not weary in well-doing,"</em> the Lord told the elders of the Church, <em>"for ye are laying the
foundation of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that which is great"</em>
(D&amp;C&nbsp;64:33).  May we all look to Him who</p>
<p>		. . . marked the path and led the way,<br />
		And ev'ry point defines<br />
		To light and life and endless day<br />
		Where God's full presence shines.<br />
		(<em>How Great the Wisdom and the Love</em>, <u>Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints</u>, p. 195)</p>
<p>Our Savior and his simple teachings are the mark to which we must "look" if we want to make it
to the right event, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters, and welcome to a new semester at Brigham Young
University<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho.  Sister Bednar and I are delighted that you are here at the university, and we
appreciate worshipping with you today in this devotional assembly. </p>
<p>I want to begin my message this afternoon with a brief test and a self-evaluation.  Please listen to
the following episode presented in a general conference address in 1966 by President N. Eldon
Tanner, a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church.</p>
<p><i>A young man came to me not long ago and said, "I made an agreement with a man that requires
me to make certain payments each year.  I am in arrears, and I can't make those payments, for if I
do, it is going to cause me to lose my home.  What shall I do?"</i></p>
<p><i>I looked at him and said, "Keep your agreement."</i></p>
<p><i>"Even if it costs me my home?"</i> </p>
<p> <i>	I said, "I am not talking about your home.  I am talking about your agreement; and
I think your wife would rather have a husband who would keep his word, meet his
obligations, keep his pledges or his covenants, and have to rent a home than to
have a home with a husband who will not keep his covenants and his pledges"</i>
(<u>Conference Report</u>, Oct.&nbsp;1966, 99-100; or <u>Improvement Era</u>, Dec. 1966, 1137).</p>
<p>Now for the self-evaluation and the test.  Carefully and thoughtfully and honestly and silently
answer the following questions.  Did President Tanner's counsel seem old-fashioned, outdated,
and unreasonable to you, or did it seem appropriate?  Was losing the home more important to
you than keeping the agreement, or was keeping the agreement more important to you than
keeping the home?   Is the counsel President Tanner gave in 1966 equally applicable in 2002, or
are our modern conditions and circumstances so different that his counsel is no longer relevant?</p>
<p>Let me suggest that our answers to these questions indicate our susceptibility to two pervasive
latter-day sicknesses: (1) the rapidly spreading disease of dishonesty and (2) the contemporary
epidemic of ethical failures.  Brothers and sisters, we live in a world and at a time when a
pharmacist has admitted to intentionally diluting doses of medication given to cancer patients in
order to make more money; when political "spin" frequently is prized above the truth and
accurate information; when executives and accountants in large corporations such as Enron,
WorldCom, Global Crossing, and Xerox "cook the books" and misrepresent the financial
condition of their firms; and when students across this country increasingly think cheating on
tests and assignments "is no big deal."  As President James E. Faust has warned:</p>
<p> <i>	. . . we all should be concerned about the society in which we live, a society which
is like a moral Armageddon.  I am concerned about its effects upon us . . . </i>
("Honesty--A Moral Compass," <u>Ensign</u>, November 1996, p. 41).</p>
<p>Consider, brothers and sisters, that if you or I found President Tanner's instruction about keeping
an agreement to be impractical, obsolete, or out of step with our current thinking, then I submit
the corrosive and eroding and debilitating impact of these two latter-day diseases on our
characters and on our souls is well under way.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><u>Integrity and Honesty Defined</u></strong></p>
<p align="left">The words "integrity" and "honesty" are closely associated and often used interchangeably.  In
fact, in my message this afternoon I will frequently refer to both integrity and honesty.  We must
remember, however, that these terms are related but are not synonymous.</p>
<p>Integrity is the quality or condition of being <strong><em>whole</em></strong>, <strong><em>complete</em></strong>, <strong><em>unbroken,</em></strong> and <strong><em>undivided</em></strong>.  The
word integrity comes from the Latin root word "integer" and is related to other words with the
same root such as <strong><em>entire</em></strong> and <strong><em>integrate.  </em></strong>All of these expressions share the notion of being <strong><em>intact</em></strong>,
<strong><em>sound, uncorrupted, </em></strong>and <strong><em>perfect</em></strong>.  As Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin has explained:</p>
<p> <i>	. . . integrity means always doing what is right and good, regardless of the
immediate consequences.  It means being righteous from the very depth of our
soul, not only in our actions but, more important, in our thoughts and in our
hearts.  Personal integrity implies such trustworthiness and incorruptibility that we
are incapable of being false to a trust or covenant</i> ("Personal Integrity," <u>Ensign</u>,
May 1990, p. 30).</p>
<p>Honesty is the quality or condition of being <strong><em>truthful</em></strong>, <strong><em>sincere</em></strong>, <strong><em>candid</em></strong>, and worthy of <strong><em>honor</em></strong>.  The
word honesty comes from the Latin root word "honestus" and is related to other words with the
same root such as <strong><em>honor</em></strong> and <strong><em>honorable</em></strong>.  Each of these expressions shares the notion of being
<strong><em>genuine</em></strong>, <strong><em>trustworthy</em></strong>, <strong><em>upright</em></strong>, <strong><em>respectable</em></strong>, and <strong><em>decent</em></strong>.  As President James E. Faust has taught:</p>
<p> <i>	We all need to know what it means to be honest.  Honesty is more than not lying. 
It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving</i> ("Honesty--A Moral
Compass," <u>Ensign</u>, November 1996, p. 41).</p>
<p>You and I must strive to become men and women of integrity and to be honest with God, honest
with ourselves, and honest with other people.  Integrity and honesty with God result from
knowing and understanding <u>who He is</u> and our relationship to and kinship with Him as our
Eternal Father.  Integrity and honesty with ourselves result from knowing and understanding <u>who
we are</u> as sons and daughters of God.  And integrity and honesty with other people result from
knowing and understanding <u>who they are</u> both as sons and daughters of the Eternal Father and as
our brothers and sisters.  All unprincipled and dishonest thoughts and actions are a betrayal of
God, a betrayal of self, and a betrayal of other people.</p>
<p>Becoming men and women of integrity and honesty does not occur quickly or all at once, nor is it
merely a matter of greater personal discipline.  It is a change of disposition, a change of heart. 
And this gradual change of heart is one that the Lord accomplishes within us, through the power
of His Spirit, in a line-upon-line fashion.  For example, in Philippians 2:12, Paul encourages the
Saints to ". . . <em>work out your own salvation with fear and trembling</em>."  But how are we to do that? 
Note the answer that follows in verse thirteen:  "<em>For it is God which worketh in you both to will
and to do of his good pleasure</em>."  That is, we give ourselves to the Lord and choose to be
changed.  He is working on us and in us.  Brothers and sisters, it is vitally important for all of us
to remember that becoming men and women of integrity and honesty is not simply a matter of
more personal determination, more grit, and more willpower; rather, it is accomplished through
the enabling power of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Closely associated with becoming men and women of integrity and honesty is reaching a point
where we no longer are driven or directed by <u>rules</u>; instead, we learn to govern our lives by
<u>principle</u>.  To be sure, we keep the rules; but we also begin to ask ourselves, "What is the
principle involved here?"  Such a person becomes less dependent upon external scaffolding and
structure and more dependent upon quiet and ongoing divine direction.  As the Prophet Joseph
Smith explained, "<em>I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves</em>" (<u>Teachings of
Joseph Smith</u>, eds. Larry E. Dahl and Donald Q. Cannon, Bookcraft, 1997, p. 32).</p>
<p>We learn from the teachings of Elder Bruce R. McConkie that:</p>
<p> <i>	Ethical principles are born of doctrinal concepts.  To say "We believe in being
honest" is to testify that because we believe in Christ and his saving truths, we
automatically accept honesty as a divine standard to which every true believer
must conform.  And so it is with all true principles; they inhere in, are part of, and
grow out of the saving truths. . . .</i></p>
<p> <i>	In teaching the gospel, it is far less effective to say "Be honest, for honesty is the
best policy," and then to reason from a social standpoint why this is so, than to
link honesty with the gospel out of which it grows by teaching: "Wo unto the liar,
for he shall be thrust down to hell" (2&nbsp;Nephi 9:34).  It is only when gospel ethics
are tied to gospel doctrines that they rest on a sure and enduring foundation and
gain full operation in the lives of the saints </i> (Bruce R. McConkie, <u>A New Witness
for the Articles of Faith</u>, Salt Lake City, Deseret Book, 1985, pp. 699-700).</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><u>Examples of Integrity and Honesty</u></strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the story of Job is the most well-known scriptural example of integrity and honesty.  Job
was a faithful and prosperous man.  Over a period of time, however, he lost his wealth, his
health, his friends and his standing in the community, and his family.  Job's integrity and honesty
with God, with himself, and with other people clearly were put to the ultimate test.  His reaction,
for example, to the loss of all the bases of his worldly wealth--oxen, servants, sheep, camels, and
even his posterity--all lost in just one day--tells us much about Job's heart and his faith in God. 
His devoted response is found in Job 1:21-22.</p>
<p> <i>	. . . Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</i></p>
<p> <i>	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</i> </p>
<p>Job's reaction to his physical challenges, including painful and disfiguring boils, is likewise
impressive.  In Job 2:9-10 we read:</p>
<p> <i>	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and
die.</i></p>
<p> <i>	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.  What? 
shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?  In all this
did not Job sin with his lips.</i></p>
<p>Wealth gone.  Health gone.  Offspring gone.  Now note Job's reply in chapter 27, verses three
through six, to the loss of friends and family and to the suffering he endured during an extended
period of isolation and loneliness and persecution. </p>
<p> <i>	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</i></p>
<p> <i>	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</i></p>
<p> <i>	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me
so long as I live</i> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the story of Job is for all of us an enduring example of integrity and honesty
with God, of integrity and honesty with himself, and of integrity and honesty with other people.</p>
<p>Albert Frehner and Matilda Reber were married on April 20, 1888, in the St. George Temple. 
Albert and Matilda then established their humble home in Littlefield, Arizona.  To provide for
his family, Brother Frehner hauled freight between El Dorado Canyon and Bonelli's Ferry.  Sister
Frehner nurtured their growing family and took care of the household chores which included
cleaning, making soap, canning and drying vegetables and fruit, and knitting socks, sweaters, and
sewing all other needed clothing.  For these stalwart Saints it was a hard and happy life together
in an arid and desolate place.</p>
<p>Albert and Matilda had been married for ten years when Brother Frehner was called in 1898 by
President Lorenzo Snow to serve as a missionary in Switzerland, his native land.  At the time
Albert received the call to serve, Matilda was expecting their fifth child.  However, it never
entered their hearts or minds to refuse the call.  Both gladly accepted the challenge.  Matilda
assumed the total responsibility for the care of her young family, for their cotton farm, for
running the post office out of a small room in her home.  She also boarded the "school teacher." 
Five months after Albert left on his mission, Matilda gave birth to twin girls, Edith and Ethel.</p>
<p>I have provided this background information about Matilda and her circumstances as a context
for the following incident.  One day Sister Frehner was attending to her duties in the post office. 
A man, as he was ready to depart after completing his postal business, gave Matilda 25&nbsp;cents to
send to Albert in the mission field.  Now I know 25&nbsp;cents does not sound like much to you and to
me today, but to Matilda it meant a great deal!  Sister Frehner thanked the good brother, and then
asked him if she could use 2&nbsp;cents of the money to buy a stamp.  Matilda explained that she had
written a letter to Albert a week or two earlier but did not have the 2&nbsp;cents to purchase the
necessary postage.  The man readily agreed to her proposal, the stamp was procured, and the
letter was mailed. </p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please consider that Matilda was the manager of the post office.  She easily
could have borrowed and used a stamp--fully intending to repay the 2&nbsp;cents when she was in a
position to do so.  And no one would have known.  In her dire financial situation, it certainly
would have seemed reasonable to go ahead and mail her letter at the time she wrote it.  <strong>But
Matilda would have known</strong>.  And Sister Frehner was a woman of integrity and honesty.  She
simply refused to use, in any way, something for which she could not pay.  She also was careful
to seek the man's permission to use a portion of the money for a purpose other than that which he
had intended.  The integrity and honesty of Matilda, my great-grandmother, have had a profound
and lasting impact upon my life.  Sister Frehner is an example of integrity and honesty with God,
of integrity and honesty with herself, and of integrity and honesty with other people.</p>
<p>Cheating in academic work is unprincipled, dishonest, and a form of self-deception and betrayal. 
No university student can hope to ultimately succeed in a career or profession if he or she builds
upon a foundation of fraud.  Please listen carefully to the following story told by President James
E. Faust in a session of general conference in 1996.</p>
<p> <i>	A friend related this experience her husband had while attending medical school.</i></p>
<p> <i>	"Getting into medical school is pretty competitive, and the desire to do well and
be successful puts a great deal of pressure on the new incoming freshmen.  My
husband had worked hard on his studies and went to attend his first examination. 
The honor system was expected behavior at the medical school.  The professor
passed out the examination and left the room.  Within a short time, students
started to pull little cheat papers out from under their papers or from their pockets. 
My husband recalled his heart beginning to pound as he realized it is pretty hard
to compete against cheaters.  About that time a tall, lanky student stood up in the
back of the room and stated, 'I left my hometown and put my wife and three little
babies in an upstairs apartment and worked very hard to get into medical school. 
And I'll turn in the first one of you who cheats, and you better believe it!'  They
believed it.  There were many sheepish expressions, and those cheat papers started
to disappear as fast as they had appeared.  He set a standard for the class which
eventually graduated the largest group in the school's history"</i> ("Honesty--A
Moral Compass," <u>Ensign</u>, Nov. 1996, 42).</p>
<p>The young, lanky medical student who challenged the cheaters was J. Ballard Washburn, who
became a respected physician and in later years received special recognition from the Utah
Medical Association for his outstanding service as a medical doctor.  He also served as a General
Authority and as the president of the Las Vegas Nevada Temple.  Elder Washburn provides all of
us with a powerful example of integrity and honesty with God, of integrity and honesty with
himself, and of integrity and honesty with other people.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong><u>The Importance of Integrity and Honesty in Your Experience at BYU-Idaho</u></strong></p>
<p>The thirteenth article of faith begins, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent,
virtuous, and in doing good to all men . . . ."  Brothers and sisters, it is significant to me that the
first trait listed in this inspired summary of cardinal Christian virtues is honesty.  Indeed, the very
fountain and the foundation of our daily discipleship are integrity and honesty. </p>
<p>Brigham Young University<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho exists and is supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints in order to provide high quality secular learning in an environment that fosters
faith in the living God.  On this campus we strive to become both faithful and competent, to
become devoted disciples as well as skilled scholars.  In our work at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho as students,
scholars, and employees, we must follow the pattern outlined in the thirteenth article of faith; we
first and foremost must have integrity and be honest.  We must become men and women of
integrity and honesty with God, of integrity and honesty with ourselves, and of integrity and
honesty with other people.</p>
<p>I believe the definitive test of our integrity and honesty is when we personally enforce in our own
lives that which ultimately cannot be enforced.  There are so many aspects of being honest, of
obeying the honor and dress codes at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho, and of living the gospel that simply cannot be
enforced in our lives by anyone else.  In the final analysis, you and I bear the responsibility to
become men and women of integrity and honesty--men and women who are true and trustworthy
when no one is watching and when no one else is around.  Do we, for example, only drive the
speed limit when we know or expect that a police officer is watching?  And what videos do we
watch and what Internet sites do we visit when we are alone?  Our parents certainly can help in
this process, but they cannot do it for us.  Our friends likewise can help, but they cannot do it for
us.  Our church leaders teach and encourage and inspire, but they cannot do it for us. 
Individually, each of us must become a person of integrity and honesty ". . . through the merits,
and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah . . ." (2 Nephi 2:8).  Indeed, all things are possible
(Mark 9:23) with the help of the Savior and through the enabling and strengthening power of His
infinite atonement.</p>
<p>Let me now be just as direct and clear as I know how to be.  If you leave this university with
knowledge and skills and a degree but lacking integrity and honesty, then you have failed.  And
the sacred tithing funds from all over the earth that make it possible for you and all students to
study here will have been wasted.  Conversely, if during your time at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho you make
meaningful progress toward becoming a person of integrity and honesty, and having done your
very best academically you are considered only an average student, then you will have
nonetheless succeeded magnificently.  And you will be well protected against the effects of the
latter-day disease of dishonesty and the epidemic of ethical failures.</p>
<p>In a world that grows increasingly dark because of distrust, cynicism, and unethical behavior,
employees and graduates of Brigham Young University<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho must radiate the light of integrity
and honesty.  This university, one of the Lord's universities, will ultimately be recognized as an
institution where integrity and honesty are as common and consistent as a windy afternoon in
Rexburg.  Can we see the influence of this campus in the world as students with ability and
integrity assume roles in families, in the Church, in business, in government, in education, and in
other spheres of activity?  Can we recognize that the world will come to this campus to find
young people who can create opportunities and solve problems and discover and innovate--and
who will do so from a strong foundation of integrity and honesty?  In an increasingly wicked
world, the image of Christ in the countenances of graduates from BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho will radiate a light
that will literally "chase darkness from among you" (Doctrine and Covenants 50:25).  Can you
students see that dishonest acts while you are a student at Brigham Young University<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho--in
your academic work, in your social activities, and, most importantly, in honoring and keeping
your commitments and covenants--will diminish your personal light and impede the primary
purpose for which this institution was created? </p>
<p>Men and women of integrity and honesty not only practice what they preach, they are what they
preach.  And the Savior stands as the preeminent example.  He said, "I am the way, the truth, and
the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).  It is not just that the Son of
God brought light into a darkened and fallen world; He <u>is</u> the Light (3 Nephi 11:11).  It is not just
that our Savior showed us the way; He <u>is</u> the Way (John 14:6).  It is not just that Christ made the
resurrection available; He <u>is</u> the Resurrection (John 11:25).  And it is not just that Jesus of
Nazareth restored the truth and taught the truth; He <u>is</u> the Truth (John 14:6).</p>
<p>I now conclude with two additional examples of integrity and honesty involving students at
BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho.  I believe the simplicity and seemingly ordinary nature of these events make them
truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>The first episode was described in a letter I received from a local business owner.</p>
<p>	A girl living in one of the dorms stopped in, shopping for a tie to send to her
boyfriend who is serving a mission.  She took a close look at the ties and found a
great looking one.  We stepped over to the checkout counter, and I rang up the
sale.  She paid with a check and left.  I went about my work, and about an hour
later I looked up and saw the same girl walking into the store.  She had an
interesting smile on her face as she walked up to me.  She handed me a check and
explained that I had accidentally put the check she had written back into the sack
along with the cash register receipt and the tie.  I really did slip up on this one! 
We laughed, and I thanked her and told her that I really did admire her honesty.</p>
<p>The young woman in this story clearly exhibited integrity and honesty with other people.  She
obviously is also increasing in integrity and honesty with God and with herself.</p>
<p>The second example comes from a letter I received from a student.</p>
<p>	My whole life I have believed very strongly in the Church, but being here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho has strengthened my testimony immensely.  I had an experience a couple of
weeks ago that helped me realize just how much of a privilege it is to be here.</p>
<p>	I recently attended an outdoor dance.  Just before the dance was to begin, my
friends and I were sitting on the grounds eating pizza.  I took my wallet out of my
pocket to show my friends some pictures, and then I forgot to put my wallet back
as we got up and left for the dance.</p>
<p>	Later that evening I realized what had happened, and I asked my RA if I could go
out to look for the wallet.  He gave me permission, and I proceeded toward what I
thought should be the location of my wallet.  I quickly realized that my wallet was
no longer there.  I knelt down right there in the grass and began to pray to my
Father in Heaven to help me find my wallet. </p>
<p>	I then returned to my dorm room with a very optimistic attitude.  I walked into my
room fully expecting the wallet to be sitting right there, but it wasn't.  So I
proceeded to check my telephone messages.  And there was a message from the
"Lost and Found" saying that someone had returned my wallet and I could pick it
up any time.</p>
<p>	I am so grateful to be here at a university where I can trust my fellow students.  I
love looking at the person in front of me in a classroom and knowing that he or
she believes in what I believe.  At any other university I probably would never
have seen my wallet again, but here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho it is different.  I never found
out who the person was who returned my wallet, but I have thanked him or her
many times in my prayers.  I have thanked them for helping me to have a spiritual
experience, one that I will never forget.</p>
<p>The unknown person at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho who returned this young man's wallet is an example of
integrity and honesty with God, of integrity and honesty with herself or himself, and of integrity
and honesty with other people.</p>
<p>May each of us have a greater desire and determination to become men and women of integrity
and honesty.  May we seek and qualify for the enabling and strengthening power of the Savior's
atonement.  And may each of us become and contribute to the latter-day light that will literally
"chase darkness from among you" (Doctrine and Covenants 50:25).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that God the Eternal Father lives.  Jesus Christ is His only Begotten
Son.  And I witness that as we yearn to and become men and women of integrity and honesty, we
will increasingly become like them.  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">It is probable that among the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the
most oft-quoted passage in all of scripture is that found in the first chapter of the book of Moses
where the purpose and design of our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ is succinctly set
forth as follows:
    </p>
<p> <em>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal
life of man</em> (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>In this simple scripture rests the reason for and the need of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus
Christ, which, as most of you know, brought with it the free gift of resurrection and life
everlasting to <u>all</u> mankind, and made possible the higher gift of life eternal, or life in the presence
of our Father in Heaven for those who qualified for this awe-inspiring blessing.</p>
<p>It is around this central issue that the forces of good and evil have drawn their battle lines; lines
which predate the history of this world and which tore apart the family of our Heavenly Father in
the premortal world.  Our Father's plan, announced by Jesus in the premortal council and
supported by upraised hand by each of us who are here today, recognized the hallowedness of
individual agency or right of choice and was framed in such a way as to encourage, motivate, and
inspire each of the followers of that plan to make the decision to become like God.  The
archenemy offered his reward at the price of that very agency.  It was a war commenced in
heaven, fought for the souls of men not the control of nations.  Rather than seeking to march his
dark forces across the countries of men, he sought instead to march his ideas and his entreaties
across their souls.</p>
<p>That war goes on today with as much fervor as it did then.  As the battles ensue, we must each be
guided by the powerful expression of empowerment contained in the 58<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine
and Covenants which states <em>"For the power is in <u>them</u>, wherein they <u>are</u> agents unto themselves"</em>
(D&amp;C 58:28).</p>
<p>All that God can do for us He has done and is doing, but inherent in the plan of life is the fact
that we have responsibility for ourselves.  We are <u>indeed</u> an agent unto ourselves. </p>
<p>Of course, the archenemy, Lucifer, who is as real as anything you will ever experience,
understands this all too well.  Remember, he was with us in the pre-existence and there, by the
power of his personality, the grace of his charm, good looks, and dynamic leadership, he was
able to convince one out of every three of our Heavenly Father's children to follow him.  I take it
that this unfortunate result occurred during a time when Jesus, along with every other major
leader any of us could name including Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Lehi, Nephi, Jacob,
Alma, Joseph, Brigham, and a host of others were doing everything they knew how to persuade
those who followed Lucifer not to do so.  <u>Never</u> underestimate Lucifer's powers.  He exists today
with full knowledge of what went on in the pre-existence.  Again I counsel: never underestimate
Lucifer's powers.  Unlike you and me who have had a veil of forgetfulness drawn across our
memories of those sacred times, Lucifer remembers them vividly.  He knows, as well as anyone,
that God is our Eternal Father and that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.  But that
knowledge was never translated into fulfilling his responsibility to be an agent unto himself. 
Because of that he failed, and he seeks now to cause <u>you</u> to fail.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, Lucifer has been there tempting and teaching through deceit and deception,
in an effort to draw every one of God's children from the paths of righteousness.  You are no
exception.  I would not find it improbable if someone were to tell me that Lucifer called together
those who served with him (perhaps we might appropriately refer to them as Lucifer's own high
council) to reason and to plan a course to bring about the downfall of each one of God's children. 
In that early plan, it is my conviction that Lucifer sought to destroy men rather than women,
knowing that with the destruction of men went the destruction of the holy priesthood, and with
the destruction of the priesthood went much of the power of revelation, the power to perform
God's work upon the earth, and particularly, the power to conduct the sacred sealing ordinance in
the temple. </p>
<p>And so, Lucifer, from as far back as time records, used pornography, alcohol, tobacco,
dishonesty, greed, and power to destroy men.  That plan has been worked for thousands of years,
but was only marginally successful.   I believe that is because there was a fatal flaw in Lucifer's
plan.  He forgot about the power of womanhood.  Throughout that period, as men were
bombarded with all of that Lucifer's arsenal held, the vast majority of womanhood remained as
faithful daughters of God.  They were, by their nature, pure, clean, uplifting, strengthening, and
building.  Where men would falter, women would encourage.  Where men would doubt, women
would believe.  And in the process of this relationship, women inspired men to be able to
withstand the entreaties of Lucifer, and thus his efforts brought only marginal return.  </p>
<p>I am fully confident that this lack of success on his part was a source of great dissatisfaction to
him.  I do not find it difficult to believe that he was frustrated, perhaps even discouraged as he
saw his limited progress. Somewhere in this process the idea must have struck him to reevaluate
his technique.  This produced a noticeable change in Lucifer's plan.  Sometime not long ago, a
new strategic plan must have been announced by Lucifer.  At the center of that strategic plan was
womanhood.  Someone convinced Lucifer that the mistake which he had been making was his
failure to concentrate on womanhood, and so a careful plan must have been devised.  A plan
which would cause women to become dissatisfied with the womanhood of old and seek to
substitute for it womanhood as defined by Lucifer and his forces.  In place of modesty came
immodesty.  In place of superior standards came mediocre standards.  In place of lifting and
building all of mankind came becoming like mankind.  Wifehood and motherhood became
phrases to describe duties not honors.  Devotion to home and family was replaced by the desire
for status and power.  A job, an office, and a title replaced the nurturing of children, the
encouragement of husband, and the honor of motherhood.  </p>
<p>Anyone who has lived any length of time at all knows that Lucifer's new plan is vastly superior
to his old one.  It is that plan which has caused so many of our young women to dress in such a
way as to be destructive not only to their own morals but to the morals of young men.  Clothing
that is too tight, too short, too low, too thin, and too little has in all too many cases become the
standard by which young women judge appropriateness of their dress.  As young women have
fallen from the pedestal, young men have lost much of that which caused them to want to rise to
be on the pedestal.  As women have lowered their standards, men followed.  Immodesty in
conduct, coarseness of language, the loss of common courtesy, drugs, alcohol, tobacco,
dishonesty, and pornography are gaining a greater foothold each day of our lives.  Together, more
and more of our youth are wallowing in the dark abyss of spiritual bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>But you know something, I have great faith in the young women and young men of the Church. 
Everywhere I go I find them standing for what is right.  Modesty <u>is</u> still popular.  Good manners
are still to be found and Christ-like behavior is still the model.  All over our young people are
saying, "Enough is enough."  I recently was told of a group of young women who simply got
tired of trying to buy modest clothing.  They arranged a meeting with the buyer for the local
store.  Their message was simple: "We don't like what you carry.  Either buy clothes that meet
our standards or we're going somewhere else even if we have to make our own."  I understand
the buyer and the store management listened.  Another group, this one consisting of young men
and young women, decided that they had had all of the improper high school dances they wanted. 
Their message to the school administration was clear: "Bring the dances up to our standards or
we'll start holding our own."  Large numbers of young men have returned to the standards of
conduct the world has now abandoned.  They treat the young women in their lives with courtesy
and respect -- and the young women are doing the same.  Things are changing and it's young
people like you who are changing them.  That's why I have faith in you and in your tomorrows.</p>
<p>The second part of Lucifer's new strategy was, I believe, equally ingenious.  He determined that
he would try to destroy our individual self-worth.  If he can make each of us feel like we are not
as good as others or that we have limited worth, and if he could sow seeds of self-doubt and
worthlessness, he could gain tremendous power over us.  So, hand in hand with his plan to
destroy womanhood, he has also moved to destroy feelings of self-worth among our young
people.  He knows that it's not easy being a young person today.  I suspect you've all been told
how fun high school was and how enjoyable your college years will be.  But have you ever
noticed that those who tell you these things are those who don't have to prepare for the exams, do
the homework, or sit through the classes?  Of course there's a great deal of fun and enjoyment,
but anyone who's been where you are knows that there's also a great deal of pressure and
responsibility.  Just the process of finding out who you are, where you fit, and with whom you fit
is a responsibility that most who are older have long forgotten you bear.  Even our school
systems, as good as they are and as much as I admire them, work in many ways to undermine
self-worth.  Where else in life do we judge and identify weaknesses, issue weekly test results
(which by the way if we're lucky, the girl in front of you gets to call out for the entire class to
hear), quarterly report cards, and notes home to parents?  Where else in life do we compare with
the same unrelenting manner that we do in our schools?</p>
<p>Everything is relatively easy if you're a starting player on the school's winning basketball team,
the quarterback on the football team, a cheerleader, the most beautiful girl in school, or the most
popular student on campus.  But what if you're not?  What if you're just a normal, average,
young man or woman?  You know the kind - a 2.5 GPA, one who studies hard to get a C+, a
little overweight or underweight, shy, and a little unsure of yourself.  The kind who wonders:
Does anyone even know I'm here?  Does anyone care?  If you're in that group - which is most of
us - when was the last time the cheerleaders led a cheer for you, or you saw your picture on the
front page of the school paper or had your favorite teacher write your parents to tell them how
great it is to have you in his class?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how well your parents would do if we issued a periodic report card to
them on the size of their house or the importance of your dad's job, your mother's physical
condition, or your dad's athletic ability?  How do you think they would feel if we erected a
neighborhood marquee with the name of "outstanding father" or "greatest mother" on it and their
names never appeared.  I wonder what would happen, even at this marvelous institution, if we
had a teacher evaluation program where the students graded the teachers.  We could even send
home low-grade notices to their wives or husbands.  To make it even more fun, suppose we list
the teachers from the best down to the worst in order and post that on the end of the library
shelving every quarter for all to see.  How about pictures in the local newspapers of teachers who
the students say aren't "cutting it."  Imagine what that kind of constant comparison would do to
their self-worth.</p>
<p>And yet, in a way, that's about what we do to each one of you.  Now understand that I'm not
critical of what we do; that isn't my purpose in bringing it up.  I'm merely attempting to help you
understand what's happening so that you can protect yourself from it.  Understand that as
marvelous as our educational system is, it is a system with flaws.  I don't know who it was that
said that your ability to recite stanzas from Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> made you smarter than if you knew
how to tear apart a diesel engine or build a cabinet, but somewhere in our society someone did. 
We started early to help you know you didn't measure up.  You remember the reading groups -- 
redbirds and bluebirds (and everyone knows that the bluebirds were the dumbells) - and it's been
going on ever since. </p>
<p>For example, the world's ideal young woman today is somewhere between 5'4" and 5'7" in
height, weighs between 100 and 105 pounds and has a perfectly proportioned figure.  Do you
realize that in pioneer times a girl fitting that description would have been considered too thin
and too weak to make a good wife?  How could she possibly help pull a handcart, yoke the oxen,
or plow the field?  So today, the femininity which the world admires would in times past have
caused you to be labeled a "loser."  I do not mention this to suggest the superiority of one
measurement over another, but merely to help you understand the fallibility of such
measurements.  Do not let what the world tells you is important determine how you feel about
yourself.  Do not let others set standards by which you are then judged and found wanting.  God
loves you.  He cares for you, each of you, individually.  Whether you are an honor student or not,
whether you are an athlete or not, whether you are popular or not, He cares about you just
because you are you and you have the divine within you.  Hold on to that divine.  Do not let
Lucifer's plan aided unwittingly by mankind draw you to the conclusion that you are less than
you really are.  Know this: I love you, the prophet loves you.  The Lord Jesus Christ loves you,
and your Father in Heaven loves you.  After all, you are his child.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago two of the most profound questions ever asked were posed to the Lord
Jesus Christ as He stood before the great Sanhedrin on trial under Jewish law.  The semi-circular
seating arrangement which historians say was used by the Sanhedrin would have been behind the
Savior; its 72 seats filled with that portion of the Sanhedrin who were then present.  At either end
were two additional seats, filled by scribes, who recorded the events of that fateful night.  At the
judge's chair on a raised platform in front of the Sanhedrin and the prisoner at bar sat Caiaphas,
the infamous chief priest.  The assembled body had expended considerable effort in attempting to
find witnesses who would testify against the Lord and Master.  It was evident to all that their
efforts had failed.  At that fateful moment, Caiaphas, feigning piety by rending his garment, stood
from his seat and in what I perceive to be a loud and profane voice proclaimed: <em>"I adjure thee by
the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God"</em> (Matthew 26:63).</p>
<p>Perhaps not even Caiaphas understood the import of the question which he as the supreme judge
of the supreme judicial body of the land had just uttered.  Inherent in its complex structure were
indeed <u>two</u> questions: (1) are you the one who has been called to lead the Jews out of bondage
from the hated Romans, and (2) are you the Son of God.  The record is silent as to the demeanor
of the witness or the circumstance of His response, but it cries aloud with the essence of His
answer.  In words or import, the simple proclamation still rings in our ears: <em>"I am"</em> (Mark 14:62;
see also Matthew 26:64).</p>
<p>Perhaps not even Caiaphas was prepared for the sudden victory which seemed to be his.  The
pretense of meeting Jewish law had now been fulfilled.  The testimony long sought from third
parties had now been supplied by the defendant himself.  The long-held plan to put the Savior to
death was possible.  The now more confident voice of Caiaphas filled the night air:<em> "He hath
spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his
blasphemy.  What think ye?"</em> (Matthew 26:65-66; see also Mark 14:63-63).  The assembled
greatness of the Jews marked indelibly upon their own foreheads the duplicity with which they
acted as pretenders to impartial justice when they answered as one voice: <em>"He is guilty of death"</em>
(Matthew26:66; see also Mark 14:64).</p>
<p>In time, the Son of God would be led as a prisoner from the judgement hall of the Jews to the
palace of Pilate and from there to the place of the skull.  In the hours before, He had entered the
spot called the Garden of Gethsemane.  There He fell upon His face and poured out His soul unto
His Father and to our Father.  For there in the Garden of Gethsemane, in a way unknown and
unknowable to the finite mind, the Son of God wrought the Atonement of all mankind.  <em>"Father,
if it be Thy will let this cup pass from me"</em> was His plaintive plea.  <em>"Nevertheless, Thy will not
mine be done"</em> was His humble addendum.</p>
<p>There in the privacy of that sacred place began the most transcendent event in the history of the
world.  There in a few hours time, the Son of God, in mortal body met and defeated another son
of God who had given himself to pride and selfish ambition and sought to destroy that for which
the father of both stood.  The mission of the mortal Christ was to fulfill that of which Amulek
had spoken some one hundred years earlier when he said:</p>
<p>	For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of
man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice;
but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice. (Alma 34:10)</p>
<p>It was indeed an infinite and an eternal sacrifice, the sacrifice of a God.  From that sacrifice came
the resurrection of every man and woman who has ever lived or will ever live, all as a free gift,
given as a birthright to the spirit offspring of a loving Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>How did this miracle of miracles occur?  The science of the process has not yet been revealed,
but the blessings of its occurrence were manifest that first Easter morn with the loving words of
the risen Christ, spoken to his ardent follower when he addressed her simply as <em>"Mary."</em> </p>
<p> <em>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they
would repent;</em></p>
<p><em>	But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</em></p>
<p><em>	Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain,
and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not
drink the bitter cup, and shrink...</em>(D&amp;C 18:16-18).</p>
<p>An additional inspired glimpse into those sacred moments is giving by Orson Hyde, an Apostle
of the Lord Jesus Christ, called to a mission, one portion of which was to dedicate the Holy Land
to the preaching of the gospel.  In 1841 Orson sat on the hill opposite the Garden of Gethsemane. 
He wrote in his journal, and I quote:</p>
<p> <em>"Is that small enclosure in the valley of Kedron, where the boughs of those lonely olives
are waving their green foliage so gracefully in the soft and gentle breeze, really the
garden of Gethsemane, where powers infernal poured the flood of hells dark gloom
around the princely head of the immortal Redeemer? Oh, yes! ...There, there is the place
where the Son of the Virgin bore our sins and carried our sorrows...."</em> <u>End of quote</u>.  (A
Sketch, <em>Times and Seasons, vol. 3 (November 1841-October 1842)</em>, Vol. 3 No. 17, 1 July
1842, 851.)</p>
<p>To each of us who ponder our worth, who wonder if the God in yonder heavens knows we live,
who wonder does He care, I offer this simple rejoinder:  He bore <u>your</u> sins and He carried <u>your</u>
sorrows.</p>
<p>From the cruel halls of the Jews' court of justice to the weakness of the temporal leader Pilate,
the Savior passed protected by the assurance of His divine sonship.  His ascension up the hill
carrying the cross has been depicted in hundreds of pictures and has been felt at one time or
another by each of us.  There on the cross He sealed the great atoning sacrifice and crowned His
life, His work, and His mission with His blood.  His hands still quivering from the nails brutally
pounded through His flesh, and with His feet still trembling from pain, He uttered in simple
majesty: <em>"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"</em> (Luke 23:34).</p>
<p>To His mother who stood at the base of His cross, tenderly He created the stewardship of John:
<em>"Woman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!"</em> (John 19:26-27). 
And to His Father as He voluntarily gave His life, the simple pronouncement: <em>"It is finished"</em>
(John 19:30).  <em>"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"</em> (Luke 23:46).</p>
<p>Like the crescendo which accompanies the closing strains of a magnificent oratorio, the heavens
wept.  A veil was drawn over the sun.  The earth shook.  In the inspired writings of Eliza R Snow
it is described thus:</p>
<p> <em>He died, and at the awful sight<br />
	The sun in shame withdrew its light!<br />
	Earth trembled, and all nature sighed<br />
	In dread response, "A God has died!"<br />
</em>	(<em>Hymns</em>, 191)</p>
<p>And with that death came resurrection and everlasting life for all.  What is of greater importance
to us seated here today than to know that we have come within the pale of the doctrines of eternal
life and to understand that the most sublime blessing of the atonement is to open the opportunity
for those who would live worthily <u>and</u> partake of those ordinances which are required, to gain
eternal life.  Life with God the Father, life like God the Father, life in His presence with His
glorious blessings and rulership, life in family circles, life with a God's power of procreation. 
All of these are the gifts of inheritance for those who <u>worthily</u> abide the doctrine.</p>
<p>This is the Jesus Christ of whom I testify.  This is the Jesus Christ of whom I am an especial
witness.  This is the Jesus Christ whose doctrines course through my body, whose life has
changed my life, and whose death has given me the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p>I plead with you to understand the doctrines of God's plan of life and to live them in this time of
your life.  </p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">During the concluding moments of the Nauvoo Temple Dedication, I remember President
Gordon B. Hinckley saying something like this,</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Walk with me down Parley's Street.  I want to paint a picture.  A family walking
near a wagon, snow swirling in the wind, an icy river in front of them.  A little girl
walking beside her mother shivers and cries, "Mama, I'm cold.  Why can't we go
home?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This was the picture that I saw. Can you see it too, the little family facing the icy river?</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Can you feel it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is a beautiful, tender picture of sacrifice, trust, faith, and love.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">President Hinckley invited those present to walk into the picture, and though it was a
sticky hot June day, to imagine that frigid day in February.  And they did.  As  the session
concluded more than 1000 members poured out of the Temple heading for Parley's St.
and the river.   They were joined by hundreds more, who had heard President Hinckley's
invitation in other locations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Church News reported:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	What unfolded on June 30, 2002, was like a spiritual snapshot, the capturing of a
moment to remember forever: Members of the Church heeded a prophet's voice.
The distance covered, approximately a mile, wasn't significant, but the walk itself
was.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The crowd thinned as people took different routes.  Some went through a grove of
trees, some kept to the dusty footpaths . . .  They eventually merged on Parley St.
and continued their walk to the river's edge. . .</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	The reason so many took the walk was summed up by four year old Anna Jensen,
who said she sings "Follow the Prophet" in Primary.<sup><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I've come today to speak with you about the beautiful pictures prophets paint and to
contrast them with the ugliness of so much we see around us every day in our
technological Telestial world.  The question is: "When do we look and when do we look
away?"  "What beholdest thou?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our world is crowded with pictures.  Many are grotesque and ugly. They intrude into the
serenity of our lives in living color and with sound effects that boom and echo in our
minds.  They rival reality, they are sinful, devilish realities.   Some are labeled  "virtual
reality."  The apparent variety is endless.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So often we are shown the sordid, the destructive.  Some of these images are wrapped
beautifully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I remember seeing a dazzling snow scene set in the wilds of a stunning, white Russian
winter in the movie, <em>Dr. Zhivago.</em>  There is a world of difference between <em>this</em> frigid scene
and the one President Hinckley described.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The handsome couple speeds across the elegant, frozen wastes in a storybook sleigh
toward an idyllic, ice-cycled house.  The photography is exquisite, taken through a foggy
lens, which adds to the romantic setting.  But the picture is of a man and his mistress-his
wife is at home but is not shown-this was a picture of two people hurrying to commit
adultery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That scene was mild compared to the startling images now produced.  We're plunging
downward, this year is worse than last. How many of you returned missionaries noticed
the visible decline in morals on TV, movies and videos when you returned home?  When
our son returned from his mission some 25 years ago he was appalled.  He put a sign on
our TV screen, "That which doth not edify is not of God!"  It was his brief message to us. 
But let's read the rest of it.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	...that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.  That which is of God
is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light;
and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day  (Doctrine and
Covenants 50:23-24).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is <em>that</em> Light we are commanded to seek and thus chase darkness from our minds and
hearts.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Satan is using every means at his disposal to peddle his menu of sins.  News reporting is
not exempt.  When a few evil men plot to kill thousands of innocent people the
catastrophe is replayed over and over and over and over again on prime time.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First Lady Laura Bush spoke out just before the anniversary of September 11, asking
parents to turn off the television on that day and instead read to their children.  She said:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Don't let your children see the images, the planes hitting the buildings or the
buildings falling. . . Children need assurance they are safe.  We saw a handful of
people do something so horrible, but then we saw so many other people do good
things.  The firemen, the policemen, the rescue workers, the children themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New heroes emerge.  Recently I heard of a little boy asking a policeman for his
autograph.  When the policeman asked him why he wanted <em>his autograph </em>he answered,
"Because you save the world."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When children are kidnaped it is instantly televised causing millions of children across
America and perhaps even the world, to be full of fear.  To be sure, prompt action might
help find a kidnaped child.  In the meantime, our youngest grandchildren now fear to
sleep alone. Satan deals in fear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The prophet Isaiah saw our time.  He paints a picture of the wicked "swimming in dung."</font><sup><font face="Times New Roman"><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
<font size="4">The vivid Satanic images we see remain in our minds.  We <em>are swimming</em> in them.  The
sin, the violence, the profane use of sacred words; the brain stores all of them. Unlike
your computer, which asks you regularly if you wish to save what you have imaged on the
screen, your mind automatically saves everything you have seen, the beautiful and the
ugly.  It is all "backed up" in living color and stereophonic sound.  It becomes <em>your</em> virtual
reality. </font></font> </sup></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is one of the reasons looking at pornography is so crippling.  The addicted viewer
fills his memory with the sordid and ugly, crowding out the beautiful until his senses are
dulled and he cannot even recognize the beautiful. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">We must learn to look away, to never look at all, to discriminate in advance, putting DO
NOT ENTER signs on our minds and hearts.  The prophet has been specific: No R rated
movies.  Are all PG-13 movies worth watching?  We must each decide for ourselves.  It
might help to ask three simple questions I heard at a BYU Devotional last year</font><sup><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>: </font> </sup></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Is it right or wrong?  Is it true or false? Is it beautiful or ugly?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The apostle Paul described our time and told Timothy, who was about your age, exactly
what we should do.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own
selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy... [the list goes on]...despisers of those that are good...lovers of pleasures
more than lovers of God; [and what should we do?] . . <em>from such turn away</em>!  (2
Timothy 3:1-7, emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Look away.  Turn away.  Become passers by.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In a polar opposite way, Prophets paint word pictures for our minds to treasure and return
to again and again.  These are the kinds of images we can use to combat and replace the
ugly that is all around us. I have come to replay some of these pictures for you today.
Happily, you can only have one image at a time on the center stage of your mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In 1 Nephi 11:8 &amp; 12 and many other places in the scripture there is a simple but
profound exchange, a formula, if you will.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...the Spirit said unto me: Look!  And I looked [and beheld a tree] (1 Nephi 11:8)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Look and I looked.  Often the Spirit will whisper to you, "Look!"  The question will
always be, "Will you glance, really look, refuse to look or look away?"  There is always
an agentive moment when you make that choice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">What did Nephi see?  As we read his words what will you see?  You will need to fire up
your imagination to truly see.  I often say to my Isaiah students, "Let the metaphor <em>speak</em>
to you."  Let the picture form in your mind with as many details as you can manage,
including color, texture, odor, stereophonic sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">When I was a little girl we only had radio.  Every Saturday morning I would jump out of
bed the moment I heard the music that meant my favorite radio program, "Let's Pretend"
was about to begin.  My mind filled with images as I <em>listened</em> to the program each week. 
There were Princes, white horses, castles, gorgeous princesses and happily ever after. 
The words and sound effects helped me see it all.  I'm so grateful for those innocent
exciting images of my childhood.  I exercised my imagination every Saturday morning
and lots of other times, too. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Sometimes I feel like you have been robbed because your childhood included a TV, a
computer and video images.   Violent video games that are built around killing and
destruction frighten me when I think what is being taught.  Why are so many children
acting out what they have seen?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">But more than that, these things are <em>someone else's</em> inane idea technologically produced
for <em>your</em> consumption.  I'm sorry you've had to settle for that. I hope you haven't let your
<em>own</em> imagination atrophy from little use.  Everyone has an imagination.  Exercise yours
with me today!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Let's look at Nephi's words to create some pictures in your mind.  He describes images in
living color.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets [reds], and fine twined linen
[white]  (1 Nephi 13:7).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It was not just something to watch but something to hear and feel as well. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	. . .I saw lightnings, and I HEARD thunderings and earthquakes and all manner of
tumultuous noises. . . (1 Nephi 12:4, emphasis added. )</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Read with me 1 Nephi 11:12-24, 28.  Let Nephi's descriptions and your own imagination
help you paint your own picture of what he saw.  You will recall that he had prayed to see
what his father, Lehi, had seen and for the interpretation of his dream of the tree of life.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...he said unto me: Look! And I looked...</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...and beheld the great  city of Jerusalem, and also other cities.  [He recognized
this city because he had lived there.   Most of you haven't lived there but I have,
so try to imagine with me that walled city on a hill with its white stone buildings
reflecting the bright sunlight.]...I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of
Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was <em>exceedingly fair and white</em>. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, <em>what
beholdest thou</em>?</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the
Son of God, <em>after the manner of the flesh</em>. [This helps us understand  how God,
the Father was not only the father of Jesus' spirit but also the father of his mortal
body.] </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit;... for the
space of a time and the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	And I...beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms. [Try to imagine that
tiny, soft baby cradled in her arms.]</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the
Eternal Father!. . .[Imagine what he might have looked like, human and divine,
and beautiful, innocent, like all tiny babies.]</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	And...he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going
forth among the children of men;...</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...I beheld that he went forth <em>ministering unto the people</em>, in power and great
glory;... (1 Nephi 11:12-24, 28, emphasis added). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Imagine with me what "power and great glory" means.  That picture will help you as we
look at another picture together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Nephi has painted word pictures that help us glimpse the birth and life of Jesus Christ,
just as he saw it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Joseph Smith gave us a similar opportunity to share his experience.  He also saw and
heard the Son of God.  But he was not an onlooker like Nephi.  This is something
different.  He was <em>in</em> the picture.  Remember the command, "Look!"  Let us look with
Joseph.  Let the picture speak to you.  Let your imagination paint this prophet's picture. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Please turn to Joseph Smith-History 1:16 -17.  He was only a few years younger than
most of you.  Remember how you felt at that age?  He had been enveloped in thick
darkness and felt as if he were "doomed to destruction," when</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun,
which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held
me bound.  When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose
brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.  One of
them spake unto me, calling me by name [Joseph] and said, pointing to the other -
<em>This is my Beloved Son.  Hear Him!</em> (Joseph Smith-History 1:16 -17, emphasis
added.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many times on my mission I repeated the words that painted that prophet's picture.  I
remember the impact on me and those I taught as I recounted Joseph's experience.  I
learned then, for certain, that the Holy Ghost delivers truth directly to our spirits.  Each
time I repeated those familiar words, <em>I saw the picture</em>.  I knew that our Heavenly Father
and His Beloved Son, Jesus, had indeed, appeared to Joseph.  I saw those whom I taught
feel the confirming spirit of the Holy Ghost as well.  It was one of the most powerful and
memorable lessons of my life.  Why does this image touch me so deeply?  Many of you
know these feelings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Now let's turn to Isaiah. Oh, oh!  Isaiah paints a unique picture for us.  In Isaiah 51:17-23
<strong><u>New Inspired Version</u></strong> please read with me verses 17, <strong>22</strong>.  He is teaching us of Christ's
Atonement in a very fundamental way. He is speaking of a cup and of appearing to be
drunk, but not with wine, rather with the effects of sin.  The cup is filled to the brim with
the "wrath of God." Or perhaps we could call the wine the just judgment for our sins.  I
will be reading partly from the New Inspired Version translation.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Awake, awake!  Rise up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the
Lord the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes
men stagger.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	This is what the LORD [Jehovah] says, your God who [pleadeth the cause of his
people King James Version]   See, <strong><em>I</em></strong><em> have taken out of your hand the cup</em> that
made you stagger; from that cup, even the dregs of the cup of my fury [judgment],
you will never drink again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Then remember with me what Jesus prayed in Gethsemane in his own extremity of
suffering:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:  nevertheless not my will,
but thine, be done.  (Luke 22:42)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Then as he leaves the garden after his agony he says to Peter. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I
not drink it? (John 18:11)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In Jeremiah we read:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	This is what the Lord, the God of Israel said to me:  Take from my hand this cup
filled with the wine of my wrath [judgment] and make all the nations to whom I
send you drink it  (Jeremiah 25:15 New Inspired Version).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Leviticus 23:13  speaks of a drink offering of wine, after sacrificing a young male lamb
unblemished.  Part of making things right with God in the Law of Moses included a drink
or wine offering, an offering for sins.  This is a perfect symbol for the sins of the world
which Jesus "drank to the dregs," to the very bottom, every drop. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Add to these pictures, the one Isaiah paints in Isaiah 53:12 New Inspired
Version as Jesus
"...poured out his [soul King James Version] unto death and was numbered with the
transgressors..."  "...though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth."
(Isaiah. 53:9)  And "though the LORD [Jehovah]<em> makes his life a guilt offering,
</em>[or as the
King James Version says, "an offering for sin"] he will see his seed."  (Isaiah 53:10,
emphasis added.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Isaiah adds another compelling image to the picture of the Atonement, the Lord's
outstretched hand.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	...his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. (Isaiah 9:12)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">God paints the boundaries precisely where they are.  There is no way he can deny justice. 
Yet, with justice one day to be paid, he everlastingly extends his hand, stretching to reach
us.  The Sistine Chapel ceiling comes to mind, where Michaelangelo painted the hand of
the Creator-God reaching through the clouds to the first man.  So soaringly real is the
painting that in studying it over time, one is led to feel that one of them must surely move
the little distance to connect those outstretched hands, touching graceful index fingers. 
Who will move?  What will justice require?  The Lord began his "reaching out" with the
first man.  But we are the ones who must close the distance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His hand is eternally extended, reaching through a veil to his children to lead them to a
place apart, the holy Temple, if they will only answer his call.  In that sacred, silent spot
he will teach them of the path to his glory. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His prophets have left glimpses of the Light, records of brief encounters with glory.  They
witnessed majesty, the sound of rushing waters, whiteness above all earthly whiteness,
light brighter than noonday sun, a voice of thunder and a still, small voice.  Yet all this
was only a shadow of his full reality. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One more glimpse from Isaiah for those of us who steadfastly seek the blessings of the
Atonement. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with
wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint. 
(Isaiah 40:31) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I have offered you pictures prophets have painted, in the hope that you would look again
and again and then search, find and collect many more.  They painted their pictures with
words so you have to put forth effort to look, like Nephi you can affirm, "I looked." And
the more you look the more you will see. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I have invited you to look away from the ugly  which surrounds you, to turn it off, to
never enter the theater or rent the video or if you have by some error, to walk out of the
theater or rewind the video and return it before adding more ugly images to your mind. 
Instead, the Savior pleads:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Look unto <em>me</em> in <em>every </em>thought; doubt not, fear not (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36-37).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Our hearts and minds can store beauty, which we can revisit again and again.  Our own
experiences can be perfectly recalled for us by the Holy Ghost.  I know this is true. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Let me conclude with some of my own sacred, personal glimpses. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I can see again a full moon in Jerusalem shining over the Mount of Olives, as I walked
near the same path Jesus had walked toward Gethsemane.  He also  walked by the light of
a full moon. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A clearing in the sacred grove, a break in the trees through which I could see the Palmyra
Temple and vice versa, a Sacred grove I could glimpse from one of the Temple windows.
An eternal connection! </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Isaiah's description of a towering Temple built in the tops of the mountains.  Often in my
mind and heart I revisit our sacred  sealing day nearly fifty years ago in the very Temple I
believe Isaiah saw. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Sometimes the Lord has pictures waiting for us and we don't come for them.  We leave
the scriptures unopened or hurriedly read when one phrase might jump from the page and
paint a glorious picture in our minds, writing it forever on our hearts. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In my heart I have a precious picture of the Lord painted by Isaiah in some of the words I
have shared with you today, Jesus, with outstretched hand or drinking a bitter cup on my
behalf.  A modern prophet's words have helped me in addition, to see a resplendent,
resurrected personage. All these images are enhanced by regular encounters kneeling
before the Lord in a place that has become holy to me because of the many prayers I have
spoken there.  It is there I know him best. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I know He lives!</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see
him AS HE IS.  [<em>In all his glory</em>.] (1 John 3:2, emphasis added.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Crawford Gates, in his <em>Visions of Eternity, </em>put music to the words that frame this ultimate
picture. Please imagine yourself in this picture. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	And we beheld the glory of the Son<br />
	on the right hand of the Father,<br />
	And received of his fullness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will we arrive at that place?</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Verily, thus saith the Lord:  It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his
sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and
keepeth my commandments, shall <em>see</em> my face and <em>know that I am</em>.  (Doctrine and
Covenants 93:1, emphasis added.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">We will be there because of our Savior's love.   In a moment we'll sing together these
words: </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">	Our Savior's love<br />
	Shines like the sun with perfect light<br />
	As from above<br />
	It breaks through clouds of strife.<br />
	Lighting our way,<br />
	It leads us back into his sight<br />
	Where we may stay<br />

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">A few months ago, I had the opportunity to stand next to the Prophet, many of the General
Authorities, and thousands of faithful members of the Church at the dedication of the Nauvoo
temple.
</p>
<p>In the dedicatory prayer, President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "Bless this City of Nauvoo . . .
[this] City of Joseph. . . . May this sacred house stand as a memorial to him who lived here and
was buried here, Joseph Smith, the great prophet of this dispensation, and his brother, Hyrum,
whom he loved."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>It is fitting that the temple at Nauvoo stand as a memorial to The Prophet Joseph Smith and to
those who served with him at the dawn of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  It is
fitting that we remember; that we never forget the grand and glorious events of those early days.   </p>
<p>Today, I would like to pay tribute to the Prophet, the people, and the events of those early days of
the Church. I wish to speak for a few moments of that glorious temple built to provide a spiritual
haven for the Saints.</p>
<p>During a cold November in 1838, thousands of Missouri militia surrounded the Saints at Far
West, Missouri.  The governor of the State of Missouri had declared that, the Mormons "must be
exterminated or driven from the state."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Frenzied by hatred, they drove hundreds of men,
women, and children from their homes. </p>
<p>Heber C. Kimball was an eye-witness to this persecution.   "They expected to see us cast down
and sorrowful," he writes, "but I testify as an eye-witness that the brethren rejoiced and praised
the Lord and kicked up their heels, and thanked God, taking joyfully the despoiling of their
goods."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>One Missourian took pity on the suffering of the Saints and wrote a letter to the state legislature. 
It, "makes humanity shudder," he wrote,  "and the cold chills run over any man, not entirely
destitute of the feelings of humanity.  These demons are now constantly strolling up and down
Caldwell County . . . in any way and every way plundering the poor [Mormons] of all the means
of subsistence . . . leaving them in a starving and naked condition."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>The prophet, along with several other key brethren in the Church were charged with various
crimes.  Many were killed or died as a result of the hardships they were made to bear.  More had
been robbed of their property and forced to flee into the cold of winter for their lives.</p>
<p>General John B. Clark, the man to whom the governor had entrusted to rid the state of the
Mormons, had been told that it should be completely left to his discretion whether he killed all of
them or not.  In his own words, General Clark told the Saints at Far West, "You need not expect
any mercy, but extermination, for I am determined the Governor's order shall be executed.  As
for your leaders," he continued, "do not once think--do not imagine for a moment--do not let it
enter your mind that they will be delivered, or that you will see their faces again, for their fate is
fixed--their die is cast--their doom is sealed."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Saints had no choice but to leave their homes and flee.  They took their poor and their sick
with them resolving to, "never desert [those] who are worthy, till they shall be out of the reach of
the exterminating order ...."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> </p>
<p>They eventually found refuge one hundred and fifty miles to the east of Far West.  The good
people of Quincy, Illinois gave aid to them  and condemned the barbaric treatment they had been
subjected to.  "The governor of Missouri," they resolved in a meeting of the Democratic
Association of Quincy, "[had] brought a lasting disgrace upon the state over which he presides."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the aid of his captors, the Prophet Joseph Smith escaped Liberty Jail and, in the
Spring of 1839, arrived in western Illinois.  There, at a bend in the Mississippi river, the Prophet
looked over a section of land that had been offered to him as a place for the Saints to call home. 
Because of the dampness and the mosquitoes that infested the area, few wanted to live there. 
Many became sick with malaria.  Some had died. </p>
<p>But mosquitoes weren't the only challenge for those who lived there.  One early visitor to the city
wrote, "Oh, the mud!  It seems bottomless.  The soil is a black, sticky loam, and when your foot
is once in, it is almost impossible to get it out."<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a></p>
<p>It was a place no one else would covet.  The prophet himself said that the city, "was so
unhealthful, very few could live there; but believing that it might become a healthful place by the
blessing of heaven to the Saints, and no more eligible place presenting itself, I considered it
wisdom to make an attempt to build up a city."<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Prophet could see through the swamp, sickness, and obscurity.  He could see what the
industry of the Saints and the blessings of heaven could make of this place.  The swamp could be
drained and the city could become a healthy place.  This could become a place of beauty and a
place of refuge.</p>
<p>Not long after designating the area as the gathering place, Joseph renamed the city calling it
Nauvoo.  It was a Hebrew word that brought with it the meaning of, "a beautiful situation," and
"the idea of rest."<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> </p>
<p>And the Saints arrived, many of them penniless, sick, and poor but armed with an unshaken and
mighty faith in the Lord.  Through their untiring efforts, they drained the swamp and began to
build.  Eventually, a city began to rise.  </p>
<p>And it was beautiful.  </p>
<p>And it was a place of rest for the weary Saints of God who had sacrificed so much for their
convictions.  </p>
<p>And it was a place blessed of the Father and saturated with manifestations of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Soon, a university was formed and literature, languages, math, and sciences were taught.  The
state of Illinois granted Nauvoo it's own city charter and granted permission for it to create it's
own militia, later known as the Nauvoo Legion.</p>
<p>Wards and stakes were organized, and the first Saints of the Restoration began to rear up a city
that gave witness to their faith, commitment, and industry. </p>
<p>In a special epistle to the Saints abroad, The First Presidency wrote that they, "soon expect to see
the thousands of Israel flocking to this region in obedience to the heavenly command."<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  And the
Saints did come.  By the twos and by the twenties.  And in a very little time, this swampy village
that had only recently consisted of a couple of dozen homes was transformed into a bustling city
of 11,000 rivaling Chicago itself.	</p>
<p>Not long after arriving in Nauvoo, Joseph began to speak of a great work that would unite the
Saints under a common labor and prepare them for spiritual endowments that they could scarce
imagine.  </p>
<p>&quot;The time has come when the great Jehovah would have a resting place on
earth,&quot; the Twelve
Apostles wrote to the inhabitants of the earth, "a habitation for His chosen where His law shall be
revealed, and His servants be endowed from on high, to bring together the honest in heart from
the four winds.&quot;<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a></p>
<p>"Let all my saints come from afar," the Lord spoke to Joseph in the 124<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine
and Covenants.  "Come ye, with all your silver, and your precious stones, and with all your
antiquities . . . and with all your precious things of the earth; and build a house to my name, for
the Most High to dwell therein."<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a></p>
<p>William Weeks was commissioned to draw up plans for the temple and began discussing the
design of the temple with Joseph Smith.  The Prophet had told Brother Weeks that circular
windows would be placed above the first story windows.  The architect disagreed insisting that
"round windows in the broad side of a building were a violation of all the known rules of
architecture."   Joseph told Brother Weeks, "I wish you to carry out my designs.  I have seen in
vision the splendid appearance of that building illuminated, and will have it built according to the
pattern shown me."<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Saints were asked to give a tithe of their means and of their time.  Every tenth day, the
brethren cut, hauled, and put into place the huge limestone blocks and wooden timbers that
would frame the temple.  The sisters mended clothing, prepared meals, worked on the
furnishings, and donated a penny a week to purchase glass and nails.</p>
<p>As work on the temple progressed, the Prophet wrote and spoke at length on the subject of
baptism for the dead.  He urged the Saints to hasten the effort to build the baptismal font.  "There
is a way to release the spirits of the dead," the Prophet instructed the Saints, "That is by the
authority of the priesthood--by binding loosing on earth. . . . those Saints who neglect it, in
behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  By performing
baptisms on behalf of their deceased ancestors, the Prophet said, the Saints could become Saviors
on Mount Zion.  </p>
<p>The brethren immediately went to work and completed the baptismal font in the basement of the
temple and baptisms for the dead began soon after while the temple walls were still being built. </p>
<p>These were glorious days in the history of the Church and in the life of the Prophet, Joseph
Smith.  The spirit of Elijah rested upon the Saints.  Hundreds of baptisms for the dead were
performed, the Saints were united in their determination to erect a sacred temple.  Contributions
of time, money, and precious materials for the purpose of building flowed into Nauvoo. </p>
<p>Joseph Smith, in speaking of those days said, "Never since the foundation of the Church was
laid, have we seen manifested a greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of Jehovah, a
more ardent desire to do the will of God, more strenuous exertions used, or greater sacrifices
made."<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the temple was completed, the Prophet Joseph felt a growing sense of urgency to bestow
upon the Brethren of the Church all the keys, knowledge, and endowments that would be
necessary for them should anything happen to him.</p>
<p>Parley P. Pratt records that the Prophet said, "I know not why; but for some reason I am
constrained to hasten my preparations, and to confer upon the Twelve all the ordinances, keys,
covenants, endowments, and sealing ordinances of the priesthood, and so set before them a
pattern in all things pertaining to the sanctuary and the endowment therein."<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a></p>
<p>Once he had done so, Joseph said, "the Lord is about to lay the burden on your shoulders and let
me rest awhile; and if they kill me the Kingdom of God will roll on, as I have now finished the
work which was laid upon me, by committing to you all things for the building up of the
kingdom according to the heavenly vision, and the pattern shown me from heaven."<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a></p>
<p>But as the walls of the temple rose, so did unrest.  The citizens of Illinois became alarmed as the
political power of the Saints increased.  Additionally, several key brethren apostatized and turned
against the faith betraying those to whom they had sworn loyalty.</p>
<p>A spirit of hatred, envy, and rage began to infect many in the area and, once again, the Saints of
God found themselves the victims of prejudice and anger, turned out of their homes, robbed of
their possessions, beaten and threatened.</p>
<p>It culminated on a day, late in June of the year 1844 as Joseph agreed to surrender himself at
Carthage and stand trial against yet another malicious charge.  It was early in the morning when
the Prophet set off for Carthage with seventeen of the brethren.  He stopped for a few moments
as he passed the temple, still only one story high and, looking out over his beloved city, he said,
"This is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens; little do they know the trials
that await them."<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a></p>
<p>Joseph Smith knew that this would be the last time he would look upon his beloved city and his
beloved people.  "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter," he said, "but I am calm as a summer's
morning.  I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men. . . . I shall die an
innocent man, . . . and it shall be said of me, 'He was murdered in cold blood!'"<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a></p>
<p>At about 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of June 27, 1844 an armed mob--painted black--of from
150 to 200 persons descended on Carthage jail.</p>
<p>"Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: <em>I am a</em> <em>dead man!</em> Joseph leaped from the
window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: <em>O Lord my God!</em>"<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a></p>
<p>Willard Richards, who had witnessed the martyrdom sent a message to Nauvoo.  "Joseph and
Hyrum are dead," he wrote.  "Taylor wounded. . . . I am well. . . . The job was done in an
instant."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a></p>
<p>The bodies of Joseph and Hyrum were placed in pine coffins and brought to Nauvoo the next
day.  "As the solemn procession approached Nauvoo," one historian writes, "sorrowing Saints
filed out of the city to meet them.  For more than a mile beyond the Temple the dusty road was
lined with the bereaved citizens of Nauvoo. As the two wagons appeared in sight and the rude
funeral trappings confirmed the report that their beloved leaders were slain, they gave vent to
their emotions in weeping and lamentations. As the cortege approached in the heat of the mid-day sun, the cries and lamentations of the sorrowing Saints arose and fell like the deafening din
of a distant cataract. The procession moved slowly to the Mansion House, where the bodies were
given into the care of their kindred who proceeded at once to prepare them for burial."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></p>
<p>Many believed that the death of Joseph Smith would mean an end to The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints.  Many believed that with the death of their prophet, the Saints would scatter
and abandon their faith.</p>
<p>Such was not the case.  The Saints rallied around Brigham Young and they became even more
determined to finish the temple as a monument to the martyrs.</p>
<p>While mobs were torching homes and threatening the Saints, the walls of the temple continued to
rise.  The Saints labored tirelessly to complete the temple.  One member of the Church, wrote of
this period, "We labored 10 hours in a day, day after day. . . . Sometimes [we had] a peck of corn
meal or a few pounds of flour and . . . sometimes [we would be] entirely out of provisions and
have to live on herbs boiled with any seasoning. . . . The reader may think that the . . . scarcity of
provision was confined to my family.  Not so.  My family was as well off as the majority of my
neighbors.  I had seen those that cut stone by the year eat nothing but parched or browned corn
for breakfast and take some in their pocket for dinner and go to work singing the songs of Zion.  I
mention this not to find fault or complain but to let my children know how the temple in Nauvoo
was built and how their parents as well as hundreds of others suffered to lay a foundation on
which they could build."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a></p>
<p>But the faithful sacrifices of the members of the Church bore fruit and the white stone of the
temple continued to rise layer upon layer.  Finally, a year after Joseph and Hyrum had lain down
their lives, the Saints raised their voices in the Hosanna Shout.  At long last,  the temple stood
complete.  The desire of the Prophet stood in glory, a testament to the fidelity and determination
of the Saints of God to fulfill the vision of their martyred prophet.</p>
<p>In the month of December, the first endowments were given in the new building and continued
until the Saints departed.  By the time the Saints had abandoned their beloved city, 5,634
members of the Church had received their endowments in the House of the Lord.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a></p>
<p>Once, after one of the endowment sessions, Brigham Young said that, "If Joseph Smith had been
living, we should have already been in some other country, and we would go where we would be
the old settlers, and build larger temples than this."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a></p>
<p>As persecution intensified, it became apparent that the Church must leave or face increasing 
hardship and persecution.  They began the task of making wagons and announced that they
would leave the city in Spring.  As news of this departure began to spread, the mobs rejoiced but
they did not let up their harassment.  In December, Governor Ford of Illinois sent a letter
suggesting that the government might not permit the Saints to leave.  Consequently, Brigham
Young organized 1,000 members to leave early and, on an extremely cold day in February, 1846,
the first wagons began the long, arduous journey to the Rocky Mountains.       </p>
<p>Newel Knight, on the day he left Nauvoo made the following entry in his diary: "About noon we
ascended the bluff here.  We all halted and took a farewell view of our delightful city that we had
seen and helped to rear even from its infancy.  We also beheld the magnificent temple rearing its
lofty tower towards the heavens which speaks volumes in honor of the wisdom and greatness of
our martyred prophet."<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Wilford Woodruff wrote in his journal: "I left Nauvoo for the last time, perhaps in this life.  I
looked upon the temple and City of Nauvoo as I retired from it and felt to ask the Lord to
preserve it as a monument of the sacrifice of His Saints."<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a></p>
<p>Within months, the once thriving city became a ghost town.  In 1846, Thomas L. Kane visited
Nauvoo not long after the last members of the Church had left.  He later described the loneliness
and silence of the city.  "The Mormons in Nauvoo . . .had been numbered the year before at over
20,000.  Where were they?" he asked.  "They had last been seen, carrying in mournful train their
sick and wounded, halt and blind, to disappear behind the western horizon, pursuing the phantom
of another home."<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a></p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this address today to chronicle the suffering of that long trek from
Nauvoo to Salt Lake City.  In truth, it may be beyond our ability to understand at all the sacrifice
and grief of those faithful Saints who left behind them the city of their beloved Joseph and their
temple which they had labored so desperately to build.</p>
<p>After the exodus of the members of the Church, the temple at Nauvoo lay vacant.  Mobbers
began inhabiting it and "they carried into it cots and beds, kegs of whisky, and supplies of food,
making the temple the rendezvous of the ungodly.  During the night they played cards and other
games of chance, cursing and profaning as they hurled empty whisky bottles against the beautiful
scenery recently painted on smooth plastered walls."<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a></p>
<p>Not long after, a bolt of lightning struck the belfry, scarring the holy edifice.  Later, arsonists set
it aflame.  In 1850, a tornado knocked down one wall and weakened others.  Finally, the temple
was torn down, stone by stone, and used in other buildings.   Joseph's temple--the temple of
Nauvoo-- was no more.</p>
<p>Then, nearly a century and a half later, on April 4, 1999, President Gordon B. Hinckley said in
his final remarks at General Conference, "I feel impressed to announce that among all of the
temples we are constructing, we plan to rebuild the Nauvoo temple."<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a></p>
<p>President Hinckley's grandfather, Ira N. Hinckley, was a young man in Nauvoo.  His father,
Bryant S. Hinckley, served as president of the Northern States Mission which included Nauvoo. 
In 1938, his father wrote that Nauvoo would rise again and, "annually, thousands . . . will visit
it."<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1939, President Hinckley's father led a 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration of the founding of
Nauvoo.  President Hinckley has said that his father "wished with all his heart to see the temple
rebuilt and worked to that end."<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Many things had to come together in order for that to happen.  The property needed to be
acquired.  In 1937, hearing that the property was going to be offered for sale, the Brethren sent
Brother Wilford C. Wood to see if he couldn't purchase it for the Church.  This was during the
Great Depression and the First Presidency authorized him to spend no more than $1000.  Brother
Wood was distressed when, visiting with bank officials,  he learned that the bidding for the
property would start at $1000 and probably sell for $1500.  Brother Wood felt impressed to ask,
"Are you going to try to make us pay an exorbitant price for the blood of a martyred prophet,
when you know this property rightfully belongs to the Mormon people?"</p>
<p>Brother Wood later said that he "felt the spirit of the Prophet, Joseph Smith in that room.  [One
of the officers] said, 'We will sell the lot for $900.'"</p>
<p>In 1948, a chance meeting between LDS missionaries and a descendant of William Weeks, the
architect of the Nauvoo Temple, led to the acquiring of the plans for the original temple.  After
President Hinckley's announcement, members of the Church brought forward journals from that
period that described the temple.  A rare photograph taken in 1847 surfaced, providing
researchers with additional materials.</p>
<p>The temple was planned to resemble Joseph's temple in every possible detail.   Just as Joseph
Smith presided over every detail of the original temple, President Gordon B. Hinckley oversaw
the construction of the rebuilt temple. He was involved in every aspect of the temple down to the
color of the carpets and murals on the walls.  </p>
<p>President Hinckley said that when the time comes he wanted to meet the Prophet on the other
side of the veil and say to him, "Brother Joseph, 'I tried to hold in remembrance your life, your
ministry, and your death."</p>
<p>And he also spoke of meeting once again with his grandfather and father.  "I hope I may meet my
grandfather," President Hinckley said, "and say, 'I've walked where you walked on the streets of
Nauvoo.  I hope I can meet my father and say, 'I went to Nauvoo where you made such great
effort to rebuild the temple and have fulfilled your dream and the dreams of thousands who lived
here, who worked here."</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, my heart is full as I think of the events of these last few years.  My love
for the Prophet and those early saints has multiplied as I reflect on the deprivations they
experienced, and the sacrifices they made.</p>
<p>What those faithful members of the Church must have felt as they looked back upon that
wonderful edifice for the final time, is almost beyond my ability to grasp.</p>
<p>What I felt as I heard the prophet of our day dedicate this new edifice--158 years to the exact
hour that Joseph and Hyrum gave up their lives as a testament to their work--to the Lord and in
memory of those wonderful Saints is beyond my ability to describe.</p>
<p>I wish to leave with you my love for those who have gone before and encourage you to learn of
these events and people and develop within yourselves a love for these great souls of the early
Church.  As we understand the faith of our fathers and remember the depth of convictions that
inspired them to give all that they had--their very lives if necessary--I trust that it will lift us as
well.  May the example of these great pioneers infuse us with new energy and new fervor.</p>
<p>Finally, I urge you to never give up hope.  This student body and indeed the entire Church is
filled with hope.  Hope in the future.  Hope in the promise of life.  Hope that life will continue
after death and hope that that life will be greater and grander than anything we can imagine.  To
be happy, we must hope.  We must be able to look at the darkness that, at times, surrounds us and
know that on the other side of grief, on the other side of despair, on the other side of desperation,
there is hope.</p>
<p>There will be times in this life when we look back upon tragedy.  We may look back across our
own individual river at the remains of what we have loved and lost.  More than likely, every one
of us will have to pass through periods of trial and suffering.</p>
<p>As those early Saints could not see into the future and into the glory that would once again dawn
upon that beloved city, so too, often we cannot see the light and promise the Lord has in store for
us after the storms of life has passed.</p>
<p>We live in historic times, my beloved brethren and sisters.  The rebuilding of the temple at
Nauvoo and its rededication earlier this year was an event of significance on earth as in heaven.  </p>
<p>I believe that on that day, many of those faithful, early Saints were with us in the city they so
dearly loved.  I believe that multitudes on earth as well as in heaven embraced and shed tears of
joy.  I believe that the hosannas we shouted to the glory of our Heavenly Father ascended to the
heavens and were enjoined by the hosts of heaven.  </p>
<p>Never forget that the Lord has His hand in all things.  As long as you are faithful, prayerful, and
strive to follow His prophet on earth, the Lord will never forget you or forsake you.  As the Lord
cares about His temple, He cares about you.</p>
<p>I know that the Savior lives and directs this work.  During his life, Joseph Smith was close to the
Savior;  particularly during the months leading up to his martyrdom.  The Prophet was taught
every detail of ordinance work in the temple and he, in turn taught every detail to those who
would take upon themselves the mantle of leadership after his death.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith was a great prophet of our Heavenly Father and we are led today by another great
man--President Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
<p>It is my prayer that you will make of your lives a temple worthy of habitation by the Holy Spirit
and that you will muster the faith and courage to stand shoulder to shoulder with those great and
faithful souls who, with the Prophet Joseph Smith, brought about the great day of Restoration, in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">As we approached this beautiful campus today, as we observed the manicured lawns and gardens,
and as we beheld the eager students within and without this magnificent structure, the words of
the Apostle Peter, spoken to the Lord Jesus Christ at an earlier time and in a far-away place,
described the feelings of my heart: "Lord, it is good for us to be here."&nbsp;
    </p>
<p> Our opportunity today is
to give to this multi-purpose and sparkling new building a name and to offer a prayer of
dedication.  I am honored by President Gordon B. Hinckley to have this singular privilege.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
During the earthly mission of the Lord, He frequently spoke of house building.  He declared, "A
house divided against itself shall not stand." Later He cautioned, "Behold, mine house is a house
of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion."&nbsp;</p>
<p> In a revelation given through the
Prophet Joseph Smith at Kirtland, Ohio, on December 27, 1832, the Master counseled, "Organize
yourselves; prepare every needful thing: and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of
fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Well could it be said today that this house, this structure in which we meet, has been completed
following such a blueprint which outlines its very purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  The words of the Apostle Paul,
spoken to the Corinthians, lifts all of us to an even higher plateau of thinking: "Know ye not that
ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you."&nbsp;</p>
<p> All that has gone into the
planning and completion of this structure is guided by this very purpose -- the acquiring of a firm
testimony of the Gospel and living the teachings of our Lord and Savior.  It was said of Him that
he "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." Another passage gives us
a never-failing guide: He "went about doing good, for God was with him."&nbsp;</p>
<p> With these thoughts
coursing through our minds, it is fitting that the structure will now bear the name, "Gordon B.
Hinckley Building." It is a comfortable fit -- for President Hinckley is a man of prayer, a man of
fasting, a man of faith, a man of learning, a man of glory, a man of order, a man of God.  He too
has devoted his long and fruitful life to doing good, and God is surely with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  In your studies,
you may learn of one Sir Thomas More, an English statesman and author of an earlier period who
was steadfast in cleaving unto his beliefs.  A book and a film tell the story of his life.  It is
entitled "A Man for All Seasons." Today, amidst the conflicts of our time and the turbulence of
our seasons, we reach out for one such.  Our Heavenly Father, knowing our need, has provided
for us "a man for all seasons." His name is President Gordon B. Hinckley.  He is our prophet,
seer and revelator.  He is an island of calm in a sea of storm.  He is as a lighthouse to the mariner
who is lost.  He is your friend and my friend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  A hero in the life of President Hinckley is his
father, Bryant S. Hinckley.  I became acquainted with Bryant S. Hinckley when he authored a
classic volume, "Faith of Our Pioneer Fathers." I was involved in its printing.  As with his father
before him, President Hinckley reflects the title of this splendid book and exemplifies the faith of
his pioneer fathers and mothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  It was my privilege to know and love President Hinckley long
before either of us was called to the Council of the Twelve, where through the years I sat next to
him, served with him and learned from him.  I am a witness to his prophetic calling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  This
campus, this faculty, this student body, this community, and this church are blessed to have this
building and the name it bears.  Fitting is its location, on an eminence seen from a distance.  It
beckons, "Come and learn.  Come and learn to serve.  Come to learn and serve and to love the
Lord our God and our neighbor as ourselves."&nbsp;</p>
<p> Time does not permit more than a mention of
President Hinckley's numerous accomplishments.  But a capsule view of his presidency reveals:
A worldwide expansion of Church membership; temples which dot the lands and bless the
people; the magnificent Conference Center; humanitarian efforts which relieve hunger, poverty,
and suffering; and the Perpetual Education Fund, which enables young people to break the cycle
of poverty from whence they come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Since all who would wish to greet President Hinckley
personally cannot come to him, President Hinckley goes worldwide to them.  He is a prophet to
the people.  Not neglected are the children who flock to his side, nor does he neglect the parents
of these precious ones.  And the best is yet to come, for under President Hinckley's direction, the
technology of our age will be utilized to permit millions throughout the world to hear his words,
see his countenance, receive his teachings and feel his spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  I express appreciation to President
Hinckley for the privilege to serve with him and with President Faust in the First Presidency.  I
am so grateful that Marjorie Pay Hinckley, President Hinckley's eternal companion, and many of
their family members are present here today.  It is a day of rejoicing; it is a day ever to be
remembered; it is a day of dedication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Long years ago I read and remembered a line which
appealed to me and which I share with you today: "What the world needs are fewer critics and
more models to follow." Such a model God has provided us for our day and for our time -- even
President Gordon B. Hinckley.  Let us follow him, for I know he follows our Heavenly Father
and His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  As we now bow our heads and close our eyes, I
will offer the dedicatory prayer:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayer of Dedication</p>
<p>  Our beloved Father in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.  We
assemble before Thee this day for the purpose of expressing our gratitude to Thee for this
beautiful edifice of learning and worship and all that it means to Thy children who will study to
gain knowledge and who will worship that they may be close to Thee and Thy beloved Son.  Let
those who shall teach here do so with Thy guiding spirit as a constant companion.  May doubt be
dispelled.  May faith provide that shining light which will fill minds and souls with truth eternal.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
Please bless the administration, the faculty, the students and all who contribute in their respective
ways to Brigham Young University- Idaho.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  May all recognize that they walk on hallowed
ground when entering this building.  May each one appreciate the past, contemplate the future,
and work diligently in the present to Thy name's honor and glory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  May Thy holy hand protect
these facilities, that no untoward incident may deface or destroy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Heavenly Father, we invoke
Thy blessings to attend President Gordon B. Hinckley, whose name this building will bear.  We
know that he is a prophet for our time.  His entire life has prepared him for this dynamic period
of worldwide growth of the Church.  He is a man of gifted intellect, a man of capacity, a man of
compassion.  His life itself is a legacy to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  With gratitude in our hearts, we dedicate
this, the Gordon B. Hinckley Building, including the chapel, gymnasium, multi-purpose area, the
kitchens and the numerous classrooms.   We dedicate the grounds which enhance the building's
beauty and which reflect Thy handiwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  The words of Thy prophet President Hinckley seem
appropriate as part of this prayer of dedication.  He said, "What is really important is that this is
the work of the Master, and our work is to go about doing good, as did He."&nbsp;</p>
<p> May we do as Thy
prophet has asked, dear Father, is our united prayer, which I offer through the authority of the
Holy Priesthood and in the name of Thy beloved Son, even Jesus Christ, our Saviour and
Redeemer, in His holy name -- the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Thank you very much, President Monson, for your very generous words. Thank you, all of you, for your attendance here today. I am grateful to be with you.</p>
<p>President Monson, Elder Eyring, President Bednar, all of you distinguished guests, faculty and students, what a great and singular honor you do me. When President Bednar proposed the naming of this building to the Board of Trustees where I serve as chairman, I was simply flummoxed. (See if you know what that word means.) I did not know what to say. I was taken by surprise. I was stunned. I simply said in the language peculiar to the lawyers, "I recuse myself."  I turned to President Monson, and said, "You run the meeting."</p>
<p>Someone once asked Abraham Lincoln how it felt to be president. He replied, "Well now, it feels sort of like the fellow they run out of town on a rail. If it wasn't for the honor of it, I'd just as soon walk!"</p>
<p>I feel I can honestly say that I had no desire for such an honor as you have accorded me. It had never crossed my mind. I did not seek it, but I am deeply grateful for your great kindness in extending it to me. The name of this building will be a constant reminder to me to live worthy of the trust that you have placed in me and a reminder to my posterity that someone honored their forebear and in so doing brought a sacred trust to those who carry his name.</p>
<p>President Monson and President Bednar have taken the time now. That is about enough for one day. But I am told that I am expected to say something. I will try to keep it brief and to the point.</p>
<p>I wish to speak to the students of this great institution. I have a granddaughter who is among them. </p>
<p>Something remarkable is happening on this campus. You may not be entirely aware of it. It was a very long time in coming. Many years ago its destiny was debated very hotly. Some wanted to make of this a four-year school and move it to Idaho Falls. They very strongly argued for their wish. But the Board of Trustees, after listening to everyone who had anything to say, concluded to leave Ricks in Rexburg and continue it as a two-year college. It has thus gone on until two years ago. The announcement that came in the year 2000 was bold and, I believe, prophetic. It came of a desire to offer to the good young people of this Church, in larger numbers, the great privilege of attending and graduating from a Church university. By moving from two years to four years this could be accomplished.</p>
<p>It happened at the time that President Bednar was in office. There may be others, but I do not know of anyone else who could have overseen and brought about the miracle that has occurred on this campus. I assure you that it is a miracle.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful that the Ricks family showed no resentment over the change of the name. It is a tribute to them and a recognition of their great faithfulness as Latter-day Saints. Well they might have wished that the school continue under the name of their worthy forebear, Thomas E. Ricks. But it was thought that recognition of the school might be further enhanced by carrying the BYU badge. I believe the wisdom of that has been shown.</p>
<p>A willingness to give up intercollegiate athletics is much appreciated. I remind you that it is not unique for a first-class university to get along without an intercollegiate athletic program. If you wish to regard this as a sacrifice, then take satisfaction from the fact that you are willing to make such a sacrifice. As a matter of fact, I attended the BYU football game last Saturday and almost came to the conclusion that they could get along without an intercollegiate athletic program.</p>
<p>To the faculty who were willing to make adjustments and have given up some treasured prerogatives in that process, I extend my sincere thanks. I hope, I pray, that you are finding greater happiness and increased excitement in the new status which has come to the school.</p>
<p>To the people of Rexburg, I believe you will benefit from this change and I hope that all will unite to assist in this process, realizing that in the presence of this university in this city you have an immense treasure and an institution worthy of your support in all it undertakes to do. </p>
<p>To President Bednar, my sincere thanks again for your herculean efforts, and to Sister Bednar, who has worked with you in this remarkable undertaking, I express deep gratitude.</p>
<p>To the Board of Trustees who embraced the suggestion that we make the effort to go forward with this transition and who have wholeheartedly done everything possible to assist, I express my thanks.</p>
<p>And finally, to the faithful tithe payers throughout the world whose consecrations have made this possible, I express my most sincere appreciation.</p>
<p>Brigham Young University-Provo has become a truly great institution (in everything but football), now recognized across the nation for the quality of the education it provides, for the strength of its faculty, and for its unique and large student body. It is a credit to the Church and will continue to be so.</p>
<p>BYU-Hawaii is doing a wonderful work and is accomplishing great things as it goes forward in training thousands of students on its beautiful campus. </p>
<p>And now, BYU-Idaho has become the third institution of growing strength under this unique BYU trilogy of great institutions of learning.</p>
<p>The Church has spent many millions in rebuilding the campus. It has spent these sacred funds to bless the lives of you students who come here. I hope you are grateful. I recognize that it is still costly to attend this university, but it is far less costly than it would be almost anywhere else.</p>
<p>I see a great future for this institution. It will go forward under inspired leadership. It will grow in strength under a dedicated and able faculty. It will be increasingly recognized as its graduates move out across the world and fill positions of responsibility.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>I know this because this is an institution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is well defined. That mission is to impart secular knowledge in a first-class manner while building faith in the Eternal God and His Risen Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This Church will never fail. Jesus Christ stands at its head. And just as it will never fail, neither will its institutions and programs.</p>
<p>This university will succeed in a wonderful manner. It will take its place among the great learning facilities of our nation as we who have some attachment to it walk and work in faith. That I believe with all my heart and pray that that day will come, as it surely will. </p>
<p>Now, I think we have time and I think I would just like to put away what I have prepared and say a few words further extemporaneously on this occasion to the student body.</p>
<p>First, I want to tell you that I love you. I love you kids, you wonderful young people of this Church. I love you. I believe you are the best generation this Church has ever had. No generation which has gone before measures up to the stature to which you measure up. You are better educated. I think you have greater faith I think you have shown that faith and are showing that faith than any other previous generation. I am so thankful for you. I thank you for your strength; for your willingness to do the right thing; for your desire to serve the Lord; for your capacity to help build the kingdom; for the fact that you get on your knees and say your prayers, as I know you do; for the fact that you pray to the Lord to help you, to guide you in the things you do, as I know you do.</p>
<p>God bless you for what you are and who you are.</p>
<p>Now, don't ever do a cheap or a tawdry or a mean or an evil thing, my dear young friends. You don't have to engage in these things. The world is on a slippery slide, it is going downhill and it is going fast. And you are as a beacon on a hill young people of rectitude and virtue and decency and goodness. Remain that way. Do not destroy your effectiveness. Do not become involved in any kind of behavior which would destroy you, injure you, hurt you, debilitate you in any way whatever. You don't have to do those things. You can stand above them. You must stand above them! The world will look to you as the years pass, of that I have no doubt whatever. For if it continues to go in the direction in which it is going, the disparity between the world and this Church will grow and lengthen and we will become more and more of a peculiar people.</p>
<p>Now, be faithful, be true, go forward, be ambitious. Don't short-circuit yourself. Don't stop now. Keep growing. Keep going. Educate your minds and your spirits and never lose sight of the fact that you are a child of God with a divine destiny and capability of doing great and good and wonderful things. Don't sell yourselves short. Don't cheapen yourselves. You know who you are. Each of you knows that you are a child of God and that your Heavenly Father expects something great and noble and good of you.</p>
<p>The Lord bless you, my dear young friends. As I look into your faces, I see the future. Keep the faith. You will marry. You will have children. You will have grandchildren. You will go out and do the work of this world, but maintain your integrity. Be honest. Be good. Be decent. Be prayerful and the God of heaven will smile upon you and bless you, and give happiness in your hearts and a sense of peace in your lives.</p>
<p>I wish for you nothing but the best. You are so choice and so wonderful and the future is so great that you can't afford to betray yourselves in anyway or to do anything less than that which each of you is capable of accomplishing. You don't have to be a genius. You don't have to be a straight-A student. You just have to do your very best with all the capability you have. You have to do your very best. And somehow, if you do that, God will open the way before you and the sun will shine, and your lives will be fruitful and you will accomplish great good in the world in which you take a part. I couldn't wish for you anything better as I look into your faces this day. </p>
<p>May heaven smile upon you. May you be blessed. May you be happy. May you have joy in your lives. May your tears be few and your smiles many as you go forward with your lives is my humble prayer as I stand before you and express unto you my love for you and my confidence in you and my hope for you and my prayer for you. You are the very fiber of this Church and this Church will grow as its young people the young people of this generation magnify their callings and go forward and serve the Lord and live in loyalty toward Him. God bless you. </p>
<p>There is no end in sight for the good you can do. Do you know it? You are just simple kids. You are not geniuses. I know that. But the work of the world isn't done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary way people of your kind who can do these things. </p>
<p>I repeat. Don't sell yourselves short. You look in the mirror every morning when you boys get up to scrape off the fuzz, and the girls get up to put on the paint you look into the mirror and say "I can do the right thing today, God being my helper. And I will do it."</p>
<p>Heaven bless you is my humble prayer for you.</p>
<p>To this good faculty who are here, I would like to say a word to you. Help these young people. I know you do. But reach a little lower to lift them a little higher. Be kind and generous and helpful and patient and encouraging. Do all that you can to stand before them as examples, teaching them the things, the disciplines that you are called upon to teach. But while doing so, stand before them as examples of faith and faithfulness and rectitude and goodness, I humbly pray.</p>
<p>God bless this great institution. May heaven smile upon it and all who come here and use it. May its name be spread for good across the earth as good men and women, educated here and going forth to serve, stand with honesty and integrity before the world as men and women of faith and accomplishment and goodness and integrity, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I am told that the majority of the student body are in the age range of 18 to 19.  I have
been thinking of you and endeavoring to place my mind into your circumstances, to see
from your perspective.  I have prayerfully sought to say things here today that will be of
help to you, that will be relevant to you.  Although this is a challenge for a man who is so
much older, don't "<strong><em>turn off"</em></strong> too quickly.  Consider the truth that at one time I was where
you now are -  that I was once <em><u>seeing <strong>life</strong></u></em> through the eyes of an 18 year old.  However,
although you have experienced much in your years,  <strong><u>you</u></strong> have never <em><u>seen</u></em> <strong><em><u>life</u></em></strong> through the
eyes of a 75 year old.  It is my prayer that these 56 years of additional experience will
have provided me with some <strong><u>insights</u></strong> and <strong><u>lessons</u></strong> and <strong><u>perspectives,</u></strong> that will be a
blessing to you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I am told that there are over 3,600 students on this campus who are <em><u>returned
missionaries</u></em>.  I have been thinking of you as well.  Missions and mission life has been an
important part of my life.  First, as a 16 year old, when my father was called to preside
over the East Central States Mission, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.  Next, after
my military service in the Navy, I served as a missionary in Virginia and North Carolina. 
In 1973 my wife and family of nine children were called to preside in the Missouri
Independence Mission.  More recently, as a General Authority, in Area Presidency
assignments, we toured many missions in the U. S. and in the Europe North Areas.  I
desire this to be relevant to you missionaries as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have determined that I will ask each of you, all who hear my voice, myself included, to
personally, and privately, respond to this question:  <strong><em><u>Where in the world am I?</u></em></strong>   The
answer <strong>we</strong> need to study is not one of geography - we know Idaho,  we know Rexburg, ,
we know Taylor Chapel and Kirkham Auditorium  and Manwaring Center.   The answer
we need cannot be found by Satellite locators.   We need to know <strong><em><u>Where we stand in the
World of Ideas!</u></em></strong>   With <strong><em>introspect and with honesty</em></strong> we must make this determination.  
This is done by careful and objective examination of,  <strong><em><u>Where, in Me,  is the World?</u></em></strong>   
18 year olds,  Returned Missionaries, 75 year olds, we <u>all</u> need to open our awareness to
see the areas where, <strong>"<em>the ideas of the  world</em></strong>" have been affecting our attitudes, have
<strong><em>intruded</em></strong>  into our lives..</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let us start by reviewing a few scriptures.  1 John 2:15-16.  <em>"Love not the <strong>world</strong>, neither,
the things of the <strong>world</strong>.  If any man love the <strong>world</strong>, the love of the Father is not in him. 
For all that is in the <strong>world</strong> - the <u>lust of the flesh</u>, and the <u>lust of the eyes</u>, and the <u>pride of
life</u> - is not of the Father, but is of the <strong>world.</strong>"</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">John identifies these three attributes as being of the world.  <strong>(First)</strong> <strong><u>the lust of the flesh</u></strong>.  I
read this to be referring to sexual appetites.  Is this common in our society?  Is this not a
most prominent theme coming out of the so called,  <em><u>world of</u></em><u> <em>Entertainment</em></u><em>?</em>  Do you see
it evidenced in printed media?  Do you see it's influence in fashion and dress?   I submit
that it <u>surrounds</u> us, that it is almost <strong><em>everywhere present.</em></strong> <strong>(Second)</strong> <strong><u>the lust of the eyes.</u></strong>  
I read this to be referring to coveting.  Coveting is defined as "<em><u>desiring something that
you don't have, something that belongs to another</u>".</em>  If you think about it, is not  the basis
for most, if not all, of the advertising to which we are exposed?  The advertiser tries to
make his product appear to you to be <em><u>irresistible</u></em>.  Again, this attribute is <strong><em>everywhere
present</em></strong>  and to some degree is affecting each of our lives.  <strong>(Third) <u>and the pride of life.</u></strong>  
Prophets through the ages have warned us against <em>pride.</em>  President Ezra Taft Benson
gave a stirring and definitive sermon entitled,  <em><u>Beware of Pride</u>.</em>  He declared it as <strong>being
<em>"the universal sin"</em></strong><em>.</em>  He said that there is no such thing as <em><u>righteous pride</u>.</em>  He warned
that it was <em>pride</em> that destroyed the peoples of the Book of Mormon.  He said that this
important message of the Book of Mormon <strong><em>is a warning to us</em></strong>, and further he declared,<em>
<strong>"I know the Lord wants this message delivered <u>now</u>".</strong></em>
(April General Conference, 1989).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We must each objectively consider ourselves and determine to what degree pride is
affecting our willingness to be "meek and submissive".  Mosiah teaches that <strong><em>meekness
and submissiveness</em></strong> are essential.  They are the opposite of pride. (Mosiah 3:19)   There are
many whose level of  <strong><em>submissiveness,  of meekness, </em></strong> are suffering as the result of  <strong><em><u>pride</u>; </em></strong>
be it <u>conscious pride</u>, or <u>unconscious prideful attitudes</u>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If these three characteristics are in truth: <em>"..not of the Father, but... of the world" </em> then to
the degree we possess them, we have identified,  <em>"Where, in <strong><u>me</u></strong></em>, is the World."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note other cautions from John. <em>"But I have chosen you out of the <strong>world</strong>, therefore the
<strong>world</strong> hateth you" </em> (John 15:19).<em>  "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the
<strong>world,</strong> but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil"  </em>(John 17:15). The Lord designed
this mortal life for his Spirit Children, to confront us with the challenge of making
choices, between good and evil.  We are here, in this <strong><em>estate,</em></strong> to be tested and to be proven. 
As described in <em> "Â…to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord, their God, shall
command them" </em>(Abraham 3:25).<em> </em> To the obedient the Lord promises, <em>"Â…glory added
upon their heads for ever and ever" </em>(Abraham 3:26).<em>  He that <u>loveth</u> his life shall lose it;
and he that <u>hatet</u>h his life in this <strong>world,</strong> shall keep it unto life eternal.</em>( John 12:25).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I ask that you review yourselves on the question, <em>"<u>Where do you stand on some of the
common and popular ideas of the World</u>?" </em>  For example, on <strong><em>conformity vs. diversity,</em></strong>   
on <strong><em>freedom of choice</em></strong>, on <strong><em>rights</em></strong>.   I ask you to consider if there are <strong><em>wrongs against God's
commandments,  </em></strong>which are<strong><em> </em></strong>being committed today, in the name of and under the
innocuous   label of,  <strong><em>rights</em></strong> ?   I ask you to consider carefully the very popular concept
that everything is <strong><em><u>relative</u></em></strong>,  that there are no <strong><em>absolutes.</em></strong>  Many today <strong><em>rationalize</em></strong> that there
is nothing that is always and absolutely wrong, just as there is nothing that is always and
absolutely right.  They argue that there are no <strong><em><u>verities</u></em></strong>.  The dictionary defines <strong><em><u>verities</u></em></strong> as
being, "<u>a permanent truth</u>".    They say that everything is to be judged relative to its time
and circumstance and by the opinion of the majority.  I testify to you that there is danger
in this, that there is subtlety and deception in progress.  I testify that there <u>are</u> <strong><em><u>verities.</u></em></strong> 
Our creator, the creator of Heaven and of Earth, our Eternal Father,  God,  does not
change according to the reasoning and <em><u>rationalizations</u></em> of man's mind.   He did not give
to Moses and to His children, <strong><em>"The Ten Suggestions"</em></strong><em>.</em>    In His infinite wisdom, and in 
love for His children, He gave <strong><em>"The Ten Commandments"</em></strong><em>.</em>   He has never rescinded nor
altered them.  He does not permit us to modify or interpret them  according to the
circumstances of our time or popular opinions of the day.  Knowing that every one
coming to earth will make mistakes, will sin, he has provided us with the principle of
<em><u>repentance</u></em>.  He has provided us with a Savior, who is His Only Begotten, Jesus Christ.  
It is he who has made the Atoning Sacrifice, whereby we can correct our mistakes and
receive forgiveness.  In the vast Eternal Plan of Happiness it is our <strong><em>mortality</em></strong> that is
intended as the great <em><u>testing</u></em> and <em><u>growing</u></em> experience which will prepare us for an <strong><em><u>eternal
life of joy.</u></em></strong>  In contrast, a mortal life consisting of  <strong><em><u>fun</u>, or "<u>doing our own thing</u>",</em></strong>  will
not accomplish God's purposes.  Here is a vivid example.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There was a 17 year old boy who lived in this world many years ago.  Some aspects of <strong><em><u>his</u></em></strong>
world were very different than ours.  He was born in 1745 BC, when his father was 91
years of age.  He was number 11 of the 12 sons of Jacob - his name was <strong><em>Joseph</em></strong>. 
Joseph's mother died giving birth to Joseph's younger brother Benjamin.  Unlike you,
Joseph never saw a television screen.  He attended no college classes nor did he surf the
web.  The conditions of his life were very different than anyone of you here.  Conditions
of his family relationships were also different, although it is possible that <u>some of these</u>
may exist for individuals today.  He had 10 half brothers and several "step mothers". 
Being number 11 of the 12 boys in the family, he was near the bottom of the '<em><u>pecking
order'</u></em> among his siblings.  To make it even harder for him, from his birth, his father had
designated that Joseph was his favored son. This was a mixed blessing for Joseph.  On
the one hand he had special tutoring and closeness to his father, but at the same time, the
older boys were fired with <em><u>envy and jealousy</u></em>.   Their mothers were likewise driven. 
There had been no tender arms of a mother to comfort Joseph or to protect him. If his
father was busy managing business affairs and his large family, Joseph was on his own. 
Life for him had some of the characteristics of  a "<u>broken home</u>".  By today's standards, a
Social Worker might conclude that Joseph was an "<strong><u>abused child</u></strong>".</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have prepared three clips from a movie made in Hollywood, entitled  <strong>Joseph.</strong>  These
short snippets will give you a little more of the <em><u>realism</u></em> of Joseph's circumstances.  It
starts with a 3-minute segment describing Joseph after his brothers had cast him into the
<u>pit.</u>  His cries are mournful, he pleads with his brothers to <em><u>help him</u></em>.  Notice their attitudes
and their <strong><em>rationalizations</em></strong> in dealing with the dilemma they found themselves in.  They
could neither agree to kill him nor could they agree to set him free.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For this 17 year old,  to have been <em><u>brutalized</u></em> by his own brothers and then sold by them
into a life of slavery, might have appeared to Joseph to be a fate worse than death.  Think
of his plight, dropping from the status of <em><u>favored son</u></em> in a noble house, to being a <em><u>slave</u></em>,
mere chattel.  It would cause anyone to <u>despair</u>.  It would challenge anyone's faith in a
living, loving God.  Compounding that,  Joseph was taken a great distance from his
home, with no hope of ever returning.  He was taken to a <u>Pagan</u> land.  His only hope for
survival was to work earnestly to please his master and hopefully to avoid his wrath; 
with luck, to enjoy the meager "perks" that a satisfied master might bestow on a faithful
slave.  Joseph's  17 years of knowing love and the religious teachings of his father were at
this point,  to him, as if from <em><u>another world</u></em>.  He might well of asked,  "What has
happened to me?".  <strong><em>"Where In The World Am I ?</em></strong><em>"  </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And then, <em>'the plot thickens'</em>, as they say.  I calculate that Joseph was in this condition for
approximately 10 years. Think of ten years in your life, at your age, it could appear to be a
lifetime. Many of the most important things that will happen in your entire life will
happen in those 10 years.  During those pivotal years for Joseph, in that hostile
environment, he demonstrated managerial skills that won him favor with his master. 
During those years he also attracted the eye and captured the fancy of his master's wife. 
She, <strong><em>"lusted after the flesh"</em></strong><em>,</em> as John expresses it.  If <strong><em><u>relativism,</u></em></strong>  if man's reasoning, if
circumstances, could warrant a change from "<strong><u>Commandment</u></strong>" to "<strong><u>Suggestion</u></strong>", then
surely Joseph could qualify himself.  After all, she too was his master.  His duty was to
obey and to do what she commanded.  Disobedience could mean his death.  He might
have  <strong><em><u>rationalized</u></em></strong>  that what she asked would be an <em>indiscretion</em> against some teachings
given him in his youth, in another time,  <em><u>in another world</u></em>.  It was that <u>world</u> that had
rejected him, had discarded him. Why should he continue to regard it?  He might have
<strong><em><u>rationalized</u></em></strong>, "It is a small thing she asks, in comparison with what handsome rewards she
could and would bestow upon me, in <strong><em>this</em></strong> <strong><em>world,</em></strong> in which I am now living."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After having endured and rejected her pleadings, her commands, for an extended time, he
was forced to act.  She caught hold of him.  Notice his response.  His words ring with
power and inspiration, they are classic.  He said, speaking of his master, <strong><u>"<em>Â…neither hath
he kept any thing back from me, but thee, because thou art his wife:  how then can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God</em></u><em>?</em> </strong>  He defines it.  She was asking Joseph to
both <strong><em>betray</em></strong> <strong><em>the trust of his master</em></strong>, and to <strong><em>sin against his God</em></strong><em>.</em>  In spite of all the
adversities that he had suffered, in spite of his being separated those many years, the
religious teachings of his youth and his integrity remained <strong>strong</strong> and <strong>firm.</strong> 
Wonderfully, <strong><em>There were some parts of his World, that he had <u>not allowed</u> to be in him.</em></strong> 
 But his test continues.  Potiphar's wife made false accusations and Joseph was cast into a
horrible prison.  There he languished for over <strong>two </strong>very long and painful <strong>years</strong>. 
Abandoned and rejected, first by his <u>family</u>, and now, <u>undeservedly,</u> <u>by his</u> <u>maste</u>r. 
Listen to his anguished cries</font></p>
<p> <strong><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Oh God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?"</font></em></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I insert here a statement that gives us <u>perspective</u>.  <strong><em>"<u>What to the caterpillar, is the end of
the world, the Creator calls a Butterfly</u>."</em></strong>  Remember this during your <strong>trials</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An objective observer could conclude at this point, that Joseph's <strong>integrity</strong> and his
<strong>obedience</strong> to the commandments of his God,  had caused his conditions to worsen.  Now
in his late twenties, he had dropped from being a trusted slave in the house of his master,
to being a helpless, hopeless, <u>prisoner,</u> in a filthy prison..  To his questioning at this point
of, <strong><em>Where In The World Am  I?,</em></strong>  Joseph might rightly conclude,  <strong><em>"About as low as one
can get".</em></strong>    However to the question of, <strong><em>Where, in <u>me</u>, is the World?</em></strong>,  observe that he
has bravely resisted, "<strong><em>the attitudes of the world</em></strong>."  Regardless of his circumstances, he has
been true to those standards, which are the <strong><em><u>verities</u></em></strong>.   He has shown himself to be as one
spoken of by John.  <em>"But I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth
you.  <u>John 15:19</u></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And now he faces the third big test.  After abandonment and rejection, after betrayal and
the filthy hopeless prison, Joseph is challenged with wealth and success.  You might
wonder how these conditions could be a challenge.  He has been miraculously catapulted
from the depths of prison to the heights of the <u>World</u> in which he lived; which was the
great kingdom of Egypt.  He becomes second only to the <u>Pharaoh</u>, in authority and in
wealth and in power.  It was an <em><u>unbelievable transformation</u></em>.  He is at this time 30 years
of age.  He has been completely separated from his family for 13 years.  It is interesting to
note the <strong><em><u>dichotomy.</u></em></strong>   It was his unyielding faith in the teachings of his God that sent him
to prison.  It was also his unrelenting faith in his God, that had opened the windows of
<u>inspiration</u> and <u>vision</u>, which thereby first opened the doors of the prison and then the
heart of the Pharaoh and ultimately the kingdom's treasury.   It was the <strong>faith</strong>, Joseph had
learned as a youth, at his father's knee, which was planted so deeply that, <strong><em>"the things of
the world",</em></strong> could not dislodge it.  Regardless of  "<em><u>Where in the world he was</u>",</em> regardless
of what adversities the world threw at him, his faith remained anchored and <strong><u>the</u></strong> <strong><u>World
was not in him</u></strong>.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Joseph's final and ultimate victory came in the way he received his brothers.  All 11 of
them had come to Egypt to buy food from the only available source.  Their families were
facing starvation in Canaan from the extended period of drought..  Their lives were in his
hands.  Listen to this last segment and feel the emotion when the most powerful man in
all Egypt, save only for Pharaoh himself, stood before the brothers who had endeavored 
to destroy him.  Can you imagine a more <u>poignant moment</u> for <u>revenge</u>, for <u>satisfaction</u>?  
Can you imagine the trauma in the heart of Reuben or of Judah, of all the "brothers",  as
he first announces to them,  <strong><em>"<u>I am Joseph, I am your brother</u>."</em></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em>Vengeance, anger, retribution</em></strong>, these were warranted, according to <u>the standards of the
world,</u> in consequence for what Joseph had suffered at their hands. In contrast, Joseph
said,  <strong><em>"Fear not, for am I in the place of God?"</em></strong>   He could see, then, how he had been a
<strong>trusted instrument</strong> in the hand of God, to literally save his family and following
generations.  He had been so refined in this '<u>fiery furnace</u>' that he became <em><u>worthy</u></em> to be
the <em><u>father</u></em> of the tribe of<strong> Ephraim.</strong>  Here, in this audience today, there are many of you
who have received Patriarchal Blessings.  With few exceptions you have been told that
you are of the <strong>Tribe of Ephraim</strong>.  That <em><u>prophetic declaration</u></em> means that this noble and
faithful <strong>Joseph,  is your father.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Having this in your mind, listen to this statement from the Washington Post about
families.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	How well we do is determined not just by our<br />
	Gifts and grit, but also by social background,<br />
	Network, <u>family connections</u> and - powerfully<br />
	By how well our <u>parents</u> did.<br />
	Life is not merely a <strong>footrace</strong>, but a <strong><em>relay race.<br />
</em></strong>	It matters a lot how much headway the previous<br />
	Runner has made when he hands you the baton.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><u>I want you to realize that the baton is now in your hand</u></strong><u>.</u>  Joseph ran a courageous
race.  Now, how much headway <strong><u>you</u></strong> make, with the <u>baton he has handed you,</u> will have
great consequence to the race your posterity will yet run.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">May I give one final illustration, regarding  <strong><em><u>verities or  standards</u>  and  <u>performance</u>.</em></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">President Spencer W. Kimball illustrated it very clearly with this demonstration.  As I
stated earlier - the <strong><u>Lord</u></strong> has set the standard.  It is <strong><u>we,</u></strong>  with our <strong><u>agency</u></strong>, that determine
the level of <strong><u>our</u></strong> performance.  When performance is below the level of <strong><u>His</u></strong> standards,
many will try to <u>justify</u> and <u>modify,</u>  to bring the <u>standards down</u> to their level of their
performance. The name for this is <strong><em><u>rationalizing</u>.</em></strong>   On the other hand, when we <strong>bring
our performance</strong> <u>up</u> to the level of  <strong><u>His</u></strong>  standards, this is called
<strong><em><u>repentance</u>.</em></strong>   The
second principle and ordinance of the gospel is <u>not</u><strong>,  rationalize</strong>.  Alma did not wish to be
an angel so that he could, <strong><em>"speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth,
and cry <u>rationalization</u>, unto every people" </em></strong>  (Alma 29:1).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><u>Our Challenge!</u></strong> : We must find something in our pattern of living, wherein the the ideas
of the <u>world</u> have entered in.  Review the commandments, avoiding <u>every
<strong><em>rationalization.</em></strong></u>.  They cover <u>Sabbath Day observance</u>.  They cover following <u>the gods of
money, of material things,</u> of <u>prestige</u>.  They cover moral issues of <u>honesty</u>, and of <u>sexual
purity and of pornography.</u>.  They cover <u>coveting</u>.  They cover <u>honoring father and
mother</u>.   Objectively review and discover where <strong><em> <u>the ideas of the world have infiltrated
you</u>.   </em></strong>There isn't a person whose life hasn't been  <strong><em><u>affected.</u></em></strong>.  Identify even a small one of
these and then determine to  <strong><em>NOTCH  UP.  </em><u>Raise your performance</u>.</strong>  Resist the
temptation to <strong><em><u>rationalize it away.</u></em></strong><u>.</u>  Exercise <u>faith unto repentance</u>.  Even from a very
small thing, in <strong><em>repentance </em></strong> you will find that you have increased power, you will feel a
<strong><u>spiritual strength</u></strong> and <strong><u>new joy</u></strong> in your life.  It is an experience you will want to repeat. 
<u>By so doing,</u> you will be growing closer to your Father in Heaven.  You will be <strong><u>rising</u></strong>. 
You will be passing with <u>honors</u>, the <u>tests</u> that qualify <strong><em><u>you</u></em></strong> and your <strong><em><u>posterity</u></em></strong>, to have,
"<strong><em>glory added upon your head forever and ever".  </em></strong></font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Today my husband, Ray, and I brought two grandsons with us to take a tour of your campus.  It
has been about three years since we last visited and the changes are remarkable. The campus is
remarkable. Your President and his wife are remarkable. You are remarkable.  Thank you so
much for inviting us to visit. I have been thinking about you and remembering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When I was near the age of some of you, (23), I was married and expecting our first baby. One
day as I was leaving the home of my husband's sister, we stood visiting on the back porch.  Her
oldest son came running up the stairs and in a breathless voice said, "What time is it?" His
mother stopped in mid-sentence, glanced at her watch and exclaimed, "Oh, I forgot, we're late for
Little League!" With all the indignation  a six year old could muster, her son replied, "Mother,
can't you be trusted?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I told this story to my daughter in Houston who has a son in first grade.  She said that Sean had
forgotten to take his books for library reading that day.  She debated whether to take them to him
at school.  His teacher is very strict and trying to teach the children to be responsible. Then she
said, "but he is trying so hard." Knowing the teacher may be critical of her intrusion she did
deliver the books.  Needless to say, Sean was so thrilled.  He wants to be responsible and he is
trying so hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Today I want to talk about the importance of trust because I believe it is the underlying ingredient
in the development of faith, the first principle of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do you remember when you were a little child how important it was to be with someone you
trusted? We count on others, often mothers and fathers, to keep us safe and to help make our
world turn out right. Our relationship with our parents and other family members helps us learn
to trust.  Missionaries are taught to build a relationship of trust with those who are being taught
the Gospel because faith grows best in an environment of trust. As we grow up and grow
spiritually we gradually learn to put our trust first in our Heavenly Father.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Today I would like to emphasize the importance of trust in three ways: First, learning to trust in
God; Second, living so that God trusts you; Third, living so that others trust you. When we talk
about trust, we must consider how we learn to Trust in God.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Recently I read an article in the Deseret News in which the writer stated that his work sometimes
put a dent in his optimism. You might say it put a dent in his ability to trust. Quoting the article
"Down the years people have disappointed me, deceived me. . .I remember the column I did
about a youth counselor who had a magical way with. . .youth. . .Two weeks later he was arrested
for selling drugs to the troubled teens he counseled.  I once raved on and on about a spiritual soul
who loved children. He ended up in the middle of an. . . abuse scandal. . ., the lesson I need to
learn is this:  Instead of praising people for being good, I should praise the source of all good
things and just love the people. . .It's what Jesus must have had in mind when he said, <em>"Why
callest thou me good?  There is none good but one, that is God." </em> (Mark 10:18) (Des. News
9/28/02, Jerry Johnston)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I liked that thought--Keep our eyes on the source of all goodness and love people.  That is the
key-- putting our trust in the source of all good, God our Heavenly Father and his son Jesus
Christ.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The scriptures give repeated counsel about trust:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	Trust in the Lord with all thine heart: and lean not unto thine own understanding.
(Proverbs 3:5)</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.  (Psalms 118:8)</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	. . .whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.  (Proverbs 16:20)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let's talk about how we develop this trust.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Turn to the Gospel of John, page 1334, Chapter 5. I will be referring to verses 32-39.  The Savior
is teaching about the importance of witnesses.  A witness would be someone we can trust. It
begins talking about John the Baptist, verse 32-34.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he
witnesseth of me is true.  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. But I
receive not testimony from man.  (John 5:33-34)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Joseph Smith translation explains as we read on in verse 34 that this is not the testimony of
man because John received his testimony from God and since John is a Prophet, we "ought to
receive his testimony."  But now look in verse 35, it suggests that we need more than a testimony
of someone else,</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	He was a burning and a shining light; and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his
light.  But I have greater witness than that of John: for the work which the Father hath
given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent
me. (John 5:35-36)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In other words John testified of what would happen and then it happened.  His works became a
second witness of his divinity.  But in the next verse he refers to the ultimate witness, <em>"And the
Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me."  </em> That is the third witness. But
now to the unbelievers he identifies the problem, <em>"Ye have neither heard his voice at any time,
nor seen his shape."</em>  Why have they not received this ultimate witness? <em>"And Ye have not his
word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not."</em>   In other words we have to
have a witness to the words that we have put inside of us. He gives us the solution in verse 39,
<em>"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of
me."</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are blessed by the testimony of others and we are strengthened by that light, but in case it
may last only for a "season," we must each develop a relationship of trust with our Heavenly
Father by our own experience--our own prayer, our scripture study and by listening to the witness
of the Holy Ghost as we apply what we learn.  What a thrill it was for me to be told that the
scriptures are a part of all you do at BYU-Idaho.  I was told you would have them with you today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The scriptures teach of individuals throughout time who put their trust in the Lord and have
become trustworthy by their actions. Would you turn to the Book of Enos on page 136 of the
Book of Mormon.  I turned to the Book of Enos at a time when I had a new calling that seemed
overwhelming. I had lost my husband.  I had a great deal to figure out.  I noticed as I read that
Enos had just lost his father and had been given the responsibility of keeping the plates. In the
words of Jacob, his father, on the preceding page, <em>". . .I told him </em>[Enos]<em> the things which my
brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands" </em> (Jacob
7:27).  Enos had made a commitment.  Perhaps he felt overwhelmed. He put his trust in the Lord
as we read in verse 2, <em>"And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I
received a remission of my sins."  </em> It didn't say he wrestled with the Lord, but he wrestled with
himself before the Lord. We don't know the nature of his sins, but perhaps he felt unworthy in
part because of his feelings of inadequacy.  In verse 4, we read <em>"And my soul hungered; and I
kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine
own soul;"  </em> In verse 5, <em>"And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven
thee, and thou shalt be blessed." </em> When Enos asked how this could be possible we read,
<em>"Because of thy faith in Christ, . . .thy faith hath made thee whole."</em>  Our Heavenly Father knows
when we are trying really hard. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, gave all, that his perfection might make
up the deficit where we fall short. Enos had his own experience in learning to trust in God. I had
my own experience as the spirit taught me how the atonement works in our lives. When we
accept the help the Savior provides we are free to be less concerned about our own problems or
imperfections and can turn our thoughts to the needs of others. This is what happened with Enos
when he said in verse 9, <em>"Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel
a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites." </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When Enos was proven to be trustworthy the Lord said, <em>"I will grant unto thee according to thy
desires, because of thy faith."</em> (Enos 1:12)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consider that promise, <em>"I will grant unto thee according to thy desires."</em>  I remember when I first
read about Nephi, the son of Helaman, and the Lord said in Chapter 10, verse 5 of Helaman, <em>"I
will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and deed, in faith and in works; yea,
even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word. . ."</em>  I thought, WOW,
wouldn't that be great to be so good that you could have anything you wanted, . . .but, you have
to read the next phrase, <em>"for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will."  </em> For us to have
such a promise we would have to understand our Heavenly Father's point of view. We would
have to live so that God trusts us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That brings us to the second part of my message--Living so that God trusts us.  A scripture stood
out as I considered my visit with you.  The words are in the short book of Nahum on page 1157
of the Old Testament. This is Chapter 1, verse 7. <em>"The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of
trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him."</em> Would you like to mark that verse in your
scriptures. Naham is speaking of the <em>"Second Coming, and of the mercy and power of the Lord."</em>
(Chapter heading) What an important message for us today. <em>"The Lord is good, a strong hold in
the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in Him."</em>  As we learn to trust God, we can
learn to live so that God knows he can trust us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In my hand is a new dollar bill.  Written on the back are the words, "In God We Trust." Those
words are also written on our coins. Is that how Heavenly Father knows that we trust in him? As
we circulate our money, we want everyone to know, "In God We Trust." We could send the
dollar to pay a tithe or even tuition, butwhat if a person chooses to go to an "R" rated movie, or
even purchase something illegal?  He still hands someone a bill with the words, "In God We
Trust." Our Heavenly Father's trust in us surely must come from more than a symbol or just
words.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Because trust is such a needed commodity in the world today, perhaps we can find ways to
improve our behavior and increase our Heavenly Father's trust in us. Could we be more
trustworthy?  We live in a land of freedom, a promised land and yet we would agree that we have
had our "day(s) of trouble." We need our Heavenly Father's help. Do we need to reaffirm to Him
our trust? He would want to know that we will do what he asks us to do. You students at this
University can be the leaders and needed example for our day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While living in San Francisco we had a Patriarch who had been a leader in the Church all of his
adult life--bishop and Stake President. I remember him saying on one occasion  that when he
pondered over names of those he felt the Lord would want to fill positions in the Ward or Stake,
he would always consider three questions: First, was the person worthy to be called. Second, was
a person able to do what was being asked--in other words was the person capable to do the job?
And third, would he do it?  He said that over time he learned that number three made the greatest
difference. Would he do it? If the person didn't do what the Lord called him to do, the other two
qualifications became less important.  Being trustworthy in our actions lets Heavenly Father
know that we can be trusted to do what we commit to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sometimes we may think if our excuses sound good enough, it let's us "off the hook," so to
speak. I once knew a Primary leader who asked, when teacher absences were a major problem,
"Would it make a difference if you told the Lord your excuses, and just told me your decisions?"
I am convinced that in most cases those who keep commitments have as many reasons for failure
as those who rely on excuses and fall short. President Hinckley has reminded us to try a little
harder.  He knows that our Heavenly Father wants the best for us which comes from doing our
best.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Someone once asked me what it was like to work with leaders at Church Headquarters.  I replied
that it was a luxury to work where people were so willing to do what was asked.  I also noticed
that responsible leaders show their commitment in all they do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I remember the first meeting I attended after I had been asked to serve on the Board of Trustees
for Church Education System. I was instructed very politely on two occasions that the meeting
always started on time and that I might like to come a little bit early.  I am usually fairly prompt,
but I didn't want to appear eager, so I timed myself carefully to walk into the board room about
five minutes to ten. As I walked in the door, five minutes early, everyone else was seated at that
long table and I heard President Hinckley say, "is Sister Hales coming?" Everyone else in that
room knew that although we may joke about Mormon standard time, in the Church
Administration Building they work on what I learned to call President Hinckley standard time. I
have never heard President Hinckley give a talk about being on time, but you may guess that I
was never again the last one to enter that room.  When I think of President Hinckley's example, it
reminds me how much it means to leaders, teachers and loved ones to be trusted to be at the
appointed place at the appointed time--and maybe even a little bit early!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When it comes to trust or being trusted, there are no unimportant items.  We become trustworthy
before the Lord as we practice and make corrections. Perhaps we make errors and need to be
taught. Perhaps we make mistakes and need to repent, but we want to let our Heavenly Father
know that He can count on us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It takes a great deal of spiritual maturity to let Heavenly Father know that we trust in his way.  He
has told us, <em>". . .my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, . . ."</em> (Isaiah
55:8)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I would like to refer to the example of Alma the younger. Turn to the Book of Alma, Chapter 29
on page 279.  Begin reading in verse 1  <em>"O That I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine
heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and
cry repentance unto every people!" </em> Now that is a pretty worthy desire. But what can we learn
from Alma as he recorded his thoughts and desires. I don't want to distract from the beautiful
missionary song, but Alma wasn't nineteen.  He was a noble prophet who had repented and been
converted in his youth; he had been a the first chief judge; he had given up the judgeship to teach
the gospel and had baptized hundreds. He had watched believers suffer death and had himself
been thrown into prison  It is understandable that he would wish for repentance and, <em>"that there
might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth."</em>  But, as Alma expressed this wish his
heart was softened and he showed trust in the Lord when he said, <em>"I am a man, and so sin in my
wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me."  "Yea, and
I know that good and evil have come before all men;. . why should I desire more than to perform
the work to which I have been called?"</em>  Even though his desires were otherwise, he was content
to show the Lord that he would accept His ways.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How much of our lives we waste wanting things to be other than they are. Do we sometimes
avoid the work at hand because we wish the circumstances were different?  Sometimes wanting
to be grand keeps us from being good.  We are bombarded by the attention given to super stars,
super athletes, Super Bowls, and everything super sized. We even have to decide if we want our
olives to be colossal sized or just gigantic. But, each day we must withdraw from the oversized
images placed before us and remember the things our Heavenly Father has taught us. Our
Heavenly Father has put his trust in us.  He knows we can do hard things. Many of you learned
that on your missions. Learn to perform to the best of your ability the work in front of you and
trust in the Lord as he leads you along. In that way he knows that you trust him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The third and last point of my message follows naturally if we care about one and two--trusting
in God and living so that God trusts you.  The third point is living so that others trust you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In President Hinckley's book, Standing for Something he states, "It is possible to so live that
others can trust us--can trust our words, our motives, and our actions." (p.28) "Very simply, we
cannot be less than honest, we cannot be less than true, we cannot be less than virtuous. . .if we
are to merit. . .trust."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let's talk first about being trusted in our words.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When President Hinckley reminded us of the importance of being trusted in our words, he used a
story that was related several times each year when I was a student at BYU. Perhaps you have
heard it, but as a BYU student you really should know it by heart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Karl G. Maeser, an educator from Germany, served as the first president of Brigham Young
University.  More than a century ago he said this to his students: "I have been asked what I mean
by 'word of honor.' I will tell you.  Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high,
ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or
another I might be able to escape; but stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and
have me give my word of honor never to cross it.  Can I get out of that circle?  No, never! I
would die first." (Standing for Something, p. 27) Surely he was a man of his word and could be
trusted by others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Words expressed lightly and without commitment can be destructive to trust.  I once had a young
man in our home who had come to install a kitchen range.  He was well dressed, well mannered
and very skilled.  As I worked in the kitchen, we visited while he did his work.  I learned he was
a student about to graduate and had some ambitious and worthy goals.  I asked if he were married
and he replied he was not.  I suggested that he would be a mighty good catch for some young
woman. Then he stopped what he was doing and looked at me seriously and said, "How can you
tell when you can trust someone?" His question took me by surprise, but then he explained that
he had a girlfriend and she had told him how much she loved him and wanted to be married to
him. Then, rather abruptly, he learned she was seeing someone else. His inclination to trust had
been damaged.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is important that we can stand behind the words we speak. Just as it is important to take your
car to a mechanic you can trust or to put your money in a bank you can trust, how much more
important to place your heart or your feelings in a relationship you can trust. Make a conscious
effort to be a man or woman of your word. How could we possibly be prepared to make and keep
sacred covenants if we have not learned to be honest in word?  Relationships of trust are the
foundation of sacred covenants and should never be taken lightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next, President Hinckley said we should be trustworthy in our motives.  I learned a great deal
about pure motivation as we served to prepare for the Olympics. The First Presidency had
suggested to members of the Church along the Wasatch front that they get involved in their
communities to be good hosts to the guests who would be coming from throughout the world to
attend the Olympic games. President Hinckley had said on many occasions that he hoped we
would be good hosts and that he hoped there would be a legacy of goodwill in the community
because of the games.  Such a large event required that everyone work together. President
Hinckley also said publicly and it was reported in the media that the Church would not use the
Olympic games as an opportunity to proselytize.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Among our other assignments, Ray and I were asked to be responsible for the training of about
5000 Church volunteers who would host guests at Church sites. We formed a committee to
develop the training with the decision to base the training on the chapter in President Hinckley's
book on Civility.  In the training we discussed how we could prepare ourselves to be good hosts. 
We quoted President's Hinckley's words, ". . .the essence of civility (is) to extend, without price,
a helping. . .hand. . ." (Standing for Something, p. 54.)  Think about that.  "Without price." That
is a pure motive-- a motive that can be trusted. Without price means your concern is for the other
person. You are not promoting your own agenda. We must have repeated thousands of times
these words: We want to be good hosts.  The Church will not use the Olympic Games as an
opportunity to proselytize. The essence of civility is to extend without price a helping hand. I
learned how important it is to identify the desired outcome and then provide training and
preparation. I believe the members of the Church and the people in the State of Utah were good
hosts. The International Olympic Committee said that Utah was the volunteer mecca of the
world. It soon became apparent that it is obvious to others when motives are pure.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First, Trust in our words. Second, trust in our motives. And third, trust in our actions. It has been
said that actions speak even louder than words.  A friend related an experience when she had
purchased tickets to take her family to the circus.  As they got ready to get in the car, her husband
commented that they were short one ticket. She hadn't gotten a ticket for their three year old
because, as she explained, "she just turned three and you know she will sit on my lap." Since a
ticket was required for those age three, her husband responded, "Would you be dishonest for a
few dollars?" The decision was made that the inclination to save money wouldn't get in the way
of the greater desire of being trustworthy. As I have observed the life of this noble man, it has
helped me understand that honesty becomes visible to others even when no words are spoken.
When we are young we sometimes make light of stories about those who are impeccably honest,
even a Karl G. Maeser story, but time helps us appreciate that being trustworthy is a blessing and
an asset in all that we do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In conclusion I would like to use an example from the life of Joseph Smith. He is  one who
trusted the Lord. The Lord trusted him and he was trusted by others. This experience is found in
the 121 Section of the Doctrine in Covenants on page 230.  The prophet, Joseph Smith, is in
Liberty Jail. Surely his circumstances were not of his choosing. Yet, it was in this setting that the
Lord taught Joseph Smith about Priesthood power and how it blesses our lives. His words begin
with pleading as he turns to the Lord. We read in verse 1, <em>"O God, where art thou? And where is
the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?  How long shall thy hand be stayed,. . ."</em>   In the next
verses  he acknowledges the power of the Lord, he appeals to the Lord to use that power to be
turned on the enemies of the saints.  In verse 5, <em>"Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies;
and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword avenge us of our wrongs."</em>  Surely the prophet
would be justified in making such a request, but as he spoke, his heart must have been softened
as the spirit taught him and he instead he made a request with a promise.  In verse 6, <em>"Remember
thy suffering saints, O our God; </em>[help us]<em> and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever."</em>
Perhaps we learn we don't even need to bargain with the Lord as we read the promise the Lord
made to Joseph and the promise he makes to those who trust in him, <em>"My son, peace be unto thy
soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;" </em>and then the ultimate
promise, <em>". . .if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high;" </em> This is the promise given to
those who trust in the Lord--peace in this life and exaltation in the world to come. There is a
secondary promise here also that can reassure us we will receive support in our troubles. The
Lord tells Joseph Smith in verse 9, <em>"Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again
with warm hearts and friendly hands."  </em>Your friends trust you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Trust is the basis of friendship and of all good relationships.  Trust is the basis of our relationship
with family members.  Trust is the basis of our relationship with God. So today my message is
threefold: First, Trust in the Lord with all your heart, mind and strength; second, live so that God
can trust you; and third, live so that you can be trusted by others--your roommates, your
associates, your teachers, your future companions. I have a testimony that <em>"I know that the Lord
is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble;"  </em> I trust in the promise that he has given to those
who make and keep sacred covenants. He has promised the blessing of peace in this life and
exaltation in the world to come. This is my testimony and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is indeed invigorating to stand before this vast congregation of bright young people and catch a
glimpse of those who will lead us in the years to come.  I am delighted and encouraged based on
what I see in you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Basically, you are here to get an education not only secular, but spiritual as well.  Hopefully, you
are here with a desire to improve yourselves mentally, physically, socially and spiritually in
preparation for your future.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are all in different stages of life, some married, some with young growing children, some are
single, some of you are freshmen and some have been here much longer.  Some of you are
returned missionaries, others just now preparing to go--varied backgrounds, varied nationalities,
perhaps even varied beliefs.  But the one thing we all have in common?  We are sons and
daughters of God, our Eternal Father!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Something the Prophet Joseph Smith said, instills in us a great sense of appreciation for our
privileges and opportunities:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>The first principles of man are self-existent with God.  God himself, finding he was in the
midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws
whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself.  The relationship we
have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge.  He has power to
institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligence, that they may be exalted with himself, so
that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and
intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits.</em>  (Teachings
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Section Six, 1843-44, p.354)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Not in the history of this world has there been a more exciting time to be on earth--opportunities
and commotion abound.  We are being deluged with advances in technology as the Lord's
Kingdom progresses.  For example, years ago I often had to wait for hours to make a telephone
call on our eight party-line.  My fingers were worn out from rotary dialing and re-dialing a
number, only to be told to hang up, and wait my turn.  Now, I have a wireless telephone that fits
in the palm of my hand, no dialing necessary, I just speak the name of the person I want and zip,
it's done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What a marvelous time to be alive!  Imagine the advances that are yet to come and some of you
will be involved on the cutting edge of new developments that today we cannot comprehend. 
The signs of the times are all around us.  Reflect on the growth of the church as the "stone cut out
of the mountain" is rolling forth.  A seemingly endless number of new Temples being built for
almost 12 million members.  The growth and success prophesied by the Prophet Joseph is
transpiring before our very eyes.  Indeed, the heavens are open and revelation is hastening on
through apostles and prophets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In spite of these wonderful events and advances, there are those who dwell on fear factor, the
adversarial dark side, worrying about the world coming to an end, wars and rumors of wars, and
gloomy misfortunes.  Believing that if circumstances were with them instead of against them,
they could have been successful and happy.  This is an unfortunate waste of spiritual energy and
will consume our valuable time if we choose to take this course.  True, evil is everywhere giving
cause for concern, but this is doctrine understood by those who know the Plan of Salvation and
the purpose of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Elder LeGrand Richards, at age 96, said:
</font> </p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For every worry under the Sun.<br />
	There is a remedy or there is none.<br />
	If there is a remedy, hurry and find it.<br />
	If there is none, never mind it.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I invite you now to turn your thoughts to the blessings and opportunities we have as sons and
daughters of God, as we participate in this marvelous "Plan of Happiness."</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord
their God shall command them.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>	And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first
estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate;
<u>and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever
and ever.</u>"</em> (Abraham 3:25-26, emphasis added.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I emphasize the last phrase.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Alma also refers to this earthly life <em>"granted unto man"</em> as a <em>"probationary time"</em> to <em>"repent and
serve God."</em>  (Alma 42:4)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Indeed, our journey of "<strong>proving"</strong> is filled with character building challenges, expanded
opportunities, personal triumphs, and professional successes, intermingled with events that bring
the refining sorrows, failures and disappointments.  Yet, enduring will provide the polishing
necessary to maximize our potential for the eternal realm.  This <strong>is</strong> all part of the proving process!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ponder this question!  In this journey of mortality will you have the solid, dependable anchor of
the gospel to rely on or will you be constantly grasping for a flimsy life preserver when you reach
those troubled waters?  Will safety be just beyond your reach as you drift to and fro with the tide?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I relate a story of a young man of great potential.  I first became acquainted with him while
serving as his stake president.  He was intelligent and confident, a good athlete, tall and
handsome with a keen sense of humor, and even an Eagle Scout.  He was a leader among his
peers and served a successful mission, returning home to further his education.  He received his
Bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and in the process fell in love and married a
beautiful young woman in the Salt Lake Temple.  He entered another institution of higher
learning and obtained a Juris Doctorate.  His hard work and diligence were rewarded with an
outstanding business opportunity with a prestigious law firm.  Life was bright and exciting!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He had it all!  A wonderful wife, the perfect job, the gospel and two beautiful children.  He had
done all that anyone could expect from a worthy priesthood holder of his age.  However, over the
next few years, I detected changes in his personality.  He began to be somewhat combative,
arrogant, prideful, and not as tolerant of other's shortcoming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">His testimony showed signs of waning as he questioned the doctrines of the church--doctrines
that he previously embraced.  And despite the best efforts of those who loved him, I watch him
gradually cast off his stable anchor and drift into a stormy sea on his own merits.  This young
man thought he could ascend that corporate ladder faster by compromising his principles, after
all, he was in control.  Then came the social drinking, accompanied by improper relationships
with women in the work place, and over the next few years, his boat capsized, if you will, his
anchor was gone!  He lost his eternal family, his testimony, his employment and his ability to
have the companionship of the Holy Spirit.  Now he is a broken man left to wallow in his own
miserable sin.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the
Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and
then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus
their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things.</em>  (Alma 24:30)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This tragic scenario is a preamble for what I want to convey to you this afternoon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I served my mission in Hawaii.  "Tough duty" you might say, but someone had to do it!  I recall
the day before we were to return home.  Our mission president allowed us to take a brief
<strong><em><u>supervised</u></em></strong> swim in the beautiful blue ocean off Hawaii's shore.  Now I remind you that this was
over 40 years ago, lest there by any of you thinking that swimming is approved on missions, IT
IS NOT!  Much has changed since then and more than likely because of my experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here is this Utah farm kid who has never been in an ocean and thinks he knows all about the art
of swimming.  I dived into the pounding surf dreaming of the bragging rights this would give me
back in my home ward.  I began swimming hard, not noticing how far out I was drifting and
certainly not aware of the tide or undertow.  These were two dangers not familiar to the young
kid who spent his summers swimming in the Weber River.  Turning back to the shore, I was
shocked to see how far out I was and decided to head back in, but the undercurrents were taking
me out faster than I could swim and I was making no progress.  After several futile attempts, I
became exhausted and panicked!  What a way to end my mission!  I could see the headlines:
"Elder Watts, in his excitement to experience it all, started swimming out to sea, never to be seen
again."  Well, fervent prayer and exerting all I could muster in strength proved successful and I
finally reached the shore.  I had a new respect for the mighty ocean and its undetectable dangers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How often do we tread into unchartered waters, assuming that our own strength will be more
than sufficient to carry us through--only to find desperate pleadings to return to safe shores,
hopefully, before it's too late.  I would have welcomed even the flimsiest of life preservers, but it
may not have been enough to save me.  It's the anchors that bring us safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I speak today about the importance of anchors to keep us from drifting into the troubled tide of
the adversary.  We are all familiar with the traditional anchor,<strong> </strong>but I wish to speak about eight
anchors of stability, culminated into one anchor that is not necessarily in the traditional shape you
may envision, but rather an "Octagon Anchor," one with eight sides or facets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em><u>FIRST</u></em></strong>: The anchor of knowing you are a son or daughter of God.  Ponder the doctrine that we
lived as spirit children with our Father in Heaven.  He knew us and we knew Him.  So that we
could obtain "all that the Father hath," he provided us with the great Plan of Happiness.  We
accepted the opportunity to gain a body and have experience in the flesh, to prove ourselves and
return unto him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As stated in that marvelous declaration, <em>The Family, A Proclamation to the World</em>:</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God.  Each is a beloved
spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, has a divine nature and destiny. 
Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity
and purpose.</font> </em></p>
<p><em> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">	In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God their Eternal
Father accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain
earthly experiences to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine
destiny as an heir to eternal life.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These eternal truths are not known to the majority of God's children here on earth.  Imagine how
knowledge of that doctrine would change their behavior.  We must (in continuum) seek to
understand our true identity and the promises we have been given.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em><u>SECOND:</u></em></strong> AND YET FOREMOST, AN ANCHOR OF THE SAVIOR.  We must have a firm,
unwavering testimony of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, our advocate with the Father, and His
Atonement.  We read from "Lectures on Faith:"</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let us here observe, that three things are necessary in order that any rational and
intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation, first the idea that He
(The Savior) actually exists, second a correct idea of His character, perfections and
attributes and third, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he (we) is pursuing
is according to His will.  For without an acquaintance with these three important facts,
the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive but with this
understanding it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the
praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Acquiring an unwavering testimony is not accomplished in a day, a month or a year, but through
a lifelong pursuit of daily diligence.  Without this facet of our anchor there is no hope of finding
our way back.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a
place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls
of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works,
being led to glorify God.</em> (Ether 12:4).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In his concluding remarks of the April 2002 General Conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley
spoke briefly of the future and what may lie ahead, and with assurance said:</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But one thing we do know.  Like the polar star in the heavens, regardless of what the
future holds, there stands the Redeemer of the world, the Son of God, certain and sure as
the anchor of our immortal lives.  He is the rock of our salvation, our strength, our
comfort, and the very focus of our faith.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It would be my hope that each of you have in your possession a copy of "<em>The Living Christ, The
Testimony of the Apostles</em>: I review just one paragraph from this declaration:</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles--that Jesus is the Living Christ, the
immortal Son of God.  He is the great King Emmanuel, who stands today on the right
hand of His Father.  He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world.  His way is the
path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.  God be
thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now I refer to the <strong><em><u>THIRD</u></em></strong> FACET, The anchor of Apostles and Prophets.  In his epistle to the
Ephesians, Paul declares the significance of Apostles and Prophets.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints,
and of the household of God; And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner <strong>stone</strong>.</em>  (Ephesians 2:19-20,
emphasis added)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When our life is running smoothly, we often disregard words of caution.  The warnings and
directives we have been given are to live pure lives, study the scriptures, participate in daily
communication with our Creator, attend the temple regularly, obtain a year's supply of life-sustaining essentials, avoid debt, etc.  Do these counsels have a familiar ring?  Perhaps the
repetitive admonitions have dulled our senses.  <em>These are anchors of safety!  </em>I testify of the
apostles.  I know they are called of God.  In my present calling, I have the opportunity to have
this knowledge fortified on a daily basis.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of
the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., and spake unto him from heaven,
and gave him commandments.</em>  (Doctrine and Covenants 1:17)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I plead with you to follow the prophets and apostles and take advantage of their inspiration from
on high by heeding their direction and counsel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em><u>FOURTH</u></em></strong>, The facet of the Priesthood.  I speak to the brethren, but the associated blessings and
implications are to all.  This priesthood is a gift from God by which He governs and directs His
kingdom here on earth.  It is powerful, it is magnificent, it is remarkable.  All who are privileged
to possess this priesthood have the responsibility to act and govern themselves in worthiness. 
There are both covenants and promises associated with the priesthood.  Let's review one
reference from the 84<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><u>The Covenant</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>The Promised Blessing</u></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All the Father hath shall be given him</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I admonish each brother here to obtain a copy of President Hinckley's remarks to the priesthood
during the April 2002 Priesthood Session of General Conference (May <em>Ensign</em> 2002).  Carry it
with you, read it often and live by the counsel given.  In this talk President Hinckley gave this
admonition regarding the priesthood:</font> </p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is nothing else to compare with it in all the world.  Safeguard it, cherish it, live it,
live worthy of it.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have witnesses many miracles through the exercise of the Priesthood of God.  They occur all
around us, on a daily basis, and many of you have and will experience these miracles in your
lives.  My dear sisters, if you seek an eternal companion, or if you already have one, that truly,
<em>and I emphasize the word truly</em>, honors his priesthood--your life will be blessed abundantly.  He
may not be the most handsome, or the best dressed, (I hesitate to say best dressed because from
what I see these days, best dressed does not have the same meaning I remember)!  Anyway, he
may not be charismatic, or have the profession you had hoped for, but sooner or later you will
come to know that if he truly honors his priesthood, you have found a "pearl of great price." 
Elder Packer once said: "If a man truly honors his Priesthood, his wife cannot help but love him."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em><u>FIFTH</u></em></strong>, the facet of spiritual knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I quote from 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost, wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. 
Wherefore, I said unto you, <u>feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of
Christ will tell you all things what ye should do</u>.</em>  (2 Nephi 32:3, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are fortunate to be attending an institution of higher leaning where you can blend secular
and spiritual knowledge.  I commend you for bringing your scriptures to these devotionals each
week.  They should be your trusted companion as you search them for guidance and spiritual
strength.  The scriptures are an important and integral part of our anchor of spiritual knowledge. 
Searching them will keep our hearts and minds attuned to the spiritual whisperings that are often
muffled by the "Boom Boxes" of the world.</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the
resurrection.</font> </em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>			And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence
and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</em>
(Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Gospel knowledge and gospel intelligence provide an anchor of peace.  Spiritual knowledge is all
inclusive and will grow with increased understanding through our faith and with the power of the
Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><em><u>SIXTH</u></em></strong> facet of our anchor is Prayer--an inner longing for daily communication with our Father
in Heaven.  We need His constant direction in our lives--it comes through the power of prayer.  I
liken it to a sonar device, if you will, that guides a ship through treacherous waters.  As I talk
about prayer I have a vivid picture in my mind of Enos when he said;</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in
mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul. . . .</em> (Enos 1:4)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, in reading from the eighth chapter of Alma we gain more understanding of fervent prayer.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Nevertheless, Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer . . .</em> 
(Alma 8:10)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Abraham Lincoln relied on prayer and once said:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had
nowhere else to go.</em> (Abraham Lincoln, Man of God by John Wesley Hill, p. 339)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What a privilege we have to pray to our Father at any time day or night.  As a loving parent
would welcome communication with a child, so it is with our Father in Heaven.  We have so
much to thank Him for, to discuss, to report, to ask.  This anchor is often our weakest and easily
forgotten, but in our hour of desperation, we are quick to plead for divine intervention.  Yet
again, when all seems well, we are slow to express gratitude when surrounded by "fat things." 
We forget that the famine comes quickly.  The Scriptures are replete with such occasions.  I refer
to a few.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those
who confess not His hand in all things ...</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 59:21)</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>. . . Let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare,
and also for the welfare of those who are around you</em>.  (Alma 34:27)</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou
liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and
when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do
these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.  </em>(Alma 37:37)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And from C. S. Lewis:</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I pray not because it changes God, but because it changes me.</font> </em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now, <strong><em><u>SEVENTH</u></em></strong>, The anchor of integrity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Inherent in each of us is the Spirit of Christ, which, if allowed, will give direction to our lives. 
Our divine nature is replete with virtues such as honesty and integrity.  But as the adversarial
influence of the world would dictate, we often live and conduct our lives far below our birthright. 
It begins with the simplest of thoughts, "No one will ever know," and spirals downward from
there, touching all aspects of our lives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We have witnessed in recent months the collapse of large, supposedly stable companies because
individuals in high positions valued their financial gain more than their integrity.  Thousands and
thousands of lives have been tragically affected by the actions of a very few.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>How rare a gem, how precious a jewel is the man or woman in whom there is neither
guile nor deception nor falsehood nor greed nor preoccupation with "getting ahead."</em>
(<em>Be Thou An Example</em> by Gordon B. Hinckley, P. 46)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Karl G. Maeser, the first president of Brigham Young University, said this to his students
regarding what was meant by 'word of honor':</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have been asked, what I mean by 'word of honor.'  I will tell you.  Place me behind
prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so afar into the
ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I might be able to escape, but
stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of
honor never to cross it.  Can I get out of that circle?  No, never!  I'd rather die first.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Several years ago as I began my career with a large corporation, I heard rumors here and there
about the padded expense accounts and white collar pilfering, but had no concrete evidence to
make accusations.  Corporate headquarters had their own suspicions and called for an audit
unbeknownst to the managers and sales staff.  For the next few months, they carefully perused
our reports, files, expense accounts, hotel receipts and even restaurant tabs, verifying with
customers and other establishments each and every detail of their employee's expenditures. 
Pursuant to their findings, a meeting was called for managers and sales representatives from all
over the nation.  The meeting convened, individuals were interviewed, evidence was presented
and the punishments given.  Some were fined large sums of money while others lost their
bonuses or were demoted.  I remember sitting there in a numbed state of disbelief for my
colleagues and friends, but felt an inner peace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Toward the end of this "Corporate Courtroom," very few were found to be in total compliance
with company accounting practices.  One was me!  Those who were aware of my religion even
presented me with the "<em>Donny Osmond Good Guy Award"</em> to bring a lighter moment to the
austere occasion.  In the elevator as we were leaving, one man who had been found guilty, looked
at me somberly and said: "<em>What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes."   </em>I don't know when I have
been more grateful for the teachings of the gospel and the courage to live them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Josiah Gilbert Holland penned:</font></p>
<p> <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">God give us men, a time like this demands<br />
	Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and willing hands;<br />
	Men whom the lust of office does not kill;<br />
	Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;<br />
	Men who possess opinions and a will;<br />
	Men who have honor; men who will not lie;<br />
	Men who can stand before a demagogue<br />
	And dam his treacherous flatteries without winking;<br />
	Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog<br />
	In public duty and in private thinking.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are so many temptations that loosen our anchor of integrity if we are not attentive to the
spirit.  One such enticement concerns the law of chastity.  This world would be a very different
place if everyone in it lived the law of chastity.  Our resolve should be, "I will not act improperly
toward the opposite sex, in any manner that would imply that I cannot be trusted.  God gave us
these marvelous bodies as temples of our spirits, trusting that we would care for and nurture them
without abusing them, degrading them or selling them like something cheap and priceless.  "<em>Be
ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord."</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Much is implied in that statement.  Synonyms for <strong>integrity</strong> include: credibility, fidelity and
honor.  One antonym is the word filth, which also appears as the opposite of the word clean. 
Think of the dress standards of today--those fashions that fill store windows and revealingly
cling to youthful bodies.  Then think (<strong>no don't think</strong>) of the number one hit on the
Internet--Pornography.  And when was the last time you watched a TV sitcom or sat attentively
in a movie theater that you weren't bombarded by lewd scenes and filthy speech that violated
your spiritual senses?</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>. . . and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong
in the presence of God; . . .</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:45)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As I stated before--Inherent in each of us is the Spirit of Christ which, if allowed, will give
spiritual direction to our lives and help us find our place in the Kingdom of our Father.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To quote Shakespeare: "This above all, to thine own self be true!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Finally, the <strong><em><u>EIGHTH</u></em></strong> FACET IS THE ANCHOR OF Service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I cannot think of service without reflecting on the words of King Benjamin:</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>And behold, I tell you these things that you may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that
when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</em> 
(Mosiah 2:17)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While serving as stake president, I was assigned as a home teacher to a family where the father
was gravely ill with cancer--which eventually took his life.  The opportunity for service both
spiritually and temporally was ever present as the family struggled through some of life's most
tragic moments.  In all my years of serving as stake president-- the accomplishments, the joy and
the endless hours of commitment--none were more gratifying or brought me more peace than
those quiet and humbling efforts I gave to this family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Service comes in many different forms whether in the community or to an elderly neighbor.  It
may include help to a family member, a stranger or more.  If you ever feel down and out or have
moments of despair, or perhaps even wish to express gratitude to our Eternal Father in some way
other than prayer--get involved in service.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <em>. . . Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto me.</em>  (Matthew 25:40)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The anchor of service will keep you from drifting too far out into the churning tide of what I call
<strong><em>"<u>me-ism</u>."</em></strong>  That's when we are tempted to entertain the thought, "What's in this for me?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We need only to read the scriptural accounts of the Savior for the greatest examples of service. 
He loved and served everyone, turning no one away who was in need.  He did not seek
recompense for his service, but only asked that we follow his example and learn charity, the pure
love of Christ.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now, in conclusion, I ask that you ponder two questions:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Is the Anchor of the gospel a constant in my life?</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No matter what the storms-of-life may bring, will I always have a stable anchor to rely on and see
me through?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">May God bless you my young brothers and sisters, you are indeed some of the "noble and great
ones."  Your future is promising, your possibilities are endless and your contributions of love,
testimony, service, commitment and obedience will stem the tide and reward you with a life
filled with joy and happiness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I testify to you as a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, that I know God lives, Jesus is the Christ. 
We are guided by apostles and prophets.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">Thank you for the prayer and scripture and thank you for the music.  Elder Bingham
shared that beautiful talent throughout his service in Chile and I am grateful that he was
able to share it today.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I consider it a privilege, a delight, and a huge responsibility
to occupy  a few minutes of your day and week to share with you some thoughts which
will hopefully help us along the way.  I feel confident that during the next half hour or so. 
That something good will happen here.  I have prayed, studied, and prepared for this day
and hold in my own heart a desire to share something which will bless and edify.</p>
<p>I also sense that one or more of you have come to this devotional today with a desire to
find answers to your prayers or need insight to help you in meeting some challenge, or are
in the moments when you are required to sort through feelings or to make some decision.</p>
<p>I have learned, that when this combination exists, a prayerful DESIRE on the part of a
speaker and of the listener, the Holy Ghost (the real teacher) responds.  Thank you for
coming today.</p>
<p>I direct my remarks to the 2,000 or so pre-missionaries, to the 2,000 or so returned
missionaries and to all those who already have or plan to marry a returned missionary,
and certainly all those who will have children and raise up the next generation of
missionaries. In short, I'm speaking today to all of us.  Although, I will draw upon some
of the experiences of our last chapter serving with missionaries in Chile, the Spirit will
help us apply the message in every arena of our lives.</p>
<p>Will you turn with me to the 5<sup>th</sup> Chapter of Alma beginning in verse 6.  Alma the
Younger, a once inactive rebel and one of the vilest of sinners had been converted years
before and now is seeking to invite 'active and less active members alike' to consider the
strength of their testimonies.</p>
<p>I think he's talking to usÂ…</p>
<p> <em>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, <strong><u>you that belong to this church</u></strong></em><em><u></u></em><u></u>, [he
is talking to us isn't he? you who belong to this church], <em>have you sufficiently
retained in remembrance </em>[your historyÂ…your legacyÂ… and how God blessed your
parents]</p>
<p> <em>Behold he changed their hearts...their souls were illuminatedÂ… </em>[they were blessed
to see and know how the Atonement of Christ works and they changed.]</p>
<p> <em>...according to </em>[my dads] <em>faith, there was a mighty change wrought in his heart</em></p>
<p> <em>And...he</em> [taught your fathers.  My Dad taught your Parents] <em>and a...change was
wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their TRUST in the
true and living God. And behold, they were faithful unto the END</em> (Alma 5:6-7,
12-13, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Then the question pointed directly at each of them (brothers and sisters who belonged to
this church) and he now asks the same of you and of me:</p>
<p> <em>And now behold, I ask you, my brethren of the church, have</em> [you] <em>spiritually been
born of God?  Have</em> [you] <em>received his image in your countenances?  Have ye
experienced this mighty change in your hearts?  Do</em> [you] (Alma 5:14)</p>
<p>How are we doing 'brothers and sisters of this church'?  Have we allowed the 'memory'
of our blessings and the understanding of Jesus Christ and His Atonement to have full
sway in our hearts?</p>
<p>Do we have an image of Christ in our "look"?  In our 'walk' and our 'talk'?  Do we
maintain that image all day?  Even when were alone?  Especially in the private moments
of our lives?</p>
<p>May I share  with you the substance of  two or three -- of the thousands of telephone calls
I engaged in while serving in Chile.</p>
<p>The first came one afternoon in one of those rare days when I was in my office.  I had
been interviewing missionaries -- and the Elder serving as my secretary came to my door
just as I was concluding an interview with a missionary and said "President Christensen,
there is a General Authority on the line who would like to talk to you."  Most of the time,
when a General Authority calls a mission president, it is NOT good!  In fact most often it
is to discuss a problem.  So, I closed my office door and picked up the telephone.  "Hello,
this is President Christensen" I said.  The General Authority identified himself and began
to ask me several pointed and detailed questions about one of our missionaries who had
completed his mission some months before.  His line of questioning went something like
this in a very NON-SMILING VOICE (Do you know what a NON SMILING VOICE
sounds like?)  "President, did you have Elder _____ in your mission?"  "Yes I did I
responded courteously.  "Well I need to know about him!"</p>
<p>"OH NO" I thought. Was there a problem?  Had he made a mistake?  He was a great
missionary.  To my knowledge he was one of the best.</p>
<p>I gave several positive answers to his every inquiry.  Then he coaxed a second time, 
"President, I need to know what kind of missionary he was!"  With confidence I replied 
"one of the best missionaries in our mission".</p>
<p>How did he get along with his companions? Came a second round of the same questions.</p>
<p>"Did you interview him often and can you vouch for his worthiness?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I interviewed him often .in fact I have taught him along with all our other
missionaries to live their lives according to their temple covenants and the 15 critical
questions (the temple recommend questions) which they must answer in order to maintain
their recommend."  With each question I remembered this wonderful missionary -- his
good nature and worthiness.</p>
<p>Then I questioned him, "Elder So and So, is there a problem with our former
missionary?"</p>
<p>There was silence on his end of the line.. for just a moment and then he asked one more
time "are you sure he was an extraordinary missionary and worthy priesthood man?"
"Yes" I answered again without hesitation.</p>
<p>Then the tone of his voice changed from the NON SMILING VOICE to a CHEERFUL 
and almost chuckling voice (I believe he felt my anxiety and felt the need to break the
tension).  "Well good, I am glad you feel that way about him, because he is dating my
secretary and I will not allow her to continue down the road to marriage if he isn't the
best there is."</p>
<p>I first felt a relief that there was nothing wrong and then I felt a special warmth and
gratitude and love for this former missionary and his soon to be fianc&eacute; that I had not yet
met.  We visited for a few minutes longer about other things and then concluded the
conversation.</p>
<p>As I hung up the telephone I leaned back in my chair and felt a rush of JOY and a
HAPPINESS for this young man who had become a part of my life.  I felt so happy for
him, that as a friend and priesthood leader. I could answer each question the way I did.</p>
<p>He is here in the devotional  today. And so is his wife!  They have been blessed with their
first child.</p>
<p>The Second Call came some time later.  Closer to the end of our time in Chile.  This time
it came to the mission home at a very late hour.  It was not a call from a General
Authority, nor a concerned parent -- but from a University Co-ed who I'm sure had not
taken into account the four hours difference in time zones.  It was rather late at night.</p>
<p>She began by introducing herself and helping me to understand the nature of her call. 
"this is highly unusual" she said  "I hope you won't be angry with me for calling you".  
But I must have some answers about one of your former missionaries".  In words similar
to those of the General Authority, she said.  "President Christensen,  I need to know what
kind of missionary he was".</p>
<p>You need to know brothers and sisters, that we love each of the 563 missionaries assigned
by the Lord who served with us in Chile as if they were our own sons and daughters.  
Probably much like Helaman felt about his 2060 sons who labored with him in the
trenches of war.</p>
<p>I responded "Yes, he was a fine missionary."  She asked a few other questions to which I
gave short, positive, answers.</p>
<p>Then, after a moment of silence I could hear in her voice. NOT A NON-SMILING
VOICE neither was it a CHEERFUL - CHUCKLING voice, but kind of a <strong><em><u>desperate and
pleading voice</u></em></strong><em><u></u></em><u></u>.  "President Christensen, I appreciate your answers, but I can't tell if you 
are being honest with me."</p>
<p>"I am considering a long term relationship with your former missionary -- I need to know
what kind of a missionary he was, how he treated his companions, was he obedient, was
he extraordinarily good, did he honor his priesthood and live with a sense of sacrifice," 
and as she went on, I was thinking to myself -- "Wow, I prefer to be interviewed by a
General Authority, this girl is tough!!!</p>
<p>As she spoke and with each question, I was beginning to examine what I truly knew about
this Elder, about our interviews, about his work ethic, about his level of obedience as a
missionary, and about his companionship relationships.</p>
<p>Then she asked the most penetrating questions of all.</p>
<p>"President, I understand that you have several daughters."  "Yes I do" I responded, "six to
be exact."  Then she pulled out her most soul searching question -- "Would you want one
of your daughters to marry this missionary?"  "Do you believe him to be the kind of
priesthood holder based on his performance in the mission field who can lead me and our
children to the Celestial Kingdom?  Would you feel 100% comfortable based on his
constancy and obedience in the mission field to be the father of your grandchildren?"</p>
<p>Do you see what I mean?  This girl was tougher than 'Mike Wallace' on 60 minutes!</p>
<p>Our telephone conversation continued -- I remained loyal to the missionary.  I did not 
utter a single negative word about him in any way.  However the questions and the 
process had been a searching one for me.</p>
<p>Instead of answering her with comments about the missionary, I took a turn to ask her
some questions.</p>
<p>"I am not your bishop or priesthood leader so you don't need to answer theses questions
but maybe they will help you."  I responded.  Then I asked her about her prayers?  Had
she fasted?  If she had counseled with her parents?  If she had listened to and paid
attention to her feelings as directed by the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>I told her that I admired her for her desire to search and find answers to important
questions about our former missionary.  In her case, unlike the General Authority, I
sensed that she wasn't comfortable with the feelings she had felt.  I suggested that her
'<strong><em>questions and concerns'</em></strong><em></em> were perhaps a signal or a flag that maybe the Holy Ghost was
trying to tell her something.  I told her that I had taught our missionaries on occasion, 
that IF THERE'S A QUESTION about something -- a kind of gnawing doubt or an
absence of 'PEACE', THEN MANY TIMES -- THAT IS THE ANSWER.  I shared with
her that in my experience, affirmative "yes" answers from the Lord come in peaceful
feelings, and gentle nudgings -- not in confusion.</p>
<p>This telephone call continued on for a few minutes longer and then ended cordially.  She
expressed gratitude and we said good bye.</p>
<p>A few months later we received a special thank you note from her informing us that she
had received a call to serve a mission of her own in a far away European nation.  The
Spirit had helped  her sort through her feelings and the answer she sought had come.</p>
<p>Although I don't recommend that you all run home and call the mission president of the
man or returned sister missionary you are dating -- I do think it is wise and I would invite
you to consider deeply the kind of questions she asked.  I believe you can tell a lot about a
person by how he feels about his mission, about the kinds of stories he tells about the
non-proselyting activity of his mission, as well as the way he talks about the spiritual
experiences of his mission in Gospel Doctrine Class on Sunday or in a religion class
during the week or in other public settings.</p>
<p>I've come to believe that you can tell a lot about a man or a woman by how they talk of
their missions.  The way they feel about the 'mighty change' that comes to all servants of
God, even the most prepared -- as they give their heart and soul to the Lord.  Anything
short of 'wondrous and positive' feelings about their mission MAY tell you something
about them, more than about the experience they had.</p>
<p>Sisters, when a missionary you have interest in, talks of his mission -- that season when
they have been invited to give their whole heart to the Lord and His Way of doing things, 
you should be 'all-ears'.  Listen with your heart.  You will learn important things about
his character and capacity to lead a family and others to the Lord.</p>
<p>There is one other kind of telephone call that I had cause to receive and sometimes to
make.  They were telephone calls from or directed to Stake Presidents about missionaries
serving from their stake.</p>
<p>We are grateful that we had relatively few of these to deal with during our mission
experience.  Calls to Stake Presidents were rarely 'happy ones'.  They were  often filled
with <strong><em><u>agony and concern</u></em></strong><em><u></u></em><u></u> over a MISSIONARY who had forgotten who they were.  While 
LOVE was ever-present in those calls as well -- maybe even multiplied, conversation 
centered around 'mistakes' and the consequences of not being obedient to the Spirit or the
Law.</p>
<p>I have thought often about these telephone calls.  To you 2,000 or so anticipating mission
or having just received a mission call:  Wouldn't the constant thought of a future call
from a General Authority or a call from your potential future spouse, help you in setting
the kind of standard you will want to adhere to as a missionary?</p>
<p>How much more will the thought of our final interview with our creator and Savior Jesus
Christ have impact our behavior throughout our entire life.  I have concluded that the
essence of every question of the General Authority, the University Co-ed, and the Stake
Presidents, can be summed up in the questions of Alma the Younger in Alma Chapter 5.</p>
<p>To those who of the Church, like you and me, who had the blessings of the gospel in their
lives.</p>
<p>And now behold, I ask you, my brethren of the church,</p>
<p>I would invite you to consider these questions in a shorter form.  Three short questions
that could have been asked by my callers or could be asked of each of us:</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Has he Learned?</u></em></strong><em><u></u></em><u></u></p>
<p>Turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-21.  You will recognize these verses,
perhaps you have two of them memorized from your Scripture Mastery days in seminary. 
Here the Lord teaches about "learning."</p>
<p> <em>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in
the resurrection.  </em></p>
<p><em>	And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life </em>[HOW]<em>
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the
advantage in the world to come</em>  (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19).</p>
<p>The Lord makes it clear, doesn't he,  that intelligence comes to us by obedience and that
knowledge comes to us through diligence.  Let's focus on the word "intelligence."</p>
<p>Keep you finger (or something) in Section 130 to mark it and turn back to Section 93 and
go to the 36<sup>th</sup> verse.</p>
<p>The University Co-ed was pleading with me to know whether or not our missionary was
"intelligent" or had "intelligence".  While she didn't use those exact words, she yearned to
know 'IF' the missionary had learned to be obedient.</p>
<p>Let's look at the Lords words in  another very familiar verse:</p>
<p> <em>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, LIGHT and TRUTH</em>
(Doctrine and Covenants 93:36, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Then in the next verse he tells about the value of 'intelligence' what is it?</p>
<p> <em>Light and truth</em> [<strong><em><u>or intelligence</u></em></strong><em><u></u></em><u></u>] <em>forsake</em> [or renounces or turns away] <em>that evil one</em>
(Doctrine and Covenants 93:37).</p>
<p>When the General Authority questioned "Is he worthy --  Is he a priesthood man?  He
might have asked "Can he turn away Lucifer on any date -- or in any circumstance -- 
because he is intelligent?  Because he has "LIGHT AND TRUTH"?</p>
<p>Lucifer (the great spoiler of anything that's good) cannot deal with that kind of a man or
woman.</p>
<p>Look across the page at verse 27 and 28 and the Lord reminds us again  HOW WE
RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE or become empowered to live life with or in "Light and
Truth."</p>
<p> <em>And no man receiveth a fullness unless he keepeth his commandments</em></p>
<p><em>	He that keepeth his commandments receiveth TRUTH AND LIGHT,</em> [intelligence]
<em>until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things</em> (Doctrine and Covenants
93:27-28, emphasis added).</p>
<p>"Intelligence", the kind you will want to have in your life and in the life of the person you
will live the next five million plus years with -- is the kind which comes through
OBEDIENCE.  The price for INTELLIGENCE is simply obedience.  We must learn to be
OBEDIENT!</p>
<p>Look at verse 39.  It tells us how we can lose "Intelligence or light and truth."</p>
<p> <em>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, </em>[or Intelligence] 
<em>through disobedience....</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:39)</p>
<p>Isn't that what  the heart-wrenching call between a stake presidents and mission president
are really is?  The conversation might proceed like this:  "President, our 'missionary' has
lost the light! He has done something 'stupid' or 'un intelligently' made a mistake
because he has been disobedient.  His spiritual stature has not been sufficient to 'forsake
the evil one'.</p>
<p>Now, go back to Section 130:20-21.  Thinking of intelligence or light and truth and its
value in forsaking the evil one let's read</p>
<p> <em>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this
world, upon which all blessings are predicated.</em></p>
<p><em>	And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by OBEDIENCE to that law
upon which it is predicated</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 130:20-21, emphasis added).</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, ARE WE LEARNING?</p>
<p>Once a young woman who was  "sort-of" waiting for a young man serving a mission (do
you know anyone who is "sort of waiting" whatever that means.  This young woman 
innocently and cheerfully made a statement to her father in a private conversation, 
regarding a telephone call she had received from a 'special missionary friend' who was
serving a mission at the time.  Her father said  "so he called you to tell you that he is
having a good mission and that he is being blessed in the work?"  She responded, "Yes,
he's doing great -- he says he misses home and is a little homesick but is doing well and
looks forward to coming home next year".  Her  father carefully suggested to his daughter 
that making such telephone calls was no doubt against mission rules.  He helped her to
see that her 'special friend' had been disobedient in making such a call.  Sisters, you can
be sure that any special missionary you may be interested in has never had and never will 
hear his mission president saying  "Elders, you've done well this past week and to reward
you I want you  call your girlfriend tonight when you return to the apartment" -- or 
"Elders and Sisters I know you're kind of discouraged with the work, maybe a call home
will pep you up and bless you.  I want you to go back to your apartments and CALL
YOUR GIRLFRIEND or Special Friend.  That father invited further consideration by
asking his daughter -- "What does it tell you about a person who will break one of the
simplest and most basic rules of 'mission life'?  With that level of obedience and
commitment to covenants, perhaps he will choose to break other 'rules' or
commandments or commitments later in life -- after he's married?"</p>
<p><strong>Are we learning that Obedience is the first law of Heaven and brings with it
blessings, promises, and power?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em><u>Does He Love?</u></em></strong></p>
<p>The Lord himself has announced that LOVE of God and Fellow Man is the
commandment upon which all others hang.  He has further counseled each of us to
earnestly seek "CHARITY" or the pure of LOVE of Christ as one of our cardinal or most
important virtues.</p>
<p>Let's look in Moroni Chapter 7: 44 ,. These are Moroni's parting words of counsel (which
are actually the words of his father Mormon given in a CONFERENCE address to the
people of the Church in a synagogue) some years before. </p>
<p>	[look about half way down in the verse]<em>...and if a man be meek and lowly in heart,
and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must
needs have charity; for if he have not Charity he is nothing; wherefore he must
needs have charity.</em> (Moroni 7:44)</p>
<p>Then he shares with us what Charity is or what it looks like even here at BYU Idaho:</p>
<p> <em>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up,
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in
iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
all things, and endureth all things.</em></p>
<p><em>	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing!...</em></p>
<p><em>	...charity is the pure love of Christ</em></p>
<p><em>	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, PRAY unto the Father with all the energy of
heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed  upon all who
are TRUE FOLLOWERS of his Son, Jesus Christ...</em> (Moroni 7:45-48, emphasis
added.)</p>
<p>It couldn't be more clear, could it?  CHARITY or LOVE is the one virtue all of us should
seek and pray for.</p>
<p>DO WE SEEK FOR IT?  PRAY FOR IT, and DO WE LOVE?</p>
<p>I am thinking of a missionary.. From the first day I saw his picture on his missionary
application form and read the comments made by his bishop and stake president I knew
we were in for a great blessing.  This missionary was somewhere between being like
Helaman and Shiblon and to my knowledge he never had any Corianton-like course
corrections to make.  He was simply wonderful!  He came to the mission with the greatest
of all desires to be extraordinary, to be like Ammon , Aaron, Omner, Himni, Muloki or
Ammah.  He was as near as I could ever detect as exacting in his obedience as anyone of
the Sons of Helaman that we read of in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>But he struggled for much of the first part of his mission.  He sometimes had a tough time
being tolerant of those who were not as focused.  But, he was one of  (if not 'the' hardest
worker I have ever seen.  I heard other missionaries comment in positive ways, how this
elder would with boldness and without fear, opened his mouth on every MICRO (that's a
bus), in the METRO (that's the subway), at the corner store, and  seized every
opportunity to stop and talk to everyone about the message of the gospel.  </p>
<p>He, in short, was a mission presidents dream.  But he lacked one critical attribute.  
LOVE!  He hadn't come to understand the LOVE of JESUS CHRIST and His atonement
in a personal or empowering way.  He didn't have a LOVE for the Chilean People. He
didn't LOVE many of His Less Perfect Companions.  I sensed his motives were rooted in
being 100% (or more if that's possible) in fulfilling the DUTY of his calling more than
DOING things for his LOVE OF GOD and OF HIS FELLOW MAN.</p>
<p>We spoke openly about his challenge in interviews and on other occasions.  He
understood and acknowledged the void he felt. Characteristic of his wonderful nature -- 
he took counsel from His mission president but mostly from the Spirit.  He engaged in the
process identified by Mormon when he counseled his son.  He prayed with all the energy
of his heart.  I have no doubt that included in his every prayer was a supplication to feel
and have the LOVE of God and for man in his heart.  I know that he fasted and sought
with every fiber of his being 'to be filled with this LOVE'.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you of all his personal and private efforts -- but I can tell you, that he
received an answer to his pleadings to the Father.  After months of struggling -- it came.  
You could see a new sense of kindness, his capacity to suffer longer increased, his faith
increased, and he was less concerned about himself and the fulfillment of DUTY.  He
became a total and a complete missionary.  To me he seemed to receive in his
countenance, an image of Christ.  The power of the Holy Ghost came into his life.  It
were as though the prophetic words of Parley P. Pratt came alive in the life of this
missionary, when he said:</p>
<p> <em>The Gift of the Holy Ghost quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases,
enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections. It inspires,
develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes,
kindred feelings, and affections of our nature.  It inspires virtue, kindness,
goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity.  It develops beauty of person, form,
and features.  It tends to health, vigor,  animation, and social feeling.  It
invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man.  It strengthens,
and gives tone to the nerves.  In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to
the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.  (Key to
the Science of Theology, 9<sup>th</sup> Edition 1965 p 101.)</em></p>
<p>Somehow, because of the desire and prayerful pleadings of the missionary, the Holy
Ghost was somehow released to purify his motives and cultivate a SPIRIT of LOVE in
his heart.   His  sense of  "DUTY" to be a great missionary (which is a good thing)  was
replaced with a profound LOVE of God and Everyone Else!!!!</p>
<p>Brothers and SistersÂ…Â…</p>
<p>Do we LOVE?  Do we pray for it, seek it, and do what it takes to allow the Holy Ghost to
activate it?</p>
<p>Do we Love?</p>
<p>The next and last question.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Are we lifters?</u></em></strong><em><u></u></em><u></u></p>
<p>Someone once said that "The difference between being good and great. Is that good
people are inclined toward being  good for good sake.Great people are GOOD not only
because they desire to be good but have a greater desire to be good for someone else!</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson once said:</p>
<p> <em>The man who is Greatest and Most Blessed and Joyful is the one whose life most
closely approaches the pattern of Christ.  This has nothing to do with earthly
wealth, power, or prestige.  The only true test of greatness, blessedness,
joyfulness is how close can a life come to being like the Master, Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p>Jesus Christ was and is the 'Master Lifter.'  Are we trying to approach His pattern of
'lifting others'?  That is a topic for another day and certainly a lifetime quest isn't it?</p>
<p>May I draw upon one more example I observed in our mission to illustrate:</p>
<p>I will forever remember a missionary who was sent to our mission to be a great trial to his
mission president and help me learn patience.  He was nearly 27 years of age and came to
the mission with much of the wrong kind of experiences in life and I am convinced that
he was sent on a mission by wonderful priesthood leaders as a 'last hope strategy' to save
his soul.  He did not like North Americans, His President, Mission Rules, nor talks in
Zone Conference about obedience.  The  Chile Area Presidency had challenged us as
Mission Presidents  to help our Latin missionaries learn English.  You can only image ..
(no you probably can't) how he felt about that.  He challenged every bit of counsel I gave. 
 Though in our many many interviews, he promised to try to be better and more compliant
to do things the LORD'S WAY, within a few weeks he failed in his resolve and returned
to his OWN WAY.  After many visits with him and invitations to 'have a mighty change
in his heart' -- (or any kind of change for the better).  In time, I received permission and
advice from the Area Presidency to send him home at anytime the Spirit dictated that I
should.  I counseled with his Stake President (in one of those 'other kind' of telephone
calls)  and we agreed that this missionary  was likely only a 'telephone call away' from
going home at some point in the future.</p>
<p>However our LOVE for him, The Lords Love for him, and I am sure that the answers to
the prayers of his aging and faithful parents prevented me from doing so four or five
times during the first 15 months of his mission.</p>
<p>However, one day while LOVE was still in my heart, PATIENCE ran out!!!  After
learning from his zone leader of something he  had done,  I turned to the missionary
serving as my secretary and with some emotion (I confess) I asked him to purchase an
airline ticket, that the moment had arrived this missionary would be going home.  I
instructed that I had already conducted all the interviews with this missionary that I
intended to have, that I had warned him of the consequences of his actions so many times,
that I had done all I could.  I requested that he return home, without honor, on the next
plane.</p>
<p>To my Assistants I turned and instructed them to go find him (if they could), inform him,
help him get packed, and make sure he was at the airport on time to meet his flight.</p>
<p>As the office staff left my office, there was a "still" and a profound silence in the office
corridor as they moved around shuffling papers and doing what was necessary to do what
I had asked.  Few words were spoken  among them and a kind of 'thick' silence
prevailed.</p>
<p>A few long quiet minutes passed and then one of my assistants (who had just recently
been called to serve as my assistant and would normally continue in that assignment for
two to four more months), meekly and humbly approached the door of my office asking
me if he could talk to me alone for a minute.</p>
<p>Certainly I said.</p>
<p>He stood quiet for a few precious moments not knowing how to say what he wanted to
say and then reverently said "Presidente, por favor -- Please don't send him home!"</p>
<p>With a tear now in his eye he once again begged, "please don't send him home.  We just
can't let him go home like this.  Going home like this will ruin his life.  You know what
will happen if he goes home like this.  Presidente, I will do anything you tell me to do but
I am respectfully asking you to release me as your assistant (remember he's just begun his
time as service as my assistant).  Please release me and let me be his companion and let
us try again, and again, and even again, if necessary.</p>
<p>No, I shall never forget the image of this humble latin missionary standing one day in a
mission office in Santiago Chile (at about noon) with the LOVE of CHRIST in his brown 
eyes pleading for the chance to LIFT and serve his undeserving and six years older
associate.  I just will never forget that image -- nor the feelings I felt that day.</p>
<p>After a kneeling  prayer together, followed by continued personal soul searching, and
seeking the advice of the Area Presidency -- a few hours later the will of the Lord
dictated that I release my assistant and continue on with an effort to LIFT our confused
associate.  The process of his going home was aborted.  We made the necessary changes, 
and Elder Ramirez went out to serve his new companion. </p>
<p>In the days, weeks, then months that followed the missionary CHANGED.  I can't tell
you for sure how -- but His younger companion, the Spirit, and love changed and lifted
him.  It was one of those miracles you always hope for.  He changed.  In time he was
trusted enough to become a trainer.  He finished his mission.  He expressed almost
weekly, verbally and in writing, his love and gratitude for me and my companion Sister
Christensen.  He spoke of Jesus Christ and the atonement in his interviews.  Our love for
him changed and expanded too.  And this missionary who once had an extreme dislike for 
North Americans.  Stood to share his final testimony with nearly one hundred
missionaries (75% North American) by expressing his love for them.  He thanked them
for their patience and expressed his love for the Lord and his mission.  It was simple and
undiluted and he gave it in English).  A few weeks after his return home, I was in
attendance at area meetings, where his stake president sought me out to inform me that
this "Several-times-almost-sent-home-without-honor-and-then- finally-Honorably-Released-Returned-Missionary" had been called to the High Council in his stake in
Southern Chile and was serving excellently and enthusiastically.  He has since been
married and sealed in the temple.</p>
<p>I am thankful for LIFTERS!</p>
<p>In paraphrased words of President Benson:</p>
<p>"The person who is Greatest and Most Blessed and Joyful is the one whose life most
closely approaches the pattern of the MASTER LIFTER Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>What can we do today -- before this day closes to LIFT someone?</p>
<p>In the words of Alma, one more time:</p>
<p>	And now behold, I ask you, my brethren of the church, </p>
<p>May someone, sometime, if the situation ever calls for it on this side of the veil (or
certainly in the next when our advocate with the Father pleads our individual cause.  It is
my prayer that  answers to the questions  "Has he or she learned?"  "Does he/she love?"</p>
<p>And "Is he/she a lifter?" That it may be said of each of us:</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost will stir our hearts and nudge us in the right direction.  The Lord will
help and empower us through our faith in him and the atonement to make needed course
corrections.  May we DO it!!!!  Is my prayer and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px"><font face="Times New Roman">My dear brothers and sisters, it's a great honor for me to stand before you for a few minutes
today and share with you my feelings about some of the truly important things in life. I would
like to begin with a scripture found in the 43rd Section of the Doctrine and Covenants given
at Kirtland, Ohio to the Prophet Joseph Smith in February 1831 when he was just twenty-six
years old. Here we are told in verse 8, "And now behold, I give unto you a commandment,
that when ye are assembled together, ye shall instruct and edify each other,..."</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, I would like to teach you something today by way of instruction, but more
importantly, it is my desire that I might edify you. If I'm successful, you will leave this
devotional with the resolve to change your life in some fashion and be better. I have pled
with the Lord that this might occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The story is told of a man in a small village who because of his ingenuity and intelligence
owned a very prosperous fish market. One day one of his customers came to him and said,
"Everyone in our village knows that you are extremely bright and very successful. What is
it  that has made you so smart?" Without even pausing to reflect, the man replied, "It's the
fishheads." "You mean," said the customer "that if I eat fishheads I'll be smarter?" "That's
correct," said the shop owner. "How much do they cost?" asked the man. "They're $5.00 a 
head," said the owner. Wanting to grow smarter, the customer said, "give me three of them,"
and he placed $15.00 on the counter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The next day the customer was back in the fish market. "I ate those fish heads," he said, "and
not only were they terrible, but I don't feel any smarter." "You didn't eat enough of  them,"
replied the shop owner. "How many do I need to eat?" asked the customer. "You need to  eat
at least ten of them," said the man. Thereupon, the customer put $50.00 on the counter and
walked out of the shop with ten more fishheads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The following day he was back. In disgust, he said that he had eaten all ten of those
fishheads. "They were absolutely horrible," he said. "Why for that amount of money I could
have bought ten entire large fish." "See," said the shop owner. "You're getting smarter
already!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I must tell you that my goal today is to make you smarter -- even to edify you -- that you
might in some way change and improve your life. I assure you, however, that this will not
occur as a result of your eating fishheads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Doctrine and Covenants 130:20-21 we are told, "There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the
foundations of this world upon which all blessings are predicated, and when we obtain any
blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, this is a pure law of physics. Most simply stated, it is "the law of cause
and effect," or as the gospel tells us, "<u>we will reap what we sow</u>." Everyone-- your  parents,
your teachers, your church leaders, and especially I today for the few minutes I stand before
you, want you to reap the wonderful blessings of the gospel because you have been great
sowers! How does this occur?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you realize how critical right now, and the next few years of your life, are to you? Many
of you within the last few months or a year or so have left the comforts, and security, of
home and have launched out on this exiting adventure we call life. For the first time you are
truly away from, and if you choose, free from the daily influence of your parents. You go to
bed when you want; you get up when you want; you go where you want to go, and you
basically do what you want to do. Are not the choices you are making right now choices that
will, to a great extent, determine what will happen to you for the rest of your life? You now
must choose. Will you be true to the Church and serve faithfully where- and whenever you
might be called? Will you be honest? There is so much dishonesty in the world. Will you go
on a mission? And will you go for the right reason? Whom will you marry? Will that
marriage be honorable and in the temple? What will you study? What career path will you
choose? Brothers and sisters, these are truly some of the most important decisions you will
ever make, not only in this life, but throughout the eternities. And now, and during the next
few years, you will be making these critical decisions. Let me give you some food for
thought to help you in making such important decisions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The scriptures don't say much about the Savior from the age of twelve until he began his
three-year ministry at the age of thirty. What they do say, however, has been a great guide
for me throughout my life. In Luke 2:52 we are told, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature and in favor with God and man." This scripture points out a <u>fourfold development of
the Savior</u> which I believe is also significant for us. May I discuss briefly with you each of
these four elements of development.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">First, as the Savior did, we must increase in wisdom. This means that we must continually
be growing intellectually. The 93rd Section of the Doctrine and Covenants tells us in verse 36 that "the glory
of god is intelligence." The 130th Section tells us in verses 18 and 19 that "Whatever
principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And
if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and
obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." In Doctrine
and Covenants 90 verse 15 we are told to "study and learn and become acquainted with all good books, and
with languages, tongues and people." To me, the scriptures are very clear that our gaining an
education and thereby increasing our wisdom, is a very important part of our lives. May I
assume that you feel that way because you have come to BYU-Idaho first and foremost to
learn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I am the first of any in my family as far back as I know to have graduated from college. I owe
this accomplishment to my father who although he had no formal education, was one of the
brightest men I have ever met. My father was a completely self taught man. Within a few
weeks after he had purchased a saxophone as a young teenager, he was playing dances
professionally and earning money. My father was an absolute genius in electronics and could
literally repair anything electrical. I will always remember and never forget his applying for
a job with the then Atomic Energy Commission now called INEL to work in electronics.
Upon reading the letter of offer, my father sat down on our sofa and literally put his head in
his hands and shed tears. He was told in that letter that there were no openings in electronics
because he had no qualifications. However, the letter said there was an opening for a
dishwasher. Can you imagine how my father felt? Can you understand why he became so
insistent that I take advantage of my educational opportunities. How thankful I am for that
support and encouragement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Are you doing all you can while here at BYU-Idaho to increase in wisdom and prepare
yourselves for what the future will certainly bring? I hope so. That is what the Savior did
between the ages of twelve and thirty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to increasing in wisdom, the Savior increased in stature. This means, of course,
that he was healthy as he grew into his marvelous manhood. Are you healthy, and are you
focusing on things that will make you healthy throughout your lives? Upon returning from
our mission in former Yugoslavia last summer the first thing Sister Strong and I noticed
when we landed in Chicago was how many truly obese people we saw walking throughout
the airport.  When we landed in Salt Lake, it seemed we saw even more. Brothers and sisters,
one of the major epidemics of our time is obesity which, for the most part, is caused because
of the unhealthy life style most Americans live. How are you doing in your attempts to be
healthy?  For most of you it's not much of a problem right now. Let me assure you, however,
that as you age, for most of you it will become one of your primary concerns. In an article
I recently read in the October 2002 Ensign it stated that "In 1995 the Institute of Medicine
reported that 59 percent of Americans were clinically obese (at least 20 percent over their
ideal weight)." Since returning home from my mission, I have been amazed at the number
of  reports I have both read  and heard on radio and television about alarming increases in
heart attacks, diabetes, strokes, and myriad other maladies. From all I have gleaned, many
of these illnesses are directly related to our life style, and especially to what and how much
we eat. Are you going to be part of those statistics later in your lives? I am sixty-three years
old, and I must tell you that with few exceptions, I exercise at least five times a week. I don't
do this because I want to die healthy; I do it because I want to live healthy and be able to
enjoy those things in life that good health can bring, especially in later life. In the words of
the scriptures, are you increasing in stature, or are you increasing in girth because of a very
sedentary life style? I am personally positive that our wonderful Word of Wisdom goes far
beyond our traditional avoidance of coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco. May your focus during
these critical early years in your life bring you to a correct understanding of the importance
of increasing in stature as I know the Savior did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to increasing in wisdom and stature, the Savior also increased in favor with God
and with man. May I address first my feelings about what we might do to increase in favor
with man. For me, this aspect of the Savior's life deals with the social graces we develop as
we interact with one another. There is little doubt in my mind that while he was growing up,
the Savior mastered the social customs of his time and place. He certainly knew how to carry
himself as he ministered throughout the Holy Land. How are you doing in your attempts to
increase in favor with man? In other words, how are your social graces? I must be honest
with you that as I move about the campus I frequently see and hear things that are disturbing
to me. Dress in many cases is inappropriate. I often see semi-unshaven, shabbily dressed men
wearing caps over unkempt hair walking about the halls between classes. I see young women
wearing clothing that to me is very suggestive because their slightest movement exposes not-so-tiny peeks of a bare midriff. I wish you sisters knew what that can do to the thoughts of
a young man. Please know that by so dressing, you are not increasing in favor with moral
LDS men.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I often hear language in the halls that is, in my opinion, semi-crude and certainly socially
inappropriate. People, for example, talking about our Prophet will sometimes refer to him
as "Hinckley." On occasion, I have had students address me by my first name. Brothers and
sisters, I am not a prude, but such things offend me. I am disappointed when young men don't
stand to shake either my or my wife's hand. I am disappointed when my wife and I are
referred to as "you guys." I may be a guy, but my wife certainly is not. There are other things
I could but will not mention. Watch closely and listen carefully to our leaders and emulate
their social behavior. I suspect you will never hear President Bednar refer to you as being
"cool guys." Remember, with a bit of luck, and a little time, you are in the process of
becoming just like your parents and other leaders. I hope that's not an objectionable thought.
We adults pray for you to develop social graces by doing as the Savior did: growing in favor
with man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, I pray for you to grow in favor with God. This, of course, has to do with our
testimonies and our feelings about sacred things. How are you doing? In a meeting I attended
in the mission field with Elder Holland, he said that the Prophet is almost embarrassed to say
there are eleven million members of our Church. In fact, he said, there are far, even millions,
less than that who hold current temple recommends and are faithful to the covenants they
have made. Where do you stand?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you pray morning and night? Do you read the scriptures every day even when you are not
taking a religion class? Are you honest? No matter what you are, if you are not honest, you
are nothing. What do you do when you are all alone and there is no one except you and the
Lord to see your behavior? That is when the real "you" can be seen. It's not when you are out
in public and putting on airs as so many people do. Maybe the most important thing we can
do in this life as we mature is to be in favor with God. It has been my experience that when
that is happening, almost every other aspect of our lives falls into place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">My brothers and sisters, I pray that you are beginning to understand the importance I am
placing on the Savior's example. I hope you will think seriously about patterning your own
life after that example. If you do, you will constantly think, strive, and pray about growing
in wisdom, growing in stature, growing in favor with God, and growing in favor with man.
You will think about the many implications that such an example can bring into your lives.
When and if this happens, your behavior will change, and you will become a better, more
Christ-like person.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In October 1994 just a few months before President Hinckley became our Prophet, he gave
a conference address in the priesthood session entitled "Don't Drop the Ball." That talk, I
believe, has great applicability to what I have been sharing with you. He began his address
by telling a true baseball story he said he was reminded of sometime earlier while watching
a TV program on PBS. He said the event occurred in the World Series of 1912 between the
Boston Red Sox and the New York Giants. It was an eight-game series because one of the
games had been called at midpoint because of darkness. Playing fields were not electrically
lighted at that time. It was the last game, and the score was tied 1-1. The Red Sox were at
bat. A Boston batter knocked a high fly. Two New York players ran for it. Fred Snodgrass
at center field signaled to the other player that he would make the catch. He came squarely
under the ball, which fell into his glove, but then went right on through and fell to the
ground. As you can imagine, a howl went up in the stands. The roaring fans couldn't believe
that Snodgrass had dropped the ball. He had caught hundreds of fly balls before; but now,
at this crucial moment, he dropped the ball in a World Series game. The New York Giants
lost the game and the Red Sox won the series.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">President Hinckley said that Fred Snodgrass came back the following season and played
brilliant ball for nine more years. He lived to be eighty-six years old, dying in 1974.
However, after that one slip in 1912, for the next sixty-two years when he was introduced to
anybody, the expected response was always, "Oh, yes, you're the one who dropped the ball
during the World Series with the Red Sox."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 1929 Rose Bowl football game a player named Roy Riegels recovered a fumble and
ran almost the length of the field in the wrong direction toward the opposing team's goal line.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He was ultimately tackled and brought down by one of his own team, preventing his making
a touchdown for the other team. Somehow Roy Riegels had lost his sense of direction in a
moment of stress. His mistake cost his team the victory. Roy Riegels was a great football
player. He lived to be eighty-four, but after his one Rose Bowl mistake he was ever afterward
remembered as the man who ran the wrong way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, President Hinckley tells us that this phenomenon is not peculiar to
sports. It happens every day in life. There is the student who thinks he is doing well enough,
and then under the stress of the final exam, he flunks out. There is the driver who all of his
life has had a flawless driving record and then in a moment of carelessness is involved in a
tragic accident. There is the trusted employee whose performance has been excellent, and
then he succumbs to the temptation to steal a little from his employer. A mark is placed upon
him which never seems to entirely disappear. There is the life lived with decency, says the
Prophet, and then comes the destructive, ever-haunting, one-time moral letdown. There is
the outburst of anger that suddenly destroys a long-cherished relationship. There is the little
sin that somehow grows and eventually leads to separation from the Church. In all of these
examples, President Hinckley tells us that someone somehow dropped the ball. Someone had
the self-confidence, possibly even the arrogance, to think that they didn't really have to try,
that they could make it with only half an effort. But the ball passed through their hands and
hit the ground, and they gave away the game. Or they made a smart catch of someone else's
fumble and ran the wrong way, only to give victory to their opponents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, what President Hinckley is telling us is that we must constantly be alert.
We must be unrelenting in our self-discipline. In reality, we must do as the Savior did: be
constantly increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">May I share with you a story given by Elder Jeffrey Holland in the October 1980 New Era
which clearly demonstrates what can happen to a person when life's focus turns to increasing
in wisdom and stature and finding favor with God and man. This is the story of one Eli
Peirce. Elder Holland says, "If there is one lament I cannot abide, it is the poor, pitiful,
withered cry, "Well, that's just the way I am." I have heard that from too many people who
wanted to sin and call it psychology. You can change anything you want to change, and you
can do it very fast. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say "I'll change"--and
mean it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As you know, the Brethren used to announce in general conference the names of those who
had been called on missions. Not only was this the way friends and neighbors learned of the
call, more often than not it was the way the missionary learned of it as well. One such
prospect was Eli H. Peirce. A railroad man by trade, he had not been very faithful in Church
meetings, "even had my inclinations led in that direction, which I frankly confess they did
not," he admitted. His mind had been given totally to what he demurely calls "temporalities."
He said he had never read more than a few pages of scripture in his life, that he had spoken
to only one public gathering (an effort which he says "was no credit to himself' or those who
heard him), and he used the vernacular of the railroad and bar room with a finesse born of
long practice. He bought cigars wholesale--a thousand at a time-and he regularly lost his
paycheck playing pool. Then this classic understatement: "Nature never endowed me with
a superabundance of religious sentiment or veneration; my region of spirituality was not
high, but below the average." Well, the Lord knew what Eli Peirce was, and he knew
something else. He knew what Eli Peirce could become.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the call came that October 5, 1875, Eli wasn't even in the Tabernacle. He was out
working on one of the railroad lines. A fellow employee, once he recovered from the shock
of it all, ran out to telegraph the startling news. Brother Peirce writes, "At the very moment
this intelligence was being flashed over the wires, I was sitting lazily thrown back in an
office rocking chair, my feet on the desk, reading a novel and simultaneously sucking an old
Dutch pipe, just to vary the monotony of cigar smoking. As soon as I had been informed of
what had taken place, I threw the novel in the waste basket, the pipe in the corner and started
up town to buy scriptures. Have never read a novel nor smoked a pipe from that hour. Sent
in my resignation...to take effect at once, in order that I might have time for study and
preparation." Then these stirring words: "Remarkable as it may seem, and has since appeared
to me, a thought of disregarding the call, or of refusing to comply with the requirement, never
once entered my mind. The only question I asked myself a thousand times ... was:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"How can I accomplish this mission? How can I, who am so shamefully ignorant and
untaught in doctrine, do honor to God and justice to the souls of men, and merit the trust
reposed in me by the Priesthood?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">With such genuine humility fostering resolution rather than defeating it, Eli Peirce fulfilled
a remarkable mission. His journal could appropriately close on a completely renovated life
with this one line: "Throughout our entire mission we were greatly blessed."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">During the course of his mission, Brother Peirce was called in to administer to the infant of
a branch president whom he knew and loved. Unfortunately the wife had become embittered
and seriously objected to any blessing being given. With the mother refusing to leave the
bedside and the child too ill to move, the two brethren retired to a small upper room in the
house to pray for the baby. Suspecting just such an act, the mother sent one of the older
children to observe and report back. In the upper room the two men knelt and prayed until
they felt the child would live. Arising from their knees, they saw the young girl standing in
the doorway gazing into the room. She stood entranced for some seconds, and then she said,
"Papa, who was that man in there?" "Brother Peirce" was the answer. "No," she said, "I mean
that other man." "There was no other," said her father. "Oh yes there was," the child  insisted,
"I saw him standing above you and Brother Peirce, and he was all dressed in white."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now if God in his heavens will do that for a repentant, old cigar-smoking, inactive, stern
swearing pool player, don't you think he'll do it for you? He will if your resolve is as deep
and permanent as Eli Peirce's. In this church we ask for faith, not infallibility."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">May I share with you a poem entitled "A Fence or an Ambulance" by Joseph
Malius.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,<br />
      Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant.<br />
      But over its terrible edge there had slipped<br />
      Full many a youthful peasant.<br />
      So the people said something would have to be done,<br />
      But their projects did not at all tally;<br />
      Some said, "Put a fence 'round the top of the cliff."<br />
      Some, "An ambulance down in the valley!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,<br />
For it spread through the neighboring city.<br />
A fence may be useful or not, it is true;<br />
But their hearts became brimful of pity<br />
For those who slipped over the dangerous cliff.<br />
And the dwellers in highway and alley,<br />
Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,<br />
But an ambulance down in the valley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"For the cliff is alright, if you're careful," they said,<br />
"And if folks even slip, or are dropping,<br />
It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much<br />
As the shock down below, when they're stopping!"<br />
So day after day as these mishaps occurred,<br />
Quick forth would their rescuers sally<br />
To pick up the victims who fell from the cliff,<br />
With their ambulance down in the valley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then an old sage remarked, "It's a marvel to me<br />
That people give far more attention<br />
To repairing results than to stopping the cause,<br />
When they'd much better aim at prevention.<br />
Let us stop at its source all this nonsense," he cried.<br />
"Come neighbors and friends, let us rally.<br />
If the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense<br />
With the ambulance down in the valley!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh he's a fanatic!" the others rejoined.<br />
"Dispense with the ambulance? Never!<br />
He'd dispense with all charities too, if he could!<br />
No, no, we'll support them forever.<br />
Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?<br />
And shall this man dictate to us, shall he?<br />
Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence<br />
When the ambulance works in the valley?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But a sensible few, who are practical too,<br />
Will not bear with such nonsense much longer.<br />
They believe that prevention is better than cure,<br />
And their party will still be the stronger.<br />
Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,<br />
And while other philanthropists dally,<br />
They'll scorn all pretence and put up a fence<br />
Round the cliff that hangs over the valley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Better guard well the young, than reclaim them when old,<br />
For the voice of true wisdom is calling.<br />
To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best<br />
To prevent other people from falling.<br />
Let us close up the source of temptation and crime<br />
Than deliver from dungeon and galley.<br />
Better put a strong fence 'round the top of the cliff,<br />
Than an ambulance down in the valley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, today I have tried to build some fences for you that will prevent the
ambulances of life from coming to your aid because you have chosen unwisely and
figuratively fallen. I have tried to give you some suggestions that will help you not to drop
some of the major balls of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841-1935) who was an Associate Justice on the United States
Supreme Court from 1902-1932 was riding on a train, and when the conductor came by to
pick up his ticket, the Justice couldn't find it. Recognizing Mr. Holmes as being very famous,
the conductor said, "I'm sure, Mr. Holmes, that you will be able to find your ticket when you
return home. I am certain that the Pennsylvania Railroad can get by without that ticket until
you find it. Why don't you just mail it to us?" "Young man," said Mr. Holmes, "You don't
understand. The problem is not where is my ticket; it's where am I going?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I conclude today by asking you the same question. Where are you going in this life? Alma
tells us in chapter 34:32, "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God;
yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors." I say to you that
now is the time. The decisions you are making now, and the decisions you will make in the
next few years, will be the most important you will ever make. They can, and will, build the
fences you need to keep from falling into the valley. They can, and will, keep you from
dropping the ball.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I pray for you to do as the Savior did: To increase in wisdom and in stature and in favor with
God and with man. I bear testimony to you that our church is true. I bear testimony to you
that President Hinckley is a living prophet. I also bear testimony to you that the principles
I have shared with you today are true, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>
