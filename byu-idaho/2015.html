<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a joy to be with you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us as we consider together the power of the word of God and faith in Jesus Christ in our lives.</p>
<p>Most of you presently are living in what Elder Robert D. Hales has called the "Decade of Decision."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn1" target="_self">[1]</a>&nbsp; It is a personally significant time in which you face decisions about education, dating, marriage, employment, and children.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn2" target="_self">[2]</a>&nbsp; You also are making decisions almost every day about personal prayer, scripture study, keeping covenants, and serving the Lord.&nbsp; These daily decisions establish a pattern of attitude and behavior that also will have a profound influence on your lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you seek to be a true follower of Christ, you have to make all of these decisions righteously in the face of diabolical opposition.&nbsp; Satan uses the temptations of pride and physical appetite to try to lure you into sin against God.&nbsp; He hurls at you his fiery darts of discouragement, doubt, fear, ridicule, scorn, and distraction to try to stop you from doing the good things God wants done.<br /><br />Making righteous decisions in the face of such opposition is all part of our Heavenly Father's plan. He prepared for us a Savior and Redeemer, even His Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; When we face decisions of such consequence, large or small, we are not alone.<br /><br />Many years ago Elder Neal A. Maxwell gave us wonderful counsel about making and implementing righteous decisions with the help of the Savior. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Real disciples absorb the fiery darts of the adversary by holding aloft the quenching shield of faith with one hand, while holding to the iron rod with the other.&nbsp; There should be no mistaking; it will take both hands!<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"></a>I want to talk to you today about the iron rod and the shield of faith.&nbsp; We will consider the light and power that is in the word of God and the protection and strength that come through faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; When our grasp on the iron rod is strong and we move forward with the shield of faith firmly in hand, the Savior will "quench . . . the fiery darts" of the adversary,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn4" target="_self">[4]</a>&nbsp;illuminate our path,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn5" target="_self">[5]</a>&nbsp;redeem us from sin and darkness, and strengthen us on our journey to peace and happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the iron rod.</p>
<p><strong>The Iron Rod</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The iron rod appears in Lehi's dream recorded in the eighth chapter of<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1 Nephi.&nbsp; In the dream, the rod "extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree [of everlasting life]"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn6" target="_self">[6]</a>&nbsp;whose fruit was "desirable above all other fruit."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn7" target="_self">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is the love of God manifest in His Only Begotten Son.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn8" target="_self">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fruit is the fruit of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn9" target="_self">[9]</a><br /><br />The iron rod is the word of God.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn10" target="_self">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Father's great plan of happiness and salvation.&nbsp; The word of God gives us eternal principles applicable to all mankind and very personal guidance, comfort, and instruction.&nbsp; The word of God may come in the scriptures, in the words of the living prophets, and in personal revelation.&nbsp; In whatever form it comes, and whatever message God has for us, the word of God always leads us to Christ.<br /><br />Jesus said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn11" target="_self"></a>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel . . . .<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn12" target="_self"></a>The Holy Ghost carries the light and truth of the gospel "unto the hearts" of those who hear or read it.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn13" target="_self">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When people receive it with a heart open to the Spirit, the word has great power.</p>
<p>Consider these words of prophets about that power:&nbsp;</p>
<p>There truly is light and power in the word of God.&nbsp; With this in mind, it is instructive that the rod in Lehi's dream is made of iron.&nbsp; Iron conducts electricity.&nbsp; The iron rod, therefore, is like the third rail in a subway system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a subway system there are two rails that carry the wheels of the train.&nbsp; They are like the path in Lehi's dream.&nbsp; But there is a third rail that carries the electric current that powers and lights the train.&nbsp; There is a device on the train that connects to the third rail.&nbsp; The device allows the current to flow to the lights that illuminate the train and its path and to the electric motors that move the train forward.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Lehi's dream, the iron rod conducts the spiritual light and power of the word of God. We take hold of the rod when we make covenants with God.&nbsp; If we keep our covenants, we move forward on the path with a strong grip on the rod.&nbsp; We establish a firm and sure connection, and the light and power of the word flow into our lives.&nbsp; We receive knowledge, understanding, insights, guidance, and warnings that help us make decisions and take action in accord with the will of the Lord.&nbsp; We receive gifts and blessings, encouragement, commandments, and true, eternal principles by the grace of Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />We cannot loosely hold on to the rod, nor can we let go and expect to receive that kind of light and power.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn18" target="_self">[18]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nephi's account of the dream, only those who "continually [held] fast to the rod of iron"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn19" target="_self">[19]</a>&nbsp;made their way through the mists of darkness, obtained the precious fruit of the tree of life, and gave no heed to the scorn and ridicule from the great and spacious building.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn20" target="_self">[20]</a><br /><br />Holding fast to the iron rod, grabbing on to it tightly with a strong connection, means that we receive and keep the ordinances and covenants of salvation.&nbsp; It means that we obey God's commandments.&nbsp; It means that we feast on the words of Christ&mdash;that we read, study, and search the scriptures every day.&nbsp; It means that we pray morning and night in gratitude and in faith.&nbsp; It means that we worship in the temple, serve in the kingdom, and renew our covenants in the sacrament.&nbsp; It means that we look to Christ and follow Him.<br /><br />I had an experience many years ago that taught me the power that is in the word of God and the importance of strengthening our grip on the iron rod.&nbsp; One morning, during a very difficult time in our family, I sought direction from the Lord.&nbsp; I opened the sixth chapter of Ephesians in which Paul writes about the armor of God, and I read these verses:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn21" target="_self"></a>When I read those words, I felt a powerful impression of the Spirit.&nbsp; This was the Lord's answer to my prayers:&nbsp; I needed to put on the&nbsp;<em>whole</em>armor of God and strengthen my grip on the iron rod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I prayed diligently about that message, and the Lord answered my prayers.&nbsp; He showed me what I needed to stop doing and what I needed to start doing in order to put on the whole armor of God.&nbsp; I followed that counsel; and the Lord blessed me with increased light, understanding, and faith in Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Which brings me to that great companion of the iron rod, the shield of faith.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Shield of Faith</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel.&nbsp; The scriptures teach us that "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn22" target="_self">[22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, "if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn23" target="_self">[23]</a><br /><br />Like His church, faith in Jesus Christ is both true and living.&nbsp; It is true because it is centered in the reality that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp; It is living because faith is a principle of action and power, and it can grow within us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Faith in Christ brings an assurance of the truth of all that He has done, all that He does now, and all that He will do to bring about the Father's great plan of salvation for you and for me.&nbsp; These are the "things" of Christ in which we have hope, for which we have assurance and evidence, and which are true.&nbsp;<br /><br />We learn about the things of Christ by holding fast to the iron rod.&nbsp; The scriptures, the words of living prophets, and the whisperings of the Spirit all testify of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and His glorious resurrection.&nbsp; Listen to the Savior's own words of testimony and invitation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God.&nbsp; I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am the light and the life of the world.&nbsp; I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn24" target="_self"></a>Brothers and sisters, our faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He is the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; Our faith is in Him, and our faith is true.&nbsp; It is also living.&nbsp; Faith in Jesus Christ inspires us to action and qualifies us for the blessings of divine power.</p>
<p>Faith in Christ comes with spiritual assurance and spiritual feelings of love, gratitude, and reverence for Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We have read and felt the Savior's own words about His suffering and His character:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit&mdash;and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink&mdash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn25" target="_self"></a>Jesus did not shrink from horrible agony and terrible suffering and pain.&nbsp; Because of our faith in the Savior, we have confidence in His love, kindness, patience, and power.&nbsp; We have reverence for His suffering and love and gratitude for Him.</p>
<p>This means that our faith in Christ is a righteous force motivating us to do what the Lord wants done.&nbsp; When we act with faith in Christ, our faith lives in us; our faith grows; and divine light and power flow into our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Elder David A. Bednar has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . faith in Christ leads to righteous action, which increases our spiritual capacity and power.&nbsp; Understanding that faith is a principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our moral agency in compliance with gospel truth, invites the redeeming and strengthening<em>powers</em>&nbsp;of the Savior's Atonement into our lives, and enlarges the&nbsp;<em>power</em>&nbsp;within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn26" target="_self"></a>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a gift from God that we must use and nurture if it is to live and grow.&nbsp; If we do not act on our faith, it will wither and die.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn27" target="_self">[27]</a>&nbsp; As James taught, faith in Christ without the works of Christ is dead.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>
<p>True and living faith in Jesus Christ is the shield in the armor of God that "[quenches] . . . the fiery darts"&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn29" target="_self">[29]</a>&nbsp;of the adversary.&nbsp; When we face significant decisions or challenges, we may feel fiery darts of temptation, scorn, ridicule, fear, doubt, and discouragement.&nbsp; Acting with faith in Christ will quench those darts.<br /><br />We see that principle in action in the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;chapter of Mosiah when an angel appeared to Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah and called them to repentance. &nbsp;Alma fell to the earth and suffered for three days the "pains of a damned soul,"&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn30" target="_self">[30]</a>&nbsp;including the fiery darts of fear, doubt, hopelessness, and despair.<br /><br />In the midst of that suffering, there came a moment when Alma caught hold of the iron rod.&nbsp; He remembered the teaching of his father about Jesus Christ, and that memory gave him hope.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn31" target="_self">[31]</a>&nbsp; Alma chose to act on his new, tender faith in Christ.&nbsp; He cried in his heart, "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn32" target="_self"></a>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn33" target="_self"></a>Alma's exercise of agency to turn to Christ with faith in His redeeming power activated the shield of faith.&nbsp; The light and power of Christ flowed into Alma's soul and quenched the fiery darts.&nbsp; Alma's pain, doubt, fear, and hopelessness were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ is our shield against the fiery darts of the wicked.&nbsp; As the Lord Himself taught the Prophet Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I call upon the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to thresh the nations by the power of my Spirit;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their shield . . . .<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn34" target="_self"></a>It is the light and power of Christ that "quenches . . . the fiery darts."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn35" target="_self">[35]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;That light and power come through the iron rod.&nbsp; When our grip on the rod is strong and firm and when we act with faith in Christ, His light and power flow into us and into the great shield of faith.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn36" target="_self">[36]</a>&nbsp; As Elder Maxwell taught us, when we have one hand firmly on the iron rod and one hand holding aloft the shield of faith, Christ protects us and strengthens us and illuminates the way forward.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When Sister Clark and I were younger, we faced the same kinds of decisions you face.&nbsp; I want to close today with an experience we shared.&nbsp; I do so not because our experience is dramatic or unusual, but rather because it is not.&nbsp; It is just like your experiences.&nbsp; I hope in this account of what we faced, you will find encouragement and inspiration from the Lord to face your own decisions with faith in Christ, holding fast to the iron rod.<br /><br />After Sister Clark had been at BYU for a couple of years, she had an opportunity to move into a great apartment much closer to campus.&nbsp; On her first day in the new apartment, she sat on her bed surrounded by her boxes and received this very strong impression of the Spirit: "you are in the wrong place; you need to go back."&nbsp; She struggled with that thought for a while, but the Spirit was insistent.&nbsp; So, not knowing why but with faith in the Lord, she went back to her old apartment far from campus.<br /><br />She did not find out why the Lord sent her back until about two years later while out for a walk with me on a beautiful Sunday evening.&nbsp; Sister Clark and I were in the same home evening group.&nbsp; I had invited her to go on a walk with me that evening, and she accepted.&nbsp; As we walked, I told her how I ended up in the apartment where I lived.&nbsp; As she heard that pretty miraculous story, she had a feeling come to her that we were going to get married. The Spirit whispered to her, "This is why the Lord sent you back."<br /><br />That evening I also felt I was walking with my eternal companion, and as you know we did get married.&nbsp; But it wasn't easy.&nbsp; After we were engaged, we faced some very strong opposition from my family and also the fiery darts of doubt and fear.&nbsp; It is not hard to understand why.&nbsp; I knew I was supposed to go back to Harvard; but that meant moving to Boston, and Sue was really afraid of living in Boston.&nbsp; I knew a few people there, but Sue knew not a soul.&nbsp; She had never lived in a place bigger than Provo, and the prospect of living and working in the Boston area filled her with fear.&nbsp; I, too, had doubts if this was all going to work.<br /><br />My family thought I was rushing things and not thinking straight about all that we would face.&nbsp; Sue had graduated from BYU, but I still had three years of undergraduate work left and probably more years of graduate school.&nbsp; I had only been home from my mission for a few months, and Sue and I had only known each other for a few weeks.&nbsp; We had no money, no place to live in Boston, and no jobs there.<br /><br />It was a hard time.&nbsp; There are two scriptures&mdash;one from Doctrine and Covenants, section 78, and one from Hebrews, chapter 10&mdash;that capture our experience very well.&nbsp; I am going to read them together as though they were one.&nbsp; They have been a great inspiration to us ever since.<br /><br />As I sat here this afternoon and thought about reading these scriptures to you, I received a very clear impression from the Lord that I should tell you that this passage I am going to read to you is&nbsp;<em>for you</em>.&nbsp; This is the word of the Lord&nbsp;<em>for you</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.&nbsp; The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn38" target="_self"></a>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn39" target="_self"></a>Sue and I faced fiery darts, but our grip on the iron rod was firm and the shield of faith quenched the fear and the doubt.&nbsp; We knew what we felt.&nbsp; We had faith in Christ, and we moved forward.&nbsp; We were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on June 14, 1971, and shortly thereafter set off for Boston.&nbsp; I told Sue that we would move back to the West in three years.&nbsp; Thirty-four years and seven children later I made good on my promise; we moved to Rexburg in 2005.</p>
<p>From this experience and many, many others, I know that when we face decisions and challenges, large and small, Jesus will bless us with the light of truth and with His almighty power.&nbsp; With His strength we can move forward to do what He wants done, paying no heed to ridicule and scorn, taking no counsel from our fears, setting doubt aside, overcoming discouragement with hope, and resisting temptation with our faith in Christ.</p>
<p><br />There still will be a path to walk and challenges to face.&nbsp; There will be times of testing and trial.&nbsp; But I bear you my witness born of my own experience that the light and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ come to those who hold fast to the iron rod with one hand and hold aloft the bright, shining shield of faith with the other.&nbsp; "[Jesus is] the way, the truth, and the life."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_Clark.htm#_edn40" target="_self">[40]</a>&nbsp; And He is our shield.&nbsp; I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Over time the muscle gets stronger. Note, however, that you do not create the biochemical signals, nor do you create the new muscle cells and organize them into muscle tissue. That is a gift to you from God. Faith in Christ works the same way. If you exercise faith in Christ, you invite the gift and blessing of divine power into your life.

<p></p>
<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a great blessing to be with you today.&nbsp; At the beginning of this new semester, President Clark and I want you to know that we love you very much. &nbsp;It is a sweet blessing in our lives to feel that love.&nbsp; It is a gift that comes through the Spirit from the Lord.&nbsp; We know He loves you; and in our stewardship here with you, He needs us to love you too.&nbsp; We feel that love.<br /><br />During the translation of the Book of Mormon, the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith about communication through the Spirit. &nbsp;The Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn1" target="_self"></a>This is one of the greatest blessings we receive in mortality. &nbsp;Our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ speak to us personally and individually through the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;In a still small voice the Spirit communicates with us through feelings, promptings, and impressions that come "in [our minds] and in [our hearts]."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>
<p>As he translated the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph received additional insight about the spirit of revelation in these words written by Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"></a>Every one of us who is baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and who receives the gift of the Holy Ghost has this wonderful promise: the Holy Ghost will show us all things we should do.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn4" target="_self">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a promise of protection, guidance, direction, and support in everything we face all through our lives. &nbsp;It is a witness to us that our Heavenly Father loves us and watches over us.</p>
<p>There are some things we have to do to make that promise a reality in our lives. &nbsp;We have to "enter in by the way"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn5" target="_self">[5]</a>&nbsp;and remain true to our covenants so that we will be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;We have to be listening so that we can hear that still small voice, and we have to act on the impressions that come to us so that we will actually do what the Lord wants us to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Since the promise of the guidance of the Spirit in our minds and hearts applies to "all things,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn6" target="_self">[6]</a>&nbsp;we know we will be blessed in everything we face, no matter how big or small. &nbsp;I want to share with you today an experience I had with the Spirit that may seem like a small thing, but for me was a great blessing.<br /><br />One Saturday last spring, I was with my oldest daughter and her little 18-month-old baby girl. &nbsp;It was the last day of their quick trip to Utah.&nbsp; My daughter had spent all of the previous day looking for a place to live in the Highland-Alpine area of Utah while I took care of the baby. &nbsp;We had just finished a relaxing lunch in Midway, and I needed to drive them to the airport in Salt Lake City so they could catch their flight to Boston. &nbsp;My daughter was anxious to get home to her other four children. &nbsp;She is a single mother and was juggling the demands of working to support her children, moving her family to Utah, and trying to take care of them.<br /><br />We got in my car, and I headed down the street that would take us to Heber City and the highway and then on to the airport. &nbsp;As I drove, a thought came into my mind: "It would be better to go through Midway on River Road and then on to the highway." &nbsp;That idea felt good to me, so I looked for a place to turn around. &nbsp;I saw a small lane on my left. &nbsp;I turned into it and then turned left into what looked like a small vacant parking lot to turn around.&nbsp; As soon as I turned, I saw a gas pump in front of me.&nbsp; I glanced at my gas gauge and saw that it showed the tank was empty. &nbsp;I looked up and saw that I had pulled into a 7-Eleven, not an empty&nbsp;lot!<br /><br />I couldn't believe it. &nbsp;I had not looked at the gas gauge until I saw that I was driving toward a gas pump. &nbsp;Had I followed my original course, I am sure that I would have gone onto the highway and run out of gas. &nbsp;My daughter would have missed her flight and would not have made it home to her children that night.<br /><br />I told my daughter about the impression I received, about the empty tank, and about the timely blessing from the Lord. &nbsp;She said to me: "I know Mom.&nbsp; In the last several months, the Lord has done that to me many times. &nbsp;He is watching over me and my children."<br /><br />With that sweet prompting from the Lord, I filled the tank and got my daughter and Baby Lottie to the airport in time for their flight.&nbsp; They made it home on time.<br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, I know that our Heavenly Father loves us and watches over us. &nbsp;I know it was important to Him that my daughter get home to her children because He spoke to me "in [my] mind and in [my] heart"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_05_SueClark.htm#_edn7" target="_self">[7]</a>&nbsp;through the power of the Holy Ghost so she would not be delayed. &nbsp;I know that He will speak to you. &nbsp;He loves you. &nbsp;You are important to Him.<br /><br />He loves us so much He gave us His Only Begotten Son to suffer and die for us. &nbsp;Because Jesus came, the Holy Ghost can speak to us and bless us. &nbsp;I know that is true. &nbsp;I leave my love and that witness with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Associate Dean, College of Business &amp; Comm</p>
<p>Brother Rick Hirschi teaches in the Department of Economics and serves as an Associate Dean in the College of Business and Communication. After graduating from Ricks College, he earned degrees at Utah State University and the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign. Prior to coming here at the time of the announcement of BYU-Idaho, he taught at Western Illinois University.&nbsp; <br /><br /> He met his wife, Suzette, in an institute class and they have been blessed with four daughters. The two oldest are students at BYU-Idaho, but are currently serving missions. His other daughters are with us today. His church callings range from Nursery Leader to his current calling as Bishop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where do you imagine yourself being in 30 years, and what decision will you make to get there? Thirty years ago I was facing the decision of where to go to school and what to study. Ultimately, I made the decision to pass up a four-year scholarship at another university to come here to school knowing, that among other things, the environment here would be more conducive to studying, and preparing for a mission. It was here that I took my first economics course that sparked my interest and changed my career choice. Having attended here and knowing the mission of this university, gave me the desire to later return to teach when the opportunity presented itself. Our lives are made up of a series of small but defining decisions that determine our future. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You are at an exciting time of life and face many important decisions. Some decisions such as what major to select and career to pursue will influence your livelihood and lifestyle, while others such as following our Savior, and whom and where you marry will have eternal consequences. Elder Robert D. Hales remarked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a time and season for all of our decisions. Make sure you make decisions in the proper time and season. All of these life-altering decisions will be made in a very busy, relatively short period during your 20s&mdash;during what I call the "Decade of Decision."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our lives are made up of decisions large and small. Even our coming to earth was the result of a decision that we made during our pre-mortal lives. As the New Year begins and you consider your upcoming decisions, I want to share with you the five P's of decision making.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Perspective</p>
<p>Recognize who you are, why you are here and what you can become. In business, GAP analysis is a tool commonly used to compare where we are to where we would like to be or have the potential to become. Once these are determined, a plan is made as to how we move to our desired goal.</p>
<p>You are a son or daughter of our Father in Heaven<sup>2<sup>&nbsp;</sup></sup>prepared to come to earth at this time and to meet the challenges of today.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Recognizing all that our Father in Heaven has given us brings a profound sense of humility and gratitude along with confidence in knowing that "with God all things are possible."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;We recognize that this life is our time to prepare to meet God and to perform our labors,<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>and that though but a brief moment in the eternities, the decisions we make now determine our destiny.<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>A couple of years ago as part of a family reunion, we hiked the Twin Peaks in Star Valley, Wyoming. While the view from the valley floor is beautiful, there is a unique perspective that can be enjoyed only from the mountain peaks. Climbing a mountain peak can be accomplished from various directions. Some paths may be harder, others overgrown, but as President Eyring's mother would remind him, the right path will always be uphill.<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>As I look out over this audience, it is hard to imagine the various paths in life each of you will take. While decisions about your career and where you live are important decisions in life, they are largely a matter of preference.<sup>8</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;More important as you travel along life's paths is to remember your eternal potential and destination, and to live your life that you may be an instrument in the hands of the Lord.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;By so doing, you accept the challenge of President Hinckley to&nbsp;<em>"rise to the great potential within you."<sup>10</sup></em><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Remembering who you are, helps keep each decision in perspective.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) Participate</p>
<p>In the scriptures, we gain a better understanding of our earthly purpose - "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;This life is designed to be a test and an opportunity to prove ourselves. This requires that there must be opposition in all things<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and that we have the agency to choose for ourselves the path we will take. We cannot fully appreciate the joys of success without exerting the effort required to reach our goal, knowing that failure is a possibility.</p>
<p>Several years ago as I was preparing for further graduate studies, I chose to audit a math class.&nbsp; Given that I was still taking other classes and finishing my thesis, I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn, without the pressures of worrying about a grade. I did great for the first few weeks, but as time became scarcer, I focused on those things for which I would be graded on, and gave less attention and attendance to the math class. Without the risk of a grade and a commitment to do the homework, I soon fell behind and quickly found that I was so far behind it did not justify attending the class.<br /><br />As with education, life is not a spectator sport to be watched as we sit on the sidelines. It requires that we are active participants and exposed to the great joys and disappointments that come throughout life. &nbsp;In every activity of life, we will at times fall short and make mistakes, but enduring the trial makes the joy of success that much sweeter.<br /><br />Thomas Edison sought for years to make the incandescent light bulb a viable device, and tested hundreds of different filaments. After yet another failure, one of his associates expressed discouragement and disgust over the failure and failing to find out anything; to which Edison responded that they had learned something "For we had learned for a certainty that the thing couldn't be done that way, and that we would have to try some other way."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Failure comes only when we fail to learn from our experience.<br /><br />Fear of failure may discourage us from making decisions or undertaking activities that would challenge us. We may question our ability to succeed in school, on a mission, in a career, or in marriage; particularly when there seem to be so many examples to the contrary. Along the path of life, there will be numerous individuals critiquing our decisions and calling out from the great and spacious building that we shouldn't even try. However, we will never know our limits and full potential until we have given it our all. President Monson reminds us of the inspiring words from the movie Shenandoah: "If we don't try, we don't do; and if we don't do, then why are we here?"<sup>14</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>As for the critics, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our Father in Heaven knew that to become like Him, we must exercise our agency and walk by faith. In so doing, we would fall short; and thus He provided a Savior that we may repent and become clean once again, if we would but continue to try each time we fall.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the&nbsp;Messiah&nbsp;cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem&nbsp;the children of men &nbsp;from the fall. And because that they are&nbsp;redeemed&nbsp;from the fall they have become&nbsp;free&nbsp;forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon,...<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Participation is more than just showing up and going through the motions. A half-hearted workout in the gym will only produce mediocre results. Completing a homework assignment or scripture reading just to check it off the list will fail to produce the deep understanding that is only obtained when we ponder and apply the principles in our lives.President Heber J. Grant taught: "It is not what you eat that benefits you but what you digest. What you hear today is of no use to you unless you put it into practice."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Digestion is a slow process as the nutrients of the food are extracted and assimilated into our bodies. The process of becoming requires us to act and takes place over a long period of time as the nutrients of wisdom are assimilated into our souls and become our character.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Elder Oaks said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As we participate, we take personal responsibility and become&nbsp;"doers&nbsp;of the word, and not hearers only."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>3) Price</p>
<p>Recognize that each decision has a trade-off. Please consider the following question that I pose to students in my principles course at the beginning of each semester: Could you get straight As this semester, if the reward was one million dollars? As I ask my students, almost all students raise their hands affirmatively. I then ask them if it is a matter of their priorities or their abilities.</p>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard taught: "One of the greatest challenges of this life is the ordering of priorities."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>If it is a matter of priorities, what things in your life would need to sacrificed or given up to reach your desired goal?&nbsp; We each have been given 24 hours a day and it is up to us to decide how we use that time. Not having time to do something, simply means that it is not a priority.</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave the following counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information.&nbsp;But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Even more important than our academic achievement is our spiritual progression. Are we making the things that matter most a priority or are we giving up what we want most for what we want now?</p>
<p>In Alma, the father of King Lamoni prays to know God after being taught by Aaron and commits to give away all of his sins to know our Father in Heaven.<sup>22</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Are we seeking first the kingdom of God<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;or do other priorities fill our day and crowd out the very acts that will lead us back to Him? "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall&nbsp;gain&nbsp;the whole world, and lose his own soul?"<sup>24</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Pioneers in the Martin Handcart Company were caught by an early winter blizzard in eastern Wyoming and suffered significantly. Several years later a teacher in a Church class criticized the decision to allow the Saints to leave that late in the season with limited supplies. A man who had been in the Company was in attendance and after listening for a while rose to his feet and asked them to stop.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. .... We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism?&nbsp;Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it. I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay...<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>It is often through our trials that we more fully recognize our dependence on the Lord and draw near to Him. As the prophet Joseph Smith sat in Liberty Jail burdened with seemingly insurmountable challenges, his plea to the Lord was answered as he was reassured "...that all these things shall give thee&nbsp;experience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>Each choice we make comes at a sacrifice or price. In undertaking one activity, we give up that portion of our time and other resources that could have been used to do something else. In economics, we refer to this as the opportunity cost. President James E. Faust taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My dear young friends, there is another great truth that you ... must learn. It is that everything has a price. There is a price to pay for success, fulfillment, accomplishment, and joy. There are no freebies. If you don't pay the price that is needed for success, you will pay the price of failure. Preparation, work, study, and service are required to achieve and find happiness. Disobedience and lack of preparation carry a terrible price tag.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In our studies, the mysteries of our discipline and the gospel alike are unfolded "line upon line, precept upon precept."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The Lord will not reveal greater truths unto us until we are utilizing that which He has already revealed. We will not fully understand or appreciate what is taught in the upper division courses unless we have paid the price of learning what is taught in the principle courses.</p>
<p>President Kimball used the following analogy when he discussed the price of reaching new heights of attainment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the Lord would have occur ... are hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond. The hills ahead are higher than we think. This means that accomplishments and further direction must occur in proper order, after we have done our part. We will not be transported from point A to point Z without having to pass through the developmental and demanding experiences of all the points of achievement and all the milestone markers that lie between.<sup>29</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>May we always remember that each choice comes at a price and be willing to pay the price in each aspect of our lives required to achieve our full potential.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4) Persistence.</p>
<p>Making the correct choice is just the beginning. Many of us make New Year's resolutions; however as evidenced by the declining number in the gym as the semester progresses, many of us will fail to keep those resolutions.</p>
<p>The Lord said: "Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceeds that which is great."<sup>30</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>There will always be those smarter, faster, or stronger; but the race&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but he that&nbsp;endureth&nbsp;to the end shall be saved.<sup>31</sup></p>
<p>Aesop's fable of The Hare and the Tortoise demonstrates the importance of persistence. During the race the talented hare, who was well ahead in the race, decided to lay down and take a nap, but the tortoise at a slow and steady pace stayed on task. After waking from his nap, the hare raced quickly to the end, only to find that he had been beaten by the slow but persistent tortoise.<sup>32</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>President James E. Faust taught that "steadiness and toil will serve you better than brilliance."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;As a professor, it is always rewarding to see those students who may not be as academically gifted but that wrestle with the subject matter and come off conquerors because of their dedication and persistence. Although the material is still just as difficult, the students' ability to comprehend has increased because they have paid the price and now have a deep understanding of the material.<br /><br />Former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge said: "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."<sup>34</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>5) Ponder and Pray</p>
<p>The last and most important Ps in making decisions are to ponder and pray. "Counsel&nbsp;with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for&nbsp;good."<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;We are not alone as we face life's many choices, but we must first do our part.</p>
<p>The Lord offered Oliver Cowdery the gift to translate,<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;but later admonished him when he failed to continue in that which he had commenced and took no thought save it was to ask.<sup>37</sup>&nbsp; The Lord continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But, behold, I say unto you, that you must&nbsp;study&nbsp;it out in your mind; then you must&nbsp;ask&nbsp;me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your&nbsp;bosom&nbsp;shall&nbsp;burn&nbsp;within you; therefore, you shall feel&nbsp;that it is right.<sup>38</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our responsibility is to do all within our power to study the problem, evaluate the options, decide which choice we feel is most appropriate, and then take our decision to the Lord for confirmation. It is also important that we are living in a manner that allows us to be sensitive and in tune to the quiet promptings that come from the Spirit. This most often happens as we take time to study and ponder the word of God. In the last general conference, Elder Richard G. Scott taught the importance of scripture study:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We talk to God through prayer. He most often communicates back to us through His written word. To know what the voice of the Divine sounds and feels like, read His words, study the scriptures, and ponder them.<sup>39</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The answers to our prayers do not always come from the actual written words, but they provide the revelatory setting for the answers to come into our hearts and minds.<sup>40</sup></p>
<p>At times we may not receive a divine confirmation of our choice, but if we are living in tune with the Spirit, and have taken the necessary steps of preparation, we can move forward with confidence and step into the darkness knowing that the Lord will guide our steps.The decisions you make in this life have eternal consequences. As you face this "decade of decision," may you remember the five P's of decision making as principles to guide you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Perspective - remember who you are, why you are here and what you can become.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) Participate - remember that to grow and learn we must act for ourselves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) Price - remember that each decision comes at a price and be willing to "lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better."<sup>41</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>4) Persistence - remember to endure faithfully to the end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5) Ponder and Pray - remember the Lord thy God in all things.</p>
<p>It is my testimony that as you live your life in accordance with the will of the Father, you will find that He will guide you and make much more out of your life than you can by yourself.<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 7, 1984.</p>
<p>Elder Nelson has held numerous positions of responsibility in the Church. He served as stake president of the Bonneville Stake from 1964 to June, 1971, when he was called as general president of the Sunday School. Prior to his call to the Quorum of the Twelve, he was serving as a Regional Representative assigned to the Kearns Utah Region. He had previously served as Regional Representative for Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>An internationally renowned surgeon and medical researcher, Dr. Nelson received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah (1945, 47). Honorary scholastic societies include Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha. He served his residency in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded his Ph.D. Degree in 1954. He also received honorary degrees of Doctor of Science from Brigham Young University in 1970, Doctor of Medical Science from Utah State University in 1989, and Doctor of Humane Letters from Snow College in 1994.</p>
<p>His professional work included the positions of research professor of surgery and director of the Thoracic Surgery Residency at the University of Utah and chairman of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Born September 9, 1924, Elder Nelson is the son of Marion C. and Edna Anderson Nelson. He and his wife, the former Dantzel White, have ten children, 57 grandchildren, and 82 great-grandchildren.&nbsp; Sister Nelson passed away in February 2005. In April 2006, he married Wendy L. Watson. <br /><br /></p>
<p>Thank you, President Clark, for your gracious introduction. &nbsp;We love you and Sister Clark.&nbsp; We are very grateful for your commitment to improve the education of the youth of the Church.&nbsp; Wendy and I are most grateful for this opportunity to visit you, the students, and staff here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, you are exceptional individuals.&nbsp; You have been reserved for this particular time to accomplish your mission in mortality.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Since your memory of your eternal identity has been largely forgotten, you need a reminder of how precious you are.&nbsp; You need to understand how really important you are in the eyes of your Maker.&nbsp; Most of you do not fully appreciate who you really are.&nbsp; And most of you do not fully foresee your future potential for greatness.&nbsp; That is understandable.&nbsp; You think of great people as men or women who are older and better known.&nbsp; And you are made aware of them because of their titles.<br /><br />Such a circumstance occurred many years ago when I was teaching a missionary discussion to a woman from Great Britain.&nbsp; I was teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, and how He had restored His gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; She really liked the teachings of the gospel, but she had a hard time accepting the Prophet's First Vision.&nbsp; She said she could believe in the Restoration more sincerely if God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ had appeared to the Archbishop of Canterbury!<br /><br />Actually, the fact that the Father and the Son appeared to an untitled youth is one of the most remarkable aspects of the Restoration.&nbsp; Joseph Smith did not have to "unlearn" anything.&nbsp; He was tutored personally by Them.&nbsp; Joseph was also tutored by other heavenly messengers, including Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, Moses, Elias, and Elijah.&nbsp; His mission in mortality was foreordained.&nbsp; His receptive and pristine mind was receptive.&nbsp; But, by worldly standards, Joseph was most unlikely.&nbsp; And his task to be the Prophet of this last dispensation seemed totally impossible.&nbsp; This example typifies the title of my message for you today: "The Lord Uses the Unlikely to Accomplish the Impossible!"<br /><br />This pattern is one the Lord has used repeatedly throughout history.&nbsp; For instance, you know the story of David who slew Goliath with a stone and a sling.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;That was another example of how the Lord uses the unlikely to accomplish the impossible.<br /><br />You may remember the account of Gideon, as recorded in the book of Judges.&nbsp; In his capacity as a servant of the Lord, Gideon was leading his forces against the Midianite enemies when "the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many,. . . lest Israel vaunt themselves . . . saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."<br /><br />So the Lord told Gideon to excuse all who were afraid.&nbsp; That trimmed the number from 22,000 down to 10,000.&nbsp; Then the Lord said unto Gideon, "The people are yet too many."&nbsp; So He ordered a drink test.&nbsp; They went down to the water.&nbsp; Some bowed down upon their knees to drink.&nbsp; Others cupped their hands to their mouths to drink.<br /><br />The Lord said unto Gideon, "By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Lord delivered the victory to Gideon and his men.&nbsp; They were outnumbered about 500 to 1.<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Here again we see the pattern: the Lord uses the unlikely to accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>Think of Moses.&nbsp; In his advanced years, he was called to lead the children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt.<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>You know what happened.&nbsp; Moses stretched out his hand over the Red Sea; and the Lord caused the sea to be divided.&nbsp; And the children of Israel walked across on the ground.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Think of Joshua.&nbsp; He led the children of Israel across the River Jordan at flood time.&nbsp; In faith, they walked to that swollen river, and when the soles of their feet were wet, the waters of the Jordan were heaped up allowing the faithful to pass along to the promised land.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For those Israelites who followed Moses and Joshua, deep water was divinely divided to allow the faithful to reach their appointed destination.&nbsp; Again we see the pattern: the Lord uses the unlikely to accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>Jumping ahead to the nineteenth century, we see the pattern emerge once again.&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why the Master waited so long to inaugurate the promised "restitution of all things"?<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Any competitor knows the disadvantage of allowing an opponent to get too far ahead.&nbsp; Suppose for a moment you are a member of a team. The coach calls you by name and says: "It is time for you to enter the game.&nbsp; But the going will be mighty tough.&nbsp; The score at this moment is one billion, one hundred forty-three million to six, and your team is the one with the six points!"<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>That large number, 1,143,000,000, was the approximate population of the earth in the year 1830, when the restored church of Jesus Christ was officially organized.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The location was in a rural part of New York State.&nbsp; With this little handful of people, the Lord's work was begun. Think of the enormity of their assignment!&nbsp; It included the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&middot;&nbsp; The gospel was to be preached to every kindred, nation, tongue, and people</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&middot;&nbsp; Ordinary human beings were to become Saints.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&middot;&nbsp; And redemptive temple work was to be done for all who had ever lived.</p>
<p>Yes, with that assignment, the promised dispensation of the latter days had commenced, and they were the ones to usher it forth!If any tasks ever deserved the label "impossible," these massive assignments all qualified!&nbsp; But, they knew this biblical truth: "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>So much for history.&nbsp; Now we are living in the twenty-first century.&nbsp; Might these patterns apply to us?&nbsp; Scripture describes us and what we may experience as latter-day Saints.&nbsp; Quote: "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; . . .&nbsp; God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the . . . mighty."<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Those "weak ones" even include us&mdash;the Brethren.&nbsp; For example, in 1984, in a most unexpected way, Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called away from our professions of law and medicine respectively, to serve as Apostles of the Lord.&nbsp; In the following year, President Ezra Taft Benson gave to me the assignment to supervise the work of the Lord in Europe and Africa, with a specific charge to open the nations of Eastern Europe now under the yoke of communism.<br /><br />If ever a task ever seemed impossible to me, that was it.&nbsp; In the ensuring years, I tried my best.&nbsp; In each atheistic nation, I was never wanted and never welcome.&nbsp; Their governmental leaders wouldn't even give appointments to a man who professed faith in God.&nbsp; In fact, at that time, some believers were imprisoned or even executed.<br /><br />Those countries kept good records on visits by foreigners.&nbsp; I was on record as an American heart surgeon, who, as a volunteer, had previously taught in some of those countries.&nbsp; Paired with Elder Hans B. Ringger of the Seventy, a Swiss engineer and architect, our partnership was disarming to them.&nbsp; We were truly unlikely, and different from leaders of other faith groups.&nbsp; Country by country, we labored diligently in Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia,&nbsp; Estonia, Poland, Armenia, and the German Democratic Republic.</p>
<p>Each country presented different challenges for us.&nbsp; We did the very best we could, and then the Lord made up the difference.&nbsp; He did what we could not do.&nbsp; Time will not permit sharing the many details with you, but I can give you the conclusion.&nbsp; Before President Benson passed away, we were able to report that the Church was now established in all countries of Eastern Europe!<br /><br />I testify to you that the Lord meant what He said when He declared: "I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Yes, I am an eye-witness&mdash;I am a part of that pattern: the Lord used the unlikely to accomplish the impossible.<br /><br />Now, let us apply this pattern to you. &nbsp;You are young.&nbsp; You are learning, but not learned.&nbsp; You will have moments of dismay.&nbsp; But, you should remember that each of you is literally and truly a son or daughter of Almighty God.&nbsp; You have been created in His very image.&nbsp;<br /><br />Physically, He wants you to honor the body he has given you.&nbsp; He wants you to treasure and care for your body as your own personal temple.<br /><br />Spiritually, He has sent you here to be successful and to have joy in your journey in mortality.&nbsp; He wants each of you to know that "with God nothing shall be impossible."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You are entitled through your worthiness to receive revelation to help you with your righteous endeavors.&nbsp; You may take upon you the name of the Lord.&nbsp; You may pray in His holy name.&nbsp; You can qualify to speak in the sacred name of God.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;It matters not that times of tribulation will come.&nbsp; Your prayerful access to help is just as real as it was when David battled his Goliath.<br /><br />So, to each of you I say, foster your faith.&nbsp; Fix&nbsp; your focus with an eye single to the glory of God.&nbsp; "Be strong and courageous,"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp; and you will be given power and protection from on high.&nbsp; The Lord has declared His sustaining help: "For I will go before your face.&nbsp; I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<sup>17</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Lord has more in mind for you than you have in mind for yourself!&nbsp; You have been reserved and preserved for this time and place.&nbsp; You can do hard things.&nbsp; At the same time, as you love Him and keep His commandments, great rewards&mdash;even unimaginable achievements&mdash;may&nbsp; be yours.&nbsp; Indeed, "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."<sup>18</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>You faithful students here in BYU-Idaho can accomplish the impossible.&nbsp; You can help shape the destiny of the entire human family!&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be scattered like seeds in the wind to build up the Church in all parts of the world.&nbsp; As you know and apply the teachings of the Lord in your lives and in your work, you can change the world.&nbsp; You will become a precious part of His perennial pattern: the Lord uses the unlikely to accomplish the impossible!<br /><br />God bless you, my dear brothers and sisters.&nbsp; We love you.&nbsp; We honor you.&nbsp; We pray for you.&nbsp; With you and through you, the great latter-day work of which we are a part shall be accomplished.&nbsp; With you and through you, prophecies of the ages shall be fulfilled.&nbsp; I so testify, with my expression of love for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Faculty Member, Department of Health, Recreation and Human Performance</p>
<p>Greg Klingler has been a member of the Health, Rec, &amp; Human Performance faculty at BYU-Idaho for 5 years.&nbsp; He is a third generation employee of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; He received a B.S. in Health Science with an Emphasis in Public Health from BYU-Idaho in 2004.&nbsp; He went on to receive his Master of Physician Assistant Studies in 2008 from the University of St. Francis in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and just last year earned his Doctorate of Health Science from A.T. Still University.&nbsp; He practiced primary care medicine for 7 years before joining the faculty here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Klingler's church service includes time as an Elders Quorum president and gospel doctrine instructor, and he currently serves as an executive secretary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He and his wife, Lottie, are the parents of 5 sons and 1 daughter who range in age from 1 to 12.&nbsp; They enjoy being outdoors long enough to have pleasurable hiking and camping experiences, yet short enough to not let their young children swallow dangerous amounts of dirt or have complete meltdowns.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>My young brother and sisters, there are many among us that are suffering underneath an almost unbearable weight and some may be calling upon God this day for divine intervention.</p>
<p>In an address to the priesthood, President Thomas S. Monson described a painting by Joseph Mallord William Turner. In this painting, the artist illustrates a dark storm and angry sea. A light in the far distance identifies a vessel hopelessly stranded. In the foreground, the artist depicts a lifeboat plunging into the storm tossed sea. On the shore appears to be a wife and two children, likely the family of one of the men on the lifeboat. Using this painting as a backdrop, President Thomas S. Monson taught, "Amidst the storms of life, danger lurks; and men, like boats, find themselves stranded and facing destruction. Who will man the lifeboats, leaving behind the comforts of home and family, and go to the rescue?<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Trials and hardships are part of our mortal existence, and many in our generation are taking on wounds that are severe. Many feel like they are losing the fight. We must go to the rescue. During my address today, please contemplate and identify someone you may know who is struggling either spiritually, emotionally, physically, or who may be in need of your help.<br /><br /><strong>"Ye are the Body of Christ"</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Allow me to share an experience that helped me better understand our call to go to the rescue.<br /><br />In addition to being a faculty member here at BYU-Idaho, I have the opportunity to practice medicine as a physician assistant at the BYU-Idaho Student Health Center.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently, I saw a student who had come to the clinic with severe abdominal pain. Emily reported that she had lived with nearly constant abdominal pain for over six years. She had been seen by several doctors, put through countless medical tests, and started on several different treatment plans. Emily expressed the frustration of living with chronic abdominal pain. She was hoping for an identification of her pain and some resolution. I immediately began to wonder how I could help her where so many others could not. I silently had a prayer in my heart and pleaded for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an initial evaluation, I became concerned about Emily's gallbladder. I ordered appropriate testing to evaluate her gallbladder and it was revealed that Emily had gallstones, and her gallbladder was functioning at five percent of its capacity. Emily was referred to a surgeon, and the gallbladder was removed. She told me that her pain resolved almost immediately after surgery. Emily later wrote me a note that said, "Thank you for finding what was wrong with me...My diet is back to normal, I am able to exercise, and [I can] go on with my life without being set back with this problem anymore.<br /><br />By now you are wondering, "What does this have to do with going to the rescue?" When one part of the body is afflicted, the whole body feels it, and we are not whole until all members of the body are whole.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Corinthians chapter 12, the Apostle Paul uses the body as an analogy to refer the church of Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free;&nbsp;For the body is not one member, but many.&nbsp;If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?&nbsp;And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?&nbsp;And if they were all one member, where were the body?&nbsp;But now are they many members, but one body.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we are baptized we become a member of the body of Christ. Each member of the body is given important gifts, and talents. Some taste, some hear. Some are eyes, and some are hands. God set the members, "every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.&nbsp;And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When Emily had gallbladder disease, her hands were fine. Her eyes, ears, mouth, and her cognitive functions were perfect. She could see, hear, taste, touch, and feel. Could I have said, because it is just the gallbladder, and not a more important part of the body like the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, or lungs that it has not need for care? Could I have said, 'because your gallbladder is afflicted, but your eyes are fine, I am going to forget about the gallbladder and all of its problems and care for the eyes? Of course not!</p>
<p>In fact we learn it is upon those members of the body that are in need that we give more care.<br /><br />And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.<br /><br />"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked."<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Do you see the vision? When one of us suffer, we all suffer. We are not whole until every member is whole.</p>
<p>Many times I have gone to those that are wounded and approached these individuals with the attitude of 'I love you. And because I love you, I want you to feel of the blessings I feel through obedience.' Although that may be the case, that is not the doctrine that will lead to significant change in that person's life. The doctrine is this; when you were baptized you became a member of the body of Christ. You are part of His body and I am part of the body. We need the gifts and talents, only you bring. We need you like our own bodies need the hands, feet, eyes, and ears. And we, the body, are not whole without you.</p>
<p>To those able and willing to go to the rescue, this will be our message, 'We love you, the Lord loves you, and we need you.'</p>
<p><strong>To the Rescue</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We cannot do it alone. When Emily was sick, I quickly realized I could not treat her alone. Although I played a role, she required the talents and skills of additional healthcare professionals to make her whole. Likewise, we cannot perform the work of the rescue alone. The Holy Ghost must be our constant companion. Additionally, home teachers are critical, but may not be enough, visiting teachers are important but may not be enough, the bishop, or other priesthood leaders, youth leaders, friends, family, fellow-shippers, and the full-time missionaries may all play an important role.</p>
<p>Recently, I went hiking in the Teton Mountains with several friends. It was to be a relatively short hike up Table Mountain and back. We arrived at the trailhead very early in the morning, and expected to be finished and back home early that afternoon. It was still dark when we started up the mountain. As we hiked up the mountain we mostly stayed together, talking, sharing stories, and enjoying each other's company. When we reached the top, we shared the joy and satisfaction of reaching the pinnacle of the trail. After a short rest, we began our hike back down the mountain. Although we enjoyed the hike we were eager to get back to our homes and families. As we began back down, we descended the mountain at different paces. Each of us spread along the trail and individually enjoying the clean air, the majestic views, and the peace and quiet of our surroundings.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the hike, we gathered at the parking lot.<br /><br />Eventually, all in our group had finished the hike, except one. As time went on, we became increasingly concerned. There came a time in which, given normal circumstances, we would have expected our friend to have finished. However, he was still on the mountain and in our eyes was not safe. After careful consideration and silent prayers, we finally determined that we must return up the mountain to find our friend. We eventually found him on the trail sitting down. He had sustained an injury that prevented his progression. He was injured, exhausted, and felt he could go no further. So with one person under each arm, we took turns helping our friend down the mountain to safety, and finally home. When our friend was still on the mountain, no amount of waiting, watching, hoping, or talking would have brought him home. It was not until we left our comfortable circumstances, traveled back up the mountain, and went to where he was that we were able to help. We must have the faith and courage to leave our comfortable circumstances, venture outside our comfort zone, and go where we are needed.<br /><br />Even those who are fighting courageously, honorably, fearlessly, and with their entire heart and soul are being wounded in this war.</p>
<p>Remember the two thousand Sons of Helaman? Their faith motivated them to go to the rescue of the badly depleted army of Antipus. As boys they had been taught by their mothers that "if they did not doubt, God would deliver them"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and as young men they were now ready to join the fight. They fought with "miraculous strength" and with "mighty power."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;At the conclusion of the fight, the enemy had been turned away. Helaman feared that many of his sons had been killed, however astonishingly not one of the two thousand Stripling Warriors had been killed. Although each of these Stripling Warrior's life was preserved, it was not before many of them suffered wounds so that were severe.<br /><br />Clark Kelley Price, in his painting titled, "It's True, Sir, All Present and Accounted For," depicted this scene. Two focal points of this masterful illustration tell the story. First, Helaman on his horse receiving the report that all of Helaman's young warriors were accounted for. Second, is a wounded, battle-torn young man unquestionably one of the sons of Helaman. Under each arm is another Stripling Warrior. They each have also taken on battle wounds, however they have come to the aid of their brother. These Stripling Warriors went to the rescue of the army of Antipus, and in the process they became wounded themselves. In their hour of need, aid came from their battle wounded brothers.</p>
<p>We are in a fight with Satan as real, and even more dangerous, than the Stripling Warrior's fight with the Lamanites. We fight together. We take on wounds. We need aid and we give aid. You need not be whole to go to the rescue. In fact, in this battle, one way in which we heal our own wounds is by seeking out and going to the rescue of others that are wounded. One measure of our success in this Great War with the adversary may not be how effectively I mend my own wounds, but rather how I assisted others to the source that could mend their wounds. There are many around us wounded on the battlefield. They are part of the same body of Christ that we belong to, and we are not whole until they are whole. We must go to our wounded.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Not</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In our desire to help, we may be tempted to judge or criticize our wounded brothers or sisters. Some rescuers may even be tempted to withhold help if they believe the wounds have been caused by behaviors in which they do not approve.</p>
<p>When my friend was injured on the trail, our desire to help was not conditional upon the cause of the injury. When we went to help, we were not immediately concerned about what had caused the wounds, what we cared about was finding our friend and helping him home. It didn't seem important at that time to provide a careful analysis of what went wrong. He did not need me to point out his mistakes or counsel him on how I would have avoided the same injury. My judgment would not have healed his wounds. My friend didn't need scrutiny, he needed help.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we go to the rescue, there may be times in which understanding the source of the spiritual wounds of those we serve is instructive and helpful to prevent further mistakes, but please be careful that you do not add to the pain of the wounded by casting an unrighteous judgment.<br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson counseled:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">None of us is perfect. I know of no one who would profess to be so. And yet for some reason, despite our own imperfections, we have a tendency to point out those of others. We make judgments concerning their actions or inactions.&nbsp;There is really no way we can know the heart, the intentions, or the circumstances of someone who might say or do something we find reason to criticize. Thus the commandment: "Judge not."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Imagine with me the Stripling Warriors searching diligently for their battle-wounded brothers. When finding a battle-torn brother, I doubt they provided a careful analysis of battle maneuvers or critical hindsight. Rather, I imagine one brother would wash the wounds of the fallen with his own tears while another warrior would stop the bleeding of the wounded with his own hands. Our wounded brothers and sisters need less criticism, and more care.</p>
<p>We are all in the thick of the war. We are all fighting for our lives. How could I, who has been wounded, criticize the efforts of someone else who is entrenched in the same war and is battle-torn?</p>
<p>We are not the ones that cast a final judgment. In this endeavor we may follow the example of the Savior.</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Even the Savior, during His mortal ministry, refrained from making final judgments. We see this in the account of the woman taken in adultery. After the crowd who intended to stone her had departed, Jesus asked her about her accusers. "Hath no man condemned thee?" When she answered no, Jesus declared, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more." &nbsp;The Lord obviously did not justify the woman's sin. He simply told her that He did not condemn her&mdash;that is, He would not pass final judgment on her at that time. This interpretation is confirmed by what He then said to the Pharisees: "Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man."&nbsp; The woman taken in adultery was granted time to repent, time that would have been denied by those who wanted to stone her.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Please do not add to the pain of the wounded by thinking to yourselves that the wounds are deserved or that you are justified in delivering chastisement. Please refrain from an unrighteous judgment. There is no room for catty, spiteful, vindictive interpretations or analysis in the Lord's service. If you or I have found ourselves finding pleasure in the pain of the wounded, we do not understand the body of Christ and we are surely outside the direction of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>Christ Can Heal the Wounded:</strong></p>
<p>Christ can heal the wounded. One attribute in the life of the Savior that has always provided me comfort is that he spent his entire life among those in need. The scribes and Pharisees even questioned why the Savior would surround himself with sinners.</p>
<p>"How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick."<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>None of us are whole. Each of us carries wounds that can be painful and heartbreaking. At some point in our life pain, suffering, trial, and despair will bring each of us to our knees. Some of our wounds are a consequence of our own sin while other times our wounds are a consequence of the sin of someone else. Some wounds are inflicted as a result of physical or mental illness. Other wounds present in the form of a loss of loved ones, marital problems, wayward children, occupational or financial burdens, and even academic stress and pressure. The list, and possibilities of trial and tribulation is endless. However, please understand, you are not alone. Christ did not merely watch the sinners from a distance. He lived his life among them. He walked among them. He went into their homes. He fed them, He healed them, He loved them. The sinners, the homeless, the lame, the lost; He loved each one.<br /><br />And so it is in our day. Christ does not work from the periphery. He is not merely a spectator of your life, waiting and watching to see 'how things work out.' Christ knows you. He is not far from you. He can heal you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The first time I remember feeling that Christ knew me and was actively involved in my life was when I was eight years old. My parents were recently divorced and I moved with part of our family to a new city. I can assure you I felt confused, lonely, and scared. On one particular morning, my mother went to work, my older siblings left for school, and I was home alone waiting for the time for me to walk to school. At the height of my fear, loneliness, and hopelessness, I remember feeling a distinct desire to read the Book of Mormon. So as an eight-year old, I read the first two chapters before school that day. I then knelt at the chair in my living room and poured out my heart to a loving Heavenly Father. This became a pivotal moment in my life. My circumstances did not change, however when I got up from that prayer and had received an enabling power above my own to go through that day. Since that day, I have never questioned the presence of the Savior. That day I knew Christ was aware of me, and would come to my aid.<br /><br />If the Savior could provide peace and comfort to an eight year-old boy, he can provide peace and comfort to you. If He could heal my wounds, He can heal your wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Please allow me to share one last example of the rescue. &nbsp;In October 1856, hundreds of our pioneer ancestors were stranded on the plains of Wyoming. Recorded are horrific stories of starvation, freezing, and death. It is recorded that some individuals died "lying side by side with hands entwined. In other cases, they were found as if they had just offered a fervent prayer and their spirit had taken flight while in the act...Some died sitting by the fire; Some were singing hymns or eating crusts of bread."<br /><br />When President Brigham Young was informed of the dire circumstances of the handcart companies he stood in front of the church membership and passionately pleaded for the saints in Salt Lake to leave their comfortable circumstances and go rescue the pioneers.<br /><br />"That is my religion; that is the dictation of the Holy Ghost that I possess. It is to save the people. ...<br /><br />"I will tell you all that your faith, religion, and profession of religion, will never save one soul of you in the Celestial Kingdom of our God, unless you carry out just such principles as I am now teaching you. Go and bring in those people now on the plains." &nbsp;<br /><br />On the frozen plains, one pioneer sister, whose husband was near death and whose two sons were suffering with frozen feet, asked Captain Edward Martin if he thought help was coming.<br /><br />Captain Martin replied, "I am as confident as that I live that President (Brigham Young) will and has dispatched the relief [party] to us and I believe that they are making all the haste they can, that they are bringing flour, clothing, [and] shoes."A day or two later, Mary Ferguson Scott, one of the members of the handcart company, was looking [to] the west, when "all at once she sprang to her feet and screamed at the top of her voice, 'I see them coming! I see them coming! Surely they are angels from heaven.'"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And so they were.<br /><br />At the very moment the stranded pioneer saints where calling upon God for divine intervention, the Spirit had moved upon men and women in Salt Lake City to prepare supplies and go to the rescue. Twenty-seven volunteer young men (including Thomas E. Ricks, the founder of BYU-Idaho) immediately left the comforts of home and family, and went to the rescue. Many more followed.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, earlier I asked if you would consider someone that you know who may be in need of your help. I believe the Spirit has directed you to someone who you could help. They may be calling upon a loving Heavenly Father right now for the help only you can provide. My young friends, let us go to the rescue. Let us remember, "Ye are the body of Christ," and when one member of the body suffers, all the members suffer with it. Going to the rescue is in our nature. It is our heritage. It is what the faithful followers of Christ do. Let us not wait one more day. You and I may be angels sent from heaven to rescue the stranded, the lost, lonely, or wounded. I bear my witness, Christ will go before our face, He will be on our right hand and on our left, and His Spirit shall be in our hearts, and His angels round about us, to bear us up.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I testify, in the name of our rescuer, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Faculty Member, Department of Business Management</p>
<p>Brother Jack Fuller is a faculty member in the Business Management Department at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; He received his undergraduate degree at BYU, and graduate degrees from the University of Chicago. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, he worked in a law practice, in financial services, and in real estate management.&nbsp; In addition to his teaching responsibilities on campus, he is a faculty mentor to student research teams at the Eastern Idaho Entrepreneurial Center (commonly referred to as "the E Center").&nbsp; He and his wife, Elizabeth, are the parents of ten children and two grandchildren.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Would you take a minute to create in your mind a picture of what exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom will look like?&nbsp; One thing in that beautiful picture that you may not have thought of, that I would like to think about on this Devotional before Valentine's Day, is that you will be there with someone you are very much in love with, and who is very much in love with you. You might say he or she is your eternal Valentine.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; Since that is an essential part of making that beautiful picture of exaltation complete, then all of us should be preparing and helping others to prepare for that part, though individually some preparation will be able to take place in this life, and some will not be able to take place until after this life.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So in the spirit of New Year's resolutions that many of us just made, I have two suggested Valentine's Day resolutions, one about helping ourselves, and one about helping others, to prepare for that beautiful complete picture of exaltation.<br /><br />Suggested Valentine's Day resolution number one:<br /><br />When I was a student at BYU and in my senior year, my parents were on a mission on a very tiny island in the middle of the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; Letters took weeks to get to them, and calling the phone available to them was difficult and expensive.&nbsp; They were pretty much out of&nbsp;day-to-day contact with their family on this mission.&nbsp;<br /><br />But I was getting ready to go to graduate school, and I wanted to talk and plan with them about where to go and how to pay for it.&nbsp; So after talking with other family members, it was decided that I should try to call them.&nbsp; I really looked forward to hearing their voice and talking to them again. &nbsp;So that next Saturday morning, using two operators to place the call, I got a call to work and suddenly heard my father's voice as clear as if it was a local call.<br /><br />I told him I had called because I had important things to talk to them about.&nbsp; But before I could tell what that was, my father said to me, "Jack, I'm so disappointed in you, you give up too easily.&nbsp; You need to not give up just because something doesn't work out right away. You have to keep trying."&nbsp; I thought, "What is he talking about?"&nbsp; Then he said, "You need to go back and kiss that girl.&nbsp; Don't give up, you go back and try again!"<br /><br />Then I knew.&nbsp; I was their last unmarried child, and they had been worried about going on a mission with me not married.&nbsp; And in one very small part of a letter I had sent to them a while before, I told them that I had actually gone out with a girl several times, and even tried to give her a first kiss, and she didn't let me, so I wasn't going to ask her out again.<br /><br />That is what was bothering him.&nbsp; He went on, without stopping, and said things like, "Are you a man or a mouse?&nbsp; You are thinking about becoming a lawyer, so you should learn to use your persuasive skills."&nbsp; He then said, "Now you go back and kiss that girl, ok?" I didn't want to argue with faithful parents on the other side of the world on a mission, so I said yes, I would.&nbsp; I also wanted to get on with what I had called about.<br /><br />Then the call got cut off.&nbsp; I tried to call back, but the operators couldn't connect again.&nbsp; For the rest of the day I tried and could not get a connection.&nbsp; Now I eventually did talk to them, but not that day, and not about that subject again.&nbsp; On that Saturday, I never said a word to my parents about why I called, and instead I had committed to them to kiss a girl that I knew did not want to see me again.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day was Sunday, so being obedient, I found the phone number of that girl, called her and asked if she remembered me, and then told her that my roommate and I were coming to visit her ward that day.&nbsp; That was all I could think up. I was hoping that if I at least got in her presence, some kind of idea would come to me on what to do.<br /><br />Of course nothing happened during Sacrament Meeting, so I went to Sunday School, where she was one of the teachers. &nbsp;She asked a question at the end of her lesson that went something like this:&nbsp; "Does anyone want to share a personal application of any of the verses from these chapters we've discussed?" &nbsp;The chapters were some of the epistles of Paul the Apostle.&nbsp; Suddenly I thought "Oh no, is this my opportunity?&nbsp; Am I supposed to raise my hand, say 'yes, I have one, and it's with you?'"&nbsp; The verse I was looking at was one of those familiar ones at the end of Paul's epistles, where he says,<br /><br />"Greet ye one another with an holy kiss."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I was too scared.&nbsp; Instead, I remained quiet, went home after church, and realized that was probably the end of my efforts, at least for a while, to do what my father wanted me to do.<br /><br />That night there was a fireside in the Marriott Center at BYU, which is the big BYU basketball arena that holds 20,000 people. I went with a couple of roommates, and we sat up in the top section, where the lights are dimmed and only a few scattered little spotlights light up the aisles. Waiting for it to start, my roommates and I noticed a group of girls coming up the aisle we were on, and realized it was the girl I was to kiss and some of her friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we watched, they stopped several rows below us, and as they went to sit down, her friends went in first, and she sat down closest to the aisle.&nbsp; But, she left one seat open right on the aisle, and right next to her.&nbsp; And, I'm sure I remember wrong, but it seemed like one of those little isle lights was shining right on that empty seat. &nbsp;My roommates jabbed me in the ribs, pointed out what had happened, and told me to go sit by her.&nbsp; I think at that time my thoughts were, "Did my father know all this?"</p>
<p>I was then faced with an important decision.&nbsp; I could either stay seated where I was, or pursue what my father had told me to do, which in his mind, was possibly taking me towards that beautiful picture of exaltation.&nbsp; So at that moment, I made a decision that has made all the difference in my life.&nbsp; I got up and changed my seat.<br /><br />There is more to this story, but stopping there for now, there is a Valentine's Day resolution I'd like to suggest.&nbsp; It is that sometimes the way to head towards that beautiful picture of exaltation is to get up and change your seat.<br /><br />Jacob of the Old Testament was living where his father told him there were no worthy women of the gospel covenant to marry, so he changed his seat and went back to the land of his fathers, finding and marrying Rachael.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Ruth and Naomi, both widows, returned to the land of Naomi, and Naomi guided Ruth to change her seat, to be with Boaz in whose fields they were gleaning, and whom she eventually married.<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Lehi had his sons go get the brass plates from Laban, and when he read them he prophesied of his descendants.&nbsp; But wait: there were no wives for his sons, which means no descendants.&nbsp; So he told his sons that the Lord needed them to change their seats, to seats inside Ishmael's home, where, if full disclosure was made of how few there were on this future journey, and of the prophecies of future seed that led Lehi to send them, those young men basically proposed marriage.&nbsp; And they received a collective "yes."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>So if you are like some of my young adult children and their friends at different times, and you have found your seat to be studying every night alone in your apartment bedroom, maybe you need to change your seat to study in the library or the MC or even outside the doors here at the I Center, where you can meet others. Or if your seat on Friday night is on your couch, alone watching football, you might need to change it to a more social location.&nbsp; If you are married, it may be changing your seat to be next to your spouse so you can go with him or her when you normally haven't been spending that time with them. It could be a seat on a pre-planned well-deserved date night, or in a rocking chair taking your turn holding a sick baby.<br /><br />In the spirit of BYU-Idaho and "we don't just talk about things, we do and become," you might even change your seat during this Devotional.<br /><br />The flip side of resolving to change your seat might be to resolve to make the seat next to you a comfortable seat for someone to change to.</p>
<p>For example, one of the businesses I've been involved in was BYU single student housing in Provo.&nbsp; To keep up on it, I subscribed to the BYU daily student newspaper.&nbsp; On one occasion, in looking at advertisements, I came across an ad of a competing complex. A few issues later, I noticed that the ad had been slightly changed.</p>
<p>At BYU in Provo, shorts are allowed on campus, but the dress and grooming standards require that shorts go to the knees.&nbsp; Someone did a photo-shopping job to lower the shorts of the girl in the later picture, until her shorts went to her knees.<br /><br />Why?&nbsp; I didn't know for sure why it was changed, but I knew why I would change it.&nbsp; Their target customers were the same as ours.&nbsp; Our complexes appealed to recently returned male missionaries, and that was a business fact.&nbsp; So the business reason for the change was this: if you want to attract as many as possible of those target customers, who attend church regularly and are ecclesiastically endorsed by their bishops and stake presidents - then if you are a young woman, cover yourself completely in compliance with the dress standards.&nbsp; Even if the covering is pretty makeshift, like this photo-shopped one, do it. I think that business principle could be applied to making the seat next to you a comfortable one.<br /><br />As another possibility, if you are sitting in movie theatres with a seat next to you, and what is on the screen is something that some people might turn their eyes away from in modesty, or maybe even walk out on, but you do not look away from it, then maybe the seat next to you is not a comfortable one for some people to want to change to.<br /><br />Suggested Valentine's Day resolution number two:&nbsp;<br /><br />Again, while I was in your situation, when I first came home from my mission and returned to BYU, I ran into a friend I had before my mission, named Paul.&nbsp; He and I had done a lot of social activities together at BYU before our missions, going to dances together and on double dates.&nbsp; I think today you would call us "wingmen."&nbsp; When we saw each other again after our missions, it made sense for us to again become friends and "wingmen."<br /><br />But, as a recently returned missionary, I was careful about getting back to regular life.&nbsp; In particular, there was a very specific promise in my patriarchal blessing that used the unusual phrase of "social activities" and said that if I chose for close friends in my "social activities" only those who were righteous and desired to live the gospel, I would be greatly blessed.</p>
<p>So when I met Paul again, I wanted to make sure he was the kind of person described in that part of my patriarchal blessing, so that I could obtain the promise.&nbsp; It was Fast Sunday coming up, so I fasted and prayed about Paul and us being "wingmen" again.&nbsp; At the end of my fast, a very distinct answer came to me, that didn't make a lot of sense at the time, so I sort of put it on the shelf for later.&nbsp; But the answer was clearly a "yes," that he and I should share our social activities again.</p>
<p>And for the next several years, we did do a lot together.&nbsp; One of the activities we did was to visit the on-campus dorms during what was called "Open House."&nbsp; These particular dormitories were seven-story tower buildings, and since the girls only had bedrooms, boys were only allowed up on the floors during a supervised time called Open House, which was for two hours every other Sunday.&nbsp; So we would sometimes go to Open House and visit and meet, in what I would call "tracting," in honor of the missionary activity we had done so much of.</p>
<p>One Sunday, Paul asked me to meet him during Open House at the room of a girl that I knew.&nbsp; I took my roommate also, but we got there late, so we missed meeting Paul.&nbsp; We decided to just tract around all the floors of that tower looking for him. When we didn't find him, I chose just one floor of the next tower, since we were running out of time. We still didn't find him, so we went to the last of the three towers, and I turned to my roommate and said, "I chose one floor in the last tower, so you go ahead and choose one floor in this tower."&nbsp; He said, "Fifth floor."</p>
<p>We got up to the fifth floor and decided to go different directions.&nbsp; As I was going past one door, I suddenly heard someone call out my name, so I went back and looked in, and it was my friend Paul in that room.&nbsp; I went in, and he introduced me to the girls in that room, and one girl in particular.&nbsp; She had a letter from a missionary serving in France, and he had written some things in the letter that were in French, and she wanted to write some things back to him in French.&nbsp; I spoke French, so I sort of helped, though I admit I was not quite honest in what he said and in what I wrote to him, since he should be focusing on missionary work anyways.&nbsp; As I was working on it, there was an announcement that Open House hours were ending, so we three boys left to go to my car.</p>
<p>As I walked out with my roommate and Paul, I asked Paul, "So how do you know that girl with the French letter?"&nbsp; He said, "I don't know her."&nbsp; I asked if he even knew her name or where she lived, and he didn't.&nbsp; He then explained how he was there.&nbsp; When I was late, and missed meeting him where we had talked about, he began looking for me, and well, tracting.&nbsp; He had been going through the towers and was walking past this particular room when someone said "Hi."&nbsp; So he stopped, and went in and said "Hi." That was when he was asked, "Do you speak French?" His answer was, "No, but I'm looking for a friend of mine, and he does.&nbsp; And there he is!" And that is when I walked by.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since he didn't know her name, and since I also had not learned her name, I decided that there was no way of ever seeing her again.&nbsp; As we kept walking together to my car, I suddenly realized I had lost my car keys.&nbsp; We decided I must have lost them in the room we were all just in, so we ran back to the dorms and up to that room.&nbsp; It was crowded with people leaving, but no one was at that room, so we split up to find anyone.&nbsp; I luckily found one of the girls from that room by the elevator, the one with the French letter, who held my Eiffle Tower keychain, like this one, that she had found, and figured was mine.&nbsp; Waiting with her by that elevator, I had some time to find out her name and where she lived.<br /><br />It wasn't until many months later, when that girl and I were engaged and just about to be married, that I remembered what the answer had been to my fasting and prayer years before, about whether or not I should be close friends with Paul in my social activities.&nbsp; The answer had been: "How dare you think that Paul is not the kind of righteous person you should include in your social activities.&nbsp; He definitely is.&nbsp; He may someday introduce you to your wife!"<br /><br />And he had.&nbsp; He had only met her just moments before me, but he met her first, and introduced me.&nbsp; And it wasn't a great introduction, since he didn't know her name or where she lived.&nbsp; That girl with the French letter, is the same girl who wouldn't let me kiss her the first time and my father had to tell me to try again, and is now with me on the stand.<br /><br />So the final suggested Valentine's Day resolution is not about you, but about others, a sort of "cupid" resolution.&nbsp; It involves being like my friend Paul - a righteous friend that helps others find someone they can love and that will love them eternally in that beautiful picture of exaltation. I'm not advocating matchmaking.&nbsp; My friend Paul was not matchmaking.&nbsp; He was just... tracting.&nbsp; I would like to instead call him a righteous "go-between."<br /><br />I love the story of an important person in the scriptures, the trusted servant of Abraham, who also was a righteous "go-between."&nbsp; He was told by Abraham to find a wife for his son Isaac, back in the land of Abraham's nativity, and not among the non-covenant-keeping people where they lived.&nbsp; The servant worried that he would not find one or that she would not come.&nbsp; Abraham promised him angels to help him.&nbsp; What a great go-between job, where you are promised angels to be with you!<br /><br />When he got there, he prayed for help in identifying the right girl, and it was fulfilled when Rebekah offered to water his camels.&nbsp; When he found out she was of the right lineage and upbringing, he praised God aloud, right then and there, for how happy he was being a go-between with this success.&nbsp; He went with her to her family, and when her family consented to her going with him, he again immediately praised God aloud.<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Why was his job such a happy one?&nbsp; Because he had the Lord's hand in leading his life - and what a great experience that is, to be led by the Lord so clearly - as he helped to be a go-between and helped bring two people together.<br /><br />Let me end with this experience.&nbsp; Many years ago, my son and I were home teachers to an older couple. As we visited each month and got to know them over the years, we learned that Christmas was a sad time for them, primarily because of a family situation of sadness.<br /><br />One year, the couple asked us to help them change Christmas for them, to make it a happy time again.&nbsp; Our role as home teachers was to ask the bishop or anyone else we knew if there was a family of young children that needed some Christmas presents that year because they could not afford them.&nbsp; The couple we home taught would buy presents, give them to us as home teachers, and we would deliver them to the family.&nbsp; The family was not to know who brought the presents, and the couple did not want to know who the family was.&nbsp; The only people who would know who was who, were my son and I.<br /><br />The first Christmas was a wonderful experience, both for the family that received all those gifts, but more importantly to us, for our home teaching family, because looking for presents and shopping and choosing gave new life to them, and my son and I saw it.<br /><br />The next Christmas was even better.&nbsp; As we delivered the presents that year, after our third armful from my car, the mother receiving them was overwhelmed.&nbsp; As we went to walk out the door, she could hardly speak. But she stopped me and looked me in the eyes and said quietly, "You have no idea how much this means to us."&nbsp; I then felt I needed to tell her, "You have no idea how much this means to those giving it to you."<br /><br />At that moment, I think I felt something that I never would have guessed:&nbsp; these two women in particular - the mother receiving the presents, and the wife of the couple giving them - they loved each other, dearly.&nbsp; And they didn't even know each other.&nbsp; It was amazing, that I had been the go-between in bringing two people to love each other, even though they don't know each other. It was like I was a little piece of warm air, in the middle of their warm embrace.<br /><br />So how can you be a go-between for your friends?&nbsp; You have been reminded by President Clark and others that the Honor Code includes the obligation to help others live it, including living a chaste life, a commandment that is directly related to being clean and ready for being deeply in love with someone in that beautiful complete picture of exaltation we thought of.&nbsp; If you really do help a roommate or friend to stop making bad choices involving those principles, or you help rescue them from a serious problem, your friend might someday say to you, "You have no idea how much this means to me." Maybe on that day, like I felt, you will feel you could say to your friend, "You have no idea how much this means to the other person who will love you so much in the future."&nbsp; Like me, you may feel that two people love each other very much, and they don't even know each other.&nbsp; And you can have the joy of being a go-between.&nbsp; No wonder Abraham's servant praised God aloud for seeing the Lord's hand in his life, as a righteous go-between.<br /><br />Now I know that this devotional is being broadcast live on radio and internet, and rebroadcast on TV, and that it can potentially reach the entire world.&nbsp; This is likely the only time in my life I will have what I say broadcast to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the serious consequence of testifying before the world of anything other than what I actually know and what I can actually witness of, I now bear witness that I know that God our Heavenly Father is real.&nbsp; I know personally that he communes with his children in prayer, for he has communed with me in prayer and manifested to me his reality and love.&nbsp; I would give up the rest of my existence to be in His presence and feel that continuing love.&nbsp;<br /><br />I also bear witness that I know that the man who is documented to have lived in the Holy Land 2000 years ago, who was crucified by cruel men in a corrupt government at a young age, that man called Jesus of Nazareth, is the Messiah and the Christ, and the Son of Almighty God.&nbsp; I witness that He literally redeems from sin, for he has redeemed me, an imperfect and sinful man who still needs his redemption. I witness that I know He rose from the dead, and is alive and living today. I witness of his love and healing and power.&nbsp;<br /><br />But most importantly, if I can witness nothing else, I bear witness that I know that He has been very personally involved in my life, in preparing me and directing me to love and be loved in his exaltation.&nbsp; I testify that I know he is that close and that personal.<br /><br />Paul the Apostle stood on Mars Hill, and saw the idols and statues they had.&nbsp; He realized how nice it must feel to anyone to have gods you can see all the time, and know they see you and are right with you, because they are idols or statues and you can touch them.&nbsp; But Paul's words are my words, when he said that God was not in those statues, "though he be not far from everyone one of us,"<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not too long ago, Sister Stutz and I had the pleasure of meeting a Brigham Young University-Idaho student in an off-campus setting. After discovering our common ties to this institution, one of the first comments this student made was, "I so love Devotionals at BYU-Idaho." I asked her what it is about Devotionals that she loves so much. "I love coming together as a campus community, learning from faculty and other wise people, and especially I love feeling the Spirit," she replied. &nbsp;"What prompted you to start attending Devotional?" I inquired. "Students who had gone before told me how great it was and encouraged me to go. So I did. After that first experience I was hooked and have attended Devotional ever since." &nbsp;"Do you often share what you learn in Devotional with others?" &nbsp;I probed. She reflected, "Each week I share what I learn with my parents, friends, and others, including the Devotional Highlight on BYU-Idaho's Facebook page." &nbsp;"Have you ever invited someone who may not be attending to come to Devotional with you?" I asked. "Yes," she replied. "I encourage my roommates to attend and sometimes ask classmates if they are going to devotional, too. &nbsp;Some come, but others don't." &nbsp;Acknowledging that some students and employees are unable to attend Devotional due to work or other commitments, I asked, "Why do you think some choose to regularly attend Devotional, while others rarely choose to do so?" &nbsp;Her response was insightful. "I think Devotionals are amazing! &nbsp;You put yourself in a situation where the Spirit can teach you more. Those who are serious about their conversion to the Gospel make time for Devotional."<sup>1</sup><br /><br />Brothers and sisters, while a student at Brigham Young University and since coming to Rexburg to begin working at this institution in 1987, I have been privileged to attend many Tuesday devotionals. During and following nearly all of them, I have felt the Holy Spirit testify of truth taught and felt prompted to repent and to discuss with others what I experienced. With that understanding of the purpose for Devotional, I am humbled by the opportunity to address you today and pray for and invite the influence of the Holy Ghost to be with and teach us. I invite you to write down promptings you receive and to commit to discuss your thoughts later today with someone else you care about. As you do, both you and those who welcome the accompanying Spirit will be uplifted and feel an added measure of God's love for them.<br /><br />Many years ago, as I began serving as head coach of the Ricks College men's and women's cross country teams, I reflected on my experience as a distance runner and assistant coach. I had observed runners--inferior in talent to their peers--often out-perform these peers in key races. I had also observed talented runners who ran well, race after race. What was it about these runners that enabled them to experience consistent success? In what ways did they focus internally to get the most from what they did physically? As a young coach I concluded if I could figure out what consistently successful runners focused their thoughts on as they prepared for and ran races and teach this in a way those I coached could learn and passionately apply, then as individuals, as teams, and as a program we would realize greater success and be happier with the results.<br /><br />One of the most foundational of these success principles is to have a clear understanding of your purpose.&nbsp; Understanding a strong, well-defined purpose empowers you to succeed. It strengthens your resolve and commitment, energizes you to get through obstacles, and focuses your efforts as you proceed along your chosen path. The first step to understanding your purpose is to discover what it is.<br /><br />At one of our team meetings at the first of each cross country season, I would invite then college president, Elder David Bednar, to speak to our athletes. One of the first questions he would ask them was, "What do you think is the purpose of our cross country program at Ricks College?" After listening to their responses, he would clarify, "There is really only one reason why we have athletics at Ricks College and that is so others may see Christ's image engraven in your countenances."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He would then invite each of our team members to embrace the Honor Code, to live by both the letter and spirit for which it was given. He would also promise our athletes that as they diligently strove to realize that purpose, the Lord would strengthen them to perform beyond their natural abilities.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Understanding that purpose, buying into it as if it was their own, and exercising faith to receive the promised blessings, our athletes and teams radiated the light of Christ and were empowered to experience great success.<br /><br />Having a&nbsp;<em>knowledge</em>&nbsp;of your purpose is essential, but knowledge alone is not enough to lead you to consistent action. You must come to<em>understand</em>&nbsp;your purpose.<br /><br />Have you ever discovered a principle that you knew would be important to apply only to forget that principle when the time eventually came for living it? I know I have countless times. &nbsp;Several years ago at a Question &amp; Answer session with President Bednar, I asked, "How do you learn things for keeps?" He responded, "You learn something for keeps when it goes from your head to your heart."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Brothers and Sisters, we come to&nbsp;<em>understand</em>&nbsp;our purpose when the Holy Ghost takes the&nbsp;<em>knowledge</em>&nbsp;of our purpose and "puts [it] in [our] inward parts, and write[s] it in [our] hearts."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Clearly understanding your purpose and believing in the benefits that will accrue as you actively pursue that purpose will focus your thoughts and actions to achieve your goals. As recorded in the Book of Mormon, Captain Moroni led the Nephite armies many times against invading Lamanites who intended "to destroy [them] or to subject them and bring them into bondage that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land" (Alma 43:29). Contrast that purpose for going to battle with this purpose of the Nephites:</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired for a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church"<em>&nbsp;</em>(Alma 43:45).<br /><br />In one particular battle, as the tide turned in favor of the Lamanite armies, the Nephites' courage and determination to press on faltered.<br /><br />"And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts--yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage. And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom from bondage. And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them" (Alma 43:48-50).<br /><br />Notice that when his men were about to give up, Moroni reminded them of their purpose. He reminded them that they were fighting not just for their lives, but for their wives, children, other family members and friends back in their home lands; for their liberty to worship God; and to pursue their choices free from the tyranny of their enemy. I'm sure Moroni's inspired words also reminded them of their duty to support their fellow brethren fighting with them and to exercise faith in God's long-standing promise to bless and prosper them in the land as long as they were an obedient, covenant-keeping people.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And notice that Moroni's words "inspired their hearts"&mdash;that is, the soldiers received an understanding of Moroni's words through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />Remembering their purpose, the Nephite soldiers turned from fear-induced thoughts of fleeing and toward fighting the enemy with renewed determination. &nbsp;<br /><br />As I envision this scene, I don't see every single Nephite soldier turning at the exact same moment with re-instilled courage to face the enemy. Rather, I suspect that there were a few stalwart soldiers whose hope in their cause had never wavered, and who had fought valiantly on even as many of their comrades began to doubt and retreat. Then there were those whose faith had only just began to falter who, when buoyed by Moroni's words, quickly rejoined these unwavering ones now fully invested in the cause. Then finally, there were those who had truly begun to doubt their ability to succeed, who, when observing the confident actions of their fellows in arms, had their faith strengthen to go forward again to contend with the enemy.<br /><br />I believe there are many in the Lord's army today who are wavering, on the brink of shrinking and fleeing, who are observing our example, to see what choices you and I will make, before ultimately deciding to fight the good fight with faith that God will deliver them or to retreat and give up hope. Never underestimate the powerful influence you can be in the lives of others by small and simple things you do each day.<br /><br />Returning to the Nephite battle, it was then&mdash;when they all had eventually returned to passionately face the Lamanites--that the Nephite armies unitedly cried unto God with faith that He would strengthen them to achieve their goal--victory in battle--in order to realize their purpose. Soon after they acted with faith, the Nephites were strengthened by the Lord in a powerful manner to stand against their enemies and cause them to flee.<br /><br />Following the victorious battle the people of Nephi did not boast in their own strength, nor did they taunt or make fun of their conquered opponent, but "[they] were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy" (Alma 45:1).<br /><br />Like the Nephites, you and I too will be strengthened to accomplish the righteous desires of our hearts in powerful ways as we passionately focus on our purpose before, during, and after life's battles. With a clear understanding of our purpose and owning that purpose as our own, we will willingly do the work necessary to prepare in advance. Recalling that purpose as we are engaged in the fight will strengthen our resolve to face challenges head-on instead of shrinking and fleeing. Remembering our purpose after a conflict will help us keep in perspective the outcome, appropriately rejoice, acknowledge the Lord's hand, and humbly move forward.<br /><br />So what is your life's purpose? If someone asked you could you tell them? And, most importantly, has that purpose sunk deep into your heart so that it influences your every thought and deed?<br /><br />As sons and daughters of Heavenly Father we all have a divine purpose: to become like Them. In the Pre-Existence, as Their spirit sons and daughters, we observed in Their glorified and perfected souls<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;power in the Priesthood<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and charity towards all. They expressed Their desire for us to become like Them and Heavenly Father unfolded a plan by which this could be brought about. His Son Jehovah, who lived the teachings of Heavenly Father fully<sup>9</sup>, was the key link that made the realization of The Plan possible.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>There were others in the Pre-Existence who fought against our Father's Plan, seeking God's power without the necessary development that comes with choice and accountability.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose to stand with Jehovah and our Father and shouted for joy<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;as we won the opportunity to follow the Plan for our eternal happiness. Inherent in the Plan was that our spirits come to this earth to receive a physical body from earthly parents, to learn to live by faith, and to prove ourselves.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Jehovah came to earth as Jesus and wrought the Atonement forever linking our premortal, mortal, and post-mortal lives and making possible exaltation as we "live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God"&nbsp;<em>(</em>D&amp;C 84:44). "For we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23).<br /><br />Our purpose, then, is to become like our Heavenly Parents. Given the veil of forgetfulness between mortality and the Pre-Existence, we have the scriptures, prophets, and the Holy Ghost to teach us what to do and be and Jesus Christ as our Exemplar, He being like our Heavenly Father in all things. We become like Him as we learn of Him, seek to do what He would do, and allow the Holy Spirit into our hearts. It is doing the primary things--having meaningful prayer morning and night, studying the scriptures daily, attending our Church meetings and partaking of the sacrament, paying tithing and offerings, serving others, making and keeping covenants, and repenting. But it is more than just doing them. It is doing them on purpose--with real intent, with the heartfelt desire to change and become more like Christ.</p>
<p>Elder Dallen H. Oaks has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts--what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts--what we have become. It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As a teenager, I remember when, at the Prophet's request, a word was changed in the lyrics of the popular LDS children's song, I Am a Child of God. The phrase, "teach me all that I must know" was changed to "teach me all that I must do"<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;to emphasize the importance of not only knowing the truth, but of acting according to that knowledge. Now as I listen to or sing that song, in my mind I change that phrase again to "teach me all that I must be" to remind myself to act with real intent and, when I find myself in the role of teacher, to teach the "why" in addition to "what" to do.</p>
<p>What is our purpose as students and employees at Brigham Young University-Idaho? In his inaugural address President Kim B. Clark summarized the mission of BYU-Idaho in two words: disciple leader. &nbsp;He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our mission, our very purpose, is to educate, develop, and prepare disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ...The Lord watches over this university in a direct and powerful way. He is mindful of the individual students who come here. Our purpose is to help them become His true followers, His true disciples, a light to the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The second word is leader. When I use that word I have in mind leadership with a small 'l.' This is the kind of leadership we need in every part of every kind of organization in our society. We want our students to provide the kind of leadership that serves, and inspires&mdash;first and foremost in their families and in the Church, in their communities, and in their work.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>That kind of discipleship and leadership comes as we worthily invite the Holy Spirit into everything we do. With diligent work, often after all we can do, the Spirit will enlighten and strengthen us beyond our natural capacities. It's our secret weapon, though it should not be a secret to any who understands the gospel and our Heavenly Father's Plan.</p>
<p>Elder Henry B. Eyring described it like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All of this great future that we're speaking of at this institution will depend upon miracles regularly occurring, where students learn more than you thought you could learn...Your teachers will teach better than their natural capacities would ever allow them to do because the powers of heaven will come down. They will come down because of your faith...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I hope I live long enough to someday meet some employer who employed one of you and says, "Where did that come from? I've never had such a person. Why people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don't have to be led; they're seeking to go where that person wants to go. And they come up with new ideas. I don't know where that comes from. They seem to find a better way, and the budget doesn't go up. I can't understand it." And I'll smile and say, "Well, come with me to Rexburg." And I may not be able to show it to you, and I may not be able to prove it to you, but you'll feel it. There will be a spirit here, I so testify, because of the love of God for all of His faithful children. And those blessings will be poured out here in rich abundance.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our purpose at BYU-Idaho is to build a Zion community: people of one heart and one mind united in the faith in preparing the world for Christ's millennial reign. In a devotional a few years ago, Elder Kim B. Clark presented a map which helps us see how to establish Zion in our own lives and how to encourage our roommates and friends to build Zion in theirs. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Being in the zone of Zion takes courage and discipline and faith. &nbsp;To be there you must do two things at the same time-you must show great love and support and encouragement; and, at the very same time, you must teach doctrine, set a good example, and encourage righteous attitudes and behavior...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Brothers and sisters, when we take the nurture and admonition of the Lord to those who are wounded, who are struggling with sin or discouragement, who are confused and lost, we do a great work. &nbsp;It is not an easy work, but it is right and it is good. &nbsp;It is the Lord's work. &nbsp;It is the work we covenant to do all of our lives...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He wants you to flee Babylon, every bit of it. &nbsp;He wants you to come to Zion, to build Zion here and now. It is in part so that this university will accomplish its divinely appointed mission and destiny...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is [the Savior's] promise I will make to you: &nbsp;If you are true to your covenants, if you will act in faith to help your roommates and your friends, you will learn how to build Zion together...And the blessings of Zion--the blessings of unity, holiness, righteousness, peace, joy, happiness, and power--will flow into your life and into the lives of your family forever.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Jacob Spori, the first principal of this institution, made the following inspired prediction at its founding in 1888. He said, "The seeds we are planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Elder Boyd K. Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a lesson that few members of the Church ever seem to learn. The lesson is this: We are not merely receptacles for the gospel; we are also conveyors of it. This idea is so important...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we have others in mind, we store the knowledge away in our minds in a different way than if it is all&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>I</em>. We know we will use it and why. It is much more easily recalled. We can add to it much more easily...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we do not gather gospel facts with the thought of sharing them, we store them in our minds in a different way and they become less valuable to us. It is so much easier to gather them with a desire to give them away in simple terms so that all can understand them.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When Henry B. Eyring served as President of Ricks College more than 40 years ago, he made the following observation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We have a tradition of training teachers, and a vision of a great oak whose branches reach out around the world...We will need a special breed of young person, rare today, but becoming more common. Raise them and let us train them, not to save them, but to help them save the world. The College has a destiny, seen by its leader from the beginning, and it will fill that destiny.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, as members of the BYU-Idaho community, let us strive to teach and learn truth with a desire to share it to make a difference in the lives of others. Having this as our purpose will make all the difference in our experience now and in the future.</p>
<p>Without a clear understanding of your purpose, you will wile away your life, be swept to and fro in the constant whirlwind of day-to-day living, be content to live out your existence from day to day but never make a real difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we be reminded often of our purposes so that we will passionately pursue them? By doing the primary actions with real intent, making Devotionals a regular habit, and sharing what we learn with others.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, as you consider your purposes, is there sufficient evidence by your actions to substantiate that these are truly why you are here? Are you passionate about realizing your purpose? As a result of your actions does Christ's light shine in you more today than it did yesterday, last week, or last year?<br /><br />To really excel in anything you must be driven by a purpose. If you are passionate about your purpose, you will stay committed long past when others have shrunk and fled.<br /><br />I remember as a young missionary in the Provo Missionary Training Center listening to Elder LeGrand Richards, an Apostle, speak to the missionaries gathered there just a few months before he passed away. &nbsp;Elder Richards, who was well into his nineties, because of dimming eyesight delivered his talks without the aid of written materials. Well do I remember the energy with which he spoke at General Conferences, often mentioning his disappointment in seeing the blinking light on the podium indicating it was time to conclude his remarks. I will never forget that night he came and spoke to us missionaries. With great fervor and characteristic wit, Elder Richards stood and spoke to us about "Enthusi<em>i</em>sm"--yes, that's exactly the word he used over and over again-- and how we ought to demonstrate enthusi<em>i</em>sm<em>&nbsp;</em>for missionary work and all that we do in life. &nbsp;Not long before coming to address us missionaries in the MTC, because of failing health he had had one of his legs amputated. Commenting on that he proclaimed, "I would rather die from the bottom up than from the top down."<sup>22</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Our Heavenly Fathers lives and cares deeply about each one of us. When our purpose is to become like Him, we will "keep [His] commandments, yea, with all [our] might, mind and strength" (D&amp;C 11:20).<em>&nbsp;</em>Passionately following His Plan because we understand its purpose and embrace it will bring great joy and peace into our lives as we share who we are to bless others. Jesus Christ is our Savior, the only One who makes the realization of our divine purposes possible. May God bless you and me to remember, remember our purposes in life, to become passionate in pursuing them is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>First Counselor, Relief Society General Presidency</p>
<p>Sister Carole M. Stephens was serving on the Relief Society general board when she accepted the call to serve as first counselor in the general presidency. She has served in various stake and ward callings in Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary. She also served as a Church-service missionary in the Family Search Library and as a Seminary teacher. <br /><br />Sister Stephens studied Early Childhood Education at Weber State College in Ogden, Utah where she met her husband; Martin R. Stephens. They were married in the Logan Temple and are the parents of six children and 20 grandchildren. <br /><br />Sister Stephens loves the scriptures and joins with Ammon declaring; "...how great reason we have to rejoice; And this is the blessing that has been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work...Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in His strength I can do all things" <em>(Alma 26).</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a general conference talk, Elder Robert D. Hales taught, "What is said is not as important as what we hear and what we feel."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I pray that today, as Elder Hales said, "the still, small voice of the Spirit can be clearly heard, felt, and understood."</p>
<p>We live in the last days&mdash;days the Apostle Paul described as "perilous times" when "men shall be lovers of their own selves . . . proud . . . disobedient to parents, unthankful . . . without natural affection . . . despisers of those that are good . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. . . . Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Paul prophesied of people in the last days who would "resist the truth"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and "turn away their ears from the truth."<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Blessed with latter-day revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, we know that we can come to the knowledge of the truth. In Doctrine and Covenants 121:26, we read, "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost."<br /><br />We receive personal revelation and knowledge of the truth by the power of the Holy Ghost. The Lord said: "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation. . . .This is thy gift; apply unto it."<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Seeking to know truth, Joseph Smith sought answers in the Bible. From James 1:5-6 he learned: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering [meaning not doubting or hesitating]." Pondering this led Joseph to a grove of trees to ask God in faith for an answer to his question.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our family recently enjoyed a memorable vacation in the eastern United States. The journey began in New York City, with its bright lights, baseball, and theatre. After a quick stop at Niagara Falls, we set our sights on Church history. We visited Harmony, Palmyra, and Kirtland and then gathered together for one last family meeting before departing for home. Everyone was invited to share a memorable experience. After several family members had shared, our granddaughter Maggie said, "My favorite place was the Sacred Grove." I asked her if she would like to tell us why. She was quiet for a moment. We could tell by her expression that she was deep in thought. Her sweet mom recognized that she was struggling and encouraged her, saying, "Sometimes it's hard to find the right words, isn't it?" Maggie replied, "Yes, it is. I don't know how to explain it. It's just something I felt there."<br /><br />It was something she felt&mdash;something she couldn't describe in words. But with childlike faith, Maggie trusted the promptings of the Spirit that entered into her mind and heart in that sacred place.<br /><br />We must also learn to trust the still, small voice of the Spirit. Through the priesthood and by the laying on of hands, we have received the privilege of enjoying the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a member of the Godhead, as we remain worthy. This is a beginning on the path from testimony to conversion, which, for many of us, is, as Elder David A. Bednar taught, "an ongoing process and not a onetime event."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Learning to recognize how the Spirit speaks to you in simple daily experiences is crucial. The accuser, even Satan, will attempt to wear you down, planting seeds of doubt, fear, discouragement, and frustration in an attempt to weaken your faith. He will try to fill your mind with feelings of inadequacy and doubt, wanting to keep you from trusting and heeding the promptings from the Holy Ghost that enter your mind and heart even in small and simple things.<br /><br />A few months ago, an unexpected source reminded me of the importance of trusting the still, small voice of the Spirit. Our grandson was staying at our home. He loves trains, so he wanted to watch the movie&nbsp;<em>The Polar Express&mdash;</em>over and over and over again. As I watched with him, I was drawn to one character&mdash;a young girl who always seemed to know the right thing to do. Even though she knew what was right, questions from others often led her to feel doubt. In the scene you are about to watch, the girl has decided to take a cup of hot chocolate to a little boy who is sitting alone in another car of the train.<br /><br />The girl retrieves a cup of hot chocolate she has hidden under her seat and carefully makes her way to the back of the train car. A boy notices her and asks, "Where are you going with that?" She turns, motions toward to the little boy sitting alone, and answers, "It's for him." The boy continues to question her: "I don't think we're supposed to leave our seats." Then another boy joins in: "Yeah, it's a violation of railroad safety regulations for a kid to cross moving cars without a grown-up." She is determined to serve this hot chocolate to the little boy sitting alone, and she continues to walk toward the rear door of the train, telling them, "I think I'll be okay." Then the question comes: "Are you sure?" The instant she hears this question she stops. She doesn't turn around right away. It's obvious the question has caused her to doubt herself and the wisdom of her simple act of service.<br /><br />"Are you sure?" At times, even a simple small question of doubt can cause us to question ourselves and weaken our resolve. And so we are commanded: "Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. . . Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>President Boyd K. Packer has taught that Heavenly Father wants each of His children to have "a shield of faith made to buckle on so firmly that it can neither be pulled off nor penetrated by [the adversary's] fiery darts."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Sometimes those fiery darts come from others. Sometimes they come from within, as we challenge in our minds what we know to be true in our hearts.<br /><br />Back to the young girl in&nbsp;<em>The Polar Express</em>. The same boy who first questioned her about the hot chocolate now finds her sitting in the engineer's chair. He says, "You? How do you know how?" "Easy!" she says. "Come here. I'll show you!" She is so excited to show him what she has learned, and she points to each lever as she explains its function: "This big lever here, that's the throttle. And then this little one here, that's the brake. And those are the pressure gauges. And that rope is the whistle!"<br /><br />"The whistle?" the boy says. He can't resist. He reaches up pulls the cord, and (as) the whistle blows (he exclaims); "I've wanted to do that my whole life!" he exclaims.<br /><br />They hear the engineer, who is on the front of the train. He is franticly calling, "Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop . . . the . . . train!" "What?" the boy asks. "He wants us to stop the train!" the girl says. "Which one of these is the brake?" the boy questions. Pointing to a small lever the girl replies; "He told me this was the brake!"</p>
<p>"Who?" "The engineer!" "The engineer?" "Yes!" "What about this red one?" the boy asks. "It looks like a brake." "No, no!" the girl says. "He said this was the brake!" Then comes the question "Are you sure? Are you sure?"<br /><br />With his hands on the lever with the red handle, the boy looks at the girl, waiting for her to answer his question: Are you sure? But she is frozen with fear and doesn't respond at all. She covers her eyes with her hands.<br /><br />"Stop the train! STOP THE TRAIN!" the engineer continues to yell.<br /><br />The boy looks to his friend to make a decision. She still has her hands covering her eyes but separates her fingers for just a moment to look at him. He chooses to trust her, removes his hand from the lever with the red handle that looks more like the brake, and reaches for the little one, which is indeed the brake. He pulls it with all his might, and the brakes lock.</p>
<p>The girl knew exactly what she needed to do. She had been taught. But when she was under pressure in a stressful, noisy, urgent situation, someone else's doubt led her to doubt herself. She was so overcome with the fear of making the wrong decision that she refused to act!<br /><br />Sometimes, like the girl in the movie, we find ourselves surrounded by noise and overwhelmed by responsibilities. And when that happens, someone else's doubt can lead us to doubt the truths we already know.<br /><br />There are times in all of our lives when distraction and fear collide with faith. This is exactly where the adversary would like us to stay - so disabled by fear that we are unable to act or refuse to act.<br /><br />Faith is a principle of action. And so, Church leaders teach us to live by faith. Elder Neil L. Andersen said: "Fear and faith cannot coexist in our hearts at the same time. In our days of difficulty we choose . . . faith"<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Peter chose faith. Focused on and trusting in Jesus Christ, he stepped out onto the water. As long as he stayed focused on the Savior, he walked on the water. But when he lost his focus, when he was distracted, when, as the scriptures say, "he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid." As he began to sink, he chose faith, he acted. He cried out to the Savior, "Lord, save me."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Each of us experiences this from time to time. Surrounded by noise and overwhelmed with responsibility, under the weight of school, family, Church, work and other responsibilities, we begin to sink. Perhaps some are sinking under the weight of sin. We can and must learn to trust in the Savior's strengthening, enabling, sanctifying, healing, and comforting power, through His Atonement.<br /><br />Several years ago, I felt myself beginning to sink under the weight of opportunity and responsibility. We had two sons still living at home, one son on a mission, and three other children scattered across the United States with their families. My husband was running for a State-wide political office and I was supporting him and traveling with him when I was able. My father was recovering from open heart surgery and my Mother was dying of cancer.&nbsp; I took every opportunity to sit with Mom during her treatments, helping in their home, cooking, cleaning, and spending nights caring for my Mother so Dad could rest. As you can see, responsibilities associated with home and family were many and varied. I was also serving as a Stake Relief Society president. My days were filled with responsibilities and sweet opportunities to serve. One night I arrived home late, the house was quiet, I put in a new CD. The music soothed my troubled heart. One song touched me in a special way. I played it over and over listening to the words. As I listened, three words; "Lord, remember me" filled me with the Spirit and entered into my mind and my heart. I closed my eyes and offered a silent prayer. I asked; "Lord, do you remember me?" The Spirit enveloped me and I heard this thought enter my mind; "I remember you, do you remember me?"</p>
<p>I realized at that very moment that, like Peter, I was distracted and had momentarily lost focus on the Savior. Like Martha, I was, "cumbered about much serving, and worried and troubled about many things..."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I was reminded; "one thing is needful..."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and partaking deeply of that "good part",<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;the Savior and His Atonement, each day is a choice.</p>
<p>In Moses 1:39 we are reminded; "For behold, this is My work and My glory. To bring to pass the immortality and Eternal life of man."<br /><br />Elder Nelson recently taught, "A loving Heavenly Father has but two desires for His children, immortality and eternal life, which means life back home."<sup>14</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>As beloved sons and daughters of heavenly parents, we have a divine nature and destiny. We were taught before we came into this life. President Henry B. Eyring emphasized this truth when he reminded us, "You were tutored by Him. . . . He helped you understand and accept that you would have trials, tests, and opportunities perfectly chosen just for you. You learned that our Father had a plan of happiness to get you safely through those trials and that you would help bring others safely through theirs. This plan is marked by covenants with God."<br /><br />President Eyring continued, "Heavenly Father taught you before you were born about the experiences you would have as you left Him and came to earth. You were taught that the way back home to Him would not be easy. He knew that it would be too hard for you to make the journey without help. You have been blessed not only to find the way to make those covenants in this life but also to be surrounded by others who will help."<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Take a moment and look around you. You are not alone. You are surrounded by others who will help!<br /><br />President Packer said, "We are at war with the forces of the adversary, and we need each and every one of us if we are going to succeed in the work the Savior has for us to do."<sup>16</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Toward the end of&nbsp;<em>The Polar Express</em>, the girl, the boy, and their little friend, are caught in a runaway train car. When the car finally stops, they are in an unfamiliar place. The girl takes a moment to get her bearings. She looks around and, more important, she listens. Finally she asks, "Do you hear that? The bell!" "What bell?" the boy asks. "The sleigh bell!" she replies. "Don't you hear it? It's coming from that tunnel. That's the way we should go! Come on!"<br /><br />Confidently, she presses forward across a train track, high above an icy ravine. "Come on!" she says. "We're lost!" the questioning boy says. Undeterred and confident, the girl says, "Yes, yes. I hear it." She knows that they are still on the right path; even in the confusion she can hear the bell! She is so happy when she hears their little friend say, "I hear it too." Confused and unsure, the questioning boy says again, "I don't hear anything." "Okay, it's down this way." She confidently leads out again, only to hear the boy's familiar question, "Are you sure?" She stops for a moment, she still hears the bell. She knows they are on the right path, and she answers, "Absolutely!"<br /><br />You know the truth. You have felt the influence of the Spirit. When doubting voices ask that question&mdash;"Are you sure?"&mdash;remember President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's counsel, "Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And confidently answer, "Yes! Absolutely! I am sure!"Testify. Trust the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Put your trust in living prophets. As we face the "perilous times" prophesied by Paul, we have warnings and promises from living prophets to guide us.<br /><br />And Elder M. Russell Ballard assured us that we can trust our living prophets. He promised, "We will not and . . . cannot lead you astray."<sup>18</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Early one morning as I quickly got off an elevator with my briefcase on wheels, the bag with additional files that rested on top of the briefcase fell off and was dangling from the handle. I was in a hurry to get to a meeting so didn't take time to stop and adjust the dangling bag. I just tried to fix it while I continued to walk. I wasn't paying attention to where I was going and when I finally looked up I was face to face with Elder Scott!<br /><br />He didn't say anything to me but simply looked into my eyes. When an Apostle engages you with his eyes, you don't move because you can't! And you don't want to anyway. I felt that Elder Scott was looking deep into my heart and I hoped that he would find something good there!<br /><br />I don't know how long the experience lasted, but soon Elder Scott smiled at me, nodded his head and walked on, into the doors of the temple. I watched him until he was out of sight and then I burst into tears! I was weeping! I was really surprised by my emotion and wondered why I was responding this way.<br /><br />I walked into my meeting, trying to compose myself, but still in tears. Everyone was concerned and asked if I was okay. The only thing I could say was, "Yes, I'm fine. Elder Scott just smiled at me!"<br /><br />I wanted to understand why this brief encounter had caused such an emotional reaction, what was it that caused this deep emotion to surface? I prayed to know and came to understand that what I felt from Elder Scott was 'pure love.' I felt for a moment what it may feel like to be in the presence of the Savior, because that's who Elder Scott represents. Elder Scott is a special witness of the Savior. He is like Him. He knows Him. I felt the Saviors 'pure love' through him.<br /><br />Trust the Savior's strengthening, enabling, sanctifying, healing, and comforting power through His Atonement. Trust God, your Eternal Father, whose work and glory is "to bring to pass [your] immortality and eternal life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for that beautiful musical number. I love how the hymns we sing and the special musical presentations that are shared with us in these devotional meetings so consistently invite the Spirit to be with us. Thanks to all of you gifted musicians, for sharing your talent with us.<br /><br />Dear Brothers and Sisters.&nbsp; Borrowing a phrase of scripture, I consider this both a great and terrible opportunity for me to be here with you today.&nbsp; Believe me I much prefer to sit where you are sitting.&nbsp; I had no idea when I started teaching here just over a year and a half ago that the invitation to speak at a devotional could ever be given to me. &nbsp;Sincerely though, I am very grateful for the opportunity and responsibility that I have been given to share some thoughts with you today. I have humbly sought to be guided by the Holy Ghost in my preparations for this meeting.&nbsp; I express appreciation to many friends, family members, and even students who have prayed for me and encouraged me in this assignment. &nbsp;<br /><br />I pray that we might all feel the influence of the Holy Ghost through this meeting, and seek to keep it with us throughout this day. Please strive to listen for spiritual promptings that you personally might receive today and take note of what you can and should do to follow those promptings. My main objectives are to help us feel the spirit, that we might be buoyed up, inspired and encouraged and that we might all become more motivated to do our best to use all of the wonderful resources our Heavenly Father has provided to help us all be successful today, tomorrow and throughout our mortal lives.<br /><br />Before I proceed, I want especially you students to know that I love you.&nbsp; Something very special happened to me on my first day of teaching on this campus.&nbsp; On that September morning as I was reflecting on the awesome opportunity and responsibility that had been given to me, a great feeling of love overcame me.&nbsp; This experience has happened many times since that day.&nbsp; It is a gift from my Heavenly Father.&nbsp; It is a feeling of love from Him and a love for the students of this university.&nbsp; Even though I don't know many of you, I feel a special love for you and I desire to do all that I can to help you find success and joy during your educational experience here at BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />I testify that our Father in Heaven is aware of each one of you.&nbsp; Now hopefully most of you already know this but there are possibly some of you that question whether He truly is aware of you.&nbsp; I assure you that He loves you and wants you to be successful in all of your righteous desires. He wants you to be happy and to have joy in this life and in the eternities. I know that this is true because I have felt of His love and witnessed His dealings with me, with family members and many others. Most importantly I know it is true because the Holy Ghost has very strongly witnessed to me that it is true.<br /><br />Because of the great love that our Father in Heaven has for us, He has provided the means for us to learn and to become more like Him by experiencing mortality on this earth.&nbsp; We know that it is His work and His glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His spirit children. (Moses 1:39)&nbsp; And as Lehi taught, we know that "Men are, that they might have joy." (2 Nephi 2:25)&nbsp; A necessary part of Heavenly Father's plan or the plan of happiness for His children is that we be given the gift of agency, the ability to choose to either follow His plan and receive joy or choose some other way which will not provide the joy He desires that we receive.&nbsp; In this way our mortal life is a test as to which route we will take, the one that leads back to our Father in Heaven and eternal joy or the one that takes us away from Him.&nbsp; As His sons and daughters we have been given many gifts or resources to help us through our mortal journey.&nbsp; I will refer to these as divine gifts from God.&nbsp; Some of these gifts are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a difficult time as you know.&nbsp; The forces of evil are working throughout the world to combat the plan of Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Oh how we need His help today! &nbsp;I believe that we who are blessed to live in this the final dispensation of the fullness of times and especially those who enjoy the blessings of membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints have the opportunity to receive more divine gifts than any people of any other dispensation.&nbsp; For example some of these include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly, Father in Heaven has given us many gifts to help us through our mortal journey.&nbsp; All of these things He has freely given but we have the choice whether we will actually receive them.&nbsp; What does it really mean to receive a gift?&nbsp; Can a gift be given and yet not received?&nbsp; Of course it can and unfortunately it is often the case for many of us.&nbsp; So what does it mean to truly receive a gift from Father in Heaven?&nbsp; The word "receive" as I am using it here is a verb.&nbsp; As I'm sure you know, a verb is a word that expresses an action.&nbsp; In this case to receive is to take possession of a gift and utilize it.&nbsp; Of what use is a gift if it is not received? The Lord has stated "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?&nbsp; Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift." (D&amp;C 88:33.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Do we truly recognize and receive the gifts God gives to us, or do we sometimes forget about and neglect them?&nbsp; Do we rejoice in the gifts He has given?&nbsp; Does He rejoice in our receipt and use of His gifts to us? Now please note that I am including myself in these questions.&nbsp; I, like probably many of you can do better at receiving and rejoicing in the gifts that I have been given by Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Unfortunately when we neglect or do not take full advantage of these gifts we forfeit some of the guidance and help that He wants us to have and we may personally slow or pause our progress in our journey to be prepared to return to His presence.&nbsp; We could be missing much of the growth and joy that we could otherwise experience by utilizing these gifts.&nbsp; This is illustrated well by the Savior's parable of the talents.&nbsp; The two individuals who utilized and increased upon the gifts that they had been given were greatly rewarded while the individual that did nothing with his gift, gained nothing and as a result lost the gift he had been given.<br /><br />I would like to review five of the gifts that Father in Heaven has given us with the hope that by considering them we might be reminded and perhaps better appreciate what we have been given that we might strive to improve our use of these divine gifts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>One of the greatest gifts Heavenly Father has given to all of us is the opportunity to communicate with Him.&nbsp; Knowing what you do about prayer, can you imagine for a minute what it would be like if you did not have the ability to converse with Him?&nbsp; Yet, I'm sure that many of us undervalue this great gift.&nbsp; Father in Heaven knows our wants and needs but wants to hear from us often.&nbsp; Let us remember the experience of the brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon and how "for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord." (Ether 2:14)&nbsp; How can we better receive and show our appreciation for this gift?&nbsp; We can improve the quality and sincerity of our prayers.&nbsp; We can pray more often.&nbsp; We can listen more intently for answers and guidance sent in answer to our prayers and follow the guidance we receive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Holy Scripture - Especially the Book of Mormon</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Have you ever pondered about how blessed we are in this dispensation to have more scripture available than probably any other people who have ever inhabited this earth?&nbsp; In addition to that great blessing, we also have easier access to scripture than any other people.&nbsp; Many of us even have access to all of the standard works in our pocket.&nbsp; What a great gift to be able to have such easy access to the word of God, given to his children through holy prophets throughout the ages.&nbsp; Are we utilizing the unparalleled access we have to the scriptures by studying them daily?</p>
<p>We are especially blessed in this dispensation to have the Book of Mormon - Another Testament of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This book of scripture was written for our day.&nbsp; It is literally another testimony of our savior Jesus Christ along with the Holy Bible.&nbsp; It teaches us about the mission of the Savior and how we can apply His atonement in our lives.&nbsp; Here is one of my favorite scriptures from the Book of Mormon regarding our Savior:</p>
<p>"Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. .....</p>
<p>"If ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot" (Moroni 10:32-33).</p>
<p>What a great promise regarding the role of our Savior Jesus Christ and how we can become holy, even without spot!&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most important roles of the Book of Mormon is assisting people in gaining a testimony of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I have seen this happen in the lives of many people and have experienced it myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon has been a very special blessing to our family.&nbsp; It has been the focus of our family scripture study since President Benson, in a conference talk in April of 1986, suggested that we read it daily as a family.&nbsp; In that talk President Benson shared a quote by Elder Marion G. Romney regarding blessings that would come from diligent study of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; I can state that the results promised by Elder Romney have been experienced in our family. That promise was that "if in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow.&nbsp; The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to that counsel. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity - the pure love of Christ - will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness." (Quoted by President Ezra T. Benson in General Conference, April 1986)&nbsp;<br /><br />What a great promise for keeping the Book of Mormon part of our regular scripture study.&nbsp; I am grateful to see our children continue this practice even after leaving home and as they have begun families of their own.<br /><br />How can we better utilize and show our appreciation for the great gift of Holy Scripture?&nbsp; We should become very familiar with these books through regular study.&nbsp; We should also apply the teachings of the scriptures in our lives.&nbsp; We must also share the Book of Mormon with all who can benefit from its teachings and power. &nbsp;I promise you will find great spiritual strength in doing these things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Gift of the Holy Ghost</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>One of the most special gifts that Heavenly Father has given to baptized members of the church is access to the Gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Think about how special this gift is.&nbsp; It is the ability to receive spiritual guidance in everything we do if we seek for it and are worthy of it.&nbsp; I believe it is a gift that many of us do not truly receive as we could and should.</p>
<p>When we were confirmed members of the church we were told to "Receive the Holy Ghost." As Elder David A. Bednar has taught, "These four words ...are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction-an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon. The Holy Ghost does not become operative in our lives merely because hands are placed upon our heads and those four important words are spoken. As we receive this ordinance, each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire, to seek, to work and to so live that we indeed "receive the Holy Ghost" and its attendant spiritual gifts" (2010 October General Conference, Sunday Afternoon Session).</p>
<p>Elder Bednar suggested that we need to do three important things to truly receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Sincerely desire to receive the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Appropriately invite the Holy Ghost into our lives; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Faithfully obey God's commandments and follow the spiritual promptings we receive (2010 October General Conference, Sunday Afternoon Session).</p>
<p>Let us follow this counsel and do better in receiving this tremendously valuable gift.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>The gift of BYU-I and the Spirit of Ricks</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Students, I hope you realize the special gift you have been given in having the opportunity to attend this inspired institution.&nbsp; This school has been made special through the sacrifice of many people through many years to provide an exceptional place of learning by study and also by faith.&nbsp; I love the spirit that we have the opportunity to feel on this campus every day.&nbsp; I hope you truly receive this gift from your Father in Heaven by using every opportunity you have here to learn and prepare yourselves for your important future.&nbsp; Please don't just do enough work in your classes to just get by.&nbsp; Do your very best to implement the inspired BYU-I learning model in your educational experience.&nbsp; If you don't know what the learning model involves then learn about it and apply in your personal study and in-class experiences.&nbsp; I know that it is an inspired plan to help you learn and to help you to assist others to learn.&nbsp; An important way you can show Heavenly Father that you appreciate this gift is to look for other students around you who could use a friend or some help in their learning process.&nbsp; I know that as you take advantage of opportunities to help others you will be blessed with additional guidance and help from the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Please do your best to learn all that Heavenly Father would have you learn during this short time you are able to learn and grow here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Atonement of Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Of course the greatest gift that Heavenly Father has given us is the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).&nbsp;<br /><br />A critical part of Heavenly Father's plan of salvation was that a mediator would be needed to intercede for all of those who would choose to accept him and follow him.&nbsp; It was at that time that Jesus Christ, our elder brother offered to be our Savior.&nbsp; We are taught in the scriptures that He was prepared from the beginning for this important role.&nbsp; I know that it was due to His love for His Father and for us, His brothers and sisters that He chose to do this for us.&nbsp; I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; He is the promised messiah testified of by ancient prophets.&nbsp; Because of His atonement and resurrection all mankind will be resurrected and receive perfected immortal bodies.&nbsp; As a result of His atonement all mankind can choose to repent and receive forgiveness for sins and transgressions and be found worthy to return to Heavenly Father's presence.&nbsp; Do we remember daily the greatness of these gifts that have been made available to us through the atonement of Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Do we endeavor daily to be worthy of these blessings and do we regularly apply the atonement in our individual lives by exercising faith in Him and by striving to improve in our obedience to the commandments?</p>
<p>Almost every Sunday we have the opportunity to participate in the sacred sacramental ordinance wherein we renew our covenants with Heavenly Father.&nbsp; In the sacramental prayers that are offered for us we hear these words: "...that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his spirit to be with them" (Moroni 4:3).&nbsp; What a simple but marvelous promise.&nbsp; As we remember the Savior and what He has done for us, and strive to follow His example and keep the commandments, we can have the influence of the Holy Ghost with us always.&nbsp;<br /><br />The power of the atonement can also help us deal with the challenges, trials and tribulations that come our way in life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught: "...the Savior's Atonement lifts from us not only the burden of our sins but also the burden of our disappointments and sorrows, our heartaches and our despair. From the beginning, trust in such help was to give us both a reason and a way to improve, an incentive to lay down our burdens and take up our salvation. There can and will be plenty of difficulties in life. Nevertheless, the soul that comes unto Christ, who knows His voice and strives to do as He did, finds a strength, as the hymn says, 'beyond [his] own.' The Savior reminds us that He has 'graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands.' Considering the incomprehensible cost of the Crucifixion and Atonement, I promise you He is not going to turn His back on us now. When He says to the poor in spirit, "Come unto me," He means He knows the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He knows the way because He is the way" (General Conference, April 2006, Broken Things to Mend). I know I have been given added strength to bear burdens and my faith in the Savior has been significantly increased as I have relied on Him during times of trial or tragedy in my life.&nbsp; I am so grateful for all of the great blessings of the atonement.<br /><br />This past Christmas season the church launched an initiative called "He is the Gift."&nbsp; We were all encouraged to discover, embrace and share the gift that is Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I hope that we can strive to do these things always.&nbsp; Again remember to truly discover, embrace and share the gift of Christ as a way to better receive this supernal gift of God.<br /><br />I am sure that you will agree that Heavenly Father is very good to us.&nbsp; How can we show our appreciation for all of the marvelous gifts He gives us?&nbsp; I believe you would answer that this can be done by truly receiving His gifts by regularly putting them to use in our lives. We should do our very best to use them to improve ourselves and to use the opportunities we are given to share our gifts and assist people around us.&nbsp; In addition, our prayers should be full of gratitude and rejoicing for all He gives to us.&nbsp; Truly it is our great responsibility to use these gifts as Heavenly Father has intended, for the blessing of all of His children.&nbsp; We should also always remember that "... unto whom much is given much is required...." (D&amp;C 82:3).</p>
<p>In summary, let us recognize and truly receive our divine gifts by:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, let us recognize and properly utilize the gifts he has given us.&nbsp;<br /><br />My challenge to each of us is to ponder upon and take inventory of the gifts Father in Heaven has given to us.&nbsp; Are there perhaps some that we have undervalued or have not fully received?&nbsp; Let us plan how we will truly receive and use them better to improve our own lives and the lives of those around us.<br /><br />God our Heavenly Father is real.&nbsp; He loves us His spirit children.&nbsp; He gives us all that we need to be successful and to find joy in this mortal existence and in the eternities.&nbsp; Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten of the Father, our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; It is through His atoning sacrifice that we can be made clean and worthy to return to our Heavenly Father's presence with our families.&nbsp; He is at the head of his church and inspires living apostles and prophets to teach and guide all those who will choose to give heed to them.&nbsp; It was through the faith and sacrifice of the Prophet Joseph Smith who did see in vision the Father and the Son, that we are able to partake of blessings of membership in the restored church and also enjoy the spirit and power of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; Of these things I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>My heart is so full of gratitude, that I hope you don't mind if I start with two quick thank you notes...&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you, President Clark, for the past 3,509 great days here at BYU-Idaho!&nbsp; Since 2005, your inspired vision has made them great!&nbsp; You will be greatly missed!</p>
<p>Thank you, random student, for shouting out "remember who you are" at 7:00 in the morning. Your shout out inspired me!<br /><br />True story by the way.&nbsp; It happened just a few weeks ago as I was walking from the Clarke building to the Manwaring Center for a meeting.&nbsp; It was about 10 minutes to seven and I was just passing the child lab when I heard someone holler "remember who you are!" from the crosswalk behind me. &nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the student was not shouting directly to me (at least I don't think so), but the message stopped me in my tracks and I laughed out loud.&nbsp; It had been a long time since I had heard that phrase with that level of imperative, but it was just what I needed!&nbsp; What inspiration and happiness filled my heart! &nbsp;Remember who you are. This is the message I want to share.&nbsp;<br /><br />But more than just remembering who you are -which to me is a more passive appreciation for something you've forgotten; I would like to explore rediscovering who you are - which more actively reconnects you with what you already deeply know.&nbsp; And this is why:&nbsp; The world wants you to forget that you - as choice spirit - were reserved for this time.&nbsp; The adversary wants you to doubt; doubt yourself, doubt your faith, and doubt you even belong. &nbsp;<br /><br />In 3 Nephi 18:18 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we doubt our core purpose, our nature as sons and daughters of God, we become in a sense malnourished, weak, and vulnerable to bitterness, anguish, and regret.&nbsp; Remember President Clark's warning at the beginning of the semester?&nbsp; He implored that we all need to hold tightly to the iron rod and the shield of faith with both hands as "[Satan] hurls...his fiery darts of discouragement, doubt, fear, ridicule, scorn, and distraction to try to stop you from doing the good things God wants done."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I testify that President Clark shared an inspired message that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; His counsel rang especially true in my heart because it happened to me.&nbsp; It is something like the experience of donning sterile gloves, as soon as you put them on your nose inevitably starts to itch.&nbsp; It takes all the fibers of your being to resist that urge to scratch.&nbsp; I think you know what I'm talking about. Reflecting back on my life, I can see how times in my life I have white knuckled that iron rod and how for a time, I let go all together.</p>
<p>I have been face-to-face with discouragement, doubt and fear and there were times when I felt aimless and couldn't see the places where I belonged. &nbsp;Perhaps you recognize that line from the song Glorious.&nbsp; When I first heard David Archuleta's cover of the song for the movie Meet the Mormons- I was captivated and could immediately relate to the lyrics.&nbsp; And as my kids will attest, for some time I played the song on continuous repeat mode.&nbsp; Not because of David Archuleta...well maybe just a little bit- but rather because of the message.&nbsp; The first few lines completely capture the essence of what I am trying to describe to you.&nbsp; The song begins:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are times when, you might feel aimless, can't see the places where you belong.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But you will find that there is a purpose, it's been there within you all along.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And when you're near it... you can almost hear it.It's like a symphony... just keep listening, and pretty soon you'll start to figure out your part.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So at 19 years of age, I left the University setting to travel and figure out my part.&nbsp; On one adventure, I set off for a month-long stay in the ashram of a Hindu Holy Man in Puttaparthi, Andhra Pradesh, India.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the hopes of discovering the "truth", I meditated, I fasted, I chanted, and I prayed.&nbsp; While I had hoped to somehow vet the teachings of my youth, I found in the end, that I came full circle. The Holy Man essentially told me to go back to the teachings of my youth.&nbsp; To be honest, I was a bit stunned!&nbsp;&nbsp; However on further contemplation, I realized I was being schooled!&nbsp; Just like the Lord schooled Oliver Cowdery as he began the work as a scribe in translating the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?&nbsp; What greater witness can you have than from God?<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What greater witness did I need?&nbsp; From that point on, my journey changed- I no longer needed to find my purpose; I just needed to rediscover it.&nbsp; While, it still required time on my part to reconcile and heal, I ultimately discovered the truth was within me all along; I didn't need to have further witness.&nbsp; The Lord directed me to the fact that I already had the truth; I just needed to reflect on it and allow my spirit to recognize it.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Rediscovery</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Hence, the power of rediscovery!&nbsp; For a moment, just think about the purpose and inspiration that comes with initial discovery.&nbsp; For instance, it could be the simple, sheer thrill of finding a $5 bill in your pocket.&nbsp; The wonder and awe that accompany the impressive spray of Old Faithful for the first time.&nbsp; How does it do that?&nbsp; Think about discovering the texture and warmth of beach sand beneath your feet on your first journey to the Ocean.&nbsp; Or imagine those first eureka moments! Like my daughter Kady who has been learning Spanish in school.&nbsp; Not long ago while making dinner, she had an epiphany!&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh" ... she said, "salsa Verde actually means salsa green"! &nbsp;The look on her face was fantastic!<br /><br />Great joy comes with the accomplishment of reading the Book of Mormon for the first time, cover to cover.&nbsp; Peace and gratitude accompany that mighty change of heart when we discover our personal testimonies of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Consider the safety in knowing deep within your soul that you are indeed a child of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; There is so much value in discovery, in the knowledge that comes from it.&nbsp; It can be beautiful, new, interesting and unexpected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But, now, let's consider rediscovery.&nbsp; To rediscover is a gift by its own right, allowing you to discover over and over again.&nbsp; Rediscovery allows you to recapture and re-live moments in your lives as though they were happening again for the first time.&nbsp; Rediscovery can also be a process, much like conversion; leading to greater knowledge, a keener understanding, and a change or rebirth in your very nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; President Kimball shared his conviction in discovering the scriptures not just once, but rather again and again.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then do you begin to really see the big picture and become able apply the messages to your own life.&nbsp; Continual rediscovery is what keeps life exciting and meaningful!&nbsp;<br /><br />Experiencing a change of heart again and again nourishes your spirit and exercises your faith, keeping you grounded and moving forward.&nbsp; Rediscovering who you are makes you "spiritually strong, sound, and steadfast."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; It gives you direction and deepens your commitment to serve the Lord. &nbsp;Rediscovering truth not only for yourself but also of yourself chases the darkness from you so that "the light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>During Elder Russell M. Nelson's recent BYU-Idaho address, he confirmed that most of us do not appreciate how precious we really are or how important we are.&nbsp; Most of us, he said, do not fully appreciate who we really are and our potential for greatness!<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Too many of us may be lost in our imperfections or in our strivings to be perfect, which, in some instances, is all it takes to lose our grip, our testimony, and the light.&nbsp; And as you know, it begins with small choices and decisions until you find yourself lost altogether.&nbsp; You begin to rationalize, become cynical, and doubt your faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />The process of rediscovering what you once knew or have begun to doubt requires you adopt a plan of action.&nbsp; It takes effort to reclaim the necessary conviction to keep the commandments, stand firm in the faith, and trust in the Lord.&nbsp; In my story, I had to awaken the courage and faith to stand firm in the standards determined by the Lord, not by the directions of the wind.<sup>9</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>I found it required the effort of one who "digged deep" laying a solid foundation upon which the winds and the storms could not ruin.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share with you three strategies that made the difference for me and continue to make the difference.&nbsp; I would also like to frame these restorative strategies around the analogy of digging deeply by using an acronym created by Bren&eacute; Brown, a qualitative researcher in social work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D = Be&nbsp;<strong>Deliberate</strong>&nbsp;and develop authenticity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I = Get&nbsp;<strong>Inspired</strong>&nbsp;and create calm and stillness</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">G = Get&nbsp;<strong>Going</strong>&nbsp;and practice gratitude and joy<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Be Deliberate</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Be deliberate in developing authenticity.&nbsp; I have mentioned Bren&eacute; Brown.&nbsp; Much of her work has been grounded in human behavior and relationships and the difficult emotions we all experience.&nbsp; She writes that love and belonging are essential to the human experience. An important concept that emerged from Brown's research was that worthiness was what separated those who feel deep love and belonging from those that do not.&nbsp; Said she, "If we want to fully experience love and belonging, we must believe that we are worthy of love and belonging."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I mention this because a lack of feeling worthy poses one of the greatest barriers to self-discovery.&nbsp; Satan has increased the intensity of his attacks on your identity and is actively engaged in evoking in you dismay, discouragement, and distraction.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Feelings of unworthiness easily become toxic and blinding.&nbsp; And when you base your worth on the opinions of others for example, you can seldom measure up.&nbsp;<br /><br />A dear friend put it into perspective for me this way:&nbsp;&nbsp; when you seek approval and validation from external sources; when you view yourself always through the eyes of others, it is just like looking into the mirrors at the Carnival fun house.&nbsp; The reflection you see back is distorted.&nbsp; It is not real.&nbsp; My dear friends, you must look at yourselves through the eyes of the Savior to see your true reflection; seeing beyond imperfection and self-doubts of worthiness.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Seeing through the Savior's eyes, you see how much better life is and can be by living on a higher plane.<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This is the first step to becoming authentic.&nbsp; By this I mean, letting go of what other people think and embracing who you already know you are - sons and daughters of God, created in His image.&nbsp; Developing authenticity is also about representing your true selves with honesty, humility, deep love and concern; which may feel uncomfortable and vulnerable to you at first.&nbsp; But in the end, you will find it becomes a great gift of freedom.&nbsp; Lifting the burden and energy it takes to carry your fears and hide behind a facade of someone you are not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Authenticity is not something you either have or don't have, it is a daily practice of consciously choosing how you want to live.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;It requires that you acknowledge your weaknesses and then seek to eliminate them.&nbsp; It requires humility and even repentance.&nbsp; It requires you embrace your imperfections and do your best.&nbsp; The grace of Jesus Christ is sufficient to compensate for the rest.&nbsp; In Ether 12:27 it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In an October 2014 conference address, President Uchtdorf shared this assurance:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God loves you this very day and always.&nbsp; He is not waiting to love you until you have overcome your weaknesses and bad habits.&nbsp; He loves you today with a full understanding of your struggles.&nbsp; He is aware that you reach up to Him in heartfelt and hopeful prayer.&nbsp; He knows of the times you have held onto the fading light and believed- even in the midst of growing darkness.&nbsp; He knows of your sufferings.&nbsp; He knows of your remorse for the times you have fallen short or failed.&nbsp; And still He loves you.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This knowledge of Christ's love for us is what keeps our grasp firm on both the iron rod and that shield of faith.&nbsp; This knowledge - when you believe it and when you&nbsp;<em>know&nbsp;</em>it in your heart- and apply it....makes you authentic, not only in the person you are today, but also for the person "of glory and light you have the potential and desire to become."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Get Inspired</strong></p>
<p>Get inspired to create calm and stillness. When I was in grade school or Jr. High I had a Snoopy poster in my bedroom that depicted Snoopy and Woodstock beating on drums.&nbsp; Snoopy was in the lead and the caption read, "I march to the beat of a different drummer".&nbsp; That phrase seemed a rather accurate depiction of how I felt as a young adolescent.&nbsp; I struggled, like many do at that age.&nbsp; I grew up in Helena, Montana and while there was a good sized group of strong LDS youth, I struggled to fit the mold.&nbsp; Or perhaps, I fought against fitting the mold.&nbsp; This led me to act out in ways that was quickly noticed by my dear parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />My father approached his concerns to me through a handwritten letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly don't recall much of the letter now except for one specific piece of counsel that has dwelled in my heart and mind ever since.&nbsp; My dad wrote,&nbsp;<em>"Sara, don't ever let the beat of the drums drown out the still small voice of the Holy Ghost."&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As you know,<em>&nbsp;</em>the voice of the Lord is not in the thunder, or in lighting, or in any spectacular display, it comes as it did to Elijah, in a "still small voice."<sup>20,</sup><sup><sup>21</sup></sup>&nbsp;My father could see what I could not see, likely because I lost my moxie.&nbsp; I lost my capacity to believe in myself and above all, I lost sight of my potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is boundless noise in the world today designed to distract and confound you.&nbsp; Anxiety, fear, anger, and regret cloud your minds; technology preoccupies your focus and may even cause you to doubt the simple clear messages of the Gospel.&nbsp; Until you create calm and stillness in your life; simplify and focus on what matters most, you may fail to recognize and understand the thoughts and ideas, warnings and comforts that come from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; in fact you may altogether lose this "unspeakable gift."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp; Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin once described:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If [you] would open [your] hearts to the refining influence of this unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, a glorious new spiritual dimension would come to light.&nbsp; [Your] eyes would gaze upon a vista scarcely imaginable.&nbsp; [You] could know for [yourself] things of the Spirit that are choice, precious, and capable of enlarging the soul, expanding the mind, and filing the heart with inexpressible joy.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>How do we create calm and stillness in our lives? Make the decision to do it!&nbsp; Simply don't allow the clatter of the world to overwhelm the promptings of the Spirit.&nbsp; Begin to let go of anxiety, fear, anger, and regret- ...and limit technology!&nbsp; Make time to meditate and to contemplate even as the Savior did in Matthew 14: 23, "And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray:&nbsp; And when the evening was come, he was there alone."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Get enough sleep.&nbsp; Eat well and move your bodies, detox from addictive substances and avoid addictive distractions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay focused on the essential truths of the Gospel and simplify your lives.&nbsp; Repent and seek the blessings of Christ's atonement.&nbsp; Only when we are "calm as a summer's morning; ...have a conscience void of offenses towards God, and towards all men"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;can we create calm and stillness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't quit, don't look for escapes and excuses.&nbsp; Don't search for someone else to blame.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Instead, accept His grace to buoy you up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Get Going</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Get going and practice gratitude and joy!&nbsp; Recall, I said that when we are deliberate and authentic, we can choose how we want to live?&nbsp; Choose a joyful life!&nbsp; To quote Bren&eacute; Brown,&nbsp; a joyful life is made up of "moments gracefully strung together by trust, gratitude, inspiration, and faith."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;No better way to achieve this is than through inspired service; becoming sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost in knowing who needs our help and what we can do for them.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley said this, "If we want joy in our hearts, if we want the Spirit of the Lord in our lives, let us forget ourselves and reach out."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Hence, I submit to you again, that the greatest way to rediscover yourself is to lose yourself in service. The Joseph Smith Translation of&nbsp; Mark 8: 37-38 reads:<br /><br />Whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; or whosoever will save his life, shall be willing to lay it down for my sake; and if he is not willing to lay it down for my sake, he shall lose it.&nbsp; But whosoever shall be willing to lose his life for my sake, and the gospel, the same shall save it.<sup>30</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Service with all of your heart and mind is free of selfish ambition and motivated by the pure love of Christ.<sup>31</sup>&nbsp; In recent months, there have been many instances when I have been overcome by the pressures of being a wife, a mother, a Nurse, a Department Chair, a doctoral student, and so on.&nbsp; My sweet husband has patiently listened to my complaints many times about the pressure I sometimes feel. It is in those moments that I complain about my life however, that I realize just how selfish I am.&nbsp; President Hinckley once referenced a great quote about this saying, "I complained because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet."<sup>32</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>How quickly I still slip into old habits of allowing discouragement and fear to overshadow my faith and testimony of our Lord and Savior.&nbsp;&nbsp; During these times, it is most important to get going in practice of reaching out to others.&nbsp; When we do, I testify, we find the tender mercies of gratitude and joy fill our wells.&nbsp; As in John 15:11: "These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full."<sup>33</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I bear testimony of Christ's love for you and in His desire for you to experience love and belonging, calm and stillness, and gratitude and joy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeatedly, I stand all amazed,<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;in Christ's love and that He rescued a soul like me; full of selfishness and transgression, impatience and imperfection.&nbsp; Through His grace I got my moxie back!&nbsp; I testify that His grace is sufficient, if we but do our part to DIG deep.</p>
<p>The simple strategies I've discussed today have been key factors in my own emotional and spiritual growth, as well as in my personal successes as a wife and mother, and professional successes as a nurse.&nbsp; Consider them tools for your own lives now or in the future.&nbsp; Be deliberate and become authentic.&nbsp; Ensure your behaviors reflect your beliefs.&nbsp; Get inspired and create calm and stillness in your lives.&nbsp; Safeguard the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Get going and practice gratitude and joy by serving others.&nbsp; Rediscover the pure love of Christ that exists within you.&nbsp; What greater witness is there, when you rediscover who you are?&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters let me conclude with this point spoken in 1987 by Neal A Maxwell, "events and circumstances in [these] last days make it imperative for us as members of the Church to become more grounded, rooted, established, and settled."<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;May we all dig deep and "settle on this determination"<sup>36</sup>, I pray in the sacred name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Wilford W. Andersen was sustained a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2009, at age 59. At the time of his call, he had been serving as a member of the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy in the North America Southwest Area.</p>
<p>Elder Andersen received both a bachelor's degree in business management in 1973 and a juris doctor degree in 1976 from Brigham Young University.&nbsp; He was a managing partner of Andersen Investments at the time of his call as a General Authority.</p>
<p>Elder Andersen has served in numerous Church callings, including full-time missionary in the Argentina South Mission, bishop, high councilor, stake president, president of the M&eacute;xico Guadalajara Mission (2002-2005), Area Seventy and General Authority.</p>
<p>Wilford Andersen was born in Mesa, Arizona, on August 22, 1949.&nbsp; He married Kathleen Bennion in April 1975, and they are the parents of nine children.&nbsp; Elder Andersen currently serves in the Temple Department at Church Headquarters.&nbsp; Previously they resided in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where Elder Andersen served as Area President of the Caribbean Area.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I am especially pleased to address such a great student body and faculty, and your distinguished President this morning.&nbsp; I have prayed that what I share with you will be a blessing and support for you as you face the challenges and opportunities that are yours here at Brigham Young University-Idaho.&nbsp; I have entitled my talk "The Faith to Reap".</p>
<p>Lehi and his family had been in the wilderness for only a matter of days when the Lord told him to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get the brass plates from King Laban. I know we don't often compliment Lehi's two rebellious sons, Laman and Lemuel, but I want to recognize that they were actually willing to go. They had enough faith to give it a try.&nbsp; First Laman then Lemuel asked King Laban to hand over the plates.&nbsp; But Laban was not at all impressed and they lost their family fortune and almost lost their lives in the attempt. At this point their faith failed them and they were ready to quit.<br /><br />Nephi, on the other hand, rose above the danger and the discouragement.&nbsp; He would never quit.&nbsp; "As the Lord liveth" he stated, "and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.&nbsp; Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord." (1 Nephi 3: 15-16.) Nephi then exercised his great faith, was able to obtain the plates of Laban, and returned to his father in the wilderness.<br /><br />I have noticed in my life, Brothers and Sisters, that there seems to be two distinct levels of faith.&nbsp; The first level is the faith to try, the faith to enroll, the faith to thrust in our sickles.&nbsp; But there is another level of faith.&nbsp; It is more than the faith to try, it is the faith to do.&nbsp; It is more than the faith to enroll, it is the faith to graduate.&nbsp; It is more than the faith to thrust in your sickle, it is the faith to reap.<br /><br />Nephi displayed a different level of faith.&nbsp; While Laman and Lemuel had the faith to try (for which we commend them), Nephi had the faith to do.&nbsp; While Laman and Lemuel had enough faith to thrust in their sickles, Nephi had enough faith to reap.&nbsp; That subtle distinction between the faith to thrust in your sickles and the faith to reap will make all the difference in your lives.&nbsp; For in order to live again with our Heavenly Father and in order to live productive and joyful lives here on earth, you and I will need to develop the faith to reap.<br /><br />I'll give you another example from 1 Nephi.&nbsp; When Lehi's sons did not return from Jerusalem as expected, Lehi's wife Sariah began to complain.&nbsp; You're a visionary man, she told her husband.&nbsp; You have brought us out here from our home in Jerusalem, my sons are dead, and we will soon perish in the wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sariah had enough faith to follow her husband into the wilderness, but when things got really tough, she was ready to pack up and go home.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lehi's remarkable response illustrates a different level of faith.&nbsp; I know I am a visionary man, he said.&nbsp;But I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know&nbsp;that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again&nbsp;unto us in the wilderness. (1 Nephi 5: 5)</p>
<p>Note that Lehi did not say that he hoped to obtain a land of promise, or even that he expected to obtain a land of promise.&nbsp; He said, I have obtained it.&nbsp; It was as if he were already there.&nbsp; His faith was so strong that it in effect converted a future promise into a present reality.&nbsp; And so he was able to move forward and not give up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, we need that kind of faith.&nbsp; We, like Lehi, have received marvelous promises from the Lord - promises of happiness and joy in this life, and exaltation in the next.&nbsp; But the challenges and problems of our daily lives tend to obstruct our view of the Promised Land and destroy our hope.&nbsp; Our land of promise seems so far away, so improbable, that we begin to doubt.&nbsp; "It isn't possible for me to reach that goal or to receive that blessing," we think.&nbsp; "Surely the Lord was thinking about someone else when he made those promises."&nbsp; No, brothers and sisters, he was thinking of you and of me.&nbsp; We only need sufficient faith to receive them - a faith so strong that it can convert our future promises into present realities.&nbsp; We need the faith to reap.<br /><br />So let's talk about the faith to reap.&nbsp; What exactly is it and how can we develop it in our own lives?&nbsp; I want to teach you three essential principles that will help you develop the faith to reap.<br /><br />First:&nbsp; Unlike the faith to thrust in your sickles, the faith to reap is not faith in yourselves.&nbsp; It is not the same as self-confidence or positive mental attitude. It is not even faith in your family or faith in your friends, all of which is good.&nbsp; But the faith to reap is faith in Jesus Christ and in his atonement.&nbsp; It is faith in his power, not yours.<br /><br />I will never forget the experience I had when I was called to serve as the Stake President of the Mesa Arizona Maricopa Stake.&nbsp; Elder Lawrence, the visiting Authority, invited my wife and me into the stake president's office and extended the calling, and I dutifully accepted.&nbsp; He then invited us to enter the High Council Room and to prayerfully consider people to recommend as my counselors.&nbsp; As I entered the High Council Room, I looked up at the north wall and there I saw the pictures of all the stake presidents who had previously served in the Maricopa Stake since it was organized, and my heart sunk.<br /><br />The first six pictures were of men I had never known.&nbsp; They lived before my time.&nbsp; But I knew their names.&nbsp; They were great leaders both in the Church and in the community.&nbsp; The next five pictures were of men that I did know - Lorenzo Wright, to whom I had delivered newspapers as a boy, his son Harold Wright who later served as a mission president and a temple president, President J. Lamar Shelley, President W. Dea Montague, and President David K. Udall - great men whom I had sustained and revered all my like.&nbsp; I looked at my wife and said, "Kathleen, I don't think I can do this.&nbsp; I'm not in their league.&nbsp; My picture doesn't deserve to hang next to theirs."&nbsp; She said, "Well, don't tell me about it.&nbsp; You better talk to Elder Lawrence." Which I did.<br /><br />I rehearsed my experience to Elder Lawrence thinking that he would try to reassure me that I could do it, that I had served as a Bishop and a counselor in the Stake Presidency, that I would have the support of the stake members and that I would be a fine stake president.&nbsp; But, to my surprise, when I told him that I didn't think I could do it, he responded, "Well, I suppose you're right."&nbsp; And I wondered who might be next on his list.&nbsp; But then he said, "You can't do it, Brother Andersen, but the Lord can.&nbsp; He has the power to do His work, and if you will be worthy and work hard, He will do it.&nbsp; You will see."&nbsp; And He did.<br /><br />The faith to thrust in your sickle is the faith to try.&nbsp; It is faith in oneself and it evaporates as soon as the going gets tough.&nbsp; And then we start to doubt.&nbsp; But the faith to reap is faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It never yields.<br /><br />One additional example:</p>
<p>After the Savior's crucifixion and resurrection, he appeared to the eleven apostles to give them their charge to go into all the world to preach the gospel, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The account is found in Matthew 28:16-20.&nbsp; "Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.&nbsp; And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted."<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, what do you think they doubted?&nbsp; I don't think they doubted that Jesus was resurrected.&nbsp; He was standing before them as a resurrected being.&nbsp; I don't think they doubted that he was the son of God.&nbsp; Peter had already declared his witness of the Savior's divinity.&nbsp; What they doubted was themselves.&nbsp; This was no small thing that Jesus was asking them to do.&nbsp; They were not world travelers.&nbsp;&nbsp; They weren't politically powerful.&nbsp; They weren't scholars. And they certainly weren't wealthy.&nbsp; They lacked hope that they could do it.&nbsp; Jesus' response was instructive.&nbsp; "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given to me in heaven and in earth."<br /><br />Note that he did not say you can do it, "you have been with me now for three years.&nbsp; You are capable men and you have the power to do it".&nbsp; He said, "I have the power to do it".&nbsp; "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:&nbsp; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen." &nbsp;(Matthew 28:19-20)<br /><br />I have all power, he said, and I will help you.&nbsp; That is also the promise he has made to you and me.&nbsp; He who has all power in heaven and on earth will be with us always.&nbsp; And so our hope never fails because we have faith in him.&nbsp; That is the faith to reap.<br /><br />In Mormon's great sermon on faith, hope, and charity, we read the following:<br /><br />"And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?" (Moroni 7: 40-41)</p>
<p><strong>How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>So based on that verse, which comes first, faith or hope?&nbsp; Sounds like hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />"And what is it that ye shall hope for?&nbsp; Behold, I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise."<br /><br />Now listen to verse 42.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; (2) for without faith, there cannot be any hope." (Moroni 7:42).</p>
<p><strong>For without faith, there cannot be any hope</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Now which comes first?&nbsp; Sounds like faith.&nbsp; So which is it?&nbsp; How many say that hope comes before faith?&nbsp; How many say that faith comes before hope?&nbsp; How many have no idea?</p>
<p>I have concluded that they both come together. You will never have one without the other. Hope is excitement, energy, determination, and commitment. And you will never have hope unless you have faith. So, brothers and sisters, if you ever find yourselves without enough hope to reach your dreams, don't focus on increasing your hope. Focus on increasing your faith in Christ, and hope will follow automatically.&nbsp; When we are discouraged, we tend to focus on hope.&nbsp; Like the high school football coach at halftime, the world would give you a pep talk.&nbsp; "You can do it." we're told.&nbsp; "Positive mental attitude." we're told.&nbsp; "Get out there and go, go, go." But that kind of hope evaporates as soon as we meet with significant challenges.&nbsp; The hope that comes from faith in Christ is different.&nbsp; One who has faith in Christ recognizes that even if she or he can't do it, the Savior can.&nbsp; And from this faith springs the hope that never gives up until the dream comes true.&nbsp; This is the faith to reap.<br /><br />Now the second principle. In order to exercise the faith to reap, we must be certain that our desires and objectives are consistent with the will of God.&nbsp; We can never exercise faith to reap if God does not agree with the harvest.&nbsp; To have his help, we must align our will with his.<br /><br />In the 10th chapter of Helaman we read about the prophet Nephi.&nbsp; Because he was a righteous and faithful man, the Lord told him,<br /><br />"I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word".&nbsp; That's quite a promise.&nbsp; But then he adds, "for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will."&nbsp;<br /><br />And this from Moroni 7, "And Christ hath said; If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me." (Moroni 7: 33.) &nbsp;Conforming our desires to God's will is a prerequisite to the faith to reap.<br /><br />When my sons were younger, they played on the Jr. High and High School basketball teams.&nbsp; I don't see this anymore, but back then they used to have a team prayer prior to beginning each game.&nbsp; As I watched from the stands, I used to wonder what they were praying for.&nbsp; If they were praying to win the game, their prayers lacked the faith to reap.&nbsp; This was clearly evidenced by the number of games they lost.&nbsp; The Lord apparently did not share their desire that they necessarily win every game.<br /><br />In other words, God will only help us to achieve the goals that are good for us.&nbsp; That is because he loves us, and he knows better than we do what will be for our good.&nbsp; And aren't we thankful for that.&nbsp; Years ago, there was a popular country song entitled "Thank God for Unanswered Prayers."&nbsp; We should pray each day that Heavenly Father will bless us with righteous desires to conform our will to his.&nbsp; We must learn to pray as the Lord did in the Garden of Gethsemane that not ours, but his will be done.&nbsp; Only then can we exercise the faith to reap.<br /><br />And now we come to the third prerequisite of faith to reap.&nbsp; It is one word - work.&nbsp; The apostle James makes it very clear that faith without works is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp;"Show me thy faith without thy works," he said, "and I will show thee my faith by my works."&nbsp; The faith to thrust in our sickles requires belief, but the faith to reap requires more than belief.&nbsp; Even the devils believe, writes James, and tremble.&nbsp; The difference between the devils and the faith filled students at this university is not belief, but work.<br /><br />Some years ago, I heard a story about a father who noticed his young daughter kneeling beside her bed praying.&nbsp; He stopped to listen to her prayer and grew concerned when he heard her praying that Heavenly Father would protect the little birds from entering the bird trap that her brother had built and placed in the back yard.&nbsp; Later that day the father grew very concerned that a bird might be trapped thus damaging his little daughter's faith.&nbsp; He knew it was a good trap.&nbsp; He had helped his son build it.&nbsp; So he decided to visit with the little girl about her prayer.&nbsp; "I heard you praying this morning that Heavenly Father would protect the little birds," he said.&nbsp; "But sometimes sad things happen even when we pray that they won't." To which she responded, "I just know he won't catch any birds, daddy. I just know he won't."<br /><br />"I admire your faith, sweetheart", the father said.&nbsp; "But if he did catch some birds, I hope that wouldn't hurt your faith." "He won't, daddy," she said, "I know he won't." The father was moved.&nbsp; "How can you have such great faith?" he asked.&nbsp; "Because", she replied, "After I said my prayers, I went out back and kicked his bird trap all to pieces."<br /><br />It is good to pray for Heavenly Father's blessings.&nbsp; But after we say amen, we have to get up off our knees and go to work.&nbsp; We cannot expect the Lord to guide our footsteps if we're not willing to move our feet.&nbsp; And we should not ask the Lord to do for us what we can and should do for ourselves.<br /><br />Years ago I attended a sacrament meeting where a young man was speaking prior to leaving on his mission.&nbsp; He came to the pulpit and said, "Brothers and Sisters, I have written out a talk, but I decided to leave it at my seat so that I could speak by the promptings of the spirit."&nbsp; Then followed a long uncomfortable pause after which he looked at the congregation and said," I think the spirit is prompting me to go back and get my talk."<br /><br />Yes, it is by grace that we are saved, but only after all we can do.&nbsp; We must work at reaching our righteous goals.&nbsp; As students, we must work hard in our class assignments and preparation.&nbsp; As children of God, we must work hard at keeping the commandments.&nbsp; Listen carefully to this.&nbsp; The real power in our covenants and the real power in the faith to reap is realized not when we conclude with certainty that God keeps his promises, but when we finally conclude, with certainty, that we keep ours.&nbsp; That great truth is what converts future promises into present realities.&nbsp; We must work.<br /><br />Don't be too discouraged with your failures or your mistakes.&nbsp; But be constant in your efforts and be determined.&nbsp; The faith to reap does not require perfection, but it does require persistence.&nbsp; Consider the experience of Alma the Younger.&nbsp; We all know his story.&nbsp; He was going about the Church with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the testimonies of the believers when the angel appeared to him and told him that if he continued doing what he was doing, he would be destroyed.&nbsp; He fell unconscious and was carried to his father.&nbsp; For three days he suffered the pains of a damned soul.&nbsp; His suffering was so intense that he wanted to disappear and become extinct.&nbsp; Then he remembered that his father had taught him about Jesus Christ who would come into the world to pay the price for our sins and to offer salvation to imperfect people like himself.&nbsp; In his heart he cried out, "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death." (Alma 36:18)<br /><br />Then something wonderful happened.&nbsp; The terrible anguish disappeared.&nbsp; He was filled with indescribable joy and could no longer remember his pain.&nbsp; At this moment, was Alma perfect?&nbsp; No, he only turned around.&nbsp; He had been looking at a terrible dark future filled with eternal suffering.&nbsp; And then he turned around and for the first time saw the light of Christ.&nbsp; When he saw the light, he knew that there was hope for him.<br /><br />But then he had to start his journey towards the light just like the rest of us.&nbsp; I'm sure he took several steps forward and perhaps a step or two backwards - five or six forwards and one backwards.&nbsp; But he never again took his eyes off the light of Christ.&nbsp; For the rest of his life, he persisted in his journey toward the light and it led him to his promised land.<br /><br />I invite each of you, brothers and sisters, to develop the faith to reap.&nbsp;&nbsp; Place your faith firmly in our Savior, Jesus Christ, and in his atonement.&nbsp; Make sure that your desires align with and conform to his will. Then go to work with all your heart, might, mind, and strength, with unfailing determination and persistence, and I promise you that there is no challenge, no problem, no barrier that will not yield to that kind of faith and you will arrive at your promised land.&nbsp; May we develop the faith to reap is my prayer.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to be here today to share my personal witness of Our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ, which has been given to me by the Holy Ghost. It is my prayer for you to feel the influence of the Holy Ghost. Please keep a prayer in your heart as I speak to you today. &nbsp;<br /><br />It was a beautiful sunny morning and I was at my friend's house racing matchbox cars on his plastic racetracks. My friend's older sister burst into the room and said that she had just heard over the radio the Teton Dam broke and we needed to leave. Of course we did not believe her so we ran into the other room to listen to the radio. At the age of 7, I did not even know what it meant for a dam to break. I knew it must be bad.&nbsp; I started to get scared. I panicked.&nbsp; I did not know what to do.<br /><br />I called my Mom!&nbsp; She was working at my grandparents store here in town. She had not heard the news so she turned on the radio to confirm what I had told her. She stood in disbelief as she heard for herself that the Teton Dam had broken and the water was headed our way. She immediately told me to go to my grandparents' home on 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;West, which was just around the corner from where I was playing.&nbsp; She was on her way to pick me up.<br /><br />We ran to my grandparents' house. When my mom arrived she started gathering anything that seemed important to save and take with us.<br /><br />My friend's parents came over to pick him up and, like children do, I wanted to go with them. I pestered my mom to let me go until she finally gave in.<br /><br />I went with my friend and instead of seeking the safety provided on the hill here at BYU-Idaho, which was Ricks College at the time, we drove to their grocery store on Main Street. They had a few sandbags placed around the outside of the building thinking that the water would only be a few feet deep.<br /><br />Once in the store, we sought protection by finding higher ground as we climbed the steps to the offices located upstairs in the loft. We could see out the big bay windows in the front of the store on to Main Street.&nbsp; We thought we were prepared and ready!<br /><br />As we waited for the water to hit, it was just like a scene out of a movie. I felt as if everything was in slow motion.&nbsp; It was quiet. No traffic--a ghost town. I remember looking out the windows of the store and seeing a huge whirlwind of dirt and garbage blow past the store. I wondered if the person on the radio got it wrong.&nbsp; Maybe it was a tornado, not a flood.&nbsp; At the age of 7, I really did not understand the difference. Then all of the sudden the slow motion gave way to a thunderous explosion as a raging wall of water crashed into the building with such force that I will never forget it.<br /><br />The floodwater did not disperse along the way through town as one would think. It appeared to come down Main Street as a wall from the east covering the big bay windows, one at a time, until we were left in darkness.<br /><br />We did not know how much water there was and had no way of knowing how deep it would be. The water immediately began to rush in. Someone had a light and we could see the floodwater lifting all the items in the store.&nbsp; We ran to the steps that led up to the loft and started to count one-by-one as the water submerged each step. It appeared that the whole building would be engulfed by floodwater.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then things became even worse. We started to hear loud explosions outside of the building in the distance. The sounds grew closer.&nbsp; It sounded like they were coming from the back of the building. The flood water had picked up huge logs from the local lumber yard and smashed them through the back end of the building like a battering ram. This caused the walls to break and collapse.<br /><br />As the water kept rising with no end in sight, the darkest coldest feeling came over me, one that I will never forget. I thought my life was going to end. There was no escape from the floodwater.&nbsp; How would we make it out alive? We were trapped. The only thing I could think of was that I was in trouble. I needed help.&nbsp; We did not have cell phones, and the floodwater had taken out the phone lines and electricity<br /><br />I really, really wanted to call my Mom now.<br /><br />I was beyond scared and panicked.&nbsp;<br />I was in darkness.<br />I was not with my family.<br />I was not safe.<br />I felt alone.<br /><br />Being surrounded and filled with this darkness, with no options, I was not sure what to do. I was ready to give up. Then the thought came into my mind: PRAY!<br /><br />I walked over to the corner of the offices by myself and in the dark knelt down and offered up the words of my heart.<br /><br />"Heavenly Father, please let me live. I want to live. I want to be with my family. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."<br /><br />As soon as the words left my mouth, I immediately felt the peace and comfort of the Holy Ghost. I had the feeling that everything would be OK. I knew that my loving Heavenly Father heard and answered my simple and heart-felt prayer. My loneliness and thoughts of despair were instantly replaced with love. I no longer feared my life would be taken.<br /><br />I remember walking back to the steps and seeing the water finally stop rising. There were only 5 steps left until the top. I knew my prayer had been answered. I felt the "peace" the Savior promised His disciples as described in John 14:27: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I testify this promise is true. I walked over and fell asleep until later that day we were rescued by the National Guard.<br /><br />I was taken to the Manwaring Center here on campus, and I sat on a stool at the information desk. With all the confusion no one really knew what to do with me. I sat there for a while until one of my relatives, Brenda Sutton, walked by, recognized me, and helped me find my family.&nbsp; I was so grateful for her and so thankful to be back with them.<br /><br />We later learned the force of the water washed a tractor tire and a dead cow into the store.&nbsp; The tire and cow together became wedged between the wall and an interior support post beneath the room we were in. &nbsp;They were the only thing that prevented the floor we were standing on from collapsing.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I believe this was an answer to my prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the flood hit, no one knew how terrible it was going to be. At the time of the collapse, the water in the reservoir was 270 feet deep at the dam and the reservoir stretched close to seventeen miles; it emptied in less than 6 hours.<sup>3, 4</sup>&nbsp;Almost 40 years ago, on the Saturday morning of June 5, 1976, I personally learned the power of prayer.<br /><br />In a talk given here, at BYU-Idaho, in 2002, Elder Boyd K. Packer,&nbsp;stated the following about the flood: "11 people died as result of the flood. There were around 900 homes that were destroyed or severely damaged. Many homes were washed for miles and miles down the Snake River Valley. A general rule of thumb for disasters of this magnitude would have predicted that due to the time of day, population, and size of the catastrophe there should have been 5,000 casualties."<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>How were so many people saved? Many people described being unusually on edge that day, so when the warning came, they responded immediately. They took action. Will you respond immediately when a warning comes to you? &nbsp;Will you be able to recognize the Spirit and act, so that the Lord can bless you and guide you?<br /><br />President Monson has said, "The Lord is in all of our lives. He loves us. He wants to bless us. He wants us to seek His help. As He guides us and directs us and as He hears and answers our prayers, we will find the happiness here and now that He desires for us." We need to be aware of His blessings in our lives.<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>President Henry B. Eyring shares the following concerning prayer and continuous personal revelation:<br /><br />"We all know that human judgment and logical thinking will not be enough to get answers to the questions that matter most in life. We need revelation from God. And we will need not just one revelation in a time of stress, but we need a constantly renewed stream. We need not just one flash of light and comfort, but we need the continuing blessing of communication with God."</p>
<p>President Eyring uses his personal experience in the Teton Dam Flood as an example he believes "could bless all of us in the days ahead". At the time, he was President of Ricks College. He tells of a local Stake President, a farmer, who was led by revelation to provide essential relief efforts before the Federal Disaster Agency even arrived. He also describes listening as Bishops and Elder's quorum presidents reported what they had done and what they had been inspired to do through personal revelation as they carried out the instructions to find families and to help them.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We all know how to communicate.&nbsp; We are constantly looking at our email, texting, and checking or posting to social media. It seems like we are endlessly engaged in some form of communication. I should know; I have 6 daughters who are continuously talking or using their electronic devices to communicate. Girls can talk a lot! The question I pose to you today is this: Shouldn't we be just as concerned with our messages from Heaven as we are with our messages on earth?<br /><br />Since prayer is our lifeline to God it is imperative we master this tool. Strive to master prayer as well as you have mastered your phone.</p>
<p>Remember the power of prayer. Prayer is so powerful it unlocked the heavens and allowed a 14-year-old boy to become an instrument in God's hands to restore the fullness of the gospel in these last days. Remember Joseph wanted to know which of the many churches he should join. He had never prayed vocally before. Then he discovered the scripture in James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God...! So that is exactly what Joseph did.&nbsp; He prayed and received a visitation from our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>You and I must chart a course using prayer as our rudder and develop the faith necessary to receive revelation continuously. The Savior's teachings and the influence of the Holy Ghost need to be woven into the very fabric of our soul. Acquiring the knowledge of how prayer can lead us and gaining sufficient faith to be led through prayer is a learning process, one that requires you and me to practice. No one else can do this for us, nor can our personal ability to communicate with the Lord be bought.<br /><br />Remember the Savior's parable of the ten virgins. The five foolish virgins were not spiritually prepared.&nbsp; They had run out of oil. When they returned from obtaining more oil, the door was shut, the Lord told them, "I know you not."&nbsp; Let us be like the five faithful virgins described in Doctrine and Covenants 45:57. It states that they are those "that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived."<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctrine and Covenants 33:17 further states, "Be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;"For no one knoweth the day or hour when the Lord will return."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>James declared, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The Bible Dictionary explains that prayer is a form of work.&nbsp; It is not meant to change the will of God, but to secure blessings that He is already willing to grant.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Monson has said, "The Lord's purposes are often accomplished as we pay heed to the guidance of the Spirit. I believe that the more we act upon the inspiration and impressions which come to us, the more the Lord will entrust to us His errands."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;As we keep a prayer in our hearts, we will be ready to receive the guiding influence of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>A personal story illustrates this council.&nbsp; Shortly after the flood, my family moved from Rexburg to Salmon, Idaho, which is 160 miles northwest of here. We farmed and raised beef cows, alfalfa and grain. One summer, when I was about 15, we had been experiencing a severe drought. I remember one particular day when my dad pulled up along the side of the tractor and waved for me to stop. With a concerned look on his face and a serious tone in his voice he said, "We need to pray and ask Heavenly Father for rain". Without any more discussion or hesitation my dad knelt down in the dirt next to the tractor, and I did the same.</p>
<p>My dad prayed.<br /><br />My dad taught me, and more importantly showed me, the power of prayer.&nbsp; I don't remember exactly when the rain came, but I remember we received the moisture the crops needed, and I knew that my dad's prayer was answered.</p>
<p>The prophet Amulek teaches us what we can and should pray for in Alma 34:18-27.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save. Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him. Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks. Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening. Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies. Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness. Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness. Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Oftentimes the difficulties of life, friends, family, roommates, work, health, finances, or even questions concerning our faith can be overwhelming. Amulek teaches us that we can go to our Heavenly Father and the Savior to petition them with our concerns. Again, I quote our prophet, President Monson: "Rather than dwelling on the negative, if we will take a step back and consider the blessings in our lives, including seemingly small, sometimes overlooked blessings, we can find greater happiness. Heavenly Father is aware of our needs and will help us as we call upon Him for assistance. I believe that no concern of ours is too small or insignificant. The Lord is in the details of our lives."<sup>&nbsp;16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>After finishing my first year here at then Ricks College, like many of you are in the process of doing, I went home to help my family bail hay before I left on my mission in July. Once I finished putting up the hay, I had plans to come here to Rexburg to purchase some final items I needed for my mission and enjoy a water skiing trip with my friend, Troy. Troy was a recent convert to the church.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks before meeting up with Troy, he called me. He did not call my house. He called me in the middle of the day, at my cousin's house. Remember this is before cell phones. Normally, I would be on a tractor, but that day it was broken down, and we were waiting for parts. When the phone rang and I heard it was for me, I was surprised. I thought, "Who would be calling here for me?" When I heard his voice, I knew it was Troy.</p>
<p>I asked him, "What's up?"</p>
<p>Troy said he felt like he needed to call me and let me know how much he appreciated our friendship. He wanted to thank me.</p>
<p>I said, "For what?"&nbsp;<br /><br />He said, "For helping me change my life.&nbsp; Helping me be a better person."<br /><br />I was stunned.&nbsp; This was not a typical conversation between us. I also let Troy know how much I appreciated his friendship. We talked briefly about our excitement for the water skiing trip and then the call ended.<br /><br />The ground we farmed was located on the west side of Salmon and had a beautiful view of the valley. You could see several mountain ranges and the surrounding weather. On the day I planned on leaving to meet Troy, I could see dark storm clouds approaching. I began to worry that I would not get the hay put up before the coming downpour. That meant I would not be going to Rexburg.&nbsp; For those of you who do not understand why I was worrying, if you bail wet hay, it will rot. If it is really wet and you stack it, it will possibly start on fire and burn down the stack.<br /><br />For reasons I did not yet understand, I felt a great urgency to get my work done and make my way to Rexburg to visit my friend Troy. In fact, after seeing the dark clouds and anticipating heavy rain coming, I thought that I needed to get off the tractor and pray. I felt I needed to pray for the rains to go around the farm.&nbsp; At first I ignored those feelings thinking it was just my anxiousness to be done and go have some fun. But as I continued to work the feeling and thought came over me again--this time it was stronger, "You need to stop the tractor and pray." The thoughts and feelings were not my own. I stopped the tractor, knelt down in the field, and asked Heavenly Father for the rains to go around the farm. After the prayer it did not rain on the fields. I felt only a light mist of moisture as the dark clouds were passing. I kept working. This exact same impression to stop the tractor and pray happened two more times that day. The other times I did not hesitate; I followed the impression asking for the same blessing each time. I was able to finish my work, and leave for Rexburg on time. The city of Salmon, right below the farm, received a heavy downpour while I bailed and stacked the dry hay.&nbsp;<br /><br />I arrived fairly late in the day at my grandparents' house in Rexburg. When I got there I found out my friend, Troy, had been in a severe motorcycle accident. Our plans to water ski never happened.&nbsp; I am grateful for the continuing revelation I received that day on the farm so I could act on the prompting to pray and be guided to where the Lord would want me to be. I was in Rexburg within hours of my dear friend's accident.&nbsp; By divine intervention I was able to be close to him during this difficult time.&nbsp; Along with others, I fasted and prayed he would recover. I really wanted God to answer my prayer, but my will was not God's will. Troy never recovered, and he died in the hospital.<br /><br />I reflected on the last time Troy and I spoke, which was when he called me at my cousin's house. &nbsp;His call was what Nephi describes as a "tender mercy" of the Lord. The Lord knew how much it would mean to me. He truly is in the details of our lives.<br /><br />Prayer can also help us at times when we feel we most need the tender mercies of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Russell M. Nelson shares the following: "If we pray with an eternal perspective, we need not wonder if our most tearful and heartfelt pleadings are heard. This promise from the Lord is recorded in Section 98 of the&nbsp;Doctrine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Covenants: "Your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord ... and are recorded with this seal and testament&mdash;the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted. "Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith the Lord."&nbsp;<sup>17</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I know it may seem at times that our prayers are not answered because we do not receive the answer we want. We must not give up. We must not look back. We must push forward learning and applying the words of Christ and faithfully living the commandments even though we do not understand or know why at the time. If we will do this we will receive eternal life and will be saved in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;<sup>18</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In conclusion, I will share one more valuable lesson I have learned concerning the power of prayer and how our prayers can assist us in hastening the work and building the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.<br /><br />Elder Jacob de Jager, then a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, visited my zone conference while I served in the Chicago, Illinois Mission. He taught us missionaries the importance of being specific in our prayers. He said, as missionaries we needed to change the words we were using in our prayers from asking to 'be led to the honest in heart and those ready for the gospel' to asking Heavenly Father 'to have the pure in heart and those who are elect led to us!'&nbsp; After this lesson on prayer my companion and I began to immediately apply it. As we did those elect were led to us. The experiences we had have stuck with me ever since.<br /><br />Soon after this conference, one Sunday we received a call. A college student had walked into church wanting to learn more about the gospel. As we met with him we discovered he had grown up next door to some members and was impressed with their family. The young man was honest in heart and elect. He, along with several of his family members, soon joined the church.<br /><br />As time went on, more of God's elect heard the voice of the Savior and came to us. One day, my companion and I received a referral from the Temple Square Visitor Center in Salt Lake City. A man in our area had been to Salt Lake on a business trip, visited Temple Square, and wanted to learn more about the gospel. We met with this referral, and he too soon joined the church. Soon after, my companion was calling to confirm follow-up appointments and dialed the wrong number. The sister who answered was surprised but so thankful we called. She and her husband had been fellowshipping a young couple with two small children while her husband was attending dental school. They were graduating soon and wanted these friends to join the church before they moved. They were ready, just as Elder de Jager said the "elect" would be ready for the gospel.<br /><br />We have been taught well by those who lead in these last days. We need to follow the living Prophet so that we may go where he is going. Pray for guidance and direction, pray for reassurance, pray in thankfulness for your blessings great and small.&nbsp; Live your lives in such a way that you may be worthy of receiving continuous revelation.&nbsp; I have seen the power of prayer calm the troubles around me, stay the storm, unite friends, draw people to Christ, and guide me through my daily life.&nbsp; No matter what we face, we can communicate with our Father and he will listen.&nbsp; We need to master communication with Him, and I testify that we can master communication with Him. The Lord will be your guide, if you seek Him.&nbsp; These things I say in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to speak to you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;I pray that the Holy Spirit will be with us as I share with you things I have learned from the devotional talks I have given during my service at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; My focus is on four themes from those talks I feel are especially important and relevant today: 1) the redeeming and strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ; 2) acting with faith in Christ; 3) obedience of the heart and soul; and 4) the eternal family.<br /><br /><strong>Theme #1: The Atonement of Christ</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>On his second day in the MTC, a young missionary knew that he could not go another hour without talking to the president of the MTC. There were things in his life he should have cleared up with his bishop at home, but had not. &nbsp;And so, he turned and headed to the president's office. &nbsp;In that moment the young missionary began a journey of repentance, humility, and hope.<br /><br />The path was not easy. &nbsp;He went back to his home ward and faced the same people who had sent him off on his mission the week before. &nbsp;He got a job, began working with his bishop, and lived at home. &nbsp;Those months were his Gethsemane. &nbsp;He suffered. &nbsp;He felt guilt, sorrow, and pain.&nbsp; And there were times, especially at night, when he felt lonely and discouraged. &nbsp;But he never gave up. &nbsp;He spent a lot of time in the scriptures and on his knees.<br /><br />Day after day, night after night, over many days and weeks, the redeeming and strengthening powers of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ became a living reality in his life.&nbsp; The Savior reached out and took hold of that young man and changed him from the inside out. &nbsp;When he went back into the mission field he was on fire. &nbsp;He became a mighty elder in Israel.<br /><br />Sue and I were eyewitnesses of the power, love, and grace of Jesus Christ in that young missionary's life. &nbsp;That missionary was our son Michael.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that marvelous blessings flow into our lives through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;I bear that witness today because I want the Atonement of Christ to work more powerfully in your lives. &nbsp;I want you to be converted more deeply unto the Lord so that in your trials, that surely will come, you, too, will experience the Savior's redeeming and strengthening power.<br /><br />In Gethsemane and on Calvary, Jesus took upon Himself our sins and suffered the "whole law of the demands of justice"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for us.&nbsp; He felt in His pure and sinless soul the searing torment of "a perfect knowledge of all our guilt and our uncleanness."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; He suffered the agony of "[death] as to things pertaining unto righteousness"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and the "awful chains"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;of Satan's power and captivity.<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In that magnificent act of love and sacrifice, Jesus suffered "pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and indeed, "the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In the words of Isaiah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Surely he hath&nbsp;borne&nbsp;our&nbsp;griefs, and carried our sorrows;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;wounded&nbsp;for our&nbsp;transgressions,&nbsp;he&nbsp;<em>was&nbsp;</em>bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;upon him; and with his&nbsp;stripes&nbsp;we are&nbsp;healed.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, there is no sin, no guilt, no shame, no fear, no loneliness, no heartache, no loss, no depression, no sadness, no terror, no pain, no challenge, no weakness that Jesus has not experienced and overcome. &nbsp;He has all power over all things.</p>
<p>If you turn to Christ and repent of your sins, He will forgive you and cleanse you and change your heart. &nbsp;This is the redeeming power of the Atonement. &nbsp;If you turn to Christ when you face challenges and need capacity beyond your own, He can strengthen you and magnify your capacity. &nbsp;This is the strengthening power of the Atonement. &nbsp;Sue and I saw both of these powers at work in our son. &nbsp;He needed the redeeming power to cleanse him from sin and change his heart.&nbsp; But he also needed spiritual healing and comfort, patience, courage, and diligence far beyond his native capacity. &nbsp;He needed both the redeeming and the strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ in his life.&nbsp; He turned to Christ and found that power, and so can you and I.<br /><br />If you come unto Christ and are faithful to your covenants, Jesus will sanctify all of your mortal experience to your blessing both now and forever.&nbsp; Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, you may become more and more like Him&mdash;you may walk in the newness of life, His sons and daughters, clean, pure in heart, filled with the pure love of Christ, blessed with joy and happiness and peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come.<br /><br /><strong>Theme #2: Acting with Faith in Christ</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In 1982 my father and mother submitted their papers to serve a mission. When the call came, it was a shock to my mother. &nbsp;They were called to serve in the Philippines Davao Mission. When my mother saw where they were going, she exclaimed, "No! &nbsp;You've got to call them and tell them we can't go to the Philippines.&nbsp; Don't they know you have asthma? &nbsp;And I don't want to deal with all those lizards and bugs."<br /><br />My father reminded my mother that she had always encouraged him never to turn down a call from the Lord.&nbsp; She knew that was true, but that didn't make her feel any better. &nbsp;One night a few days later she woke my dad up at about 2:30 a.m.&nbsp;<br /><br />She said, "Did you hear that voice?"<br /><br />"No, I didn't hear any voice."<br /><br />"Well, I have heard the same voice three times tonight.&nbsp; It said, "Why are you worrying? &nbsp;Don't you know that I know he has asthma? &nbsp;I will take care of him and you.&nbsp; Get yourself ready to serve in the Philippines."<br /><br />My mother and father went forward with faith in the Lord and had a marvelous experience in the Philippines. &nbsp;My father served as the first counselor in the mission presidency, and he and my mother trained hundreds of missionaries and thousands of faithful Latter-day Saints in preparation for the coming of wards and stakes on the island of Mindanao.<br /><br />Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel.&nbsp; The scriptures teach us that "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;When we have faith in Christ, we look forward with the eye of faith<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>we see the remarkable promises of the redeeming and strengthening powers of the Atonement coming to pass with sharpness and clarity.&nbsp; These promises come alive in our minds through the power of the Spirit.&nbsp; Our hope in the power of Christ then becomes what the scriptures call lively,<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;bright,<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and excellent.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This is the hope that is an anchor to the soul.<br /><br />In times of trial (and in every other time) these marvelous blessings can be ours when we look forward with the eye of faith and take righteous action.&nbsp; However, looking forward with the eye of faith in times of trial is not easy.&nbsp; The natural man in us looks forward with the eye of fear and sees only darkness, failure, and pain.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fear does not come upon us slowly.&nbsp; It springs up in us quickly and can cloud our perspective and our vision.&nbsp; As the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith, the eye of fear leads us to "[set] at naught the counsels of God, and [follow] after the dictates of [our] own will and carnal desires."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Fear can lead us to take unrighteous action, and it can paralyze us.&nbsp; It can cause our hearts to fail us so that we shrink from our trials.&nbsp; It can cause us to react to our trials with denial, anger, resentment, and self-pity.&nbsp; This is why the Savior said so many times, "Fear not."<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Fear does not go away easily.&nbsp; It resists our efforts to overcome it.&nbsp; It reoccurs easily. However, with faith in Christ and personal determination we can declare: "I am not going to look forward with the eye of fear.&nbsp; I am going to look forward with the eye of faith, and take righteous action."<br /><br />When we see the future with faith and hope in Christ, and when we act on that faith, divine light and power flow into our lives.&nbsp; That light and power activate the bright, shining shield of faith in the armor of God that "[quenches] . . . the fiery darts"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;of the adversary.&nbsp; In the strength of the Lord we can move forward to do what He wants done, paying no heed to ridicule and scorn, taking no counsel from our fears, setting doubt aside, overcoming discouragement with hope, and resisting temptation with our faith in Christ. &nbsp;Jesus Christ is our shield.<br /><br /><strong>Theme #3: Obedience of the Heart and Soul</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Every morning when I walk onto this campus, I feel the Spirit of the Lord. &nbsp;Every time I attend a meeting, conduct an interview, or teach a class, I feel that wonderful Spirit. &nbsp;Brothers and sisters, the Holy Ghost ministers on this campus. &nbsp;It is one of the greatest blessings we enjoy in our association at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;It is a precious gift.<br /><br />We enjoy the blessings of the Spirit here because the vast majority of the people who work and study here live in accordance with this remarkable scripture in the 64th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. &nbsp;And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we obey the commandments of the Lord with heart and soul, especially small and simple acts of goodness, kindness, and righteousness, the Holy Ghost ministers to us and the Lord strengthens us to accomplish His great work.</p>
<p>Obedience of the heart and soul embraces all of who we are&mdash;our behavior and our attitudes, our actions and our desires, our diligence and our love.&nbsp; That kind of willing obedience connects us to Christ in a powerful way and brings His Spirit, love, power, and joy into our lives. A casual, reluctant, surface kind of obedience will not do.&nbsp; The Lord requires of us obedience that is exact, willing, and deep. &nbsp;He wants obedience of the whole heart and soul.<br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson beautifully described the difference between reluctant and heart-and-soul obedience this way:"When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<sup>18</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I believe the great key to developing heart-and-soul obedience is to be obedient in small and simple things. &nbsp;I have in mind small things like keeping the Sabbath Day holy, saying our prayers, telling the truth, paying our tithing, keeping the Word of Wisdom, being kind to others, avoiding profanity, and keeping our promises, including living all the standards in the Honor&nbsp;Code.<br /><br />You may have heard on this campus comments from a student who does not understand the importance of obedience to small and simple things. &nbsp;For example, you may have heard a young man or a young woman say: "We decided to allow our girlfriends (or boyfriends in the case of the young woman) in our bedrooms, and it has worked out fine. &nbsp;Nothing bad has happened. &nbsp;We just act like adults."<br /><br />The purpose of the visiting standard in the Honor Code is to protect you from devastating sin and help you develop the discipline, unselfishness, self-control, and spiritual strength so important to a celestial marriage.&nbsp; This young man and his girlfriend (or the young woman and her boyfriend) feel that being alone with each other in his (or her) bedroom is no big deal. &nbsp;They have crossed over into Satan's territory where the ground slopes downward and is very slippery. &nbsp;They are in great spiritual danger.<br /><br />Please remember, obedience in the small things creates a spirit of obedience in all things. Moreover, obedience in the small things brings the Spirit into our lives, strengthens our faith in Christ and our resolve to do His will. &nbsp;It opens our hearts to Christ and blesses us with the strength and discipline to withstand temptations to violate the law of chastity, succumb to greed and materialism, or fall into apostasy. &nbsp;Obedience in the small things prepares us to give our hearts to the Lord so that we will accept and fulfill the increasingly demanding personal assignments and commandments that will come to us from the Lord all through our lives.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I hope and pray that you will give your heart to the Lord and follow Him.&nbsp; If you strive to be obedient in the small things, the Holy Ghost will be with you. You will act with faith in Christ to never do anything, or go anywhere, or say anything, or watch anything that would drive the Spirit away. &nbsp;You will be a blessing to everyone on this campus. &nbsp;And you will be ready to obey whatever the Lord commands with all your heart and soul all through your life.<br /><br /><strong>Theme #4: The Eternal Family</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In&nbsp;<em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World,</em>&nbsp;living prophets teach us true doctrine about our eternal identity as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers of an eternal family. &nbsp;Through the Atonement of Christ, you and a beloved eternal companion can create an eternal family, experience the joy of heaven on earth, and return to the presence of Heavenly Father "crowned with celestial glory,"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;"raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God,"<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;"in [whose] presence&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;fulness of joy."<sup>21</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The prophetic window of the proclamation gives each of us a beautiful picture of what our future holds.&nbsp; These blessings come at different times to different people.&nbsp; In mortal life we often encounter unexpected delays and disappointments. &nbsp;But it is good to have in front of us a vivid picture of our divine destiny as sons and daughters of God. &nbsp;That picture is real. &nbsp;If you are faithful, every one of you will realize that destiny.</p>
<p>The greatest experience of your life will be to stand with your eternal companion at the head of your eternal family. &nbsp;With the power of the holy priesthood in your life and in your marriage, you will love, guide, direct, and teach the children God entrusts to your care. United as eternal companions, and with the Lord Jesus Christ and His divine power, you will create a celestial marriage and an eternal family.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, your eternal family needs you to keep your covenants.&nbsp; You, your spouse, and your children will need the powers of heaven that will come into your family only through your faithfulness.&nbsp; You need to be faithful and obedient now so that you will be ready&nbsp;then.<br /><br />I know this is true of my own experience. &nbsp;Two weeks after our third child was born, I came home from graduate school to find the house in chaos.&nbsp; Our first two little ones were in the process of destroying our apartment, and Sue was sitting on the couch trying to comfort the crying baby.&nbsp; She, too, was in tears. &nbsp;I knew she was discouraged and depressed. &nbsp;I gave her a hug and then started to clean up when the Spirit whispered to me, "Give your wife a blessing."<br /><br />So, right there in the midst of all that chaos, Sue sat on a chair while I placed my hands on her head. &nbsp;In that moment the Spirit of the Lord enveloped us.&nbsp; I spoke a blessing that was given to me of the Lord. &nbsp;The blessing was full of words of astonishing breadth and power. &nbsp;Sue received promises of strength and capacity and sweet blessings about our children and our family here on earth and in the eternities. &nbsp;<br /><br />I saw my wife the way her Heavenly Father sees her.&nbsp; I came to understand who she really is; I saw her eternal identity and her divine destiny. &nbsp;I knew that if we were faithful to our covenants, we would have an eternal family and our children and grandchildren would call her blessed.&nbsp; When I finished, I hugged her for a long time.&nbsp; It was a glorious experience of the Holy Spirit and priesthood power.&nbsp; It came because despite our weaknesses and limitations, we were faithful, and the Lord blessed us.<br /><br />The marvelous blessings of an eternal family come through acting with faith in Jesus Christ and in Heavenly Father's plan. &nbsp;However, in the days in which we live, our faith in Christ and in the Father's plan are now being and will be tested. &nbsp;We live in a time when the forces of darkness are attacking marriage and the family and thus God's eternal plan. &nbsp;President Monson has called us to stand for truth with courage, even as we avoid contention and act with grace and civility.<sup>22</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The most important way we stand for the truth about marriage and the family is to live it. And that means acting with faith in Christ in the face of fear, doubt, ridicule, or even persecution. &nbsp;I know from my own experience that everything about becoming a husband or wife and a father or mother in an eternal family is an act of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Looking for your eternal companion, finding that companion, and deciding to marry are acts of faith. Deciding to have children is an act of faith. &nbsp;Rearing children in love and righteousness is an act of faith.<br /><br />Getting married and having children is not about money or skill.&nbsp; It is about faith.&nbsp; These are acts of faith in Jesus Christ, in His atoning sacrifice, and in His redeeming love.&nbsp; These are acts of faith that the Savior can change your heart, lift your burdens, and strengthen your capacity with His almighty power.<br /><br />I saw all of these principles come together one day as I sat in a temple sealing room. There I watched as a young man and young woman were sealed for time and all eternity.&nbsp; I knew the young man, and I knew of the path he had traveled.&nbsp; His life had been full of the pain and heartache of sin. &nbsp;Some of that pain he had brought on himself; some had come by the actions of others. &nbsp;However, he had humbled himself before the Lord, repented of his sins, and sought the redeeming and strengthening powers of the Savior.<br /><br />I knew the Lord Jesus Christ had blessed that young man with His forgiveness and His grace.&nbsp; He was about to be sealed in the temple of the Lord to a marvelous young woman. &nbsp;I looked across the room at the young man's mother. &nbsp;I could see on her face pure joy as tears flowed down her cheeks.&nbsp; I knew also the path the young woman had walked.&nbsp; I knew of her goodness and her great faith that had sustained her in difficult hours.<br /><br />As I watched this beautiful scene, there came into my mind a thought I knew was from the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; These are the words I felt:&nbsp;<br /><br />"This is why He did it&mdash;this is why Jesus suffered the crushing agony of the Atonement&mdash;so that this young man and this young woman could be clean and worthy, healed and whole, sealed forever by His power as husband and wife in the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"This is why the Father sent His Son to suffer and die for us.&nbsp; This is why the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove and called him to be the great prophet of the Restoration.&nbsp; This is why Joseph received the power to translate the Book of Mormon; why he received the keys of this dispensation, including the sealing power; why he received the ordinances and covenants of the temple and revelation upon revelation establishing the Lord's true and living Church on the earth.<br /><br />"This is why from the days of Joseph Smith until this very hour the Lord has called living prophets to stand where Joseph stood, to hold the keys Joseph holds&mdash;so that you and I could be blessed with prophetic counsel and guidance, with spiritual gifts, with sacred ordinances in holy temples, with courage and faith to walk in the light, with repentance and forgiveness, with the power and authority of the keys of the priesthood of God. &nbsp;It is so we might qualify for all the blessings of the temple of the Lord, be sealed to a beloved eternal companion, and have our children sealed to us forever in eternal life with our Father in Heaven." &nbsp;<br /><br />That is why.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak today and leave with you my testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ. &nbsp;During this week leading up to Easter, my children and grandchildren have been posting "Because He Lives" messages on Instagram. &nbsp;A granddaughter posted this quote from Sister Carole Stephens' talk in the Women's Conference Saturday night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He is the way, the only way we can overcome mortal challenges, be healed, and return back to our heavenly home.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>Alma assures us in his parting words to his son Helaman:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whosever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>This is such a wonderful promise.</p>
<p>We are born with the Light of Christ within us; and because of His atoning sacrifice, we can also receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;This light and this gift are from God. &nbsp;They give us access to the path that builds our trust in God and returns us to Him.</p>
<p>As part of our mortal challenges, we face opposition. Satan invites and entices us to love him and the world more than God. &nbsp;Will we accept Satan's invitation and love the world, or will we love God and accept the Savior's invitation to come unto Him in order to qualify for exaltation and eternal life with our Father in Heaven?<br /><br />When I was your age and attending BYU, I learned that accepting the Savior's invitation to come unto Him becomes easier as we develop the ability to follow a very simple pattern of living.&nbsp; This is what I learned: &nbsp;Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there!<br /><br />Following this pattern has helped me to become more honest, dependable, and trustworthy because I kept my commitments to other people to "be there."&nbsp; And&nbsp;<em>being prepared to be there</em>&nbsp;also has added value to my life.<br /><br />Let me give you some examples from my college years at BYU, which is when I made a commitment to follow this pattern in my life. During my first two years at BYU, I worked for Custodial Services every day from 4 a.m. until 7 a.m. &nbsp;My first class was English at 7 a.m. It seemed logical to schedule my classes early because I would already be on campus. &nbsp;However, as you can guess, it wasn't always worth that convenience. &nbsp;The temptation many days after work was to find an empty recliner or cot in one of the women's restrooms on campus and skip that first class. &nbsp;If I did, and fell asleep, I could easily miss the whole morning of classes. &nbsp;(In those days we didn't have cell phone alarms.) &nbsp;I had to resist that temptation and walk sleepily to class repeating to myself, "Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there."<br /><br />Following the pattern was great because it got me to class! &nbsp;But on those days when I had prepared by getting plenty of sleep the night before, I was much happier to leave work and go to class, and my participation in class was much more meaningful!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Here is another example. &nbsp;Following the advice to be there helped me develop a pattern of always attending my Church meetings. &nbsp;I had followed that pattern at home with my family, but on my own sometimes I was tempted to sleep in on Sundays. &nbsp;Again I resisted the temptation, and with the words "be where you are supposed to be" coaxing me out of bed, I attended Sunday School every Sunday morning and returned to the Church each Sunday evening for sacrament meeting.<br /><br />Setting that pattern of always attending my Sunday meetings had an important impact on me while raising my children. On many, many Sunday mornings when President Clark was out of the house fulfilling his callings, it was up to me to get the family to Church on time. &nbsp;It wasn't easy, but we were there every week&mdash;all eight of us&mdash;including two somewhat reluctant teenage sons! &nbsp;It took a lot of preparation to set everyone's expectations, get us all ready and fed, and get out the door in time for me to lead the opening hymn and fulfill my calling.<br /><br />Another commitment to follow the pattern during those college years was to actively be involved in home evening group meetings and activities. &nbsp;I can tell you that habit had a direct positive impact on my life and the lives of my children&mdash;literally.&nbsp; It was in my home evening group that I found their dad&mdash;my true love. &nbsp;Where would our children be today if I had skipped out on home evening? &nbsp;Because I was following the pattern at that time in my life, I was also prepared to be sealed with him in the House of the Lord.<br /><br />I would like to pass this same advice on to you.&nbsp; Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there, and be prepared to be there.<br /><br />Be there for all of your ward meetings and activities, ready to contribute. &nbsp;When you are in school and supposed to be in class, be there with assignments done. &nbsp;When you are supposed to be at home evening, be there and be ready to love and serve your brothers and sisters and maybe even to fall in love with one of them. &nbsp;Be there for your work commitments, and be prepared to serve well. &nbsp;Be there for the people you live with, ready to love and to serve them.&nbsp; When it is time for you to be on your knees speaking with the Lord, be there. &nbsp;Go through your day saying to yourself, "Where am I supposed to be? &nbsp;What do I need to do to be prepared?" &nbsp;And then be there, prepared.<br /><br />I pray you will establish this pattern in your life now.&nbsp; Make it your motto: &nbsp;Be where I am supposed to be when I am supposed to be there, and be prepared. &nbsp;If you follow this pattern in your life, it will help you lay the foundation for accepting the Savior's invitation to come unto Him and qualify for exaltation and eternal life with our Father in Heaven.<br /><br />You will be like the five wise virgins.&nbsp; They were at the marriage feast when they were supposed to be there, and they were prepared.You will make and keep sacred covenants with the Lord; you will build a home full of faith and spiritual power; you will create an eternal family; you will magnify whatever callings you receive; you will run the Lord's errands wherever He sends you; you will always be where the Lord wants you to be when He wants you to be there, and you will be prepared. &nbsp;And in that glorious day when He comes again, you will be there, ready to receive Him&mdash;the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.<br /><br />I know He lives. &nbsp;I love Him. &nbsp;I testify to you today that&nbsp;<em>because He lives</em>&nbsp;he will sustain you in these efforts.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the parents.<br /><br />Thank you for entrusting your children to us.&nbsp; We love them very much. &nbsp;As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have said on their behalf. &nbsp;I think of all the home evenings and family dinners. &nbsp;I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home.&nbsp; I think of your devotion to them and your love for them.&nbsp; We have seen that love and its fruits in your children.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about your children is the Light of Christ in their eyes and His love in their hearts.&nbsp; It is surely true that they have worked hard at BYU-Idaho and have developed knowledge and skills that will be of great value to them and their families.&nbsp; Yet, what matters most is that they have become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;They love the Lord, and His light and His love are in them.<br /><br />I now speak to the graduates.<br /><br />Tonight is the last time I will address the graduates of BYU-Idaho as president. &nbsp;I want to share with you the most important counsel I can give a graduate of this very special and set apart university.<br /><br />Here is my counsel: keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Ghost in it. The world is not in your heart now; don't let it in.<br /><br />Keeping the world out of your heart is not easy. &nbsp;There is all around us now, and there will be all around us in the days ahead, diabolical "shafts in the whirlwind,"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;cunning devices,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;lying craftiness,<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;subtle deception,<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;flattery,<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;doctrines of devils, [and] commandments of men.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;These are all designed to tempt you, deceive you, turn you away from Christ, and bring you down to destruction by getting the world into your heart.<br /><br />Tonight I will give you a sure way to keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Spirit in it.&nbsp; It is a very simple way, but it is powerful because it is the Lord's way:<br /><br />And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself&nbsp;unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of&nbsp;prayer&nbsp;and offer up thy&nbsp;sacraments&nbsp;upon my&nbsp;holy day;<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Brothers and sisters, I make you this promise: if you will observe the Sabbath day to keep it a holy day and if you will partake of the sacrament in a spirit of love, remembrance, and commitment, your faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, will increase.&nbsp; You will keep the world out of your hearts, and the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you with His Spirit.<br /><br />Jesus taught the Nephites at the temple at Bountiful that when we partake of the emblems of the sacrament on His holy day:</p>
<p>. . . it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>. . . I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. &nbsp;And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my&nbsp;rock.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I hope and pray that you will build your lives "upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;by keeping the Sabbath day holy and by making with our Heavenly Father that sacramental covenant of remembrance and obedience every week. &nbsp;Then, you will keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Spirit will be in it. &nbsp;No matter where you go, no matter what happens to you, this promise of the Lord Jesus Christ will be yours:<br /><br />And whoso&nbsp;receiveth&nbsp;you, there I will be also, for I will go&nbsp;before&nbsp;your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;shall be in your hearts, and mine angels&nbsp;round about you, to bear you up.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>And so I say to you tonight, go forward unafraid with confidence and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;I know He lives.&nbsp; I bear witness of His love, mercy, and grace. &nbsp;You are important to Him. &nbsp;He suffered and died so that He could lift you and strengthen you, cleanse you from sin, comfort you in hours of need, and bless you with His love, His light, and His almighty power, now and forever. &nbsp;His promises to you are true.<br /><br />I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>It is always exciting to see you who are graduating or commencing on to the next phase of your lives.&nbsp; I add my congratulations to you and my thanks to all who have done so much to make this day possible.&nbsp; I also want to pay tribute today to President and Sister Clark who, in one sense, are graduating from BYU-Idaho and commencing on a new part of their lives.&nbsp; I love them and am grateful for what they have done to bless you.&nbsp; I listened to their last devotional addresses and was touched as they invited their family to join them on the stand as a symbol of their testimony.</p>
<p>The fact that you graduates have completed your studies here shows you have been preparing for life.&nbsp; Here at BYU-Idaho you have been preparing academically, and even more importantly, you have been preparing spiritually for the future.&nbsp; Some of you have made major decisions while you have been here.&nbsp; Some of you may have already taken the time to lay out a plan for your life.&nbsp; You may know whether you are going to pursue further education, begin a career or focus on raising those children that have come or may come.&nbsp; Some of you may have determined where you would like to be in 10 years, 20 years and throughout your life.&nbsp; You may have your plans worked out for where you will live and what you will be doing.&nbsp; You may even have financial goals and other plans you have worked out.</p>
<p>I remember setting some financial goals when we were young parents without much cash flow.&nbsp; At one point I set three financial goals:&nbsp; 1. be able to afford disposable diapers.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; be able to afford milk from a jug rather than powdered milk, and 3. drive a car that was made in the same decade we were driving it.&nbsp; It took us about 15 years before we achieved all three of those goals, but it did happen.&nbsp; You probably have your sights set a little higher than I did.</p>
<p>For a few of you your life plans may actually unfold the way you envision them, but for the vast majority of you, your lives in 40 years will be different than you have designed them now.&nbsp; This doesn't mean you shouldn't plan, but it does mean that many of you will see twists and turns that you couldn't have anticipated. &nbsp;You don't have to be too concerned if the specifics of your life plans don't pan out exactly as you had envisioned them.&nbsp; The Lord can guide and shape our lives if we will let Him.</p>
<p>Think about President and Sister Clark.&nbsp; Can you imagine a planning session they might have had early in their marriage?</p>
<p>President Clark: "Let's go to graduate school at Harvard."</p>
<p>Sister Clark:&nbsp; "Sounds good, and then why don't you get on the faculty at Harvard?&nbsp; We can raise our children in Boston."</p>
<p>President Clark:&nbsp; "All right.&nbsp; Then maybe I'll be the Dean of the Harvard Business School for about ten years."<br /><br /> Sister Clark:&nbsp; "That's just what I was thinking.&nbsp; After that why don't you become the president of BYU-Idaho?&nbsp; I love Winter. And Rexburg puts the wind in Winter."<br /><br /> President Clark:&nbsp; "You must be reading my mind.&nbsp; That's exactly what I was thinking.&nbsp; We could do that for about ten years and then let's plan on me being called as a General Authority."<br /><br /> Sister Clark:&nbsp; "Perfect.&nbsp; It's a plan.&nbsp; Let's get at it!"<br /><br /> I have never asked Elder and Sister Clark if this is the way it was, but you know as well as I do that it didn't happen that way.&nbsp; We could go through the same exercise with Elder and Sister Gay.&nbsp; My guess is that their lives have turned out very differently than any planning they did when they first got married.&nbsp; I don't imagine that Sister Gay knew she would be leading a large humanitarian effort in Africa, or that the Gays would have a chance to bless millions of lives around the globe in philanthropic work.<br /><br /> The Gays and the Clarks prepared themselves, and the Lord led them.&nbsp; Sometimes it may have been by the Spirit prompting them to do something or go in a different direction.&nbsp; Sometimes it may have been circumstances that forced a change in direction from where they thought they were headed.&nbsp; The Lord has been able to guide them because they were ready, they were worthy and they were willing.&nbsp; Many times our experiences help prepare us for what is coming in our path.&nbsp; That way we can be led step by step where we should go.&nbsp; Sometimes what we view as a roadblock actually directs us to an onramp to the road the Lord would have us take.&nbsp; <br /><br /> The Savior said that the Apostle Paul would bear His name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel (Acts 9:15). &nbsp;At the time Paul seemed to be at the height of his influence he ended up being a prisoner for a number of years in Caesarea and then in Rome.&nbsp; What may have seemed like a major setback actually made it possible for him to bear Christ's name to kings.&nbsp; I love - Paul's words to the Philippians during the time he was a prisoner:&nbsp; "I would ye should understand . . . that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel." (Philippians 1:12)&nbsp; <br /><br /> If we can stay ready and worthy, the Lord can use us.&nbsp; The Lord uses worthy disciples in many different ways&mdash;often in ways those disciples had not planned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your lives most likely won't mirror the Clarks' or the Gays', but you can be just as significant an instrument as they have been.&nbsp; <br /><br /> As you move forward from this critical point in your life, may you always be ready and worthy, and also willing to allow the Lord to guide you in your very significant lives.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Johnson, President Clark, distinguished faculty and staff, brothers and sisters and accomplished graduates, I am honored to speak to you tonight. I bring you the love of our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, and all the Brethren. On behalf of all, I extend heartfelt congratulations to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are an inspirational sight not only because of what you have accomplished but also because of how you&rsquo;ve chosen to conduct your life by attending BYU-Idaho. This makes your degree doubly impressive. You offer hope to an ever-darkening world. You are those who the Savior referred to as &ldquo;the light of the world&rdquo; (Matthew 5:14) and those He then challenged to &ldquo;shine before men&rdquo; (Matthew 5:16).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of my graduation from Harvard, I was particularly reminded of this special charge for each of us to shine as a light before this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in the office of my thesis advisor. He was a kind, devout Christian. We had never spoken about religion but that afternoon he said, &ldquo;Bob, I want you to stay and teach here at the Business school, but I don&rsquo;t want you to stay for the reasons you may think. I don&rsquo;t want you here because I believe you&rsquo;ll make some great contribution to the literature because I don&rsquo;t believe you will.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smart but not that kind of smart.&rdquo; I said something like, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advisor then walked very slowly from behind his desk and circled behind me. He then walked a second time around both his desk and me saying, &ldquo;Bob, I think I know you. I believe I know you. I feel I know you. I want you to stay and teach here because I want you to teach our students about God. That is what I do every day during my office hours. I need someone to help me teach them about life.&rdquo; I was stunned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My vision of my degree changed. I knew that no matter what else I might do with my schooling&mdash;whether it be teaching, business, supporting a family&mdash;I needed to apply it in a way that added light to others and not myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, about eight years ago, I had a similar experience. I had just returned home from serving as a mission president and began seeking advice from others as to what to do next. At that time, I received a note from Elder Dallin H. Oaks. It reads, in part:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Bob. . . It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. What is important in the end is what we have become by our labors . . . Wise are those who make this commitment: I will put the Lord first in my life, and I will keep His commandments . . . This is the ultimate significance of taking upon you the name of Jesus Christ, and this is what we should ponder . . .&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight, as you move forward, yours too is a choice of how best to apply your degree and talents. As both my thesis advisor and Elder Oaks taught me, you can either use your training to bring light to yourself or to bring the Savior&rsquo;s light to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to do this should be deeply pondered. To that end, I would like to commend two fundamental principles for your consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first principle is that you hear and follow the Spirit, doing things in the Lord&rsquo;s way, not your way; the second is that you embrace the marginalized of this world, or as Christ said: the lost, the last, and the least.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>First: Act According to the Spirit.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago at another commencement my father said the following to the graduates: <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The real challenge today is not in outer space but in inner man. To reconcile the how of our living with the why of our existence and in the synthesis to emerge the child of God that we know we are&hellip; May your life bear an unalterable testimony that there is knowledge &ndash; independent of reason &ndash; [a knowledge that is able to alter lives and which can only be found through obedience] to the voice of the God within us.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultimate foundation of all you do in life should be to live so that the voice and integrity of the Spirit takes precedence as the powerful, necessary force in determining your actions, both professionally and personally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are graduates of a time that needs a profound inner spiritual rebirth. Yours is a time that calls for men and women willing to assert their birthright of choice to alter and shape lives and institutions in a way that reflects the moral and spiritual values dictated by the Spirit of God. Unless you can arrive at that point, you will idolize and surround yourself with the trivial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting according to the Spirit, however, is not always easy. It often requires significant sacrifice and at times deep obedience against the purely rational mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some years ago, the late Truman Madsen, introduced me at a talk I delivered at BYU. He shared the following story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all heard of Jesse Knight. There&rsquo;s a BYU building named for Jesse. He did his successful work in mining&hellip; [he] was generous in his use of what he managed to earn. When a crisis arose [in the Church] Heber J. Grant, later president, was sent out to try to raise funding just to keep the Church going.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He went to Jesse and said, &lsquo;We need five thousand dollars from you.&rsquo; And Jesse said, &lsquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve given a lot and helped a lot, and at the moment I sort of feel like I&rsquo;m paid up.&rsquo; Brother Grant said, &lsquo;I only ask one thing. I want you to go home and pray about it. That&rsquo;s all I ask. You pray about it, and I&rsquo;ll come and see you tomorrow.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Jesse promised. That night he prayed and had a strong impression, &lsquo;Give my servant Heber ten thousand dollars.&rsquo; And he said aloud, &lsquo;Lord he only asked for five thousand dollars!&rsquo; And the message was repeated. So when Brother Grant showed up, Brother Jesse Knight had a check for ten thousand dollars. [Jesse] then said, &lsquo;But (Heber) don&rsquo;t ever ask me to pray again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As you sit here tonight, I am sure each of you has given thought to your future. For some it will be off to jobs or graduate school or other opportunities. It may be returning home to concentrate on raising a family, and for others it may be more exploring and pondering the question, &ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo; More than this, most of you have probably thought, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now time to become part of the real world.&rdquo; Let me assure you it is not and never will be that time. Rather, this is the time to resolve forever to stand above the world&mdash;your goal must not be assimilation into the real world but to disrupt it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord himself has invited each of you to do so, saying: &ldquo;Seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness&rdquo; (JST, Matthew 6:38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To build up His kingdom you must forsake and sacrifice to establish every needful thing of conscience. You have to stand up and bear witness and testimony in uncomfortable and even threatening circumstances. In His kingdom you can no longer say, like Jesse Knight, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m paid up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the voice of the Spirit, you will be asked to walk unmarked paths, many times needing to do things that make little sense. Like Jesse Knight, you will need to pay $10,000 instead of $5,000. You will have to build a Kirtland temple, like Joseph, with no money, or retrieve brass plates, like Nephi, against an army of fifty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church would have never risen above its own debts if the saints were unwilling to sacrifice what was asked by the voice of the Spirit, and instead did only that which they could afford. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the maximization of wealth or success that underpins the command to let your light &ldquo;shine before men,&rdquo; rather it is Spirit-directed acts of sacrifice and courage that build and edify. These also are the acts that blaze new pathways that astonish this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intimate and absolute test of your life will not be the job or career ahead, not even whether you marry or serve in the Church&mdash;but rather the test is:&nbsp; Will you, &ldquo;hear&rdquo; or &ldquo;hearken&rdquo; and act upon the voice of the Spirit of God within you with exactness&mdash;using all the talents and gifts and education He has given you&mdash;to bring to pass His work and His glory and not your work and your glory. The great charge to Joseph Smith as he opened this dispensation was to, &ldquo;Hear Him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you hear and follow the voice of the Spirit, you cannot and will not survive this day and time&mdash;and you will certainly never achieve the impact your life can otherwise realize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young business professional on Wall Street one evening, while in a lawyer&rsquo;s office, I had a prominent investment banker ask me this question: &ldquo;Bob, do you think I ought to buy a summer home in East Long Island New York or one in France?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You live in New York. You can drive to that home.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I know, but the traffic is so bad on the Long Island Expressway, I think I can go to the airport and take the Concorde jet to Paris quicker.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; I then heard a voice shout inside me, &ldquo;You need to leave this place and this job immediately or you are going to become like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not doubt that Voice, and while it made neither logical or financial sense, I walked out on Wall Street a few weeks later&mdash;leaving a large bonus on the table&mdash;and joined a small boutique investment company in Boston that paid me less than half of what I was then earning. It made no sense to many of my friends, and I could not fully explain it to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In time, though, as I followed the voice of the Spirit to walk away, doors opened that allowed me literally to become an instrument in the hand of the Lord in helping lift countless people out of poverty, disease and hopelessness. The decision to leave only made sense in hindsight, but being true to the Voice changed everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you understand nothing else tonight, understand this&mdash;whether you are on the farm pitching hay and harvesting potatoes, or in the home raising a family, or working as a manager in business&mdash;you will not be whole and healed and fully empowered unless you receive His voice and go and do whatever it directs. In a very real sense, it does not matter what you have studied and leave here to do. What matters is that you make whatever you do one with the Lord and His voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second, embrace the marginalized.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better or worse, the reality of our world is that we live in a day and hour where both good and powerful evil share the geography of our time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incredible as this may seem, you are not here by accident. You are here by choice. You wanted the opportunity to prove yourself in this time of morally twisted opposition that calls evil, good and good, evil. You elected to stand here to give service and to love.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we have great divisions before us. Within and without the Church there exist real stumbling blocks. Outside we are pressed daily by violence, invasion of individual liberty, discrimination, poverty, immorality, disease and so much more. Inside the Church many struggle to reconcile and understand same-gender attraction, the role of women, or certain Church doctrines or history. Many struggle with doubt, lack of confidence or resources, zealousness, commitment, meeting schedules, leaders who offend, friends or children who stray, prayers that seem unanswered, and broken trusts through emotional, physical or sexual abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some would like to ignore or diminish these issues by contending with those that challenge our orthodoxy; or by delivering dismissive sermons; or by saying to those that struggle temporally or spiritually with doubt or depression to &ldquo;just be patient, things will work out.&rdquo; The Lord, however, expects much more of us than words. He expects our personal ministry despite discomfort or any personal rejection. He expects an outreach of charity. He expects us to go into the &ldquo;highways and byways&rdquo; of people&rsquo;s lives and to bring them to the Sacred Grove and to Gethsemane and Calvary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures teach us that Jesus showed forth &ldquo;an increase of love&rdquo; to those He rebuked and to those that denied Him. Against norms, he dined with sinners and ministered to the outcast, the grieved, and unbeliever.</p>
<p>There is nothing that has more power to affect our lives than the pure love of Christ, which is charity. Charity, looks beyond self, choosing to &ldquo;bear&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;endure all&nbsp;things.&rdquo; If&nbsp;we live without&nbsp;charity, if we live indifferently, our&nbsp;Heavenly Father says &ldquo;[we] are nothing.&rdquo; That is, we live a life of vanity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of my favorite chapters in the New Testament are the thirteenth chapter of John and the fifth chapter of Mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described in John, the night of the Atonement began with the Savior commanding the disciples to make and renew a covenant to always remember and honor His sacrifice. He then knelt down and washed the feet of those who would in a few short hours betray Him, deny Him or fall asleep in His most needed hour. He never condemned for this but exhorted them to be one with Him; to forgive; to wash the feet of others; and to love their neighbors as He loved them. He asked that we raise our vision to His vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see that the great charge of the Atonement is to love as He loved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To love those who betray, who offend, who fall asleep, who deny, who doubt, who are zealous and cut off an ear with a sword or a heart with a harsh deed; to be longsuffering with those who will not hear and who will not love back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the night of the Atonement, Pilate did things the world&rsquo;s way&mdash;he washed his hands of the matter of justice, and sold out, while Christ pleaded mercy for those who nailed Him to the cross.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the gospel of Mark, chapter 5, the Savior comes to a man who is an outcast. Nobody will have anything to do with him because he is &ldquo;untamed&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut himself with stones&rdquo; (verse 10). The Savior, however, embraces him, heals him and sends him home with the command to bear witness of God&rsquo;s compassion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior then passes over the sea. There a religious leader, Jairus, asks him to give a blessing to his daughter who was dying. As He begins the journey to Jairus&rsquo; home a crowd of people walk with Him. In the crowd, another outcast, a woman who had been suffering for twelve years with an issue of blood, touches His garment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had been to all the doctors and could not be healed. In her culture this made her unclean and required her to live apart from her husband and children. She was completely isolated. In this humiliating situation, she touched the Savior&rsquo;s garment hoping to be cured. Jesus sensed her presence, turned and asked, &ldquo;Who touched my clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desperate but faithful, she then falls down before Him. He then envelops her with His grace saying, &ldquo;Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole, go in peace&rdquo; (verse 34). In doing this, not only did the Savior heal her physically, He also healed her spiritually. Through His ministry she was no longer a &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; but now a &ldquo;daughter,&rdquo; a member of the family of God and once again a member of her own family and society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Savior lingered, however, Jairus&rsquo; daughter died. Undeterred, He still goes forward to minister. He finds family and friends weeping over her and asks why. He tells them the young girl is not dead but sleeping. The scriptures record that they then &ldquo;laughed him to scorn&rdquo; (verse 40). Ignoring them He raised the girl from the dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep in a frame on the wall in my home office these words of Elbert Hubbard:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;God will not look you over for medals, degrees or diplomas but for scars.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the pattern that Jesus places before us as we work to do His work to lift others: we will be called upon to suffer innocently, if we are to achieve what He needs us to achieve as His light before men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have many who are spiritually dead around us, and you must be willing to be laughed at &ldquo;to scorn.&rdquo; Like Jesus, you must move forward against a world that does not believe and not &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; before the taunting of our secular world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the parable of the great supper the Savior said: <em>&ldquo;And whosoever doth not bear [my] cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple&rdquo; (Luke 14: 27).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In opening this last dispensation, He reminded us that He &ldquo;partook&rdquo; of &ldquo;the bitter&rdquo; and also &ldquo;finished&rdquo; the required ascent to the cross. God expects engagement. You are to be a finisher and not an observer in His battle for the souls of men. Scars are more important than diplomas. This is how we show our love to Him and &ldquo;shine before men,&rdquo; and how we receive His enabling power and grace in our own lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion let me share one final thought. Let me return to my friend Truman Madsen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Truman shared the story of Jesse Knight, who gave $10,000, he then said the following which I feel impressed to share with you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Ann and I were present one night at the Jerusalem Center. Sitting next to us were Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, not yet in the Twelve, and Elder James E. Faust, not yet in the First Presidency.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Brother Faust turned to Jeff and said, &lsquo;Talk about Abraham.&rsquo; And he began, as if on cue, and described&hellip; [how] both Abraham and Isaac had demonstrated their willingness to accept the will of God at all hazards&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The footnote on Brother Holland is that he was in a meeting somewhere in a university, and from the audience, a student cried out in a mocking way, &lsquo;Brother Holland! Would you give your life for Jesus?&rsquo; And he thought a minute and then said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought I was doing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Truman then said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[There] are two ways of giving our lives, brothers and sisters, one is in the emergency where we give our life in death. But the other way is to give through our lives [in the <strong>how</strong> of our living].&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you leave this conference center tonight, may you do so with the resolve to live as a witness for Christ by letting your light &ldquo;shine before men.&rdquo; May you know that this will require you to &ldquo;hear Him&rdquo; and to bear with love the outcast, the enemy, the marginalized. May you understand that this is not a journey into the known but the unknown&mdash;it is a path of faith and integrity to the voice of the Holy Ghost that ultimately demands your sacrifice to be more than just good or less sinful, but to become holy and consecrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of this my prayer is that each of you may find the strength to obey and repent as needed to live a life, dictated by the Spirit within, that bears witness that He is your priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Primary we learned the words and sang the song, <em>I&rsquo;m Trying to Be Like Jesus</em>. Tonight I simply ask, &ldquo;Are you trying to be like Jesus?&rdquo; I believe that there is no more important graduation message than that simple Primary graduation message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offer you again my heartfelt congratulations and commend you once more on your academic achievements leading to this graduation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave you my testimony that you are loved, deeply loved, as well as an invitation to leave here resolved to live beyond a career to a life of discipleship that takes upon you His name as directed by conscience with charity to all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also leave you my personal testimony, born of experience and His voice to me, that He lives and that He can and will lift you beyond any losses you suffer for His namesake. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>President Gilbert</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Sister Gilbert and I are so excited to serve with you at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; We feel the Lord's hand on this university.&nbsp; We also feel His love for you, the students who enroll here.&nbsp; In ways that are truly unique in all of higher education, this is a student-centered university.&nbsp; President Hinckley declared in his announcement of BYU-Idaho:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The school will have a unique role in and be distinctive from the other institutions of higher education within the Church Educational System . . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">BYU-Idaho will continue to be teaching oriented. &nbsp;Effective teaching and advising will be the primary responsibilities of its faculty, who are committed to academic excellence.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>You may not yet recognize the power of this unique identity; but if you haven't already, you will feel it when a faculty member knows your name, recognizes your needs, and reaches out to you personally.</p>
<p>I promise you that in the coming years you will be blessed with an increased recognition of this great blessing in your life. &nbsp;We are grateful to serve with a remarkable faculty and university staff, filled with individuals who are committed to the students and mission of BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;We feel a sacred stewardship to this university and to each of you.<br /><br />Today we would like to introduce ourselves and begin to give you a feel for who we are and how we were called to this new assignment.But in introducing our family and our background, we also hope to introduce a theme: accepting and magnifying calls that come from the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>But first, let us start by simply introducing our family.&nbsp; President Gilbert and I met and were married while in college at BYU in Provo. Work and school have taken us to Northern California, Southern California, Massachusetts, Utah, and Idaho. &nbsp;We are the parents of eight children.&nbsp; Our oldest son, James, is graduating from high school this year and recently received a call to serve in the Taiwan Taichung Mission.&nbsp; Our daughter Paige is 14 years old and will be our oldest child at home as we move our family back to Rexburg. John is 12 and is fretting his brother's mission departure, leaving him the only boy at home.&nbsp; We have five additional daughters: Emma, who is ten; Mary and Grace, our 8-year-old twins; Lucy, who is 7; and our youngest daughter Claire, who is almost 2.</p>
<p><img alt="Gilbert Family" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/GilbertFamily.jpg" width="293" /></p>
<p><strong>President Gilbert</strong></p>
<p>But we did not start out with a family of ten! &nbsp;In fact, before there was James or Paige, John or Emma, Mary, Grace, Lucy, or Claire, it was just the two of us. &nbsp;Yes, this marriage started as two college students&mdash;one of them hoping beyond hope that he could impress his future bride that he was the one.&nbsp; This is a picture of Sister Gilbert and me studying together when we were dating in college.</p>
<p><img alt="Gilbert Date" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/GilbertDate.jpg" width="293" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accepting the Call</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>So, how did we go from study dates in the library to a family of ten and the call to serve as President of BYU-Idaho?&nbsp; Well, it didn't happen all at once.&nbsp; Throughout our marriage, and even back to our time dating in college, we have learned that when we are obedient to the calls that come from the Lord, He blesses us in ways we could never imagine.&nbsp; Some of those calls will come as formal Church assignments&mdash;a bishop, a Primary president, a Young Men's leader, or even a seminary teacher.&nbsp; Other calls will be less formal, but will be just as significant.&nbsp; Those calls may come as a responsibility to be a father or a mother, to become a better person, or to simply serve someone in need.<br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The title of our talk today is "Rise to the Call."&nbsp; To introduce this theme, we would like to draw on the calling of Matthew in the New Testament.&nbsp; The scriptural account of Matthew's call does not provide a lot of detail&mdash;in fact, it is just one verse.&nbsp; In Matthew, chapter 9, verse 9, we&nbsp;read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me.&nbsp; And he arose, and followed him.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>That's it; a single verse and a simple response from a disciple to rise to the call. &nbsp;What else do we know that can help us understand the calling of this disciple? &nbsp;Matthew was a tax collector, a profession not well-respected because of its focus on money, greed, and even misrepresentation.&nbsp; We also know from Matthew that his call came in a custom house where tax monies were likely counted and gathered.</p>
<p>The often troubled early Baroque painter Carravagio has captured this scene in dramatic relief.&nbsp; In his painting "Calling of St. Matthew," Carravagio portrays Christ on the far right side of the canvas.&nbsp; He employs a technique that uses light and shadow for thematic emphasis. &nbsp;Notice that while Christ stands in the darkness, He seems to emanate light. &nbsp;Moreover light flows across the painting in the direction of the future disciple. &nbsp;Among art scholars there is some debate about which figure actually represents St. Matthew in the painting.&nbsp; The most commonly accepted view is that the man in the middle who is pointing to himself is Matthew. &nbsp;A less common interpretation, but the one we prefer, is that Matthew is the younger man sitting at the table on the far left, looking down at his hands and his money.&nbsp; It's almost as if he is taking one last look at his past before he rises up to take the outstretched hand of the Savior calling him to the work.</p>
<p><img alt="St. Matthew Painting" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/StMatthewPainting.jpg" width="293" /></p>
<p><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>There is a lesson in the calling of St. Matthew, and we believe there is a pattern we can learn from in rising to the calls we receive in life.&nbsp; First, we must look up and accept the call.&nbsp; If you follow our interpretation of the Caravaggio masterpiece, before Matthew could rise up to his call, he had to first look up, raise his sights, and accept the call he had been given.&nbsp; Second, he had to let go of the things that were holding him back.&nbsp; For Matthew, that was not just his money but his career and a life invested in a different path.&nbsp; For others, this might be a fear of failure, sacrificing personal pride, leaving behind a bad habit, or even personally forgiving an offense.&nbsp; Third, we must seek for the enabling power that comes from the Lord when we are on His errand.&nbsp; Not only did Matthew become a disciple of the Savior, he would eventually witness the Resurrection and later the Ascension of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Finally, when we are blessed with great power in our callings, we need to have the humility to recognize where that power comes from.&nbsp; The Lord can do great things with us when we dedicate our lives to Him.&nbsp; As Elder Russell M. Nelson has said recently from this podium: "The Lord uses the unlikely to accomplish the impossible."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Whether it was the young Joseph Smith called to restore the gospel, David to defeat Goliath, or Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, it is not the greatness of the man or woman, but their willingness to rise to the call that leads to power in the Lord.&nbsp; When we look up and truly understand the call the Lord is extending and let go of our self-focus, the Lord will empower us and make us mighty in His hands.<br /><br />1. Look up and accept the call<br />2. Let go of the things that would hold you back<br />3. Seek for enabling power from the Lord<br />4. Recognize the source of that power<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Serving with the Boston Youth</strong></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>President Gilbert</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We would like to share several experiences in our own lives that have helped us learn the importance of this pattern.&nbsp; During the midst of a very challenging academic season in my graduate studies, I was extended a call to serve in the Boston Stake Young Men's presidency.&nbsp; Having never served in that calling before, my first thought was that the assignment would basically entail planning a few dances each year at a stake center.&nbsp; But I soon learned to look up and see that the Lord had much more in mind.&nbsp; In fact, the Lord was looking for someone who could invest personally in the lives of the young men in Boston, young men who were new in the gospel and who needed to know the Lord's love in a personal and direct way.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Once President Gilbert looked up to see what the Lord expected, he realized this call would mean much more than a quarterly stake dance.&nbsp; It would mean every Sunday driving around the Boston Stake attending meetings, teaching, and getting to know those youth.&nbsp; It would mean attending weeknight youth activities in inner-city branches where there were not always local youth leaders available.&nbsp; It would mean having youth in our home and into our lives.&nbsp; Here is a picture of some of those youth sharing a meal in our dining room.&nbsp; President Gilbert loved those boys as if they were part of our family.&nbsp; He prayed for them.&nbsp; He knew them the way the Lord knew them, and he knelt at night asking how best to reach each of them.&nbsp; The Lord put great power into my husband because he was on the Lord's errand.</p>
<p><img alt="Boston Boys" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/BostonBoys.jpg" width="293" /><br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Now, I want you to focus especially on the four boys pointing at the camera.&nbsp; Each of those boys would eventually come here to Rexburg and attend BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Each of them would eventually serve a mission.&nbsp; And each of them would eventually meet a wonderful young woman and marry in the temple.&nbsp; This is a picture of all four of them in front of the Oakland Temple at a wedding that happened last summer in California.&nbsp; I love those boys.&nbsp; I love everything they have become.&nbsp; Mostly, I love that the Lord allowed me to serve them and to witness His power in their lives as He has shaped them into the men they are today.</p>
<p><img alt="Boston Boy's Wedding" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/BostonBoysWedding.jpg" width="293" /><br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Now, in a marriage sometimes one spouse is asked to serve by supporting the other in his or her calling.&nbsp; Certainly there have been many times in our married life where I have had to support President Gilbert as he has been called to assignments of responsibility in the Church.&nbsp; But that support has gone the other way as well.&nbsp; When I was eight months pregnant with our third child, I received a call to teach early morning seminary in our home.&nbsp; That's right&mdash;eight months pregnant and in our home! &nbsp;Now before you start wondering whether our bishop had gone crazy, let me tell you of the blessing this was for our family. &nbsp;First, the call meant that President Gilbert was often responsible to get the other children ready for the day, to tend the baby in the early morning, and sometimes to fill in for me in teaching lessons when I wasn't feeling well.&nbsp; Consider again the pattern we have discussed of rising to the call: I had to look up to recognize that the call had come from the Lord, and I had to let go of my fears of managing a young family and a busy home in accepting the call.&nbsp; Very soon, I began to see the enabling power in my calling as the Lord began to magnify my ability to teach. &nbsp;Finally, I learned to recognize that the sacrifice I thought I was making would turn into a blessing in my own life in ways I never could have imagined when I first accepted the call. &nbsp;Here is a picture of that seminary class after a Church meeting in Boston.</p>
<p><img alt="Boston Church Meeting" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/BostonChurchMeeting.jpg" width="293" /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Path to Rexburg</strong></span><br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Both of our first two stories relate to formal callings or assignments in the Church.&nbsp; But sometimes the call to follow Christ comes in other, more intimate ways.&nbsp; These calls can relate to our work, family life, and personal life.&nbsp; And sometimes they require us to do hard things.&nbsp; When Sister Gilbert and I first moved back East for graduate school, I was required to participate in a multi-week program affectionately named "Math Camp" by the doctoral students in my program.&nbsp; I was in way over my head. &nbsp;It was about one-third of the way through the initial experience when I started to doubt myself.&nbsp; I knew the program was where the Lord wanted me, but I was becoming painfully aware of my own academic shortcomings.&nbsp; I will never forget one evening with Sister Gilbert as we ate dinner along the Charles River.&nbsp; I confided in her that I didn't think I could complete the program.&nbsp; I explained it wasn't simply a matter of working harder; I just didn't have the ability to do that kind of work.&nbsp; I will never forget her response: "Clark, you prayed for this opportunity and you know our family is supposed to be here.&nbsp; Now, buck up and learn that math!"</p>
<p><img alt="Harvard Bench" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/HarvardBench.jpg" width="293" /><br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, as you know, President Gilbert made it through "Math Camp," and he eventually made it through his graduate program and was given multiple offers to teach in his field.&nbsp; Through this challenging process we both learned that when you are on the Lord's errand, you need to forget your fears and trust in the Lord. &nbsp;In Proverbs we read, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Ironically, my husband's research and work in his doctoral program would prove foundational, not only to his future work for the Church, but also to his time in Boston.&nbsp; He took a position on the faculty right where he had trained and began teaching.&nbsp;<br /><br />We grew to love New England falls, cheering on the Red Sox, serving in the Boston Stake, and being in a community where we could represent the Church.&nbsp; President Gilbert loved his job, and he loved teaching and being in a visible professional environment where he frequently played an ambassadorial role for our faith.&nbsp; Here is a picture of President Gilbert with one of his cohorts of MBA students.&nbsp; They are all dressed in white shirts with khaki pants in caricature of our family photos that hung in his office at work.&nbsp; President Gilbert loved teaching, and he loved working with and mentoring students in personal ways.</p>
<p><img alt="KhakiClass" height="193" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2015/Spring 2015/Devo Graphics Spring 2015/KhakiClass.jpg" width="293" /><br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>And yet, we would soon learn that sometimes a call in one stage of life is preparation for another.&nbsp; Think of Lehi and his family who were called out of Jerusalem.&nbsp; They showed great faith in leaving their possessions to enter the wilderness.&nbsp; I have to believe that by the time they reached the land of Bountiful, they were quite comfortable and were not anxious to go anywhere else.&nbsp;<br /><br />And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.<br /><br />And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>After nearly 10 years in Boston, it became clear that the Lord had another call for our family.&nbsp; We would be asked to leave the familiar and comfortable surroundings of Boston to gather with so many others who had done the same thing in coming to Rexburg to become part of this amazing institution at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; This time it was not overcoming fear of failure or questions about personal preparation.&nbsp;<br /><br />This time we had to leave behind something very different.&nbsp; The success of an early career led to the very risky temptation that our accomplishments had come from our own efforts and not from the Lord.&nbsp; Rising to the call meant recognizing that the Lord had placed experiences in our lives, not for our own glorification but in preparation for future service in the kingdom.&nbsp; We would be asked to give up a career studying innovation and the trappings of a visible professional life to once again leave the familiar in order to be blessed with something better.&nbsp; The ensuing three years on this campus changed our lives in ways we never could have imaged.&nbsp; We learned then, and we continue to realize, that when we rise to the calls the Lord presents to us, He blesses us in ways that are powerful and permanent.<br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let us review what we first shared about rising to the calls we receive in life.&nbsp; Whenever we are given a calling from the Lord, we must first look up and accept the call.&nbsp; Sometimes this means raising our gaze so we can see the great work the Lord has waiting for us.&nbsp; In looking up, we also must then let go of the things that would hold us back.&nbsp; For Matthew it was leaving his money, his career, and perhaps even some of his professional associations.&nbsp; For others it might be letting go of a nagging sin, personal pride, fear of failure, or any number of requisite sacrifices.&nbsp; Once we understand the call the Lord is extending and we are willing to leave behind those things that would hold us back, we must then seek for the enabling power that comes from the Lord to fulfill our callings.&nbsp; For President Gilbert, that power was manifest in the lives of the young men he served with in Boston.&nbsp; For me, it was the power to teach by the Spirit as a seminary teacher.&nbsp; Whatever your call, if it comes from the Lord, He will endow you with great power; but you must seek for that strength.&nbsp; Finally, when those gifts come, and they will come, it is critical that we recognize the source of that power and never claim it unto ourselves.<br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In closing we would like to briefly share with you some of the context of our most recent call.&nbsp; Three months ago I had just landed on a flight enroute to speak to a gathering of media executives.&nbsp; When I turned on my phone, it rang almost immediately with a call from the Office of the First Presidency.&nbsp; I was told President Uchtdorf would like to meet with me and my wife in his office.&nbsp; Having just landed, I asked if I should turn around and fly right back to Salt Lake City.&nbsp; Instead, the meeting was schedule for three days later.&nbsp; That meant we had three days to reflect on what the call might be.&nbsp; We initially thought the assignment would be to serve as a mission president.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we found out it was to return to BYU-Idaho, we were thrilled and overwhelmed all at once.&nbsp; While the visibility and expectations of this call are unique, we soon realized that the pattern of this assignment would be the same as so many other calls we had received throughout our lives.&nbsp; Like millions of others in this Church, ours was simply another call to "lift where [we] stand."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We would like to conclude our message with a challenge to all who are participating in this devotional.&nbsp; This semester, and in the coming years, you will receive calls from the Lord.&nbsp; He will ask you to be more than you are today&mdash;to look up and leave behind those things that would hold you back.&nbsp; One of those calls may come from your bishop this week. &nbsp;That call may be an assignment in your ward Relief Society, elders quorum, or home evening group.&nbsp; Other calls may come in more individual and personal ways.&nbsp; The Lord may extend them during a quiet moment in the temple, during a campus devotional, or while sitting in one of your classes.&nbsp; You may be called to invest more in your school work, to more fully live the Honor Code, to have the courage to interview for a leadership position on campus, to get married, or to simply reach out to a roommate and be a better friend.&nbsp; To look up and understand the impact of each of those calls, you may need to let go of an addiction, to change a pattern in your life, to overcome selfishness, or to confess a sin.&nbsp; You may need to let go of your own fears and insecurity and work harder with more hope in Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share with you a Twitter post from my first day as the president of BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;The post reads: "First day @BYUID. &nbsp;I will rise to the call by listening, learning, and seeking the Spirit #RisetotheCall." &nbsp;Sister Gilbert and I invite each of you to share with others how you will rise up to the calls in your life. &nbsp;Rise up and accept the call the Lord has for you and seek for His power in magnifying your assignments.&nbsp; When you are on His errand, He will make you mighty in His hands.<br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We would like to close with our testimonies of the gospel.&nbsp; Let me first say that I know that this is the restored gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth.&nbsp; I know that the Atonement of the Savior is real.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon is true. &nbsp;We are led today by a living prophet, President Thomas S.

<p>It is a joy to be here this afternoon, because it is always a joy to speak of the peaceable things of the kingdom<sup>1</sup>, to gather here in this remarkable center and share in spiritual witness of divine truths. I know that many of you have come having invested effort to study the scripture passages online. Others have come with a prayer in your heart and intent both to hear and to hearken (they are different) to the words the Holy Ghost will speak to your heart. My intent is to honor that preparation and allow the Holy Ghost to speak through my words the thing that you and I will need most. I pray that the Spirit will open our hearts to receive that message, which I am fully aware may not include my words.&nbsp;This university has been rightly labeled a disciple preparation center. Elder David A. Bednar assigned that designation when the ground was broken for this very building.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You and I are both here to practice becoming better disciples of Jesus Christ. We gather weekly at devotional so that we may incrementally and systematically add to our testimony and ability to learn of the Lord, to exercise faith in Him and His atonement. Most of us will need that strengthening influence sooner rather than later. It is therefore critical that we gather often to help strengthen one another. At the beginning of the semester, it is easy to imagine that our time of testing will come much later, when we have studied and prepared and become as competent as we can be after long exposure to the specified curriculum. You know as well as I that these are artificial constructs. God's eternal curriculum does not demand that we pass some summative assessment all at once. The purpose of this life is not to cram for a great cosmic final. Instead, prophets have declared that our progress through the journey of life is intentionally formative: line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>That too, is why we are gathered here today, because we want to be a little better than we were yesterday.<br /><br />I want to speak of an aspect of that process a little today. I will do so using the context of one opportunity that has become a formative experience in my life. It is not the most pivotal experience, but as I suggested, it has added here a little, there a little. It will serve as a suitable model for our inquiry today and may be of interest to you.<br /><br />In 2012, after a series of auditions, I was selected to participate in the production of the Life Of Jesus Christ Bible Video Series produced by the Church.&nbsp; I played the role of Nicodemus and appeared in three short segments of that significant body of work. The longest of these segments illustrates the nighttime visit of Nicodemus to the Savior, which will provide the context for the majority of our discussion.</p>
<p>John records this intimate interview in chapter 3:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>For some reason, now lost to time, Nicodemus came to the Savior at night. The biblical record seems to imply that Nicodemus came alone, and thus he had a rare occasion to speak face to face with the Lord. Many have speculated that because he was "of the Pharisees" and a "leader of the Jews" his visit involved great personal risk. Whether Nicodemus came of his own volition, or at the admonition of others, the Lord perceived this interaction as an opportunity to share some of the most profound and deeply personal details of his ministry with this man. Thankfully someone recorded it, because I feel a great privilege to have been involved in a portrayal of what I feel is the central theme of the New Testament. For in this scene Jesus teaches Nicodemus that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." He taught that the son came into the world, not in condemnation of the world, but rather "that the world through him might be saved."</p>
<p>Important to our discussion, he taught Nicodemus that we must be born again if we wish to return to live with God. These marvelous teachings caused Nicodemus to wonder, "How can these things be?"<br /><br />It's a great and potent question. One that each of us much honestly consider as we seek spiritual rebirth. Like most of you I have been blessed by the covenant of baptism. The birth by water is already in the past for you and for me. But the rebirth of spirit is an ongoing journey whose fruition surely lies somewhere in the future. Regarding spiritual rebirth, with Nicodemus, I honestly wonder, "How can these things be?"<br /><br />As an actor, as I pondered over why Nicodemus visited the Savior at night, I thought that there were more possibilities dramatically if Nicodemus came with courage and with the potential for change, rather than as some speculate, so that he wouldn't be seen. So I decided to add a layer of courage. I mean courage distinguished from bravery. Sure there was great personal risk for Nicodemus, but there was substantial spiritual risk as well. Some of you may be aware of the etymology of the word "courage." It comes to English via French and has Latin roots. In its basic sense it reflects the "true story" of one's " heart." So courage isn't really about bravery so much as honesty. The scriptures use other terms to reflect this type of courage: "acting no hypocrisy," with "real intent,"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;with "full purpose of heart,"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;with "sincerity"<sup>7</sup>or "without guile."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The Savior introduced another aspect of this honest heart: He declared, "... And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost" (3 Nephi 9:20). It is not only that we have honesty in our heart, but that heart must also be broken, supple, and receptive. It requires that we make not a physical, but a spiritual change. But how can these things be?</p>
<p>As humans we typically perceive change as a threat rather than an opportunity. All of us are carnal, or mortal, because of the fall of Adam and Eve. It is our human nature to be influenced by the passions, desires, appetites, and senses of the flesh rather than by the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Such a person can comprehend physical things but not spiritual things. Every person must be born again through the atonement of Jesus Christ in order to interrupt this natural tendency. For as King Benjamin taught, "the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord" (Mosiah 3:19).King Benjamin adds his voice&mdash;We must be changed from one state to another, but "how can these things be?"<br /><br />The journey to discovering the answer to the question, "how can these things be?" seems to begin with a broken heart and a contrite spirit: A state we might describe as spiritual vulnerability. Such vulnerability is necessarily difficult to accept. Most of us view vulnerability as an undesirable state. The natural man desires to control every aspect of his environment as much as possible. Indeed it is expressly against our human nature to seek out situations of vulnerability.<br /><br />Recall Adam's comment in the Garden of Eden: "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."(Gen. 3:10) Nakedness is used repeatedly in the scriptures as a symbol of vulnerability. In recognizing their nakedness, Adam and Eve simultaneously acknowledged their spiritual vulnerability: their need for help. It is perfectly natural to be afraid of vulnerability. One of the most common nightmares involves us showing up to a public event without any clothes on. Right? So our subconscious brain is worried about this too. And yet the scriptures reveal that this is a critical state for us to arrive at. Like Adam and Eve, we must acknowledge our naked vulnerability before God: our need for the Atonement in our lives.<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The opposite of spiritual vulnerability is spiritual numbness. The natural man resists the embarrassing emotional toll of repenting of his sins and receiving grace; it seems like weakness or foolishness<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;to him. He attempts to numb his soul from debilitating embarrassment, shame and the suffering of wrongful doing by retreating from the light of the gospel. But human beings can't numb emotions selectively. Retreating from the sorrows of weakness and hardship functions like a general anesthetic; when we try to anesthetize one emotion we end up dulling them all. This is one tragic outcome from covering our sins.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We may temporarily rid ourselves of discomfort, but we also become jaded and numb to our worth, love, gratitude and belonging. The natural man feels that perhaps he must be fully converted before he can embrace a truth, make a covenant or serve someone. He may feel that it is hypocritical to practice a principle that he does not fully understand or cannot fully live yet. He fears judgment or ridicule or rejection when expressing shortcomings and faults. This why the natural man is an enemy to God, because he is reluctant to repent and spends time being only casually rather than anxiously engaged in his spiritual rebirth. The scriptures are filled with numerous examples of individuals who felt the same way, and they may not be whom you expect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. In her vulnerability, Mary worried about the "low estate of [a] handmaiden" (Luke 1:48) when the angel told her of her divine role as the earthly mother of Jesus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Enoch feared the wrath of the people as he was called to preach, noting, "[I] am but a lad, and all the people hate me" (Moses 6:31).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. The Prophet Joseph confessed that after his first vision, he "fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature...offensive in the sight of God" (JSH 1:28).</p>
<p>Just like these individuals, we may fear that spiritual vulnerability will expose our inadequacy, or expose us to fear and contempt, pain and worry. But in a divine paradox, spiritual vulnerability is actually the seed of joy, of creativity, of connectivity with others, of forgiveness and belonging and of divine worth and love. These feelings come as enticings of the Holy Spirit. The enticings of the Holy Spirit must have been convincing for Mary. In spite of her insecurities, Mary humbly offered, "behold the handmaid of the Lord," and later acknowledged that, "henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name."</p>
<p>The enticement of the Holy Ghost gave Enoch confidence to declare God's will to the people. Instead of hating him, they flocked to hear him.<br /><br />And the Holy Spirit surely comforted young Joseph's spirit when he received the assurance that, "God had a work for [him] to do". In each of these situations, the humble overcame the fear of spiritual vulnerability yielded to the enticings of the Holy Spirit. The outcome of their spiritual vulnerability was not scorn or judgment, for as Nicodemus learned, "God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world." Spiritual vulnerability is not weakness but rather connects us with the Atonement of Christ that "the world through him might be saved." The Atonement of Jesus Christ applies to these experiences because it applies to all of life.Spiritual vulnerability is at the very root of our ability to yield to the "enticings of the Holy Spirit."&nbsp; This puts us well on our way to a spiritual rebirth. Like Nicodemus, there are great personal risks for you and me when we fully commit to a spiritual rebirth. And there are great spiritual fruits in store when you and I put off the natural man and yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;As the savior taught, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is sprit....</p>
<p>There are distinct fruits of spiritual vulnerability. These may include:</p>
<p>How can these things be in your life and mine? I will suggest a few things we could do today to increase our spiritual vulnerability.</p>
<p>We need regular communion with God by studying his word and communicating in prayer. We need to go often to the house of the lord to worship and ponder his word. We can serve him and his children through missionary work and temple and family history work and other acts of honest service and compassion. The more frequent our communication with Him, and importantly His communication with us, the more apt we are to perceive and to receive his will. The reason these "Sunday School answers" are so critical to our souls is simply because they allow us to feel the Holy Spirit and tap into the refining grace of the Atonement. As Alma taught, these experiences will cause our, "souls [to] expand." (Alma 5:9) When we pray with real intent, we acknowledge that we are not only desirous of an answer to the prayer, but also willing to act on the received answer. This requires that we follow the Savior's perfect example and in spiritual vulnerability learn to relinquish our own will that His might be done.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We also commune with Him by regularly partaking of the sacrament to refresh our baptismal and other covenants and allow them to refresh us. If you have not felt the sweet refreshment of the sacrament recently, may I suggest this simple effort to increase your spiritual vulnerability during that ordinance? As you listen to the priesthood brother utter the prayer this Sunday, in your mind try substituting the third person pronouns "they" and "them" with first person pronouns "I" and "me" and "my." Your heartfelt prayer may sound something like this: "O God, the Eternal Father, [I] ask thee, in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this water to [my soul] [as I] drink of it, that [I] may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for [me]; that [I] may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that [I] do always remember him, that [I] may have his Spirit to be with [me]."<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Such a heartfelt prayer might make you more susceptible to the enticings of the Holy Spirit. Let this and other ordinances lead you to spiritual rebirth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Be fully present.</p>
<p>We cannot serve others, as God would have us do,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;unless we allow them into our hearts and have compassion on them. It is difficult to be fully vulnerable and susceptible to the Holy Ghost if we are not fully present in the current moment. There is something we can do. We can cultivate the desire to set aside distractions while we seek His influence. Plan specific time in your day to commune fully with Heavenly Father, free from electronic or social distraction. Try to be fully present in class and in conversation with family and friends. Constantly glancing at your screen will disconnect the subtle feelings of compassion and respect for others. Speeding through the day on autopilot will earn you only oblivion to the needs of those around you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we rush through our worship, we leave no time to measure its impact on us. We may find ourselves in that woeful state that Elder Wilford W. Anderson described in General Conference where we "learn the dance steps without learning to hear and to feel the beautiful music of the gospel."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Be fully present in the current moment, and you will be surprised at how full moments can be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Have courage to be imperfect.</p>
<p>Let go of a need to present yourself as who you think you should be, and focus on who you really are trying to become. Having courage to be imperfect means that it's okay to ask for help. We embrace vulnerability when we graciously accept our imperfection and weakness and receive help from neighbors and friends, from family members and ward members, and from the Lord's authorized servants. Whether they bring us cupcakes or invitations to repent, we can welcome them with a broken, receptive heart and a contrite spirit. Vulnerability embraces the inevitability of imperfection.</p>
<p>Until we own our weaknesses, they can never become strengths. Have compassion to treat yourself and others with kindness and worth. Honestly do what you can and rely consistently on the merits of Jesus. Remember, His grace is sufficient for all who will humble themselves. Elder Bruce C Hafen wrote,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Mercy and repentance are rehabilitative, not retributive. The Savior asks us to repent not just to repay him for paying our debt to justice, but also to induce us to undergo the personal development that will purify our very nature. The "natural man" will remain an enemy to God forever&mdash;even after paying for his own sins&mdash;unless he also "becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord." (Mosiah 3:19.)<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Spiritual vulnerability prompts us to repent willfully and often. Because the Atonement of Jesus Christ is infinite in its scope, reach and compassion,<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;we can cast aside any doubt that the depth of our sin or the breadth of our separation from God makes it impossible to return to Him. We can return; we can be forgiven. We can recapture the joy and hope lost through willful or unintentional disobedience or negligence. How can these things be? By yielding to the "enticings of the Holy Spirit" and becoming "a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord." As Moroni wrote, "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him...his grace [is] sufficient for you" (Moroni 10:32). &nbsp;We must confess that we are imperfect and that we will accept His divine help so that we may become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord."</p>
<p>The Lord taught early Latter-day Saints in D&amp;C 97:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice&mdash;yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command&mdash;they are accepted of me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit" (D&amp;C 97:8, 9).</p>
<p>That sounds like a delightful rebirth to me. And it reemphasizes the important tenet that Jesus taught to Nicodemus, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. There is much personal work that you and I must do to answer Nicodemus' question, "How can these things be?" We will do so incrementally, line upon line. We can begin today. Each of us can ask Heavenly Father today for strength to become more spiritually vulnerable. We can ask how He would have each of us be reborn for this day. Pray with real intent and I promise he will answer that prayer.</p>
<p>The truths expressed in that short interview in Jerusalem 2000 years ago are still true. God still "so love[s] the world" He loves you and he loves me, because he is our Father. He wants us to return to Him so much "that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." May we find the path to spiritual rebirth and vulnerability through Him that we may obtain this promise, I earnestly pray in the name of him who died that we might be born again, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My dad and I were painting back bedrooms in our house when I was 16 years old. It was a hot dry dusty summer Utah day. My mom and sister were shopping and our dogs were outside roaming the forest behind our house. Our back yard bordered the forest service so we had a mountain and the forest as our backyard. When we let the dogs outside, we normally left the backdoor open so they could come in whenever they felt like it.</p>
<p>My dad became thirsty, so he decided to get something to drink from the kitchen. Within a couple of seconds after he left me, he started yelling and shouting. Now my Dad was a very calm man. He rarely lost his temper and he never raised his voice, but he was quite excited about something and was yelling for me to come here.<br /><br />I walked to the hallway outside of our dining room and saw my dad pointing in the corner of the room. I stepped into the dining room and looked in the corner to see what he was pointing at. There was a rather large snake - about 3'-4' long and about as big around as the largest part of my forearm -- in the corner. The snake had crawled in the backdoor we had left open for the dogs.<br /><br />My dad and I were not really sure what kind of snake it was. Rattlers are bad and gopher snakes are pretty harmless, but they look very similar and this snake could have been either. Well, we were not going to take any chances, so my dad went down to the garage and found a couple of six foot long boards. The plan was that I would push the snake with my board towards the backdoor and once the snake was by the door my dad would push it outside. Only problem was, the snake did not want to go back outside. It coiled up in the corner, raised it rattles in the air, and began to strike at our sticks.<br /><br />When those rattles started shaking, my dad jumped back and said 'Hot darn, it is a rattle snake," almost like he was happy and excited to see a rattler in our dining room. And yes, he really said "Hot darn" - I'm not editing.<br /><br />Our life is like a house, it's built on sand or on stone, a holy temple or an unholy temple. If we leave the wrong door open, and the snake of sin enters our life, we make our self a place where the Spirit can not dwell,<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;where Jesus can not come.<br /><br />The Lord knows you, He loves you, and wants to be part of your life in a very personal way. He is always at the front door knocking, but sometimes we can't hear because we are dealing with a snake in our dining room. Maybe we are uncomfortable inviting a heavenly guest into our house because of our not so friendly snake.<br /><br />What do we say to a guest who's come over for dinner and we have a snake in our dining room? "Oh hey, come on in. Glad you could come over for dinner. Don't mind the snake in the dining room. Just keep your feet up and he probably won't bother you."<br /><br />After we made a few attempts to move that snake towards the back door, it became really mad and started lunging at us. One time it lunged at my dad with full force. Its body went completely straight in the blink of an eye. You can imagine the adrenaline that would rush through your veins if a rattle snake moved 3'-4' towards you faster than you could blink.<br /><br />My dad jumped back and he smacked that rattler on the head with his board. Then, he pulled back the board with a backswing that would have made Tiger Woods envious, and with a perfect 300 yard forward swing he launched the snake out the door - and, no divot in the carpet.<br /><br />Once a snake enters your dining room, it may be hard to get it out. You may need help from a parent, a spouse or a Bishop. But getting it out is worth it. The joy that will fill your soul will exceed your pain.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;It is better to be obedient, leave the backdoor shut, and have your house ready at all times, but repentance is a way to cleanse your house, if necessary.<br /><br />Jesus said "I stand at the door, and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Because He loves us, knows us, and wants to be part of our life, He is at our front door already and we need to prepare your house through obedience and repentance to accept him. Once we have cleaned our house and are prepared to receive the Lord, we must hear His voice and knocking at the door. I testify that we hear His voice at the door when we faithfully study the word of God. Let me illustrate.<br /><br />Paul McCauley was a happy devoted member of the Baptist church in the late 1960s. He loved his family and he worked hard to provide for them. He understood the value of spending quality time together as a family, so one year they took a long family vacation, in their station wagon, from the East to the West and back East again.<br /><br />It was a foggy day when they arrived in Manti Utah on their way to Bryce Canyon and Arches. Paul said they came into town and there was a fog low to the ground. Because it was low to the ground, He saw what looked like a castle floating on a cloud. The Manti temple would look like it was floating because it sits on a hill and was above the fog.<br /><br />He decided he needed stop and take a closer look at this floating Mormon castle, which he knew was a Mormon Temple because of all the road signs. He parked his car in the temple parking lot and headed towards the backdoor of the Temple in shorts and a pack of cigarettes rolled up in the sleeve of his tee-shirt. He said he headed to the backdoor, the wrong door, because he figured missionaries would try to snag his name at the front door - and if missionaries got hold of his name and address they'd never leave him alone.<br /><br />There was a nice grounds keeper who saw Paul headed to the back door of the temple and said, "You are not a member, are you?"<br /><br />The grounds keeper did his best to explain to Paul why he and his family could not tour the inside of the temple and he showed Paul to the visitor center.</p>
<p>Paul was just curious enough to know more that he went into the visitor center to see what he could find out about the church. At one point of the tour, he found himself in a small theater watching Man's Search for Happiness. So many of his questions were answered by just that one movie, and, maybe more importantly, he felt something powerful. So, Paul filled out a referral card, at the insistence of his wife, in spite of the fact that he did not really want missionaries knocking on his door.</p>
<p>A year passed after the McCauley's came home from their vacation and no missionaries showed up at their home. Paul had pretty much forgotten about Mormons. But, one night he came home a bit tipsy from the drink, and did something he'd done for most of his life before going to bed. He sat down, grabbed his scriptures, let them fall open to a page, and read on that page. On that night he said something remarkable happened. He said he clearly remembers the scriptures speaking to him, they said: "Paul, you are a drunken disciple." The message was clear, Paul knew he needed to get his life in order. He asked his sweet wife to "Call the Mormon missionaries" and two sister missionaries showed up knocking at the front door the next day.<br /><br />One thing led to another, and the McCauleys were baptized members of the Church. The Lord knew the McCauleys and He loved them. Paul heard the voice of the Lord at the front door as he studied the word of God. And when we immerse ourselves "in the scriptures regularly and consistently...testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;We will hear the Lord's voice and knocking at the front door.<br /><br />Remember, the Lord said "I stand at the door, and knock: if any man&nbsp;<em>hear</em>&nbsp;my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him..."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;We must hear and heed his voice and I testify that we hear his voice at the door and hear him knocking when we study the word of God.<br /><br />I'm grateful Paul heard the voice of the Lord (and the Sister missionaries) at the front door as he read the scriptures because he started something that day that would have eternal consequences. In my case, Nancy McCauley, his daughter, became my best friend and we entered the front door of the Washington, D.C. temple to become eternal companions.<br /><br />Through study of his word, we have heard his voice at the front door. Through obedience and repentance, we have prepared our house to receive him.<br /><br />Notice that the Lord said,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He stands at the door, and He knocks. He tells us that&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;must to hear Him and&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;must open the door&mdash;hearing and opening are&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;responsibility. So how do we open the door? Prayer is how we open the front door to let him in. Let me explain.<br /><br />In September of 2002, I had the privilege of eating lunch with the magnificent and happy Elder Perry - sat right next to him and chatted all through lunch. When I got home that night, I shared my experience with Sister Sessions.&nbsp;<br /><br />She gasped because she really wanted to meet Elder Perry. He is one of her favorite apostles - she appreciates his persistent smile and positive attitude. With Elder Perry, you can tell that "when Jesus shows his smiling face, there is sunshine in the soul!"<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Later that month after I met Elder Perry, Sister Sessions and I went to General Conference in Salt Lake. I had arranged to meet with Elder Condie of the seventy while we were in Salt Lake because Elder Condie was going to preside at our Stake Conference in a few weeks. He wanted to meet with me to discuss the needs of our stake and agendas for the various meetings we were going to have.<br /><br />I knew Elder Condie's office was located in the same building where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve were located. For a couple of weeks prior to our visit to Salt Lake I prayed and asked Heavenly Father to bless Sister Sessions that she might meet and shake the hand of one of the Apostles, maybe even Elder Perry, while I met with Elder Condie.<br /><br />When we arrived at Elder Condie's office, we found it was right next to the office of one of the Apostles. I went in and met with Elder Condie and Sister Sessions sat in a chair outside the door of the Apostle's office - and that apostle was in his office. I knew my prayer would be answered and she would meet an Apostle. When I came out of Elder Condie's office, Sister Sessions and I started to head for the front door, and I asked if she had met the Apostle.<br /><br />She said "No," he got a phone call right after we arrived and he closed the door to his office. He only reopened the door a couple minutes before I finished my meeting, but he never came out of his office so she never met him.<br /><br />As we walked towards the front door, my heart sank that she had not met one of the Apostles. I wanted so much for her to have a sweet experience shaking the hand and saying hello to one of those great men. As I put my hand on the door to open it and leave the building, I still had a prayer in my heart that she would meet someone, and an office door to our right opened and several brethren stepped out. One of the brethren walked directly towards us and we paused for a moment realizing the person walking our direction was James E. Faust, counselor in the First Presidency.<br /><br />We were the only people there and it suddenly seemed very quiet. President Faust shook Sister Sessions hand and spoke sweetly and gently to her. He then shook my hand, asked my name, and where we were from. But then he didn't let go of my hand. He moved closer and looked into my eyes. He didn't say a word, just held his eyes on mine. After what seemed like a long time, I said a very short prayer and asked "what is going on here?" The prayer in my heart opened the front door to heaven and the Spirit said very plainly, "you are having your PPI."<br /><br />Well, you can imagine how I felt at that moment. Emotions welled up inside of me and tears filled my eyes. I was just about to melt when President Faust let go of my hand, patted me on the shoulder and said, "you'll be fine." Then, he walked away leaving me speechless.<br /><br />It wasn't the kind of experience that was going to save our souls or change our testimonies, but we knew Heavenly Father knew us intimately and loved us perfectly. He wanted to come into our house in a very personal way.<br /><br />Think how amazing prayer really is - Prayer provides you and me with an opportunity to have a two-way communication with the most loving, knowledgeable, wise, merciful being in the entire universe. We can express our concerns and joys to him. He shares insights and guidance with us. He looks into our eyes and sees us for who we are - and then blesses us - sometimes with a simple statement of counsel, such as, "you are having your PPI," or with words of comfort like "you'll be fine."<br /><br />Like the primary song says, "Heavenly Father, are you really there? And do you hear and answer every child's prayer? Some say that heaven is far away, but I feel it close around me as I pray."<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>At the next General Conference, President Faust spoke directly to Sister Sessions and I in his talk.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I know some of you have had similar experiences in the past. Now she and I know he spoke to all Saints world-wide, but it was as if he'd peered into our deepest concerns about our family and spoke, no, spoke is the wrong word, it was more like he prayed for us and our family for 20 minutes. Prayer for our family had opened the front door to heaven and Heavenly Father spoke to us through one of His divinely appointed servants.</p>
<p>Oh, just a minute, my smart phone must have been listening to me. It sent me a message - these smart phones are just too smart. The message reads, "but aren't I the modern day equivalent to the ball of curious workmanship? Don't people stare into their phone, even while walking, hoping it will point the way they should go?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Silly phone, I have to call you to repentance. You are so prideful. When Lehi came out of his tent, he didn't find a cell phone or a tablet. You are not our Liahona-in-a-box. Our Liahona is found in the words of God and in the promptings of the Spirit.<br /><br />Better make sure you are turned off...<br /><br />Through studying the word of God we hear his voice at the door, like Paul McCauley did. Obedience and repentance prepares us to receive him by cleaning our house&mdash;we don't want any snakes in the dining room. And prayer opens the door so He can come in and converse with us. Once our guest is inside, we want to sit together at the dining room table and serve Him a meal. We serve the Savior when we serve others. "When we offer succor to anyone, the Savior feels it as if we reached out to succor Him."<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>One of our sons served in the military and was called to serve overseas. He had not been overseas very long when we received a phone call that he'd been seriously wounded.<br /><br />Nancy and I met our son at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital a couple of days after we received the phone call&mdash;those were long days and nights we waited. When we met him, he was pretty busted up.<br /><br />Following his fifth surgery in less than 3 days, he was in excruciating pain. The pain would come in great waves and then it would subside for a moment. It was terrible to hear him moan and scream in pain. He held his mom's little hand and I could see her tender fingers turn white when his grip tightened as the pain grew.<br /><br />It was absolute chaos in his room. Doctors and nurses were running in and out. They gave him various medications and increased dosages, but nothing worked. After about 10 minutes of frantic activity at his bedside, the doctors decided to consult in the hallway. When they left, my son looked at me and said, "Dad, I need a blessing." The time for preparation was past. There was no time to fast or repent or get a snake out of my dining room. There was no time to figure out how to get in tune with the Spirit. I was the person&mdash;now was time.<br /><br />The blessing was among the shortest that has ever crossed my lips. He was told that he would be able to withstand the pain until the doctors determined how to properly treat him.<br /><br />He instantly relaxed and became calm. His entire facial expression changed. In less than a minute, the doctors came back into the room from the hallway. One doctor asked him, "what is different? Something has changed and everything seems to be better." My son looked at him calmly and said, "I can't explain it to you in a way that you would understand. The pain is just as bad as it was before, but somehow I am able to withstand it now."<br /><br />The doctors wheeled him out of the room to another surgery room to see if they could figure out what was wrong. As he was being wheeled out, he looked at me and said, "Dad, it was the priesthood." Over the next hour, the doctors determined the shunt they had put in to deliver pain medicine was in the wrong place so it wasn't working and they were able to move it and relieve his pain.<br /><br />How will we come to know the Savior as He is<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;if we do not strive to walk in His shoes?<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;It's one thing to read about riding a bike, but you won't know what riding a bike is really like if you do not ride it yourself. It is one thing to read about the Savior praying for and ministering to the sick and afflicted, it is another thing entirely to pray for and administer to the sick and afflicted. We must&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;His work to&nbsp;<em>become</em>&nbsp;as He is.<br /><br />While my role of service in capacity as a priesthood holder provided my son with much needed relief, and we all experienced the power of the God that day, Nancy lived at Walter Reed with my son for the next five months, and had the opportunity to serve him nearly every moment of every day that she was with him. He couldn't walk or do many of the things he'd grown accustomed to doing for himself. She was his legs and, in many cases, his brains, advocate, paper filler outer, food getter, and a host of other things. It was hard for her. She was away from her other family members, her home, and friends. She had to witness on a daily basis the most terrible consequences war could inflict on the human body and mind with not only our son but many many men and woman. There were times she put our son to bed and go eat in the cafeteria by herself, but she was not alone&mdash;the Lord knew her personally, He loved her perfectly, and He supped with her and blessed her. She supped with the Lord by serving Him a meal, because His meal is served when we serve others.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<sup>13</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The gospel challenges us to grow beyond a testimony of what we&nbsp;<em>know</em>, by&nbsp;<em>doing</em>&nbsp;His work so that we&nbsp;<em>become</em>&nbsp;even as He is.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Nancy grew and was strengthened with a gift of Christ-like love, even for the enemies that tried to kill our son - she came to understand that all are children of God.</p>
<p>Nancy and my son experienced God's love through service. She changed and became more God-like because God-like love dwelled in her, and because that love dwelled in her, God dwelled in her. "God&nbsp;is&nbsp;love; and he that dwelleth in&nbsp;love dwelleth in&nbsp;God, and&nbsp;God&nbsp;in him."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;God comes in and sups with those who serve others and he fills them with His love.</p>
<p>I have heard and read the brethren repeat so many times these four small and simple things<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I have shared with you - they are:</p>
<p>Read your scriptures, say your prayers, be obedient, and serve one another.<br /><br />I have planted these four seeds in the garden of my heart<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;and can testify that these are the straight and narrow path that lead to the tree of life. They are the blueprint to build spirituality, the way to hear the Lord at the door, to welcome Him in to sup with you. Doing these four small and simple things allow us to know Him as He is.<br /><br />Jesus Christ lives. He knows you intimately, loves you perfectly, and wants to be a personal part of your life - let Him in, and He will sup with you. To this I testify, In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>It is a real pleasure for me to be with you today in this devotional.&nbsp; This university has always been special to me because my wife graduated from here when it was still Ricks College. &nbsp;She was a math major and a member of the international folk dancers.&nbsp; She continued her studies at BYU and continued with her dancing.&nbsp; Then she married me, and I am not a dancer of any kind.&nbsp; But she has a very compassionate heart and has stayed with me anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Each one of us is the product of a wide variety of influences in our lives and I have had the blessing of having as my wife and eternal companion, a wonderful daughter of God who has been, without question, the greatest influence in my life.&nbsp; She was born in Sugar City just four miles north of here.<br /><br />She has followed me from country to country throughout Latin America, has lived some 31 years of our 45 years together, far from her native country and family, and in countries that do not speak her native tongue.&nbsp; During all of that, she raised six wonderful children and is now the grandmother of 24 grandchildren, the eldest of which is now serving a full-time mission.&nbsp; She told me the other day that she has survived 18 international moves and moved into and out of something like 26 different homes.&nbsp; It seems to me, President Gilbert, that there must be some kind of university degree that she has earned through all of that.<br /><br />I once asked her this question, and I would counsel you to&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>&nbsp;ask your spouse a similar question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you had known what you now know and having lived as we have lived, would you have said yes when I asked you to marry me?"</p>
<p>I really expected and even anticipated a very quick and very enthusiastic, "yes, of course I would have".&nbsp; Instead, she waited far too long to answer...and I was rapidly thinking of how I could retract the question...but before I could, she replied:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I would have thought about your proposal of marriage much longer before I responded...but...yes...I&nbsp;<strong>think</strong>&nbsp;that I would still have said yes."</p>
<p>I earnestly pray and invite your prayers to the end that the Holy Ghost will be with us today as we discuss eternal principles than can, and should, change our lives.&nbsp; I do not pretend to be the possessor and/or conveyor of great and hidden truths; rather I will be discussing some basic truths that you will have heard many times before.&nbsp; But, the Holy Ghost knows each one of us and will teach us according to our individual needs.&nbsp; Indeed, he is the real teacher.&nbsp; But, we have to invite him to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why there are so many scriptural references that include, in one way or another, the invitation to "ask", to "seek" and to "knock." &nbsp;To those who "ask," the Lord promises that they will receive.&nbsp; To those who "knock," the door will be opened and to those who "seek," they shall find.<br /><br />You have been asked to read and ponder several scriptural references in preparation for this devotional.&nbsp; I will not offend or embarrass you by asking if you did or did not.&nbsp; I will simply state that those who did, will gain greater insights into those scriptures than those who did not.<br /><br />You will recall from your readings of the Book of Mormon, that Lehi and his family awoke one morning and found a "round ball of curious workmanship and of fine brass" on the ground.&nbsp; It had two spindles and "the one pointed the way whither they should go."<br /><br />You will further recall that it worked according to their faith and diligence.&nbsp; If they were slothful and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence, then it ceased to work and they did not progress in their journey.<br /><br />The Liahona also provided them a new writing which gave them understanding concerning the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; These writings were changed, from time to time, according to their faith and diligence which were given to these writings.<br /><br />Now, you will recall that they already had the Brass Plates which contained the writings of the prophets of the Old Testament.&nbsp; Together with the writings on the Liahona, these were their scriptures and they were expected to study and give heed to them continually.&nbsp; As they did so, they progressed in their journey and if they did not, they tarried in the wilderness and were afflicted with hunger and thirst.<br /><br />The question that I would like you to consider is this, what was the Lord trying to teach them, and us, through the workings of the Liahona?<br /><br />As you consider that question, I would remind you of the one and only purpose that the Lord has, and He has none other.&nbsp; As He, Himself declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>For behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."</em></p>
<p><em></em>To the end of bringing as many of His children home to Him as possible, He sent His Son, Jesus the Christ, to not only provide the way for our return, but also to be the example that we should follow.</p>
<p>Jesus asked this of his disciples:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Then, He answered His own question by stating:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Verily I say unto you, even as I am."</em></p>
<p><em></em>So, in response to the question that I asked, the Lord was teaching the family of Lehi, and us, that the primary purpose of the Liahona and the scriptures is to help us know, understand, and become as the Savior is.&nbsp; Studying the scriptures continually helps us keep our eyes, our minds and our hearts focused on the Savior, and as we apply and live the teachings found in the scriptures, we become more like Him.&nbsp; As we become more like Him, we become candidates for eternal life.&nbsp; He so declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."</em></p>
<p><em></em>Now, I would like to discuss with you a vision or dream given to a prophet of the Lord.&nbsp; I refer to Lehi's Dream that is usually entitled the "Tree of Life."</p>
<p>This was a part of your study assignment for this devotional, so I will refer only to certain parts of what Lehi and Nephi saw and their interpretations of the same.<br /><br />You will remember that there were four groups of people represented in the vision or dream.&nbsp; The first three groups entered the path that led to the Tree of Life.&nbsp; You will also remember that the gate to the path is baptism, as stated by Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water;...and then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life;"</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we are talking about members of the Church in these first three groups.&nbsp; Let's review each of them.&nbsp; I will not take time to discuss the fourth group, as they are those that rejected the invitation to be baptized and entered the great and spacious building.&nbsp; However, as we consider the other three groups, you might want to do your own internal evaluation to determine the group to which you currently belong, and ask yourself to which group you would prefer to belong.</p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; line-height: inherit;">Group 1:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; line-height: inherit;"></strong>"<em>And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I stood.&nbsp; And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree.&nbsp; And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Please note that there is no mention of the Rod of Iron in these verses.&nbsp; From that, we can assume that these members of the Church did not grasp hold of the Rod of Iron.&nbsp; Remember, the Rod of Iron represents the Word of God, or scriptures.</p>
<p>Members of this group apparently did not read or study the scriptures, did not listen to general conference, read the Ensign or attend their Sunday meetings, all of which represent the Word of God, or the Rod of Iron. Consequently, they lost their way, wandered off and were lost.</p>
<p><strong>Group 2:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>"<em>And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.&nbsp; And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed...and after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost."</em></p>
<p><em></em>Please note that this group clung to the Rod of Iron.&nbsp; They reached the Tree of Life and partook of its fruit.&nbsp; Then they got distracted by the enticements of the world, became ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, stopped focusing on Him and focused instead on the attractions, temptations, and riches of the world.&nbsp; They then fell into forbidden paths and were lost.</p>
<p>The key to understanding these verses is the phrase, "clinging to the Rod of Iron".&nbsp; Why were they lost if they were clinging to the Rod of Iron?&nbsp; I would compare the word "clinging" to a "white knuckle" experience.&nbsp; Many of you have had such experiences.&nbsp; If any of you have been white water rafting, you will recall how you clung to the side of the raft.&nbsp; You clung so hard that your knuckles turned white. Then, when you came to calm waters, what happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You let go!</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>That can be compared to a practice not uncommon in a university setting.&nbsp; It is called "cramming" like just before mid-terms or finals.&nbsp; Instead of focusing on your studies all semester long, you try to memorize in a few hours or days what you neglected to learn, through consistent study, in the weeks and months before.&nbsp; In the gospel context, "scripture cramming" can occur when asked to prepare a talk for sacrament meeting, or when faced with a crisis in life such as a death in the family, a break-up of a relationship, or a new calling about which you know nothing.&nbsp; So you cram.&nbsp; You look up talks you seldom listened to or scriptures you were negligent in reading. &nbsp;You seek the spiritual guidance and support from others because of your own spiritual weakness.&nbsp; Then, when the immediate need or crisis is over,&nbsp;<strong>you let go</strong>! You put the scriptures back on the shelf where they were before, you regress to old habits of infrequent Church attendance, and you abandon daily scripture study and prayer, at least until the next crisis, or "white water" experience.&nbsp; Or, in other words, you turn to the Savior for help only when a desperate need arises, instead of continually.</p>
<p>The members of this group were baptized, many were probably ordained to the priesthood, received temple ordinances, perhaps even served full-time missions and were married and sealed in the temple.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;<strong>they let go</strong>!&nbsp; They stopped reading their scriptures daily,&nbsp;<strong>or continually</strong>, and fell into forbidden paths and were lost.<br /><br />This is much more common that you might think! &nbsp;For example, how many of you know a returned missionary who is now less active? What a tragedy! Why does it happen?&nbsp; For 18 or 24 months, the Lord teaches missionaries how to live the rest of their lives.&nbsp; They learn to study the scriptures each day with their companion and they pray constantly.&nbsp; Their focus is on the Lord continually.&nbsp; Then they come home.&nbsp; They get invited to dances and parties that end late at night (or early in the morning).&nbsp; The next morning, they are tired and get up just in time for class or work.&nbsp; What do they stop doing?&nbsp; They first stop reading the scriptures, then they stop praying, they stop focusing on the Savior and then they lose the spirit and fall into forbidden paths and become lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>They let go!</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Thankfully, most do not and they remain faithful to what they learned on their missions.&nbsp; Their lives are continually focused on the Savior through daily scripture study and prayer.&nbsp; We are so grateful for them and for their faithfulness.&nbsp; They are the future of the Church and the future parents of those who will carry the Church forward after you.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Group 3:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>"<em>...behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree...they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not."</em></p>
<p><em></em>Please note the phrase, "continually holding fast to the rod of iron."&nbsp; This group read the scriptures continually.&nbsp; They kept their focus on the Savior continually.&nbsp; Now, you may want to define the word "continually" differently, but I would suggest that it means just what it says.&nbsp; I would suggest that it means every day of your life!&nbsp; The scriptures are the most important thing that you can study.&nbsp; It should take precedence over chemistry, physics, accounting, dance, music, sports, or any other secular study or activity.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you start your day, every day, with the scriptures.&nbsp; I would suggest that prayer and studying the scriptures go hand in hand.&nbsp; They are inseparable companions.&nbsp; Constant prayer will lead you to the scriptures and continual scripture study will lead you to prayer.&nbsp; Both of them keep you focused on the Savior and give you access to revelation and to that peace that can only come by "<em>continually holding fast to the Rod of Iron.</em><strong>"</strong>&nbsp;It will make you better students, it will lead you to the temple, it will make you want to keep the Sabbath Day holy, it will help you avoid and overcome the temptations of the adversary.&nbsp; It will keep you focused on the Savior.<br /><br />Now, I would draw your attention to the phrase, "<em>they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.</em><strong>"</strong>&nbsp; I have asked many missionaries and young single adults what they think this phrase means.&nbsp; The most common answer is that "they were probably exhausted from the journey".&nbsp; I don't think that is it.&nbsp;<br /><br />The key to understanding this phrase is found in chapter 11 of First Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.&nbsp; And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.&nbsp; And he said unto me: What desirest thou? And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof.</em>"</p>
<p>The angel responded by saying, "Look." Then, Nephi saw in vision the Virgin Mary, whom the angel identified as the mother of the Son of God.&nbsp; He then saw Mary bearing a child in her arms and the angel then asked Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!</em><em>&nbsp;Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</em>"</p>
<p>Then, in verse 24, we find the clincher:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many&nbsp;<strong>fall</strong>&nbsp;<strong>down</strong>&nbsp;at his feet and worship him</em>."</p>
<p>The Tree is clearly a representation of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that those in Group 2 also arrived at the tree, but they did not fall down as did those in Group 3.&nbsp; The obvious question is, why not?&nbsp; How could they be in the very presence of the Son of God and not know it?&nbsp; Is it really possible to be in His presence and not recognize Him?</p>
<p>You only have to read the New Testament to find your answer to that question.&nbsp; He ministered for three years among the Jews, teaching and performing miracles, but few recognized Him for who He was.<br /><br />The questions that each of us must ask ourselves are, "what can I do to ensure that I am firmly entrenched in Group 3, holding fast to the Rod of Iron, so that when I arrive at the Tree of Life, or in the presence of the Savior, I will recognize Him and fall down at His feet and worship him?&nbsp; What can I do to keep my eyes, my mind and my heart focused on the Savior?&nbsp; What can I do to become more like Him?<br /><br />Again, the answer is found in the scriptures themselves:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."</em></p>
<p><em></em>On April 4, 1986, in connection with his first general conference as President of the Church, President Benson presided over a special meeting for priesthood leaders.&nbsp; As he concluded his address to them, he made this plea:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"I urge you to recommit yourselves to a study of the scriptures. Immerse yourselves in them&nbsp;<strong>daily</strong>&nbsp;so you will have the power of the Spirit to attend you in your callings. Read them in your families and teach your children to love and treasure them. Then prayerfully and in counsel with others, seek every way possible to encourage the members of the Church to follow your example. If you do so, you will find, as Alma did, that "the word [has] a great tendency to lead people to do that which [is] just&mdash;yea, it [has] more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which [has] happened unto them."</em></p>
<p><em></em>I add my own testimony to that of President Benson.&nbsp; I know that if you will immerse yourselves in the scriptures each day of your life, you will not only&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;fall into any serious transgression, but more importantly, you will come to know the Savior.&nbsp; You will be able to keep your eyes, your minds and your hearts focused on Him.&nbsp; As you come to know Him and apply His teachings and follow His example, you will become like Him.&nbsp; As you become like Him, you will be a candidate to live forever in His presence.</p>
<p>I testify that we are children of a loving Father in Heaven who desperately wants us to return to Him.&nbsp; I testify that Jesus is the Christ and has provided the only way for us to return home, and that is through His atonement.<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters. I pray that the Holy Ghost might allow our spirits to communicate one to another so that we both can receive light and truth from our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and feel of Their goodness and love.</p>
<p>In October 2005, President James E. Faust told the following story,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I recently recalled a historic meeting in Jerusalem about 17 years ago. It was regarding the lease for the land on which the Brigham Young University's Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies was later built. Before this lease could be signed, President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then president of Brigham Young University, agreed with the Israeli government on behalf of the Church and the university not to proselyte in Israel. You might wonder why we agreed not to proselyte. We were required to do so in order to get the building permit to build that magnificent building which stands in the historic city of Jerusalem. To our knowledge the Church and BYU have scrupulously and honorably kept that nonproselyting commitment. After the lease had been signed, one of our friends insightfully remarked, 'Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?' He was referring to our students who were studying in Israel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What was that light in their eyes which was so obvious to our friend? The Lord Himself gives the answer: 'And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.'<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Where did that light come from? Again the Lord gives the answer: 'I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.'<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord is the true light, 'and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.'<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;This light shows in our countenances as well as in our eyes."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>With this story in mind, I would like to read some counsel given to us by the Savior. This counsel is recorded in the fifth chapter of Matthew. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."</p>
<p><strong>What is this light which shineth?</strong></p>
<p>Elder Craig Christensen very clearly explains, "... when we talk about light, we are really talking about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Bible Dictionary adds this definition, "The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In other words, this light, which gives us enlightenment, knowledge and has the ability to uplift us, comes from Jesus Christ.<br /><br />We use the word light both to explain temporal and spiritual enlightenment or knowledge. Teachers talk about the moment when a student understands a concept as "a light turns on." It is that "aha moment," the moment you say to yourself or others, "I get it." Light and darkness are also used as metaphors to illustrate and teach many gospel concepts. We use the word light to explain the Plan of Salvation, revelations from God, the difference between Christ and Satan, right and wrong, truth and falsehood.<br /><br />Physical light has always fascinated me. I am drawn to light. When I consider all the beauties of this earth that Heavenly Father has created through his Son, Jesus Christ my heart swells with gratitude for the wonders and beauties around us. However, for me, all these creations are even more beautiful with the addition of light; the glow of the mountains at sunrise or sunset; light from the moon and stars that illuminate an otherwise dark sky, light breaking through the clouds after a storm is some of the most dramatic light, the light that shines through the droplets of water creating a rainbow lifts my spirit. Where there is light, there is life and hope.<br /><br />In contrast, the absence of light is darkness. Darkness feels lonely and cold. When I was a little boy, I was afraid of the dark. Fears and doubts seemed to overwhelm me in the darkness. Where there is light, doubt and fears are dispelled. I found that my eyes were always searching for a source of light, however small. That small glimmer of light could be coming from a night-light, a closet light, or a crack under the door.<br /><br />My brothers and sisters this is true with spiritual light as well. President Henry B. Eyring has stated, "You make choices every day and almost every hour that keep you walking in the light or moving away toward darkness."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;When we turn away from the light by the daily decisions that we make, we soon are surround by the mists of darkness. We can stumble, become lost, discouraged and disoriented. Always remember, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that light is Christ.<br /><br />In these times of darkness, perhaps we are like the apostle Thomas who asked the question, "How can we know the way?" The Savior answered Thomas' question by stating, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man&nbsp; cometh unto the Father, but by me."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong>How can we obtain this light?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Once we understand that the light we are talking about is Jesus Christ, we should seek to obtain His light. How do we do this?<br /><br />Earlier this year Sister Cheryl A. Esplin spoke to the students at BYU. She stated, "The search for knowledge, light, and truth is one of the reasons we are on earth. It is a lifelong pursuit that requires great effort and diligence on our part, whether by study or by faith."<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We are at this university, as part of our lifelong search for knowledge, light, and truth. It is a wonderful blessing to be at a university where both temporal knowledge and spiritual light and truth are taught as one. Where we can teach that the best way to protect our computers and networks is a layered approach and then compare it to the way that Captain Moroni prepared his people for war. We can teach that computer security having passwords, firewalls, and virus protection are very similar to digging ditches, building breastworks of timbers, and building towers. A layered defensive approach can also be applied to protecting ourselves from Satan's influences. By having our daily prayers, reading our scriptures and serving others, we can keep that light bright and diminish the powers of darkness.<br /><br />What a great blessing it is to be at a university where we begin classes with prayer, inviting the Holy Ghost to aid in our teaching and learning. It is that gift of the Holy Ghost, when conferred upon us and righteously received, that enables us to receive light and truth so that we can comprehend all things.<br /><br />"And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things."<br /><br />We all have learned that, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>To gain intelligence or the glory of God, we must be diligent to God's commandments and the covenants we have made with Him. The light and truth, which God possesses, is only gained by hard work. What are those habits, which, if consistently adhered to, will lead us to obtain light and truth?</p>
<p>There are many good habits, which when practiced, will enable us to become receptors of light and truth. We refer so some of them as "the Sunday School answers". The Sunday School answers are easy to give but giving them will not result in the desired outcome. It is in the daily practice of the Sunday School answers that light is obtained. May I suggest to you a few daily habits, which are worthy, of our best efforts:</p>
<p>Several things will happen when you make these a part of your daily practices. You will soon recognize, "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As we receive God's light and continue to practice these small daily tasks, we will receive more light until our body is filled with light and we comprehend all things. However, if we do not study, keep the commandments and diligently seek to know truth, this light will cease.<br /><br />In addition to the daily habits I have suggested, Elder S. Gifford Nielsen suggests listening to good music as a way to obtain light.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Uplifting music can overcome darkness. One-third of our hymns directly reference light, and most of them allude to it in some way. We can become enlightened by listening to inspired music and memorizing sacred words. President David O. McKay (1873-1970) taught, 'Music is truly the universal language, and when it is excellently expressed how deeply it moves our souls!'"<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I was truly taught this principle in February of this year while I was visiting my wife's parents. My mother-in-law is in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease. I read from my journal, "I am sitting in sacrament meeting, in mom and dad's ward in Salt Lake City. The ward choir is singing a hymn, 'Now Let Us Rejoice.' Mom is sitting next to me in the congregation. She is quietly singing along with the choir. I am amazed that even as mom struggles to remember her own children, she still remembers the music and every word of the hymns. I am touched by the Spirit and realize the importance for all of us to learn and sing the hymns of the church. The sacred music that we sing as we worship speaks to more than our mind, it speaks to our spirit."</p>
<p>In the hymns, there are many examples of the Savior's light, as it uplifts us both spiritually and physically. In 1833, an Englishman by the name of John Henry Newman traveling to England booked passage on a small boat. "Not long after the ship set sail, thick fog descended and obscured the hazardous cliffs surrounding them. Trapped for a week in the damp, gray darkness, the ship unable to travel forward or back, Newman pled for his Savior's help as he penned the words we now know as the hymn "Lead, Kindly Light."13</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom; ...<br />"The night is dark, and I am far from home; ...<br />"Keep thou my feet; ...<br />"one step enough for me...<br />"Lead thou me on!"<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This hymn illustrates that even if our trials and challenges cause us to lose our way, we can look to Christ and He will be our light in times of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>After first obtaining light, how do we then let our light shine so others can see it?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>All of us have experienced, or are now experiencing, struggles in our life or perhaps in the lives of family members or close friends. Many of these we quietly deal with. These struggles are real and many of them are in dark and scary places. We need to know where to find light and how to use that light to help others and ourselves.<br /><br />To illustrate this I would like to tell you of a struggle one family, who is dear to me, has experienced. This family has chosen to seek the light rather than let the darkness and evil of the world overcome their hearts.<br /><br />Eric a senior at the local high school loved music. He played the piano, guitar and the cello. His home was often filled with the sound of him playing one of these instruments. He gave of himself to others with kind words and helping hands. He shared the talents and light that he had with everyone. Every day when he came home and before he went to bed, he would tell his mother he loved her. One spring day, Eric and his sister came home from school for lunch and interrupted&nbsp; a burglary in progress. Eric was shot and killed.<br /><br />When the family was finally able to return to their home after this tragic event, some of the family members were reluctant to use the room where his death had occurred. Eric's mother told the family, "We can either think of this as the spot where Eric was shot, or we can think of this as holy ground, and we are going to think of it as holy ground."<br /><br />Since that day, the family has remembered the lives Eric saved through his organ donation. They have celebrated Eric's love of music by awarding an annual music scholarship at his former high school. This past month over fifty family members and friends just finished participating in the 19th Annual Victory Over Violence Walk/Run with all proceeds being given to anti-violence programs in the community.<br /><br />I quote from an address given by Eric's mother in Sacrament meeting on Easter 2013:<br /><br />"Three years ago I stood at this podium and spoke to the ward. As I was speaking, I remember looking over and seeing my son Eric and his father sitting at the sacrament table. For some reason, that really touched me. In fact, I believe it was the only time they blessed the sacrament together. I remember thinking how lucky I was to be part of such a wonderful family. The following day, my daughter and Eric went home for lunch. Intruders were in our home. Luckily, my daughter escaped, but Eric did not."</p>
<p>This good mother continued by quoting from her favorite hymn, "I Know That My Redeemer Lives."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'He lives to silence all my fears.<br />'He lives to wipe away my tears.<br />'He lives to calm my troubled heart.<br />'He lives all blessings to impart.'<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>"In my hour of deepest sorrow, I found peace from the words of the angel that first Easter morning: 'He is not here: for he is risen.'<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Without this knowledge of the resurrection and without the knowledge that we can be reunited in the next life, I could not have born the loss.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;"I know that my Redeemer lives. As President Monson said, 'This is the knowledge that sustains. This is the truth that comforts. This is the assurance that guides those who are bowed down with grief&mdash;out of the shadows and into the light.'"<sup>17</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>&nbsp;For me this family has exemplified how our light can shine before men. Sister Cheryl A. Esplin further explains,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...we will have to do our best to hold on to whatever light and truth we currently have, especially in difficult circumstances. The answers to our prayers may not come dramatically, but we must find quiet moments to seek greater light and truth. And when we receive it, it is our responsibility to live it, to share it, and to defend it."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When I was a freshman here at Ricks College, we had an activity the first week of classes called "Hello and Smile" week. We would walk across campus, we would smile and say "Hello" as we passed each other. Okay, maybe we did not say hello to everyone, but we tried to smile as we passed each other. I know it sounds corny. It was just a smile, but what a light it radiated across campus. "Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;"<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Many times during my youth, my family would drive from New Jersey to Connecticut to visit my grandparents. As part of our trip, we would often visit my father's alma mater, Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.<br /><br />On one of these visits to Yale, my father and I were talking about the Yale seal. I asked him to explain the meaning of the inscription. My Dad explained that Lux Et Veritas was Latin for "light and truth," and that this phrase was a goal of higher education&mdash;to enlighten our minds with knowledge.<br /><br />I then asked my father what the Hebrew symbols meant. He said he did not know. I jokingly said, "What? You don't know!" I thought to myself, "My dad knows everything." I then asked, "You have a degree from this school and you don't know what the school seal means?" I guess he missed the foundation class lecture that explained the meaning of the seal.<br /><br />In the years that have passed since that conversation with my father, I have often wondered what that Hebrew inscription meant. A few years ago, while reading an article I discovered their meaning. Imagine my excitement at solving one of the mysteries of my youth. Now try to imagine my excitement when I learned that the translation of the Hebrew text means Urim and Thummim!<br /><br />Wait a minute! What is the connection between the Yale seal and the item that the Prophet Joseph Smith used to translate the Book of Mormon? In order to answer this question, I did what any good Latter-day Saint would do. I turned to the Bible Dictionary.<br /><br />The Bible Dictionary, states that Urim and Thummim is Hebrew for "lights and perfections." It also explains that it is an instrument prepared of God to assist man in obtaining revelation from the Lord. In other words, the Hebrew translation of Urim and Thummim gives us the very purpose for which God intended the instrument to be used, that of obtaining revelation from Him&mdash;or light and truth.<br /><br />Shortly after I started teaching at BYU-Idaho, I was struck with the thought, "If any university should have a motto of light and truth it should be BYU-Idaho." The Lord has blessed us with so very much at this university. To honor our Father in Heaven and his son Jesus Christ, we should strive to walk daily in the light. We should diligently learn all that we can. We should use the light and truth we obtain while at this university to help and lift others, whether it be through a kind word or just a smile. We should invite all to come unto Christ. We should be the beacon set on a hill.<br /><br />In his book,&nbsp;<em>Standing for Something</em>, President Gordon B. Hinckley has expressed these ideas in this way. "We need another dimension in our lives, a compelling need and drive within each of us to feel that somehow, somewhere we have made a difference&mdash;that our lives have mattered.<br /><br />"It is not enough just to be good. We must be good for something. We must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for our presence. And the good that is in us must be spread to others."<sup>20</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Just as the BYU students in Jerusalem referred to by President Faust, we too have a responsibility to take the light that the Lord has blessed us with and share it with others. "It is our responsibility to live it, to share it and to defend it."<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, it is my prayer that each of us may strive to "Let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works, and glorify [our] Father in heaven."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restricted Accounts Specialist</p>
<p>Marilyn Richins Nelson works in Accounting Services at BYU-Idaho as an Accounts Specialist.<br /><br /> She is originally from Driggs, Idaho.&nbsp; After graduating from Teton High School she came to Ricks College to earn an associate's degree in Accounting.&nbsp; She began working at Ricks College 29 years ago.<br /><br /> Sister Nelson has served in various callings in the church, including primary president, young women president, stake relief society president in a BYU-Idaho campus stake, and is currently serving in the Nursery in her ward.<br /><br /> She and her husband, Vance, will celebrate 42 years of marriage this summer.&nbsp; They have 3 daughters and 12 grandchildren.&nbsp; Sister Nelson enjoys fitness, running, reading, traveling with her husband, and hosting a "Cousin Camp" each summer for her grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am so excited to speak to you today!&nbsp; Afterwards, I'm having a gigantic chocolate milkshake, maybe even two.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I am excited and grateful to spend this time with you and I have prayed that the Holy Ghost will attend us, that we may each learn together.</p>
<p>As you know, the early members of the Lord's restored church suffered great persecution and hardships.&nbsp; The Lord offered His words of strength and encouragement, telling them, "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many, but endure them, for, lo,&nbsp;<em>I am with thee</em>, even unto the end of thy days."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>"I am with thee." That loving and poignant phrase has carried me through trials and sorrows.&nbsp; It brings about a marvelous visual experience for me.&nbsp; I see the Lord's hand outstretched, reaching my reaching.&nbsp; I grab his hand and hold on tight.&nbsp; He lifts and carries me.&nbsp; He listens, counsels.&nbsp; His words strengthen me.&nbsp; He offers tender reassurance that He will never leave my side.</p>
<p>This is more than a visualization. &nbsp;Elder David A. Bednar explains it as the enabling and strengthening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;It gives us the power to do more than what we could, if left to our own abilities and strength.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; This enabling power has been a tremendous blessing for me.&nbsp; Please let me share.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad were thrilled when I was born.&nbsp; I was their only child and they had waited for seven years.&nbsp; When excited well-wishers came to the house to see the new baby, Mom held me up to the window inside the house and the onlookers viewed me from the front yard outside the house.&nbsp; No one was allowed into our home to welcome me and to hold me.</p>
<p>As I grew, we visited my grandmother often.&nbsp; She lived close by. &nbsp;I loved playing with cousins there. &nbsp;They could take their shoes and socks off and play in the grass and dirt.&nbsp; I could play, but only if my shoes remained on. &nbsp;My Mother insisted that my bare feet could not touch the ground.&nbsp; Alarmed with the flies at Grandma's house, Mom would shout at me "Don't let those flies touch you!"&nbsp; She was frightened by what their tiny feet might carry.&nbsp; She didn't like me touching door knobs or anything else others had touched. &nbsp;When it was time to leave, Mom would scrub my fingernails with a scrubbing brush until they would bleed.&nbsp; Mom initiated strict rules and I obeyed or I was beaten. &nbsp;I noticed as young as three years old that Mother acted differently than others. &nbsp;I didn't know why, but in my adulthood, her condition finally had a name and some of my questions were answered.</p>
<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, also known as OCD, is an anxiety disorder, a chemical imbalance of the brain.&nbsp; This mental illness consists of obsessions which are intrusive, unwanted thoughts that produce uneasiness, fear or worry. With OCD, the brain sends emergency thoughts when there is no emergency.&nbsp; The compulsions are repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing the anxiety of the unwanted thoughts. &nbsp;So rituals and routines are performed.&nbsp; Individuals with OCD are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic, dread or doom.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Mother developed OCD before I was born.&nbsp; She had an intense fear of germs and performed cleaning rituals to eliminate the fear.&nbsp; She viewed herself as germ-free.&nbsp; Everything and everyone else was contaminated.&nbsp; Mother's family knew something was wrong, but didn't know how to help her.&nbsp; In those days, OCD did not have a name or any kind of treatment.&nbsp; Thank goodness, today there are medications and behavior therapies to assist.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland teaches us, "These afflictions are some of the realities of mortal life, and there should be no more shame in acknowledging them than in acknowledging a battle with high blood pressure or the sudden appearance of a malignant tumor ... Though we may feel we are "like a broken vessel," as the Psalmist says, we must remember, that vessel is in the hands of the divine potter.&nbsp; Broken minds can be healed just the way broken bones and broken hearts are healed.&nbsp; While God is at work making those repairs, the rest of us can help by being merciful, nonjudgmental, and kind."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;We did not have this information or reassurance then and Mom received no relief.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My dad was a fulltime National Guardsman.&nbsp; When he received a promotion, we moved from Driggs, Idaho to Idaho Falls and bought a new house. &nbsp;Dad focused his spare time on finishing our downstairs. &nbsp;I hoped the new home would help my mom change from her old ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't and life only got worse.&nbsp; Dad was tired of her compulsive behavior.&nbsp; He soon divorced Mom and moved out.&nbsp;<br /><br />I thought my life had ended.&nbsp; I was seven years old and Mom had full custody.&nbsp; It was just Mom and me.&nbsp; She began working full time.&nbsp; Dad remarried and resided within our city.&nbsp; Mom's anxiety increased and so did her OCD.&nbsp; She scrubbed things at work, but most cleaning routines were performed within our home and yard. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Mom moved me to the downstairs bedroom, while my toys and most of my clothes remained with her.&nbsp; I was never allowed again onto the main floor of the house.&nbsp; I lived in the basement for the next nine years.&nbsp; Restrained by Mom's fears, I had no say or control.&nbsp; I was frightened and heartbroken in that dimly-lit basement.</p>
<p>Our house was connected to a one-car garage.&nbsp; I could enter my house only once a day by following a well-established pattern.&nbsp; I disrobed in the garage and Mom carried me down stairs to newspaper that I stood on while she scrubbed the stairs and stairway.&nbsp; When I was too big to carry, Mom allowed me to walk downstairs.&nbsp; After the stairs were cleaned, I could walk from the newspaper to the bathroom, bathe and dress following a certain routine.&nbsp; In my bedroom, I could touch only my light switch and two drawers of my dresser.&nbsp; In my double-sized bed, I could only touch the left-hand side. &nbsp;I didn't understand these rules, but I obeyed.&nbsp;<br /><br />After Mom finished her rituals downstairs, she would climb to the top of the stairs and shout to me, "Turn off your light."&nbsp; I hated turning off my light!&nbsp; It was very dark. &nbsp;I worried about monsters finding me and I'd hide my head under the covers.&nbsp; I knew if I needed help, Mom would not respond.&nbsp; There was no interaction allowed until morning when Mom would choose my clothes and bring them downstairs with breakfast.&nbsp;<br /><br />I questioned myself ... if I tried harder, if I were cleaner, if I were nicer, would Mom allow me to live on the main floor with her? &nbsp;I desperately wanted her to change.&nbsp; We never talked about it.&nbsp; Only occasionally did I dare ask her "to please change."&nbsp; She would quickly answer, "I will change tomorrow."&nbsp; The next day she'd be the same or worse.&nbsp; I was helpless, hopeless, and all alone.<br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated, "There is, in the suffering of the highest order, a point that is reached&mdash;a point of aloneness&mdash;when the individual (as did the Savior on a much grander scale) must bear it ... alone. Even the faithful may wonder if they can take any more or if they are in some way forsaken.&nbsp; Those who ... stand on the foot of the cross often can do so little to help absorb the pain and the anguish. It is something we must bear ourselves in order that our triumph can be complete."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Please note:<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This was a time when there were no child-protection laws.&nbsp; Today, child abuse can and should be reported!&nbsp; Resources are available and it is our responsibility to see that all children are protected.<br /><br />The Lord provided me with good people along my path.&nbsp; A kind neighbor friend introduced me to Primary.&nbsp; I began attending with her.&nbsp; It was a happy setting and I looked forward to it every week! &nbsp;My Primary teacher taught me about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and that they loved me.&nbsp; That was survival information! &nbsp;It felt good, it sounded right and it provided much needed comfort.&nbsp; I'm grateful for that Primary teacher who week after week bore testimony of gospel truths.&nbsp; She didn't know I felt unloved and disvalued.&nbsp; She didn't know that Mom could not hug me because of my germs.&nbsp; She didn't know the vital impact of her words, but the Lord knew.&nbsp; He was there.&nbsp; He reminds us "[I] knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes;"<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He knows our hardships.&nbsp; He knows our pain.<br /><br />Also, in Primary I learned of prayer. "Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I began talking with Heavenly Father and sharing my fears.&nbsp; I asked him to save me from the basement monsters and later with maturity, I pleaded that I could escape Mom's compulsive behavior and demands.&nbsp; I felt the Lord near and I held on tightly to His hand.&nbsp; I had hope!&nbsp; I kept praying and waiting, praying and waiting.<br /><br />Elder Orson F. Whitney wrote,&nbsp;<strong>"</strong>No pain that we suffer ... is wasted. &nbsp;It ministers to our education, to the development of ... patience, faith, fortitude and humility.&nbsp; All that we suffer ..., especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God ... and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we {came} here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven."<sup>9</sup><strong></strong><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I was fearful of Mom and knew I could tell no one about my home life.&nbsp; I knew I'd be punished if I told the "secret." &nbsp;I believe dysfunctional families have unwritten rules designed by the adversary.&nbsp; One of which is the family "secret" cannot be told.&nbsp; Satan wants us to feel embarrassed, shameful, defective by any kind of dysfunction or sin.&nbsp; He will not comfort or uplift us.&nbsp; He covers us with his dark cloak of deceit to hide us from truth and the Savior's healing power. &nbsp;Then he leaves us in despair.&nbsp; "And thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell."<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Lord will never leave us in our sorrows.&nbsp; We can trust Him and His Priesthood leaders with our honesty and openness.&nbsp; Through the power of His loving atonement, He will reach out with His omnipotent hand and lift us to higher ground.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott testifies, "The atonement will not only help us overcome our transgressions and mistakes, but in His time, it will resolve all inequities of life - those things that are unfair which are the consequences of circumstance or others' acts and not our own decisions."<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Lord reminds us to "Fear&nbsp;thou not; for&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;with thee</em>: be not dismayed; for I&nbsp;am&nbsp;thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The Lord knows how to bless us because He has lived our tribulations and sorrow, even before we experienced them.</p>
<p>Alma teaches us "And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people; and he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people;&nbsp; And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people."<sup>13</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>When school was out, Mom arranged for others to watch me at their homes while she worked.&nbsp; &nbsp;If no one was available, I would be left at my home, locked out of the house, as Mom left for work. &nbsp;I never had a key to open the door and the house was always locked. During the summer, Mom would bring me a sandwich on her lunch hour and I could drink from the garden hose.&nbsp; My bathroom was an empty tin can in the garage or a fast bike ride to the gas station.&nbsp; Reading Nancy Drew books, listening to my transistor radio, weeding the marigolds, watering the lawn occupied some of my time. &nbsp;The best times were spent riding my speedy, blue bike with friends. &nbsp;I have many fun memories!</p>
<p>My mother dated frequently and I'd stay the night with friends. &nbsp;A few families were active in the Church and one in particular demonstrated righteous patterns that I grew to love.&nbsp; For instance, every morning before breakfast was served, they knelt around their kitchen table for prayer.&nbsp; I cherished those moments and the spirit of family unity.&nbsp; Each time I bowed my head in that setting, I noticed the round braided rug we knelt on under their round wooden table. I remember that clearly and the feeling of hope I had for a future time with an eternal family that could kneel in prayer together. &nbsp;Was it possible?&nbsp; I know now that survivors of dysfunction can reverse the trend and start new patterns that follow the Savior. &nbsp;We are not stuck where we started.<br /><br />In the garage with doors closed, I liked singing Primary songs.&nbsp; The lyrics would echo off the walls.&nbsp; It seemed extra voices sang with me.&nbsp; "I need my Heavenly Father to help me every day.&nbsp; He wants me to be happy and choose the righteous way.&nbsp; He wants me to be happy and choose the righteous way."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Those songs helped me then and in the years ahead. &nbsp;Often a musical phrase would circle in my head and remind me of who I was and what I could become.<br /><br />I remember a Beehive class that left a lasting impression.&nbsp; The topic was temple marriage.&nbsp; The teacher taught enthusiastically and was full of the Spirit.&nbsp; I left that class knowing there was only one way to marry and that's what I wanted.&nbsp; I held on to the Lord's hand.</p>
<p>I echo the words of Ammon, "I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.&nbsp; Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things;"<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I received the Lord's guidance and strength in many ways; from the class room to the pulpit, from General Conference addresses to scripture passages, from multiple prayers to examples of great and caring people.</p>
<p>The summer I turned 16, I moved in with an aunt in Driggs who needed a live-in babysitter.&nbsp; Mom agreed and I lived with my aunt until my high school graduation.&nbsp; It was the long-awaited answer to prayers!&nbsp; My aunt welcomed me with love.&nbsp; I learned life lessons there; how to choose my own clothes, how to make cookies, how to interact with family, how to welcome friends as they came to visit and how to enjoy life. &nbsp;I even learned how to walk barefoot in the grass and dirt. &nbsp;Sometimes I made foolish decisions, but soon realized it was much easier holding on to what I knew was right. &nbsp;The Lord tells us "I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>My grades earned me a scholarship to Ricks College.&nbsp; I lived with a long-time friend and her brother returned from his mission. &nbsp;And believe me, I noticed him from the start! &nbsp;He's a people person, service oriented, witty, fun, and faithful. &nbsp;I saw how he treated his sweet mother and loving sisters with kindness and respect. &nbsp;That won him extra points!&nbsp; I watched how his family functioned. &nbsp;I knew that his five brothers had or would be serving missions and the gospel was important to their family.&nbsp; More points!&nbsp; I determined early on that I wanted him and his family.&nbsp; Later we married in the Ogden Temple and I got both!</p>
<p>Vance is my best friend and has offered me great support on my path of healing. &nbsp;We have raised three beautiful daughters who are in turn raising righteous families.&nbsp; They are our greatest accomplishment and we have been blessed with a dozen incredible grandchildren who bring us great joy!<br /><br />I have that home I hoped for as a child.&nbsp; I don't have the braided rug or round table, but I do have a home where family prayers are said and love and faith reside.&nbsp; Do we have challenges?&nbsp; Yes, everyday!&nbsp; We know the Lord may not remove all our trials, but we have faith that through His enabling power, we'll have strength to endure.<br /><br />Soon after I left the basement, Mom left Idaho Falls.&nbsp; She transferred from her position at the Post Register to the Idaho Statesman in Boise.&nbsp; I'm happy to report that both my parents, inactive most of their lives, received their temple endowments within their lifetime. &nbsp;In Mom's later years, she suffered a stroke, became immobile and required full-time care.&nbsp; We moved her to eastern Idaho and we insisted that she receive psychological treatment.&nbsp; She reluctantly agreed to medication.&nbsp; We worked closely with her and her caregivers to meet her needs.&nbsp; I was able to have loving exchanges with Mom before her death.&nbsp; I'm grateful for the blessing of the resurrection and I'm waiting in awe to meet her someday with a clear, healthy mind.<br /><br />In my journey of healing, I have received prayers, Priesthood blessings, lots of love, and professional counseling.&nbsp; All of these have contributed to my wellbeing.&nbsp; My most essential resource has been my relationship with the Savior.&nbsp; He has not forsaken me.&nbsp; He is truly the Master Healer!</p>
<p>We are taught well by Alma's story recorded in Mosiah 24.&nbsp; He and his people were persecuted and abused by the Lamanites and the wicked priest, Amulon. &nbsp;The Lord came to Alma's people in their afflictions, saying,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>"Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, ... And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs ... and this will I do&nbsp;<em>that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter</em>, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The burdens that were upon Alma and his brethren were made light.&nbsp; They submitted cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>They were strengthened and blessed through the enabling power of the Atonement.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we agreed at baptism to stand strong "as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp; To bear witness is to testify by the power of the Holy Ghost and make a solemn declaration of truth based on personal knowledge or belief.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; The Lord encourages us, saying, "...With all your soul ...you shall...open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do, for I am with you."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp; Sister Susan W. Tanner further explains that we also stand as witnesses of God by nurturing a spirit of faith, love, and peace, and by expressing gratitude and radiating joy.<sup>22</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Savior suffered greatly for us.&nbsp; In his earthly ministry, we were&nbsp;<em>not there</em>&nbsp;to stand as a witness of Him.&nbsp; He was rejected and persecuted.&nbsp;<em>We</em>&nbsp;were not there.&nbsp; In Gethsemane, He suffered alone.&nbsp; We were not&nbsp;<em>there</em>.&nbsp; On Calvary's cross, He was mocked and crucified.&nbsp; We were not there to stand for him.&nbsp; Yet in our afflictions, He responds to us by saying, "<em>I am with thee</em>." &nbsp;Shouldn't we each reply, today and every day, with a resounding, "Dear Lord, I am also with thee and will stand as thy witness."</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I am standing here today as a witness that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, does visit and strengthen his people in their afflictions and in their victories and everything in between. &nbsp;I know He lives and His Atonement is real.</p>
<p>May we each take hold of the Lord's hand and stand strong as His witness.&nbsp; I know He will help us to "be patient in [our] afflictions, for [we] shalt have many, but [we can] endure them, for, lo, [He] is with [us], even unto the end of [our] days."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp; No matter our trial or circumstance, we can hold on and stand strong!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elder William R. Walker was called as a General Authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2002. He served in the Second Quorum of the Seventy for six years. On April 6, 2008, he was named a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. He served as the Executive Director of the Temple Department from 2007 to 2014. As Executive Director, he worked closely with the First Presidency in the oversight and administration of the Church's many temples throughout the world. In October 2014 he was released as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and was designated as an emeritus General Authority.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Elder Walker was raised in Raymond, Alberta, Canada, and served a mission in Japan as a young man. He is a graduate of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. During his career, he held a number of executive positions with major firms in the securities and investment banking fields.<br /><br /> Elder Walker has served as the Area President of the Asia North Area in Tokyo, Japan. Prior to his call as a General Authority, he was president of the Japan Tokyo South Mission and also served as a stake president and bishop.&nbsp; <br /><br /> William R. Walker was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, on May 25, 1944. He married Vicki Van Wagenen in 1968. They are the parents of five children.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the invitation to speak at BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />In 1966, I finished serving my mission in Japan, and I came to school at Ricks College.&nbsp; I loved it here, and know there is a wonderful Spirit here on your campus.<br /><br />I am grateful to President Clark Gilbert for his warm welcome.<br /><br />Today, I will speak about why the temple is so important to every Latter-day Saint.<br /><br /><strong>The Great Plan of Happiness</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Any observer of the Latter-day Saint culture will quickly conclude that the temple has a unique and very special place in the lives of our people.<br /><br />Fundamental to our feelings about the importance of the temple is our understanding of the Doctrine of God's Plan of Happiness for us.&nbsp; Some call it the Plan of Salvation.&nbsp; Alma called it "the Great Plan of Happiness." (Alma 42:8)<br /><br />Essential to our understanding of God's plan for us is to know that God lives, that He loves us, and that He provided a Savior for us.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint believes that they are children of a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Every Latter-day Saint believes that life is eternal.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint believes that God's plan for us includes the provision that we can return to Him.&nbsp; Central to that plan, of course, is the fact that God provided a Savior for us.&nbsp; Through the Son of God, the Savior Jesus Christ, we can overcome the world and find our way back to Heaven.<br /><br />The temple is essential to all of this.<br /><br /><strong>The Prophet Joseph Smith - Temples and The Restoration</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught early in his ministry the importance of the temple and the temple ordinances.&nbsp; Joseph's teachings and doctrines were unique to the religious world of that day.&nbsp; When Joseph spoke of the need for temples and temple ordinances, those concepts were not subjects that were part of religious discussions of that day.<br /><br />The Restoration, of course, provided that there would be a restoration of all things, including temples, temple ordinances, and temple worship.<br /><br />These things were revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We calculate to give the Elders of Israel their washings and anointings, and attend to those last and more impressive ordinances, without which we cannot obtain celestial thrones."&nbsp; (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 362)</p>
<p>Joseph taught, "There must be a holy place prepared for that purpose." (Ibid. p.362)</p>
<p>As he continued to teach of the importance of building temples, Joseph taught that we needed a place "for men to be baptized for their dead", and where they "may receive their endowments and be made kings and priests (queens and priestesses) unto the Most High God."&nbsp; (Ibid. p. 363)<br /><br />As you know, temples were built in Kirtland, Ohio and Nauvoo, Illinois.&nbsp; Some of you may enjoy studying these matters in more detail in Sections 109, and 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and the first 55 verses of Section 124.<br /><br /><strong>Look to the Temple as the Great Symbol of our Membership</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>President Howard W. Hunter was president of the Church when some of you were born. &nbsp;He died in 1995.&nbsp; When he was president of the Church he challenged us to "look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of our membership." (Conference Report, October 1994)<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>What a wonderful challenge he gave us.&nbsp; Probably many of you have already done this: You look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of your membership in the Church.&nbsp; It is the Lord's Church. &nbsp;The temple is the house of the Lord.&nbsp; The temple&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be a great symbol of our membership in the Church.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint knows he is on his way back to God.&nbsp; We know that this life is temporary, although very important.&nbsp; We know that God gave us the temples as a means to find our way back.<br /><br />What a blessing it is for us to live in a day when temples now dot the earth.&nbsp; With the recent dedication of Cordoba Argentina Temple, and the upcoming dedication of the Payson Utah Temple, we will have 146 operating temples throughout the world.&nbsp; It is marvelous time to be a member of the Church.<br /><br />In the seven years since President Monson became president of the Church, he has overseen the dedication of 22 temples, the rededication of 7 refurbished temples and he has announced plans for another 27 temples to be built.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some are nearing completion and will be dedicated soon.<br /><br />At April General Conference, President Monson thrilled the saints in the Ivory Coast, Haiti, and Thailand, when he announced a temple would be built in each of those countries.&nbsp; When all the temples that President Monson has announced are dedicated, we will have 173 temples throughout the earth.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint knows that the ordinances of the temple are essential for us, and our loved ones, in order to avail ourselves of all the blessings that our Father in Heaven has in store for us. &nbsp;As I mentioned a moment ago, the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of "celestial thrones."&nbsp; That is what our loving Heavenly Father has in store for us.<br /><br /><strong>Children and Temples</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The temple is very important in the lives of Latter-day Saint children.&nbsp; As children, we identify with the temple. &nbsp;Why is that?&nbsp; I suppose in part it is because children innately feel close to Father in Heaven, and the temple is the house of the Lord.<br /><br />As the poet Wordsworth eloquently wrote of our birth, with this expression: "Trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home...."<br /><br />Things of a spiritual nature are not so far removed from us in our early years.&nbsp; Children, who are not yet affected by worldly things, are more sensitive to the things of the spirit.&nbsp; Think how often Jesus taught that we must become as children.<br /><br />At one of the temple open houses, a little boy was in his father's arms as the family visited the celestial room.&nbsp; After a few sacred moments of reflection for all of the family, the father and mother turned to leave.&nbsp; The little boy in his father's arms looked heavenward, smiled and then waved goodbye.&nbsp; It was a tender moment for me.</p>
<p>Years ago, the prophet Spencer W. Kimball suggested that every young Latter-day Saint ought to have a picture of the temple in their bedroom.&nbsp; Probably many of you had just such a picture - a picture of your&nbsp;favorite temple.&nbsp; It may have hung on the wall in your room, or sat in a strategic place on your dresser.&nbsp; It may have been the temple closest to where you lived, or another temple that had special significance to you, such as the temple where your parents or grandparents were married.&nbsp; Or it could have been a temple that you found to be particularly beautiful and inspiring.</p>
<p>You are here in Rexburg, attending university, and it could well be that the nearby magnificent and beautiful Rexburg Temple has become your favorite temple.<br /><br />The architecture and the surrounding beauty of each temple may differ, but the ordinances are the same in every temple.&nbsp; Whether it is the Temple in Accra, Ghana, or the Temple in Seoul Korea, the ordinances and the promised blessings&nbsp;are exactly the same.<br /><br />It is interesting to me that children, who may have never been inside a temple, can hold it in such high esteem and great affection.&nbsp; Latter-day Saint children sing the song: "I love to see the temple, I'm going there someday."<br /><br />As a child I grew to love the temple.&nbsp; I lived in Raymond, Alberta, Canada.&nbsp; Our home was about 35 miles from the Cardston Alberta Temple.&nbsp; I loved to see the temple; I knew I was going there someday.&nbsp; Our family often stopped at the temple and took family pictures in front of the temple.&nbsp; Even before I was old enough to figure out very many things, I knew that the temple was very important to my mother and father and to my grandparents.<br /><br />I remember sitting on the floor in the dining room and watching my mother iron her temple clothing.&nbsp; She would tell me that, "Tonight is temple night, and your father and I are so happy to be going to the temple."&nbsp; She was setting an important example for me.<br /><br />I have been with President Thomas S. Monson at temple dedications when he has suggested that when little children come to see the temple, they go right up to the side of the temple, and actually touch it.&nbsp; He said: "When they touch the temple, the temple will touch them."<br /><br />When you have children, you will feel the importance of teaching them about the temple.&nbsp; You will want to be an example, and go to the temple often.&nbsp; Your children will realize the importance of the temple in your life.&nbsp; Few things that you teach them could be more important.<br /><br />President Boyd K. Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Point your children toward the temple.&nbsp; From the days of their infancy, direct their attention to it, and begin their preparation for the day when they may enter the Holy temple." (The Holy Temple, p.47)</p>
<p>As your children go to Primary, Sunday School, Mutual, and Seminary, they will be taught about the importance of the temple.&nbsp; You want your children to listen to those lessons, and have the feeling in their heart: "This is all good, and I already know how important the temple is to my mother and father."</p>
<p>Sister Walker and I have five children.&nbsp; When the children were little we had some exciting family home evenings. &nbsp;We found it helpful to keep lots of pictures of temples as well as Bible and Book of Mormon pictures to help in teaching lessons. We would bring out the big stack of pictures each family home evening.</p>
<p>Each child would select a picture to show during their part of the lesson.&nbsp; The children would often choose a temple picture and they would say: "This is the Salt Lake Temple.&nbsp; This is where Daddy and Mommy were married."&nbsp;&nbsp; Or,&nbsp; "This is the Idaho Falls Temple, we stopped there on our vacation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the pictures in the stack was a picture of the Sacred Grove.&nbsp; One evening our son chose the Sacred Grove picture.&nbsp; I was very pleased, and thought our little guy would tell us the story of the First Vision.&nbsp; When he stood up, he said: "This is the Sacred Grove, This is where Joseph Smith chopped down the trees, and built a temple."<br /><br />It was fun and we were able to gently straighten things out.&nbsp;&nbsp; We knew our children were learning.&nbsp; As the years went by, every one of them married in the temple.<br /><br />An 8-year-old baptized member can attend a temple dedication, but generally, our youth are not able to be in the temple until they reach age 12.&nbsp; They are then able to go to the temple and perform the sacred ordinance of being baptized for their deceased ancestors.<br /><br />This practice can continue throughout the teenage years and will be a source of great blessings for our youth.<br /><br /><strong>The Spirit of Elijah</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In a remarkable talk in General Conference in October 2011, Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve, challenged the young people of the Church to not just go to the temple to do Baptisms, but to learn about and experience the Spirit of Elijah.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I encourage you to study, to search out your ancestors, and to prepare yourselves to perform proxy baptisms in the house of the Lord for your kindred dead."&nbsp; (Conference Report, October/2011)</p>
<p>In his wonderful message, Elder Bednar promised the youth of the Church these blessings if they followed his counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.Your Patriarchal Blessing will become more meaningful to you.<br />2. Your love and gratitude for your ancestors will increase.<br />3. Your testimony of the Savior will become deep and abiding.<br />4. You will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary.<br />5. You will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives.</p>
<p>Every member of the Church should want these blessings.</p>
<p><strong>Sealings - Families Can Be Together Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We learn that families can be together forever.&nbsp; That is accomplished by living God's commandments and by making and keeping sacred temple covenants.&nbsp; A loving Heavenly Father would want his children to be sealed together for time and for all eternity.&nbsp; "Until death do us part" has very little appeal for those who love each other with all their hearts.</p>
<p>When a cousin of mine was killed in a tragic accident, my parents comforted us by teaching about the blessings of the temple, the significance of the sealing and how a loving Heavenly Father would make everything right.&nbsp; It still hurt, but not quite as much.<br /><br />When a grandparent passes away, you wonder how the surviving companion is going to deal with the grief and loneliness.&nbsp; They realize that they have been sealed in the temple for time and all eternity and therefore they have the assurance that they will be together again.<br /><br />This comfort and reassurance comes to every Latter-day Saint.&nbsp; I was blessed to be with President Gordon B. Hinckley in Korea in 2005, shortly after Sister Hinckley had died.&nbsp; In his talk to all of the Saints in Korea who had assembled in a special conference to commemorate the 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary of the Church in Korea, President Hinckley spoke lovingly and tenderly of his wife.&nbsp; Everyone there was touched by his tender expressions of love for Sister Hinckley.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: "We went to the temple, and we knelt at the altar, and we were sealed for time and for all eternity.&nbsp; She is mine and I am hers, and it won't be long until we are together again."</p>
<p><strong>The Endowment - A Gift from God<br /></strong><strong>The Temple is a Place of Revelation and Peace</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple is important to us because of what we learn when we participate in the temple ordinances.&nbsp; We all know that "the temple is a place of revelation and peace." (Howard W. Hunter, Conference Report, October 1994)<br /><br />"As we attend the temple we learn more richly and deeply the purpose of life and the significance of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord, Jesus Christ." (Howard W. Hunter, ibid.)<br /><br />As we attend the temple we are reminded of the beauty of God's creations.&nbsp; Many of the temples have magnificent murals, which depict the beauty of this world.&nbsp; We are reminded of God's plan for us, the role of the Savior in each of our lives, and we are reminded of the commandments and blessings that will come to us when we live righteously and keep the covenants that we make in the temple.<br /><br />The endowment really is a gift from God.&nbsp; It keeps giving and giving, just as the traditional use of the word endowment implies.<br /><br />We live in a hectic world, a world filled with influences that will keep us away from righteousness. &nbsp;Going to the temple is a way of stepping out of the world for a few moments, or a few hours.&nbsp; When we make time to go to the temple, we will be spiritually refreshed.&nbsp; If our life has lost important balance, being in the temple can help restore that balance.<br /><br />Those who stay worthy of the temple, and who participate in temple worship regularly, are far more likely to stay spiritually balanced and live in harmony with the teaching of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They are far more likely to manifest "godly walk and conversation", and they are more likely to be "walking in holiness before the Lord."&nbsp; (DC 20:69)<br /><br />President Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It has been my observation that the temple transforms&nbsp;the individual and makes abundantly worthwhile any efforts made to get there."&nbsp; (The Holy Temple, p. 21)</p>
<p>I have a smart phone, which has an app that is a compass.&nbsp; Occasionally, the compass gets out of balance and needs to be recalibrated.&nbsp; The instructions tell me to take the phone and move it in a figure-eight motion, repeating several times - after which, the compass will once again work correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I feel that my spiritual compass is a little out of balance, I have found the very best way to recalibrate is not to quickly run around in a figure-eight pattern, but to go to the temple.&nbsp; For me, it works every time.<br /><br />Being in the temple will give us important perspective - spiritual perspective and eternal perspective. &nbsp;Our burdens will be lightened, not because they change, but because the spiritual strength and perspective that we gain will assist us in dealing with them.<br /><br />Additionally, we are entitled to revelation and guidance from the Spirit.&nbsp; For me and many of our people, we feel an increased measure of direction from Heaven when we are in the temple.<br /><br />Most devout Latter-day Saints want to go to the temple when they are faced with an important decision in life.&nbsp; Not because they will talk to anyone about it, but because they will look to Heaven for guidance and direction with the confidence that they'll receive important inspiration and revelation.&nbsp; We expect to leave the temple with feelings that will help guide us.<br /><br />I heard of a cynical man who thought it was just incredulous that Latter-day Saints thought they could actually receive answers to their prayers, that God would actually communicate with them somehow.&nbsp; Well, I testify that revelation is real and available to God's children and we seem to receive an increased measure of that direction from Heaven when we are in the temple.<br /><br />We all need to remember that when we were baptized, we were also confirmed and we received the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Current Temple Recommend</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I love the expression of Elder Russell M. Nelson, of the Quorum of the Twelve, who said that for our children CTR is a reminder to Choose The Right, but for us adults, it should be a reminder of Current Temple Recommend.<br /><br />Just as our youth are reminded to choose the right, we need reminders to keep our temple recommend current and to have the temple and temple worship be an essential part of our lives.<br /><br />I once heard someone say that their recommend was "slightly out of date."&nbsp; I was astonished at the rationalization that led the person to feel that since it hadn't been long since their recommend had expired, that it was not so bad. An expired recommend is not a valid recommend regardless of how recently it expired.&nbsp; It would be a worthy goal for every one of us to never let our temple recommend expire - we ought to renew our recommend well before it has a chance to become "slightly out of date."<br /><br />Many years ago, a man in my stake was dying from cancer.&nbsp; He was a good, faithful High Priest.&nbsp; His Bishop called me on the phone and said: "President Walker, Brother Bolyard is bed-ridden and near the end of his life.&nbsp; His recommend will soon expire and he would like to renew it.&nbsp; He can't come to the office, so I would like to go to his home to give him his interview.&nbsp; Would you be willing to accompany me?"<br /><br />Gladly, I went to the man's home with the Bishop.&nbsp; In turn, we each asked him the temple recommend questions, and signed his recommend.&nbsp; When I handed it to him, he smiled and said: "Thank you, President.&nbsp; I'm going to put it right here on my night stand, so that when they come to get me, they'll know I have a current temple recommend."<br /><br />I was deeply impressed with the faith and devotion of this wonderful man.&nbsp; Each of us would be wise to follow his example - always have a current temple recommend.<br /><br /><strong>How Important?&nbsp; No Sacrifice is Too Great</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When we consider how important is the temple in the life of every Latter-day Saint, I think it is wise to consider the words of President Thomas S. Monson.<br /><br />In his General Conference message in April 2011, President Monson made a powerful and poignant expression on the importance of the temple in our lives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who understand the eternal blessings that come from the temple know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive (our temple) blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure.&nbsp; They understand that the saving ordinances received in the temple that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an eternal family relationship and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high are worth every sacrifice and every effort." (Conference Report, April/2011, p. 81)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong></p>
<p>The temple is so important in the life of every Latter-day Saint, because we know it is what our Father in Heaven wants for us.&nbsp;The temple is so important because we know that Jesus Christ's atonement is paramount in each of our lives and the blessings that we receive through keeping our temple covenants will bring joy and happiness in this life and throughout eternity.&nbsp;The temple is so important because we know that the sealing in the temple truly enables Families to Be Together Forever.<br /><br />May each of us make the temple the great symbol of our membership.&nbsp;May the temple help us to always remember Him.&nbsp;May the temple help us to love the Lord and to keep His commandments.<br /><br />I know that as we make the temple more important in our lives, we will draw nearer to God and we will become more like Him.&nbsp;I express my love to each of you and appreciate you being here today.&nbsp;I pray God's most choice blessings for you, the blessings of the temple, the house of the Lord.<br /><br />In the holy and sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters.&nbsp; What a thrill it is for Sister and I to be with you this afternoon.&nbsp; We are excited to bear testimony to you and let you know how much we love and respect you.&nbsp; You are a chosen generation.&nbsp; Many prophets and apostles have spoken about your preparation in the pre-mortal world.&nbsp; Allow me to share some of those statements with you.</p>
<p><strong>Statements from Apostles and Prophets</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>"For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the second coming of the Lord.....God has saved for the final inning some of His strongest ... children, who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly." (Ezra Taft Benson)<strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup><br /></sup></strong><strong><sup><br /></sup></strong>My dear young brethren, the Lord has been very good to you. He has brought you forth in this, the greatest age in the history of the earth. He has made you the beneficiary of His glorious gospel, restored to the earth for your blessing. No other generation has been the beneficiary of so much knowledge, of so much experience, of so much affluence and opportunity." (Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign, May 2007)<br /><br />Yours is a chosen generation of destiny...You are His son or His daughter. He made your spirit strong and capable of being resilient to the whirlwinds of life.....These are your days--to stand strong as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ......You will rejoice that God has placed you here to be a part of the final preparations for Christ's glorious return. (Neil L. Andersen, Ensign, May 2014)<br /><br />After hearing all of those comments you might be sitting there and wondering:&nbsp; If I am who the prophets have declared that I am, then why is the road so hard?&nbsp; Why am I struggling to find my strength and my purpose?&nbsp; Why do I falter?<br /><br />In preparing for this devotional, I have spoken to my children, nieces, and a young friend to have a sense of some of your questions, challenges, frustrations, and triumphs.&nbsp; I have pondered and prayed about what they have shared with me and have summarized them into points which I hope to share with you as answers to some of your musings or even answers to questions that you did not know you had.&nbsp; In so doing I pray for yours and the spirit's help as we try to seek learning by faith.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost, who is the only true teacher, can, during the time we are together, put thoughts in your mind and feelings in your heart.&nbsp; As you diligently seek it, he will teach you one on one and you will hear things that will not be said.<br /><br /><strong>Receiving Revelation (Answers to Questions)</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Contrary to how some of you might be feeling, may I categorically declare that our Heavenly Father does answer our prayers.&nbsp; Consider the following scriptures:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened." (3 Nephi 14:8)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&nbsp; (James 1:5)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart." (Doctrine and Covenants 8:2)</p>
<p>How then do we receive answers?&nbsp; How do we receive revelation?&nbsp; How do we know if it is the Holy Ghost prompting us and it is not just us thinking?&nbsp; Allow me to share with you two experiences in my life that have become patterns:</p>
<p>After Sister Teh and I dated a few times it became obvious that I wanted to spend eternity with her.&nbsp; Naturally, I have made it a subject of earnest prayer for many nights and also fasted a couple of times.&nbsp; There was no particular change in my feeling.&nbsp; I did not feel a burning in my bosom nor did I have goosebumps all over my body.&nbsp; I did, however, continue to feel good about my decision so I persevered.&nbsp; I am assuming that Sister Teh got the same answer so here we are.&nbsp; Many of my life's decisions after that experience and up to the present time, have been arrived at in a similar fashion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (Doctrine and Covenants 6:22-23)</p>
<p>Now, let me contrast that with experiences that I now have concerning specific assignments from the Twelve to reorganize a stake presidency and call a new stake president.&nbsp; As I approach this assignment in the spirit of prayer and fasting, I have been blessed with very distinct impressions to help me know who should be called as a stake president.&nbsp; The impressions come sometimes before, sometimes during, or sometimes even after the interview process.&nbsp; I always feel a burning in my bosom and I feel the hair on my arms rise.&nbsp; I have since recognized those as ways the Holy Ghost guides me in such assignments.</p>
<p>Why the difference in the way the Holy Ghost communicates with me?&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; The important thing is - I have learned to recognize these patterns in my life as ways that I receive personal revelation.&nbsp; I take comfort and confidence in the following admonition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." (Doctrine and Covenants 112:10)</p>
<p><strong>Knowing Good from Evil</strong></p>
<p>Some people think that in this world of increasing sophistry and technology that it is becoming harder and harder to distinguish right from wrong. &nbsp;There appears to be, at least in the minds of some people, more and more grey areas.&nbsp; Many of the incorrect but popular opinions of the day appear to make sense when viewed solely on very narrow lenses.&nbsp; Old garbage covered with new packaging and backed by creative advertising is still garbage.&nbsp;<br /><br />Discerning between what is right and what is wrong need not be a complicated activity for us.&nbsp; Even prior to our receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, we are blessed with the light of Christ.&nbsp; Consider the following teaching from the prophet Mormon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him." &nbsp;(Moroni 7:15-17)</p>
<p>One of the greatest tests of our day is sustaining the living prophet.&nbsp; Now, most of you will say:&nbsp; "Oh that is easy.&nbsp; I already got that.&nbsp; Check."&nbsp; However, it is quite amazing to see how some people who supposedly "sustain the living prophet," react to some of the popular opinions of the day.&nbsp; When faced with tremendous pressure - some people act or form opinions in a manner that suggests that they have never known that there is a living prophet on the earth today.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Right Balance</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Do you ever feel like there is so much to do, that there are so many demands on your time and it's pulling you from different directions?&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; It will only get worse.&nbsp; So the question is:&nbsp; How do you find the right balance? (sometimes just to keep your sanity.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Establish as your beacon or your North Star the eternal nature of our spirits.&nbsp; Focus your energy towards that truth and what that means.&nbsp; Everything else will either drop out of your life or fall into its proper place.&nbsp; I offer two scriptures (among others) that can serve as guiding principles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."&nbsp; (3 Nephi 13:33)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."&nbsp; (Matthew 6:19-21)</p>
<p>Believe it or not I was once in your shoes.&nbsp; There was a point in my life when I had a full-time job during the day, going to school at night, had a second part-time job after school until the wee hours of the morning, while Sister Teh and I were raising our young family.&nbsp; I only had a couple of hours sleep a few days a week for two months.&nbsp; On top of all of that, I was also serving in a ward bishopric.&nbsp; It was one of the most productive times in my life.&nbsp; I don't think I have ever utilized my 24 hours a day as efficiently as I did during that period of our lives.&nbsp; I am glad I made it out of that situation alive.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley gave this counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I think ... all of us in this Church ... have a fourfold responsibility. One, [members and leaders] have a responsibility to their families, to see that their families have a measure of their time. ... None of us can evade that. ... That is basic and fundamental.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we are employed, we have a responsibility to our employer. We are not at liberty to short-change him. ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We have a responsibility to the Lord, of course, to do that which is expected of us as a servant in His house.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And ... we have a responsibility to ourselves to take some time to do a little meditating, to do a little exercise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... How do you balance them? I don't think that is difficult. I served in many capacities in this Church. I am the father of five children, who were young and growing up when I was serving in those various capacities. ... We enjoyed life. ... We just did what the Church expected us to do."&nbsp; (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley&nbsp;(1997, 33).</p>
<p><strong>What It Means to Endure to the End</strong></p>
<p>Enduring to the end is not about completing a gospel checklist and then saying: "I'm good.&nbsp; All I have to do now is coast along and maintain it."&nbsp; It is about continually learning and growing.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus Christ is all about constant repentance and change.&nbsp; Therefore it is an uphill climb rather than a stroll in the park.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And others will he pacify, and&nbsp;<strong>lull them away into carnal security</strong>, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&mdash;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and&nbsp;<strong>leadeth them away carefully down to hell</strong>."&nbsp; (2 Nephi 28:21)</p>
<p>There are two phrases that jump out at me:&nbsp; "Lull them away into carnal security" and "leadeth them away carefully down to hell."&nbsp; To lull is to cause someone to become sleepy or to feel safe and relaxed instead of careful and alert.</p>
<p>"Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion.</p>
<p>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have."&nbsp; (2 Nephi 28:24, 30)</p>
<p>Those are very serious injunctions from the Lord.</p>
<p>Here's another scripture mastery scripture:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some members embrace that passage from King Benjamin because they use it as a justification for their unwillingness to try harder or do their best:&nbsp; The problem is they only focused on the first half of the passage.&nbsp; Here is the second half:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order."&nbsp; (Mosiah 4:27)</p>
<p>The two halves together clarify what it really means to do things in wisdom and order.</p>
<p>My young athletic friend who is an excellent ball player introduced me to the phenomenon called - "second wind."&nbsp; Here's how Wikipedia defines it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Second wind is a phenomenon in distance running,.... (as well as other sports), whereby an athlete who is too out of breath and tired to continue suddenly finds the strength to press on at top performance with less exertion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some scientists believe the second wind to be a result of the body finding the proper balance of oxygen to counteract the buildup of lactic acid in the muscles. Others claim second winds are due to endorphin production, while still others believe it to be purely psychological.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The phenomenon has come to be used as a metaphor for continuing on with renewed energy past the point thought to be one's prime, whether in other sports, careers, or life in general."</p>
<p>Let me quote part of what my friend said as he considers how he has had to find a "second wind" in some aspects of his life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That relates to college students, such as myself (now) because it can be really easy to come home from a late night and make an excuse to be too tired to say prayers or read some scriptures, or even make regular temple visits. There can be many excuses for not doing these things, (especially for college students.) But, in the end we need to find our "second winds" and do those little things."</p>
<p>I sometimes tease and say maybe instead of "enduring to the end", we should be "enjoying to the end."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My dear young friends, we love you and pray for you often. &nbsp;These are your days.&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father has reserved you to come forth in these last days.&nbsp; He loves each of you dearly.&nbsp; He sent His some to die for us that we might live.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you for that beautiful musical number. My father-in-law is fond of saying that what we need in the Church is better music and more of it, and better speaking and less of it. Maybe we should have another musical number.<br /><br />I'm grateful for the opportunity that I have to speak today. I'm grateful for my family who is here with me today. This coming Sunday is Fathers' Day, and I would like to pay a special tribute to my father, who is now in his 91st year, as well as to my mother. My father has had many experiences in his life, including serving as a belly gunner on a B-17 bomber during World War II. Here's Dad with a few of my boys next to the ball turret on the bottom of a B-17.<br /><br />My father and mother have worn out their lives in service, including raising nine children (with me being the non-spoiled baby of the family). But what they have&nbsp;<em>done&nbsp;</em>in their lives is not as significant as what they have&nbsp;<em>become</em>. Not only have they become the parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents of a great posterity, but they have also become true disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>A central message of the gospel is that we, as children of Heavenly Father, can change and become like Him and our Savior Jesus Christ. The process of becoming takes time, and is done step by step, line upon line. We go through experiences and seasons of life that provide us with opportunities to grow and change and take a step towards becoming like our Savior.<br /><br />One such step just concluded for our oldest son Jonathan who returned just two weeks ago from serving in the Wellington, New Zealand mission. In one of Jonathan's last emails he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I love New Zealand, and I love the people here. God has blessed me with so much love for so many people. ... I find it easier to love than I ever have before. I also love God and His Son more than I ever have before. What a great blessing."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>That season of missionary service provided Jonathan with the opportunity to learn more about the Savior, to serve Him and His children, and to become more like Him.</p>
<p>I sense that a similar thing is happening for our second son, Spencer, who will return next week from serving in the Johannesburg, South Africa mission. We read in his emails about the things that he is learning, and the things that he is doing, and occasionally we get a glimpse into his heart, and into who he is becoming. For example, a few months ago he wrote the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"On Saturday we went to the funeral of the brother who passed away last week. It was a unique experience. Me, my companion, and one other sister were the only white people in the congregation of about 250-300. There was a LOT of singing. I loved the beautiful African songs. I played the piano for the normal hymns and gave the closing prayer. I prayed in Zulu for a small part of the prayer. I wanted to let the people know that I am African too."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>These comments, along with some of the pictures we receive from him, indicate that a love for Africa and for the African people is growing in his heart and changing who he is. (I'm not sure, but I don't think that this is his normal proselyting attire.)</p>
<p><strong>What to Become</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Serving as a missionary can be a wonderful season of growth, of change, of becoming. But there are other opportunities for growth and change throughout life as well. For example, most of us here are currently associated with BYU-Idaho either as students or employees. What are we becoming during this season at BYU-Idaho? The goal of the university is to help you to become:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you becoming these things? Are there other, perhaps more specific or personal or immediate things that you are striving to become right now? For example, are you striving to develop kind feelings for a roommate or family member, or to become free from an addiction or bad habit, or to become more converted to a particular principle of the gospel? Is there one thing that you could identify that you would most like to become, or make progress towards becoming, over the next few months? I'll give you a second to think about that and to even write it down if you like.<br /><br />Okay, did everyone think of something? I hope that you can recognize whatever it was that you thought of as being a step towards becoming like the Savior.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to discuss 3 topics related to reaching our righteous goals and becoming more like the Savior:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1 - Our Role in the Process of Becoming</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The first topic is our role in the process of becoming. There are clearly things that we must do in order to change who we are and to become better. You're likely familiar with the Know-Do-Become process that you see each time you log into I-Learn. It may be that your computers load so fast that you've never actually seen that phrase before. If that's the case - here's a screenshot of it. This model suggests that changing and becoming better doesn't just happen automatically. There is action required of us. We must exert our own best efforts to create a change in our minds, a change in our actions, and a change in our hearts. The scriptures often remind us that we must give our very best effort. For example, in the Doctrine and Covenants we read:</p>
<p>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We must apply our very best mental, physical, and spiritual capacities as we strive to improve. Now, what about the goal you thought of earlier? What are the actions that you can take to make it happen? Maybe you need to reach out to someone in love and kindness. Maybe you need to install a filter on your computer. Maybe you need to put a reminder on your mirror to read scriptures or to pray. Whatever it is that you are striving to become, you must first figure out what effort is required of you, and then you must do it.<br /><br /><strong>2 - The Role of the Spirit</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The second topic is the role of the Spirit in the process of becoming. Just as it is clear that we must put forth our own efforts, it should be equally clear that we cannot become who we should become without the help of the Lord. This enabling power that comes from the Lord is referred to in the scriptures as grace. The Bible Dictionary says the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is ... through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The scriptures are full of references to this critical combination of personal effort and divine grace that is required for true change. In 2 Nephi 25:23 we read that, "... it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In Ether 12:27 we read that, "... my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And a special one for those of us who teach is found in D&amp;C 88:78, which says, "Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you..."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In each of these examples, and many more like them, we are taught the importance of our personal effort combined with the grace of God in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>I believe that a powerful manifestation of the grace of the Lord can be found in the ministry of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost not only guides, and witnesses, and comforts, but also enlightens and strengthens and empowers. The power of the Holy Ghost truly can magnify our individual efforts.&nbsp;<br /><br />So what part of the Know-Do-Become process does the Holy Ghost help us with? Well, maybe it's time for a quiz.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Holy Ghost can help me in my efforts to:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a. Know<br />b. Do<br />c. Become<br />d. All of the above</p>
<p>I would say that the correct answer is "d. All of the above." Regardless of what you are striving to become, whether it is one of the official university outcomes or one of your own improvement goals, the Holy Ghost will magnify your individual efforts to know and to do and to become.</p>
<p><strong>Know</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>First, the Holy Ghost can help us to learn and to know things, both in our minds and in our hearts. In Doctrine and Covenants 8:2 we read:<br /><br />Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>So the Holy Ghost can help us to gain both an intellectual knowledge and a spiritual witness of truth. We can&nbsp;<em>know&nbsp;</em>truth through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />The Holy Ghost enhances our individual efforts as we strive to learn and gain knowledge. The prophet Joseph Smith wrote the following relative to the experience that he and Oliver Cowdery had after they were both baptized:<br /><br />We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation. Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of.<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This illumination of truth through the power of the Holy Ghost does not just apply to obtaining "spiritual" knowledge. It applies to all truth. President Henry B. Eyring said:<br /><br />I know from my own experience, for example, that the Holy Ghost knows the mathematical equations used to solve problems in thermodynamics. I was a struggling physics student studying in a book that I still own. Halfway down a page, in the middle of some mathematics, I had a clear confirmation that what I was reading was true. It was exactly the feeling that had come to me before as I had pondered the Lord's scriptures and that I have had many times since. So I knew that the Holy Ghost understood whatever was true in what I might be asked on an examination in thermodynamics.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Holy Ghost helps us to learn and to know all truth.<br /><br /><strong>Do</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Second, the Holy Ghost can help us to "do," or to act in accordance with true principles. Throughout the Book of Mormon we read about how the Nephite armies were strengthened when they were righteous and had the Spirit with them, and how they lost that strength when the Spirit was not with them. In Mormon 2:26 we read:<br /><br />And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them; nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Spirit gives us strength to act; a lack of the Spirit leaves us "to ourselves."</p>
<p><strong>Become</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Third, the Holy Ghost can change our hearts and help us to "become." After King Benjamin had taught his people he desired to know if they believed his words.<br /><br />And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Holy Ghost had wrought a change in their hearts, in their very dispositions. President Henry B. Eyring has said:<br /><br />It is not surprising that when we feel the influence of the Holy Ghost, we also can feel that our natures are being changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We feel an increased desire to keep His commandments, to do good, and to deal justly.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Holy Ghost is essential in our efforts to change our natures and our dispositions and to become like the Savior.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to think back to the goal that you thought of or wrote down earlier. Are there ways in which the Holy Ghost could help you in achieving your goal? Are there things that you need to learn, or do, or feel that would be made easier or more effective with the assistance of the Holy Ghost? If your goal is going to truly change who you are, it is likely that you will need the Holy Ghost to help you achieve it fully.<br /><br />So far we have talked about (1) our role in the process of becoming, and (2) the role of the Spirit in that process. Let's go now to the third topic, which is about obtaining the Spirit through the word of God.<br /><br /><strong>3 - Obtaining the Spirit through the Word of God</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>If the Spirit is so essential for us to become who we need to become, then how can we get it more fully in our lives? Whatever else we may do, we&nbsp;<em>must&nbsp;</em>learn and follow the word of God.<br /><br />There is a special connection between the word of God and the Holy Ghost. Part of that connection comes from the fact that the Holy Ghost is the primary means by which the Lord communicates his word to us, either directly through personal revelation, or through prophets. Even though prophets may at times talk with heavenly beings or with the Lord directly, they also receive the word of God through the Holy Ghost. For example, the prophet Mormon told his son Moroni how he received an answer to a particular question. Mormon said, "For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Then, after explaining what he had learned, Mormon concludes by saying, "And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;So, the Holy Ghost manifests the word of God to us.<br /><br /><strong>Spiritual Power from Studying the Word of God</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Another part of the connection between the word of God and the Holy Ghost comes from the fact that the Holy Ghost witnesses of the truthfulness of the word of God when we receive it, and gives us power and strength to follow it. President Benson taught of the spiritual power that comes to us through the word of God, and particularly from the Book of Mormon, when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is not just that the Book of Mormon teaches us truth, though it indeed does that. It is not just that the Book of Mormon bears testimony of Christ, though it indeed does that, too. But there is something more. There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So we can receive power to follow the strait and narrow path as we study the word of God. That strait and narrow path was described by Lehi in his vision of the tree of life. You'll recall that a rod of iron, which represents the word of God, ran along the path and lead to the tree. Now, I'm not exactly sure why it was an iron rod, and not a golden rod or a mahogany rod, or some other material, but iron has some properties that I think are symbolic of the word of God. First, iron is very strong (even stronger than gold or silver). Likewise, the word of God is sure and steadfast. Second, iron is electrically conductive. That means that electrical current, or electrical power, can flow through iron. Similarly, spiritual power flows through the word of God. As President Benson said, "There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The connection between the word of God and the Holy Ghost is so strong that the two are sometimes discussed almost synonymously in the scriptures. In Ephesians 6:17 we are counseled to, "... take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;In 2 Nephi 32:3 we are told that, "... the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Then just two verses later we read that, "... the Holy Ghost ... will show unto you all things what ye should do."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Boyd K. Packer explained that, "At your baptism and confirmation, you took hold of the iron rod."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;It is significant that being baptized and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, is indicative of our taking hold of the iron rod and stepping onto the path that leads to the tree of life. President Packer also said that, "If you hold to the rod, you can feel your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost, conferred upon you at the time you were confirmed a member of the church."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The word of God and the Holy Ghost go together.</p>
<p>In order to receive the blessings of the Spirit that come through the word of God, we need to regularly and consistently study the scriptures. President Benson has said:<br /><br />However diligent we may be in other areas, certain blessings are to be found only in the scriptures, only in coming to the word of the Lord and holding fast to it as we make our way through the mists of darkness to the tree of life.<sup>24</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>So, in addition to other things that we might do to invite the Spirit into our lives, we must tap into the spiritual power that flows through the word of God. If you do not currently have a habit of regular scripture study, you need to begin. Whatever else you are doing with your time, your efforts to&nbsp;<em>become&nbsp;</em>will be less effective without the spiritual power that is available through the word of God. Exercise faith by making scripture study a priority in your life.<br /><br /><strong>Spiritual Power from Giving Heed to the Word of God</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Now, it's not just in&nbsp;<em>studying&nbsp;</em>the word of God that we can increase the Spirit in our lives, but it's also in&nbsp;<em>giving heed</em>&nbsp;to the word of God. Right after explaining to his brothers that the iron rod was a representation of the word of God, Nephi said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Modern-day prophets have taught that, in addition to studying the word of God, giving heed to, or acting in accordance with the word of God, brings the Spirit into our lives. In the introduction to the For The Strength of Youth booklet, the First Presidency state:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We promise that as you keep the covenants you have made and these standards, you will be blessed with the companionship of the Holy Ghost...<sup>26</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As you review the individual principles in the booklet, you will find that many of them speak directly about the blessings of the Spirit that come as you follow the principles that are taught. For example:</p>
<p></p>
<p><sup></sup>And so forth. As you live in accordance with a particular principle of the gospel, you will receive the Spirit more strongly into your life, which can strengthen you to live other principles of the gospel. Conversely, breaking one of the commandments can leave you spiritually weakened and deprive you of the Spirit that could have helped you improve in other areas.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson compared this situation to a parachute or sail that is tethered by several chords, each representing a particular spiritual quality or attribute. He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... imagine what would happen if one of the supporting cords breaks&mdash;the cord of honesty, for example. If that cord breaks, additional strain is immediately imposed on neighboring cords of chastity, virtue, and benevolence, in accordance with the law of sequential stress.<sup>31</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Breaking one aspect of the law of God can lead to a loss of the Spirit, which strains our capacity to live other aspects of the law of God. So, if you are striving to develop patience and kind feelings towards a roommate, but are viewing pornography, your spiritual strength to accomplish your goal will be diminished. On the other hand, if you view only wholesome and uplifting materials you will have an increase of the Spirit, which will help you to achieve your other righteous goals. Giving heed to, or living in accordance with, the word of God brings spiritual power.</p>
<p>So here's the final question relative to the goal that you thought of earlier: is there something that you can do relative to studying the word of God or giving heed to the word of God that would help you to have the Spirit more strongly in your life? Do you need to recommit to a pattern of regular scripture study? Is there some principle of the word of God with which you are out of compliance that, if corrected, would increase the Spirit in your life? Right now is the best time to commit to make any necessary changes.</p>
<p>So far we have discussed:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever it is that we are striving to become, we need to put forth our own best efforts to know, to do, and to become. Then we need to seek for the strengthening power of the Holy Ghost, especially by studying and giving heed to the word of God. As we do, we will begin to change, and to become who we are intended to become.<br /><br /><strong>Promised Blessings</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>So what's the end of all of this effort, of all of this&nbsp;<em>becoming</em>? We can find out by going back to Lehi's dream. Remember that, in the dream, there were some who progressed along the path and actually arrived at the tree and partook of the fruit, but who were then ashamed because of those who were mocking, and so, "fell away into forbidden paths and were lost."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Could it be that this group of people had simply gone through the motions of the gospel, but had not experienced a mighty change of heart, and had not truly become like the Savior? Let's compare this group's reaction with that of the next group that Lehi describes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down, and partook of the fruit of the tree.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This group, I believe, did experience a change of heart, wrought by the Holy Ghost, as they pressed forward holding fast to the iron rod. When Nephi had his own vision of the tree of life, he learned what the true meaning of the tree was, and why the people may have fallen down when they arrived there.</p>
<p>And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw? And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things. And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul. And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>If we press forward in our efforts to improve and to become like the Savior, continually holding fast to the iron rod and the Spirit that it brings, we will change and will be filled with the love of Savior. Then, as Mormon taught, "... when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is..."<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;That is who we can become. That is the joyous message of the gospel. I know that it is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Department of Animal &amp; Food Science Faculty Member</p>
<p>With a research interest in carbohydrates, particularly in the starch chemistry of cereal grains and potatoes, Brother Kerry Huber joined the Animal and Food Science faculty at BYU-Idaho two years ago.&nbsp; He came to us from the University of Idaho, where he was a professor in the School of Food Science for 15 years.<br /><br /> Dr. Huber earned a bachelor's and master's degree from BYU in Food Science, and a PhD in Food Chemistry from Purdue University.<br /><br /> Brother Huber has served as an early morning seminary teacher, a bishop, a stake president, and is currently the Young Men president in his ward.&nbsp; In his spare time, he enjoys fly-fishing, backpacking, hiking, and gardening.&nbsp; <br /><br /> He and his wife, Lori, are the parents of one daughter and 3 sons.&nbsp; Their daughter, BreAnne, is a BYU-Idaho student, and their oldest son, Christopher, is leaving next month for the Philippines Cavite Mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I attend these weekly devotionals, I am consistently impressed with both the spirit and attitude of preparation that you bring each week - as evidenced by the many notebooks I see on the laps of individuals.&nbsp; If there is a downside to this - it is that you have made my preparations that much more difficult, as I have truly felt the need to seek the Lord's guidance. &nbsp;I personally thank each of you for your faith and obedience, which make this campus a special and unique place where the Spirit of the Lord truly dwells.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Lamanites Deceived from "Stronghold"</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In Alma chapter 52 of the Book of Mormon, the Nephites found themselves in "dangerous circumstances."&nbsp; Due to internal strife, they had lost many of their lands to the Lamanites, including a number of heavily fortified cities they described as "strongholds."&nbsp; To fortify them against attack, Captain Moroni had earlier caused high mounds of earth to be raised up around the cities, upon which wooden fence-like fortifications and guard towers were constructed.&nbsp; Teancum, one of the Nephite commanders, had been charged with recapturing the "stronghold" city of Mulek.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;"...but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs...to wait for the coming of Moroni..."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>After Captain Moroni arrived, the chief captains determined that the best approach would be to somehow convince the Lamanites to abandon their fortified position.&nbsp; Their next course of action was to simply send a message to the Lamanite commander, requesting that the Lamanites come out of the city and do battle on the open plains.&nbsp; Of course, the Lamanites flatly refused this "generous" offer and elected to remain within the security of their "stronghold" (yeah, go figure).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair grounds...resolved upon a plan that he might&nbsp;decoy&nbsp;the Lamanites out of their strongholds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; ...when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto...their leader.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor. And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the city, and take possession of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And thus they did..."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As the story concludes, the Lamanite army that had left the city of Mulek in pursuit of Teancum and his small army eventually became surrounded by multiple Nephite armies.&nbsp; In the ensuing battle, the Lamanites lost many men, including their leader, and were ultimately forced to surrender.&nbsp; It is interesting to note how the Lamanites - in just a quick turn of events - went from a recognized position of strength to one of extreme vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see the irony here?&nbsp; When directly asked by the Nephites to leave their "stronghold" and come out to battle, they flatly refused!&nbsp; The Lamanites recognized that they held a definite position of strength over the Nephites, and they were not about to give that up.&nbsp; However, when approached in a slightly different manner, they willingly relinquished their position of strength and abandoned the security of their "stronghold" - to ultimately suffer a disastrous consequence.&nbsp;<br /><br />What might account for this difference?&nbsp; In the second instance, the Nephites appeared to simply appeal to the carnal or wicked nature of the Lamanites.&nbsp; Earlier in the book of Alma, the Lamanites are described as "...a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites..."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In short, Captain Moroni simply provided the Lamanites with an opportunity they could not refuse - a chance to lay waste to a small group of Nephites - and they willingly took the bait.&nbsp; What appeared at the time to be certain victory ultimately became a crushing downfall and defeat.</p>
<p>I invite each of you to further ponder this story with me.&nbsp; What are some spiritual lessons that may be gained from these described events?</p>
<p><strong>Our Gospel "Stronghold"</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Like the Lamanites in the story, we need to recognize that we occupy a position of great strength here in mortality - the equivalent of a fortified "stronghold."&nbsp; First, each of us possesses the God-given capacity to act for ourselves.&nbsp; Thus, "the power" is in us, wherein we are "agents" unto ourselves<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;- to choose who and what we will ultimately become.&nbsp; In the pre-existence, Satan "sought to destroy the agency of man."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; After falling short of this objective, he now seeks to destroy man through our misuse of that same agency.&nbsp; Thus, the battle over agency continues here in mortality - with Satan seeking to have us willingly relinquish our God-given right to choose - something we opposed in the pre-existence.</p>
<p>A second element of our fortified "stronghold" is the gospel framework or iron rod, consisting of doctrines, commandments, ordinances, and covenants - all founded upon the Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Thirdly, to enhance our capacity to make righteous choices, our Father in Heaven has blessed us with two key influences, the Light of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the scriptures, the Light of the Christ is described as "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and is the means by which all are given to discern good from evil.&nbsp; The prophet, Mormon, further promises us the ability to make this judgment with "perfect knowledge" - "as the daylight is from the dark night."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; With this assurance, we can consciously determine our own path - to choose either "liberty and eternal life" or "captivity and death."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In regard to the Gift of the Holy Ghost, President Wilford Woodruff stated that there is "no greater gift," "blessing," or "testimony given to any man on the earth."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; This heavenly communication leaves an imprint on both our hearts and minds,<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and provides a divine sense of peace, comfort, strength, conviction, truth, enlightenment, and sanctification - blessings otherwise not available to us in mortality.<br /><br />The prophet, Nephi, testified that the Holy Ghost "will&nbsp;show&nbsp;unto you all things what ye should do."<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Light of Christ and Gift of the Holy Ghost represent the capstone elements of our gospel "stronghold," and are the key means by which our gift of agency is protected and developed to achieve our Godly potential.<br /><br /><strong>Satan Seeks to Lure Us from Our Gospel "Stronghold"</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>With access to both the Light of Christ and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, it would seem that Satan should, in theory, have no power over us, as these two gifts together would seem to represent a virtually impenetrable "stronghold."&nbsp; Nevertheless, Satan seeks to neutralize or compromise the strength of our position by dulling our sensitivity to these Godly influences - through distraction, disobedience, discouragement, and sin.&nbsp; The Liahona - which is a type for the Holy Ghost - ceased to provide needed direction for Lehi and his family in times of disobedience - causing them to lose their way or fail to progress in their journey<sup>12</sup>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Kevin W. Pearson of the Seventy succinctly put it, "If you lose the Spirit, you are lost."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; This lack of heavenly guidance equates to a compromised or weakened spiritual state. The scriptures describe this state or condition as being "past feeling,"<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;having the mind or understanding "darkened,"<sup>15,16</sup>&nbsp;or my personal favorite, "walking in darkness at noon-day."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp; These phrases all describe an inability to access the spiritual light around us - not because it does not exist, but rather because of a reduced capacity on our part to recognize or perceive it.&nbsp; All of us have experienced this condition, as we are imperfect beings who occasionally make mistakes.<br /><br />In a compromised spiritual state, we become more vulnerable to being drawn out of our gospel "stronghold" - due to a reduced capacity to discern right from wrong and to obtain guidance from the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The further removed we become from our gospel "stronghold," the greater power Satan gains over us - as we are left to our own understanding in our life judgments and choices. &nbsp;If allowed to persist, this compromised spiritual condition leads to destruction - for both nations and individuals.&nbsp; The prophet Nephi described this progression as he foresaw the future destruction of his own people 1,000 years before it actually occurred.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...I have seen it...; and they sell themselves for naught; ...for the reward of their pride and their&nbsp;foolishness&nbsp;they shall reap destruction....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the Spirit of the Lord will not always&nbsp;strive&nbsp;with man. &nbsp;And when the Spirit&nbsp;ceaseth&nbsp;to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction..."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In the account of the Lamanite defeat, it is easy to be critical of the Lamanites and wonder how they could have been so foolish - or even stupid.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most of us can relate all too well with the plight of the Lamanites - because it mirrors the strategy used by the adversary to lure each of us out of our gospel "stronghold."&nbsp; The adversary generally does not openly invite us to knowingly commit sin - since we would flatly refuse the invitation - just as the Lamanites initially refused to give up the security of their "stronghold."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather, the adversary appeals to our carnal or worldly tendencies - those aspects of the natural man or woman - to bring us out of our gospel "stronghold" into a state of spiritual vulnerability.&nbsp; We can each pinpoint circumstances when we have experienced unfortunate"Lamanite moments" in our lives.&nbsp; The adversary - through gradual and subtle means - seeks ultimately to convince us to willingly give up that which we had never intended to give up in the first place.&nbsp; Ironically, this outcome can only occur to the extent that we choose it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Recognize and Counter the Tactics of the Adversary</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In the latter-day war with the adversary, Elder David A. Bednar, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, taught that "understanding the intent of an enemy is a key prerequisite to effective preparation."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;The adversary generally targets our individual weaknesses, utilizing tactics of distraction and deception.&nbsp; Let's explore the underlying basis for some of Satan's temptations and the tactics needed to counter them.<br /><br />In Lehi's dream of the Tree of Life, the temptations of the devil are depicted by "mists of darkness."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; One prominent function of the "mists of darkness" is to simply shield our view of the tree, which represents Christ.&nbsp; If you have ever seen a fog gradually settle in, the first thing that is lost is the ability to see far off into the distance. In this way, Satan's "mists" can cause us to lose sight of our eternal purpose and destination while here in mortality. &nbsp;Simple distraction is enough to keep us from progressing to the tree.</p>
<p>One of Satan's greatest weapons of mass destruction is "mass distraction."&nbsp; Given the technological advances of our day, consider the adversary's potential to access the masses through a single cell phone app, video game, movie, iTunes song, or whatever the new thing of the day might be.&nbsp; Downloads for the most popular game apps exceed 100 million.&nbsp; In our day, there is potential to unwittingly enter the "great and spacious building" with the simple push of a button - and not even recognize it.</p>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles recently cautioned us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Sometimes, it feels like we are drowning in frivolous foolishness, nonsensical noise, and&nbsp;continuous contention.&nbsp; When we turn down the volume and examine the substance, there is very little that will assist us in our eternal quest toward righteous goals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...Many choices are not inherently evil, but if they absorb all of our time and keep us from the best choices, then they become insidious."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Becoming distracted in life is akin to treading water - which requires a constant activity of both your arms and legs just to keep your head above water and to avoid sinking.&nbsp; Thus, all of your available resources are required just to keep you afloat - yet the grand reality of all this energy expenditure is that it gets you nowhere - it simply involves swimming in place.</p>
<p>A state of distraction is often accompanied by the notion that contentment in life is achieved only through the selfish pursuit of pleasure, amusement or, new and exciting things.&nbsp; Distraction hinders development of our faith and our sensitivity to the Spirit, because it crowds out from our lives the essential things that would otherwise create them.&nbsp; In a distracted state, our resolve to remain within our spiritual "stronghold" is weakened, and we can be oblivious the potential reality that we may be "walking in darkness at noon-day."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>"And others will he&nbsp;pacify, and lull them away into carnal&nbsp;security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&mdash;and thus the&nbsp;devil&nbsp;cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In our quiet moments when we are separated from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we might ask ourselves - Am I anxiously engaged or casually distracted? &nbsp;Do I feel true peace or emptiness?&nbsp; We can choose to break free of distractions that might hold us captive by re-focusing our efforts on things that bring the Holy Ghost - the true source of peace and direction - into our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Hilbig of the Seventy has stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...if you set your personal contribution high, you will reap an abundant harvest from the Spirit.&nbsp; The payment I reference is...a greater commitment to and involvement in personal spiritual endeavors and behaviors.&nbsp; We determine the level of our current contribution by examining our present choices and priorities...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...Would you consider investing more of your time in the things of eternity in order to merit the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and to benefit more fully from His influence?"<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>There are always things we can strive to do better to merit a greater portion of the Lord's Spirit in our lives.&nbsp; In setting personal priorities, we cannot overlook the "little-big" things - the little things that make the big difference.&nbsp; We all know them - they include personal prayer, daily scripture study, meaningful partaking of the sacrament, Sabbath day observance, temple worship, and service to others.</p>
<p>Acting in these "little things" now prepares us to receive spiritual guidance and have the needed faith to act in the future critical challenges of our lives.<br /><br />For Sister Huber and I, one such occasion was the birth of our first child.&nbsp; With every contraction, our daughter's heart rate would slow and almost stop - the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck.&nbsp; The doctor told us if the situation did not improve in the next twenty minutes, he would need to deliver our daughter by C-section.&nbsp; As I began to fill out the consent paperwork for the procedure, I was bothered by the fact that Sister Huber had received two priesthood blessings, both of which had blessed her with a normal delivery.&nbsp; Not knowing what else to do, I called my dad for fatherly counsel.&nbsp; While on the phone, the words distinctly came into my mind - She has already had two priesthood blessings, it's time to exercise some faith.&nbsp; As I hung up the phone, I admit that I was somewhat nervous to follow through on the prompting I had received.&nbsp; As we discussed the situation, Sister Huber and I both agreed to consciously exercise our faith.&nbsp; Amazingly, not once during the next 15 minutes did our daughter's heart rate slow as it had before.&nbsp; As the nurse returned, she was surprised to note that our daughter was ready to be born - it all worked out in the end.&nbsp; I was grateful that, at that point in my life, I was in a position to not only receive the prompting of the Spirit, but to have the faith and confidence needed to act on it to bless my family.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Another function of Satan's "mists of darkness" is to impair our more immediate view as we progress along the gospel path.&nbsp; If you have ever experienced a thick fog, you know firsthand that the details of objects and landmarks - even at close distances - is somewhat clouded and obscured.&nbsp; Satan's "mists of darkness" are intended to disguise or hide the true identity of his counterfeits that are placed either alongside the path - or just far enough off the path that we have to temporarily let go of the iron rod to wander after them. &nbsp;Satan does not want us to have a clear view of his temptations, because they are not what they are advertised to be.&nbsp; Without this deception, we would never opt for them in the first place.&nbsp; If acted upon, these temptations bring about spiritual darkness by cutting us off from spiritual light - thus, they are literally "mists of darkness."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are only two forces in the world - good and evil.&nbsp; Whether we recognize it or not, our small daily decisions take us in one direction or the other - even though the daily shift may be so slight that it is difficult to discern.&nbsp; However, it is these seemingly small everyday decisions that matter most, because they chart our long-term direction and destination.&nbsp; Mormon admonished us to "search diligently in the Light of Christ that ye may know good from evil..."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp; His counsel suggests that some effort and pondering on our part may be required to correctly make these judgements - it may not just happen automatically.&nbsp; We would be wise to apply Mormon's counsel to the movies, television shows, internet sites, music - or anything for that matter - that we choose to bring into our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar further instructed us to pay close attention to the spiritual impact of our daily choices:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The standard is clear.&nbsp; If something we think, see, hear, or do distances us from the Holy Ghost, then we should stop thinking, seeing, hearing, or doing that thing.&nbsp; If that which is intended to entertain, for example, alienates us from the Holy Spirit, then certainly that type of entertainment is not for us.&nbsp; Because the Spirit cannot abide that which is vulgar, crude, or immodest, then clearly such things are not for us.&nbsp; Because we estrange the Spirit of the Lord when we engage in activities we know we should shun, then such things are definitely not for us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I recognize that we are fallen men and women living in a mortal world and that we might not have the presence of the Holy Ghost with us every second of every day.&nbsp; However, the Holy Ghost can tarry with us much, if not most, of the time - and certainly the Spirit can be with us more than it is not with us..."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>Thus, the Holy Ghost serves as an effective barometer in our own lives and offers the needed clarity to see through Satan's temptations to recognize them for what they truly are - invitations to misery.&nbsp; What current practices or activities in our own lives might stand in the way of us experiencing a greater portion of the Lord's Spirit?&nbsp; &nbsp;We can choose to lose ground, regain position, if needed, or to fortify.</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught that it is through the process of yielding "to the enticings of the Holy Ghost" that we put off the natural man and become "a saint through the atonement of Christ."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp; As we heed the enticings of the Spirit, the sanctifying influence of the Holy Ghost will cause us to become increasingly spiritually-minded and less carnally-minded.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp; These changes in our nature make us less susceptible to Satan's influence, and solidify our position within our gospel "stronghold."&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In summary, our Father in Heaven has provided each of us the opportunity to become as He is and to receive all that He has - our potential is truly glorious.&nbsp; Nothing that Satan has to offer that can even compare.&nbsp; Each of us should take confidence in the fact that we hold a position of strength here in mortality - our God-given freedom to choose is true power. &nbsp;The influences of the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost preserve and protect our power of agency.&nbsp; We retain power over Satan through our righteous decisions that allow the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost to be active forces in our lives.&nbsp; Thus, in the end, our gospel "stronghold" can be as effective as we choose to make it.<br /><br />I would like to conclude with a personal experience that occurred at our home several years ago.&nbsp; I had gone outside to turn on our barbecue grill, when I noticed a quail sitting on the railing of our deck.&nbsp; I only noticed the quail because it was making a terrible racket - to the point of being annoying.&nbsp; As I looked across my yard in the direction the quail was directing the noise, I noticed the neighbor's cat sitting under our tree.&nbsp; I became intrigued and walked over toward the cat.&nbsp; As I got close, I noticed that the cat had something in its mouth, and I came to see that it was a tiny baby quail.&nbsp; Armed with my barbecue utensil, I scared the cat away, and it dropped the baby quail from its mouth onto the grass.&nbsp; The baby quail was still alive, so I went back into the house to give the mother quail a chance to attend to its missing baby.&nbsp; I gathered my family and together we watched from the window.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, the mother quail flew down to the ground, and began to make a call that was noticeably different than the one she had made before.&nbsp; In response to the call, we were all surprised to see not just one, but five, baby quail immediately pop up from different areas of the grass, and began to quickly make their way to their mother.&nbsp; The mother continued making the sound until all of the baby quail, including the one that had been in the cat's mouth, had all arrived safely back to her.</p>
<p>It became clear that the initial call made by the mother quail was a voice of warning - instructing the baby quail to take deep cover in the grass.&nbsp; The latter sound was a call to gather.&nbsp; Thus, there was safety and security to be had for the baby quail in both recognizing and responding to the specific instruction that was given.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, our Savior, has promised the same to each of us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who will gather his people as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many will hearken to my voice, humble themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer."<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>I bear witness that the ultimate role of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son,<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;and to gather all to Christ - as many as will hearken to His voice - that at a future day we may be brought safely back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I personally know that as we are "wise" and choose to take the Holy Spirit as our "guide,"<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;that we will not only successfully abide that "great and dreadful day of the Lord"<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;that is certain to come, but also each and every day of our mortal lives.&nbsp; As we do so, I testify that our gospel "stronghold" in this life will be built on the "sure foundation" of Jesus Christ, "whereon if upon if men build they cannot fall."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp; Let us all choose to make it so....In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Department of Foundations &amp; Interdisciplinary Studies Faculty Member</p>
<p>Colonel Guy Hollingsworth returned last summer from a 400-day deployment to Afghanistan, where he served as the Department of Defense Lead for the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell. Five years ago he completed another 400-day combat tour to Iraq, where he was involved in training soldiers.&nbsp; He is a veteran of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. He is an Army Reserve Brigade Commander in Norfolk, VA.&nbsp; He has been a member of the National Guard or Army Reserve for nearly 40 years, and is the recipient of several outstanding awards, including the Bronze Star.<br /><br /> Dr. Hollingsworth holds a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees in various disciplines, and a PhD in Education.&nbsp; Formerly an Associate Academic Vice President at BYU-Idaho, he is now a full time faculty member, specifically teaching and revising courses on Pakistan and the Middle East.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Brother Hollingsworth grew up in Preston, Idaho and served as a full time missionary in the New Mexico Albuquerque mission.&nbsp; In 2009, he was the president of the Baghdad Iraq Military District, and last year was the president of the Bagram Afghanistan Branch.&nbsp; Brother Hollingsworth and his wife, Chris, are the parents of two children and have one grandchild.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon my brothers and sisters. It is my privilege to be with you today. I thank you for coming, because I was fearful that you wouldn't, and even though you being here adds to my nervousness, I have prayed and fasted that the Lord will bless me and you during the short time we have together this afternoon.&nbsp;On this 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of July week, I would be remise as a soldier if I didn't say something about the United States of America and about freedom in general (recognizing certainly that some of you come from other great nations as well).<br /><br />I want you to know that I was as proud to put my uniform on today as I was nearly 40 years ago when I put it on for the first time on my 17<sup>th</sup>birthday. I have added up all the time I have been away from my wife due to military duty in our 33 years of marriage&mdash;and that separation totals a little over 14 years. I don't mention that statistic for you to feel sorry for me or for my sweetheart, (many other seasoned military personnel would have a similar statistic), but to remind you to thank a soldier, or sailor, or airman, or Marine when you see them in uniform&mdash;many who have sacrificed much, as have their families. I say that also recognizing the courageous veterans who came before me.<br /><br />Freedom is hard to come by and even harder to hold on to. A University of Illinois report some time ago stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"National constitutions [around the world] have lasted an average of only 16 years since 1789. The U.S. Constitution has lasted over 225 years. They are fragile organisms at best."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Ours, brothers and sisters, is considered the longest surviving constitution in the world.</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson once said (and I am paraphrasing) that if you added up all the people who have ever lived on this earth, you would find that less than one half of one percent enjoy the freedoms you and I enjoy today.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Be grateful for that freedom that allows you and me to be here this afternoon.<br /><br />Coming from a combat veteran perspective, I'd like to now speak a bit to the principle of preparation, and to borrow a military term, address in a personal manner "Your Own Soldiers Call to Duty" as you and I continue to serve in the Lord's Army and look to live the gospel in a more disciplined approach. In doing so this day you must know that I make no attempt to sound impressive or imply that I am a hero&mdash;for I am neither&mdash;but simply attempt to strengthen your commitment to the gospel and testimony of the Savior.</p>
<p><em>"Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."<sup>3</sup></em></p>
<p>We indeed are all certainly trying to be good soldiers for the Savior.</p>
<p>A few months ago I ran a half marathon, one that I had prepared for diligently for many months prior to the event. The start line is always an exciting time for me and as the first few miles unfolded that day, I made an attempt as I always do on staying mentally focused. At about the 10-mile mark, as often is the case, I found myself settled in with a group of runners who had about the same pace I did at that stage of the run.<br /><br />One particular young lady at that point (she was probably half my age), touched me on the shoulder and asked me how I was doing (I must have looked in rough shape to her). I pulled out one of my earbuds and reassured her I was doing alright and felt good with about three miles to go. I returned the question and asked her how she was doing, to which she replied; "Great, I want to finish strong, and my goal at this point is to finish ahead of you!" I chuckled and said, "Well that shouldn't be difficult, as I am old, slow, and fat." She laughed at my comment, and then I added this statement as we continued running along the course, "But remember this young lady, keep in mind, that if you are running close to me with a quarter mile to go before the finish line, I have a nasty kick that will come into play." She laughed again and I put the earbud with music back in my ear.<br /><br />As I continued to lumber along, I thought about her challenge to finish ahead of me and about my preparation for the race. I had run over 3,000 miles the previous year in Afghanistan virtually all on a treadmill&mdash;but at that time for a different reason&mdash;to keep up with the rigor of my military assignment in a combat zone. I thought about the endless hours of running I'd done since returning home leading up to this race where I had strapped on the running shoes and hit the pavement to pay the price leading up to this event. I thought about my commitment to be consistent and my effort to improve along the way. I thought about the days I didn't feel like running or working out, but forced myself to do so anyway, because I knew it would help me succeed in the end. I thought about the promise I made to myself to progress in earnest as the day of the run approached. I knew I had paid the price to succeed.<br /><br />That said, sure enough at the final turn which indeed left about a quarter mile to the finish line, this young lady was still running next to me, and I asked her at that point if she was ready for my final kick, and she assured me that she was. I then turned on that nasty kick that I spoke of and by the time I crossed the finish line, she was about 100 meters in my rearview mirror.<br /><br />My point with this story now as it relates to things spiritual, is the need for each one of us to look at our daily preparation to serve the Lord. Do we pay the price and prepare for callings regardless of how big or small, despite the inconvenience of trying to line up with our busy schedules each day? Or do we think that we can or will accept that calling during the next phase of our lives when it is more convenient? Do we look at being ready to serve as a seasonal issue, if you will, and let preparation lag behind for the time being? The word "prepare" is noted over 470 times in the scriptures. There is a reason for that I believe.<br /><br />By the way, I had a quick visit with the young lady when she finished a few seconds after me in the race and I gloated over my little victory for about 30 seconds&mdash;until I was reminded by a friend that there were over 2,000 runners who finished ahead of me&mdash;a lesson in staying humble and a talk for another day&mdash;but let me shift gears.<br /><br />In the summer of 1977, I waited anxiously for my mission call. Most of my friends and classmates had already left on their missions, and that summer was a lesson on patience for me. Leading up to that event in my life I had prayed on a regular basis that my Heavenly Father would send me on a foreign mission. After years of fervently praying for such to take place, I was confident the Lord would answer my prayers with an exotic location to spend my two years as a fulltime missionary.<br /><br />The call finally came on a hot afternoon while I was working for a local plumber. My younger brother brought me the large envelope that so many of you have received. I'm not sure why I didn't wait to open the call later that night with my family, but it simply wasn't something we did back then it seemed. I wiped the sweat and dirt from my brow and wiped my hands off on my already muddy pants, and tore the big envelope open. From looking at a number of mission calls over the previous months, I knew right where to look in the letter for those wonderful words telling where I would serve, (first paragraph&mdash;third line). My eyes quickly tried to focus on the print through the sweat, and for an instant I was sure the Lord indeed had been good and kind to me, and had answered my repeated prayers. I was sure my first glance comprehended the words "Acapulco Mexico," and then as I looked with more intent, I realized the actual words on the paper read "Albuquerque, New Mexico." I suddenly became breathless, as if someone had punched me in the stomach. How could it be so? I stood there for a moment in disbelief, then became angry, threw the mission call to the ground, left that muddy ditch, and drove home. I went directly to my room, threw myself on the bed, and wept like a little child. How could this be so after years of what I thought were fervent prayers? Later that night, when the anger subsided to some degree, I offered a half-hearted prayer to the heavens. I asked in a bit of subdued rage as it were, "Surely Heavenly Father, there is no one better prepared than me to serve a foreign mission?" The following scripture applied to my situation that day.</p>
<p><em>"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord."<sup>4</sup></em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now&mdash;you must know&mdash;that I still have my mission call letter, and it still has mud on it. I indeed served two years in the Albuquerque New Mexico mission&mdash;two wonderful years&mdash;and my prayers now are such that I might be blessed to go back there with my good wife someday and serve again. I had a tremendous experience there and it truly was and I'm sure still is the best mission in the Church. But&mdash;that day&mdash;my heart was not in the right place, and I learned a valuable lesson, that satisfying my plans to serve where and when in the Church was not the right approach to find out what my Heavenly Father had in store for me. That day taught me the deeper concept of obedience, the necessity for submission, and in my case, the sting of humility in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Over 30 years after that humbling missionary call experience, I got a very different call&mdash;this one from the Pentagon. After the officer on the phone confirmed with me that I was indeed the COL Guy Hollingsworth she had been ordered to contact, I was told that I was being deployed to Iraq for 400 days with a particular assignment in mind. After listening to the assignment and being somewhat stunned by what I was hearing, I asked the Pentagon officer something similar to what I had asked my Heavenly Father in an angry prayer over three decades earlier, although I switched up the words a bit this time. I said, "Surely Ma'am, there is someone better than me prepared to serve in this Middle East assignment." Then I asked myself when I hung up the phone, "Had I prepared properly for such an assignment in a dangerous combat zone?" Deep down inside I realized the years of training had put me in a position to serve the Army, and although scared on one side of the coin, I pushed forward with all my might to succeed from a military standpoint over that next year.<br /><br />A couple months after I arrived in country, I got another call while in the Green Zone in downtown Baghdad&mdash;this one came in the form of a Skype call&mdash;from Elder Paul Pieper of the First Quorum of the Seventy. After some initial discussion, he told me the Brethren felt it was time to establish the Baghdad Iraq Military District and create a number of branches in country. My next challenging service at that point for the Lord would come in the form of District President for the remainder of my time in theater. This time&mdash;although I didn't say it to Elder Pieper&mdash;I asked my Heavenly Father silently the same thing I asked the officer from the Pentagon; "Surely there is someone better prepared than me for this assignment?" However, as is the case with most callings, there was not time to tell Elder Pieper that the calling sounded fine, but could he give me a few more weeks to prepare to serve in that capacity. At that moment I could only look back at my preparation. Did I prepare well spiritually the day before, the week before, or before being deployed to Iraq? What was my spiritual preparation like the year before, or the decade before? This was not the time to dither in the service of the Lord in a calling to oversee 1,300 members of the Church in a place called Iraq. My Heavenly Father needed me right then&mdash;not after the fact. The Lord taught me again the value of preparation for a calling not of my choosing&mdash;in a place where I did not expect.<br /><br />Four years later a similar call came from United States Central Command Headquarters, to serve another 400 days in a different combat zone&mdash;this time in Afghanistan. I answered the call, feeling inadequate initially, but in the end realizing that my preparation was comprehensive and consistent enough over the previous months and years to serve the Army as needed. After arriving in country and going about my assignment in this different combat zone, I again received a call to serve in the Church, this time as a Branch President at Bagram Air Base&mdash;Afghanistan. And again, I asked myself those familiar questions; "Was I prepared to serve in this capacity, had I been worthy the day before, the year before, the decade before?"<br /><br />As with so many other occasions, there was no time to delay for a few weeks when it came to accepting the call to allow me to get "more ready" if you will. The Lord needed me to serve worthily then and there. While in that assignment, some good Church members deployed in that combat zone suffered from intense depression due to loneliness, and the constant grind of being put in harm's way&mdash;the overall trappings of war if you will, and often asked for a blessing of comfort and healing. There was no time to tell them that I wasn't quite ready to assist where needed, and to give me a few days to prepare myself to administer help. When a Marine was worried beyond measure of an upcoming combat operation and needed reassurance that all would be well, there was no time to ask for a reprieve to prepare the right spiritual thoughts he needed. When a wounded soldier struggled for his life after a suicide bomber took a number of other lives, and nearly took his during an ugly firefight, there was not a later time to prepare that priesthood blessing to keep him alive.<br /><br />Whether a calling or assignment for you comes to help the many or the one, the time to serve is now, and the preparation that is needed for such a calling is often past. I ask you, what did you do to prepare to serve the Lord this morning, or yesterday, or last year? Have you built your testimony and preparation line upon line, so that when the Lord calls on you, in the form of a spotty Middle East Skype call, or in the comfort of your home Bishop's office, will you have paid the price for that call to duty&mdash;regardless of where and what it might be.&nbsp; Will you be prepared to serve like the sons of Mosiah&mdash;regardless of when and where it may take you?<br /><br />Those sons of Mosiah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...h<em>ad waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God."<sup>5</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>I ask you again brothers and sisters&mdash;can you&mdash;will you&mdash;sustain that kind of preparation&mdash;at least to some degree in your life&mdash;regardless if that service is down the road with people you have known your whole life, or halfway across the world with good people you have never seen before.</p>
<p>I want you to know that one of the most difficult things I ever had to do during my recent deployment to Afghanistan was not weathering incoming rocket fire several times a week, nor was it my involvement with special operations which often put a number of great American serviceman's lives in danger. The greatest difficulty for me came in the confines of my little commander's office in a quiet setting in one-on-one conversations.<br /><br />It was my responsibility to often review the applications of those who would become members of my interagency team. Nearly every applicant I looked at on paper was a seasoned warrior and a veteran of multiple campaigns with a track record of leadership and courageousness. They were great Americans by any account and wanted to continue to serve in a combat zone&mdash;nearly all of them with impressive and particular skill sets. My challenge was to pick the individuals who would make the best fit, because each applicant was more than qualified on paper for the task at hand.<br /><br />Once a decision had been made and that individual arrived in country, I watched him or her closely for a number of weeks to ensure what I had read on paper matched up with what I was seeing in the field.<br /><br />However, on a couple occasions after careful observance and thoughtful consideration&mdash;from two inches behind my belt buckle if you will, I had to bring a new team member into that little office, thank that individual for his or her service, remind the person that indeed he or she was a great American, and simply mention to that individual that their efforts did not meet the intent of our team nor the ongoing mission at hand. I had to painfully state that I simply could not trust their actions, and that despite a stellar resume that brought that individual halfway across the world for that particular assignment, I could not further endanger the lives of my team and the mission at hand with what I saw. I wished them well, and told the individual to be on the next available flight home. In those few cases, their actions simply did not match up with their resume. I then had to begin a new search for the right person to join the team.<br /><br />With that story in mind, I again ask each one of you:<br /><br />Does your spiritual resume match up with your daily thoughts and actions&mdash;scripture study, daily prayer, serving others, staying worthy, keeping the commandments? Does your preparation that others see on paper if you will, match up with what the Lord really expects in whatever calling comes your way? Will He have to send you away from a potential assignment at hand? Or will you be able to deliver for Him on a moment's notice today, tomorrow, next year, or 30 years from now? To answer yes on all accounts, you must truly take on a genuine and ongoing spiritual sense of urgency and a righteous call to duty.<br /><br />Shortly after I arrived at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, I found this ancient Cicero statement on a cement T-Wall barrier which proclaimed, "Live as brave men and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts." The gospel will require your brave hearts&mdash;both men and women&mdash;now and decades from now&mdash;in locations that you cannot comprehend at this stage in your lives.<br /><br />I close with a WWI story from a book by Lucy Gertsch Thomson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"After fighting in a bitter battle, a soldier pleaded with his commanding officer to let him go out on the battlefield to search for his missing companion. The commander said it was of no use, for no one could have lived through the hours of constant fire. The soldier insisted and was finally granted permission. Sometime later he returned with the limp body of his dead comrade. "I told you it was useless," commented the commander. "But you're wrong sir" the soldier said. "I got there just in time to hear him whisper, 'I knew you'd come.'"<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>At the Last Supper the Savior taught his Apostles,&nbsp;<em>"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you..."</em>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>As some of the chosen few, may each one of you continue to prepare yourselves to fulfill your assignment in the Lord's mighty Army, in whatever capacity he requires of you, regardless of how small or big or where or when that assignment may be. May we all prepare spiritually with a sense of urgency today, tonight, in the morning, and the day after for those callings that most likely will come years from now&mdash;maybe decades&mdash;so that others can truly say in gratitude someday&mdash;"I knew you'd come."<br /><br />May your spiritual resume truly reflect what the Lord requires of you, regardless of when and where that assignment may take you&mdash;whether your challenges keep you in the city of Rexburg or on to Albuquerque, or take you to foreign places like the city of Baghdad, Iraq or Kabul, Afghanistan. For what you are and for what you will become&mdash;wherever the Lord takes you on your journey&mdash;whether it be in a comfortable primary class setting&mdash;or an unpleasant ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter&mdash;I salute you&mdash;for your commitment to be better&mdash;now and forever.</p>
<p>President Monson and President Hinckley before him have called you the finest generation of men and women in the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I have traveled much of the world and have seen to some degree the best and worst of mankind&mdash;and I assure you that you are the best. Despite the fact that Satan knows the assignments that await you, may you continue to fight the good fight, may you have the righteous kick to finish each aspect of this race called mortal life, may you take on each day with a sense of urgency and fulfill your own spiritual call to duty. I know that your Heavenly Father will bless you and me as we do so&mdash;is my prayer and message this day&mdash;in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<strong><br /></strong></p>

<p>Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Director</p>
<p>After working in several different positions on campus in both the Admissions Office and Scholarships Office, Aaron Sanns' current post is Director of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, he worked as a Juvenile Probation Officer in Bannock County, Idaho.<br /><br /> Brother Sanns was born and raised in New Jersey, and served as a full-time missionary in the Japan Osaka mission. He obtained an associate's degree from Ricks College, a bachelor's degree in Psychology from BYU, and a master's degree in Higher Education Administration from Idaho State University.<br /><br /> He has served in bishoprics, Elders quorum and young men presidencies, High Priests groups, as well as being a Sunday School teacher, Primary teacher, and assistant Scoutmaster. Presently, he is a High Councilor in his stake.<br /><br /> Brother Sanns and his wife, Ruth Ann, are the parents of 2 daughters and 2 sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Minasan konnichawa</em>. Sorry, my New Jersey accent comes back when I get nervous. Actually, that was Japanese for, "hello everyone." People in Japan return greetings when a speaker at a meeting expresses salutations. For example, in sacrament meeting a speaker might say, "good morning" or&nbsp;<em>ohayou gozaimasu</em>, and the congregation would respond back by saying in unison,&nbsp;<em>ohayou gozaimasu</em>. I believe there is a similar tradition in Hawaii. A common greeting in New Jersey where I grew up is, "how you doin'?" Now the response back is not, "fine, thank you." It is the same phrase back with the accent on "you." "How&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;doin'?" So, hello everyone, how you doin'?<br /><br />I hope you are all doing fine. Even though you all have troubles and life can be difficult, I actually hope you are more than just fine. Brothers and Sisters, have trust and faith in God. Be happy. &nbsp;Don't borrow trouble from tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don't take counsel from your fears. Don't be anxious or afraid of the future. &nbsp;God is omnipotent and He is in charge, even if your favorite politician doesn't get elected, God's still in charge. He knows you and loves you. He has a plan for you. The world we live in is a beautiful, lovely place. Jesus Christ is real. He accomplished the atonement and was resurrected. Thomas S. Monson is a true prophet of God. Think about these facts and be happy! Do as the Apostle Paul instructed the Colossians:<br /><br />"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts...; and be ye thankful."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I would like you to think about places you have seen or been to that are beautiful and have amazing views. Some places that come to mind for me include the top of the path that leads to a castle called Burg Eltz in Germany; the Manhattan skyline as viewed from Jersey City, New Jersey, close to where I grew up; a harbor in Vancouver, British Columbia; an Idaho potato field and our own Thomas E. Ricks Gardens with my favorite people - my family.<br /><br />Having a home with a scenic view can be very expensive and is not always practical. Even if you are fortunate enough to start with a fine view, in time you might not be able to control what happens around you. New local industry, pests, plant disease and drought can all have a negative effect on the views around you.<br /><br />For these reasons, my wife and I have tried to create our own views from our house. You could say we have tried to build our own version of the thought by Francis de Sales who encouraged, "bloom where you are planted." Although we are not professional landscapers, and the fruits of our efforts are not exceptional, we do try to control what we see from our front porch and the windows of our home. We do this by planning, designing and planting our landscape with our future view in mind.<br /><br />We remove dead, diseased and undesirable plants.&nbsp; Next, we prepare the ground to receive the new hardscape and landscape.&nbsp; And finally comes the seeding, and planting of a variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers.&nbsp; It takes effort.&nbsp; It takes time.&nbsp; But it creates a pleasant and peaceful view from our home.&nbsp;<br /><br />My sons grow and pick pumpkins of many varieties and thoughtfully place them in our front yard during the autumn time. We obsess a little about pumpkins at our house.&nbsp; My daughters have also chosen to create their own views by placing inspirational pictures and sayings on their desks and bedroom walls. They have even created handmade paper and cardboard fireplaces during Christmas time in their student housing while attending college. This has added a warmth and comfort to the cinderblock walls in their living rooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our&nbsp;<strong><em>view</em></strong>&nbsp;on life can be like the views from our homes.&nbsp; The things we choose to surround ourselves with influence how we see the world. This includes printed materials, media and technology. We should choose wisely so we don't plant the spiritual equivalent of skunk cabbage, dandelions and poison ivy. &nbsp;We also don't want to leave diseased and rotting trees that may fall and cause harm.&nbsp; They need to be hewn down and burned.&nbsp;<br /><br />With the capabilities of today's technology, the world is literally at our fingertips. The speed of current-event knowledge is almost instantaneous and bombards us with mostly negative events. Not only do a butterfly's wings affect the weather on the other side of the world, you can probably subscribe to get an alert the moment it flutters. &nbsp;<br /><br />Many feel anxious about the state of the world. This could be due to the availability of news and the provocative nature of the Media today. Everything is breaking news and most news seems to be negative. Pundits and spin doctors turn everything negative and into debates. The news rarely emphasizes the great and positive things going on and certainly doesn't report on the terrible things that&nbsp;<strong><em>ARE NOT</em></strong>&nbsp;happening. Can you imagine turning on the TV or radio to a breaking report of "This just in, no major calamities, no pandemics, no world wars and no giant meteors heading towards us today. However, poverty is at an all-time low and world peace is at an all-time high.&nbsp; People are living longer than ever."&nbsp; How about a newsflash of a poor kid from Chicago who just graduated from college and gained a testimony of Christ? &nbsp;What about major news coverage of a former U.S. republican senator who recently joined the LDS church and was baptized by a prominent democratic senator? &nbsp;It doesn't sell, so it doesn't happen.<br /><br />Psychology researcher Shawn Achor, has expressed the idea that the majority of information on the news is not positive. In fact it's negative. Most of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, and natural disasters. He says your brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world which creates "the medical school syndrome." During the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases you suddenly realize you have all of them. It's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.<sup>2</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This reminds me of my time as a probation officer; after a few years I began to have an unrealistic view of how many people were really committing crimes. My perspective was not reality and was skewed by what I thought about 40 hours a week at work, which was people breaking the law.<br /><br />We need to create our own views. We need to be in charge of what we take in and it should be based on reality. The way our time is spent and what we do creates a lens which affects the way we see life. We cannot let the negative and bad things paralyze us into inaction or passivity, waiting for others to act upon us. We cannot sit back and let the world create our view.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The reality is that there is wickedness in the world today. However, it is also a place of positive things, a place of beauty, goodness and wonder. It is also true that God lives and loves us and Christ has restored His Church in these latter days with a prophet leading the way. These positive things can be placed in your view.<br /><br />I suggest that there are&nbsp;<strong><em>good, better&nbsp;</em></strong>and&nbsp;<strong><em>best</em></strong>&nbsp;ways of gaining a positive realistic view.<br /><br />One&nbsp;<strong>GOOD</strong>&nbsp;way of creating your own positive view is by assessing your life in relation to the past and being appreciative and grateful to Heavenly Father for the life you now live.<br /><br />Along with good times, there were also very dark days throughout history that some argue were much worse than the things we see right now. Here are some historical facts to put your life today in perspective:&nbsp;</p>
<p>History, even somewhat recent history has seen bad days which can help us be grateful for the lifestyles we currently live.<br /><br />And although lots of history was grim, it is vital to recognize that the struggles of the past did not hold back great men and women from achieving wonderful things. Many did not postpone progress until the perfect moment which never came.<br /><br />We shouldn't wait until we feel we are totally secure and our lives are in total order before we let ourselves be happy and take active steps toward the future. If we do we will be waiting a lifetime.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice. Human culture has always had to exist under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure the search would never have begun . . . Life has never been normal. Even those periods which we think most tranquil, like the nineteenth century, turn out, on closer inspection, to be full of cries, alarms, difficulties, emergencies. Plausible reasons have never been lacking for putting off all . . . activities until some imminent danger has been averted or some crying injustice put right. But humanity long ago chose to neglect those plausible reasons. They wanted knowledge and beauty now, and would not wait for the suitable moments that never come. ... men ... propound mathematical theorems in beleaguered cities, conduct metaphysical arguments in condemned cells, make jokes on scaffold, discuss the last new poem while advancing to the walls of Quebec, and comb their hair at Thermopylae. This is not panache; it is our nature."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Perhaps a&nbsp;<strong>BETTER</strong>&nbsp;method of creating your own positive view could be to look for the good in the world today. Thessalonians 5:21 says, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good." The 13th Article of Faith declares, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul&mdash;we believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."</p>
<p>Let me help to create a current realistic view of this world for you and share a positive lens by reporting some good news including the idea that there are many good people doing good things in contrast to what much of the media is reporting:<br /><br />Some say that today could be the most peaceful time in human history. Dr. Steven Pinker of Harvard University has recently written that "Today we may be living in the most peaceful era in our species' existence." He acknowledges: "In a century that began with 9/11, Iraq, and Darfur, the claim that we are living in an unusually peaceful time may strike you as somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene . . . wars make headlines, but there are fewer conflicts today, and wars don't kill as many people as they did in the Middle Ages. Also, incidents of violent crime have decreased dramatically in the last few decades."<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Today also sees the most advancement in technology to make our lives better and help us live longer. The average life expectancy worldwide was just 47 years in 1950, today it is over 70 years and is around 80 years in developed countries.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Not only do we live in a relatively more peaceful time with longer life spans but the global poverty rate has halved over a recent twenty year period from 43% in 1990 to 21% in 2010.<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Also, imagine having your smart phone with its capabilities 25, 100 or 1,000 years ago. Most people of long ago would have thought it was magic. It has many tools to help your life be better including the vast majority of human knowledge, art, and music. Your phone likely also has access to calendaring, organizational tools, vast medical information with health trackers and my personal favorite app, the Gospel Library including all of the scriptures. You probably also have access to unlimited streaming of cat videos; however the science of viewing cats on your phone is still in its early stages.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>A few more bits of great news pertaining to our day include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few medical breakthroughs that scientists say are on the horizon include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Church is strong:&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the April 2015 General Conference, Elder Quentin L. Cook said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never been stronger. The number of members removing their names from the records of the Church has always been very small and is significantly less in recent years than in the past. The increase in demonstrably measurable areas, such as endowed members with a current temple recommend, adult full-tithe payers, and those serving missions, has been dramatic. Let me say again, the Church has never been stronger. But, remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. We reach out to everyone."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Although a&nbsp;<strong>GOOD</strong>&nbsp;way to create a positive view would be to look to the&nbsp;<strong>PAST</strong>&nbsp;and be grateful to Heavenly Father, and a&nbsp;<strong>BETTER</strong>&nbsp;way is to look at our time and the current circumstances of our day and be grateful for the&nbsp;<strong>NOW</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>BEST</strong>&nbsp;way to create your own positive view of reality is to consider and act upon your knowledge of the grand big picture which is an eternal perspective of God's Plan of Happiness. This includes the reality of the existence of God our Father in Heaven, the fact that He is omnipotent and in control of the universe, He loves us, that we lived with Him before we came to this earth, we are here for a reason and He has a plan for us to return to Him which plan hinges on His son Jesus Christ. The good news is that the pivotal event of the Savior's Atonement has already been accomplished by our Elder Brother, the Savior, Jesus Christ. He made this world, was born into it, lived a perfect life, suffered for our sins and to lift our burdens, died for us and was resurrected; HE LIVES! He is also directing His Church today. We are not left alone. We have a prophet on the earth right now who speaks for the Lord and leads us to our Savior.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father's plan is not called the plan of failure, or the plan of anxiousness and fear, or the plan of doubt and worry, it is called The Plan of Salvation or The Plan of Happiness. Heavenly Father wants us to be happy and have joy. After the Last Supper was concluded the Lord told his disciples that, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Regarding being of good cheer, Elder Adhemar Damiani of the Seventy said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As part of our mortal probation, we pass through affliction, pain, and disappointment. Only in Jesus Christ can we find peace. He can help us to be of good cheer and to overcome all the challenges of this life."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>There are literally hundreds of occasions in the scriptures where the Lord has instructed us to be happy or not to fear or to cast our burdens upon Him. We know He speaks to us through His prophets of old and of today and that we can liken the scriptures unto ourselves. The messages of the scriptures are for us including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world would have us believe that if you have challenges, struggles, or afflictions then you are a victim and you should be miserable. That is not true. We have come to this world to learn and grow and that often comes through aches and pains. Part of your view is how you choose to deal with your aches and pains. Again, the great news is that we can find comfort from our sorrows and struggles through Jesus Christ, and when we fail and are not perfect we can repent because of the Savior's atonement. We have to be on the road to perfection, we don't have to be perfect. &nbsp;<br /><br />Our modern Church leaders have also encouraged us at least dozens and dozens of times not to be fearful but be cheerful and give our burdens to the Lord.<br /><br />President Boyd K. Packer said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the final windup scene Satan cannot win . . . we need not fear. Fear is the opposite of faith. . . I have been in the councils of the Church and seen many things. I have seen disappointment and shock and concern. Never once have I seen any fear. . . Our youth can look forward with hope for a happy life."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President James E. Faust said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let us not take counsel from our fears. May we remember always to be of good cheer, put our faith in God, and live worthy for Him to direct us. We are each entitled to receive personal inspiration to guide us through our mortal probation. May we so live that our hearts are open at all times to the whisperings and comfort of the Spirit."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In the April 2015 General Conference, Elder Quentin L. Cook said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The clamor that reverberates across the earth because of worldly wickedness creates feelings of vulnerability. With modern communication the impact of iniquity, inequality, and injustice leaves many feeling that life is inherently unfair. As significant as these trials can be, they must not distract us from rejoicing in and celebrating Christ's supernal intercession in our behalf. The Savior literally 'gained the victory over death.' With mercy and compassion He took upon Himself our iniquity and transgressions, thus redeeming us and satisfying the demands of justice for all who would repent and believe on His name. His magnificent atoning sacrifice is of transcendent significance beyond mortal comprehension. This act of grace provides the peace that surpasses understanding."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When times are tough and things get really bad our capacity can be increased to deal with the problems of the day through Christ. We can handle it all through the Savior.</p>
<p>Now that is a nice view!</p>
<p>Elder Cook also described how his wife rejoices when sunflowers appear in "improper places" and even "flourish" where the ground has been negatively affected by machinery and materials not conducive for flowers to grow.<br /><br />The key to flourishing and blooming is to do like the young sunflowers described by Elder Cook; they "follow the sun across the sky . . . Like the young sunflower, when we follow the Savior of the world, the Son of God, we flourish and become glorious despite the many terrible circumstances that surround us. He truly is our light and life."<br /><br />You are responsible for your own view, take steps to create it. Let us not follow the world and its media to create our view but let's follow the Savior of the world, the Lord God Jesus Christ who rose after the third day and who restored His Church through Joseph Smith and continues to lead it today through a living Prophet, President Monson. Your future is bright in these latter days which are your days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>LDS Charities Director</p>
<p>Sharon Eubank was born in Redding, California, to Mark and Jean Eubank. She received a bachelor's degree in English from&nbsp;Brigham Young&nbsp;University and served as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Finland Helsinki mission. &nbsp;Her career includes teaching at the Language Education Institute in Japan, working as a legislative aide in the U.S. Senate and owning a retail education store in Provo, Utah.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since 1998, she has been employed by the Church in the Welfare Department.&nbsp; She helped to establish 17 international LDS employment offices in Africa and Europe.&nbsp; For five years she directed the humanitarian wheelchair program.<br /><br />In 2008 Sharon became Middle East regional director of the LDS Charities where she oversaw humanitarian work in 8 countries.&nbsp; She also served on the Relief Society general board during Sister Julie B. Beck's administration.<br /><br />Currently, Sharon is the executive director of LDS Charities -- the humanitarian organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>A colleague of mine was invited to work on a humanitarian project in a somewhat closed country. He was accompanied everywhere by representatives of the government who, as part of their duties, had been given access to read about the church online. One man had done his research extremely well and amazingly knew everything about the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's first vision, Brigham Young settling the valley, the welfare farms - his one question to my colleague was: What is Liahona? He couldn't find anywhere a translation for that concept.<br /><br />If that were you, how would you describe to the man what is Liahona? Alma calls it a ball or director or compass that pointed the way they should go in the wilderness<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;but that doesn't really describe fully this spectacularly individual spiritual phenomenon that still exists in the lives of believers and pioneers today.</p>
<p>While you are thinking, let me describe a Liahona experience that has been important to me: I notice how often the Lord places a question in my mind and then works with me to try to find an answer. Of course this isn't special just with me. He works this way all through the scriptures. He asks his apostles in the New Testament: "Will ye also go away?"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He asks the Brother of Jared: "What will ye that I should do?"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He asks Mary in the garden: "Why weepest thou, whom seekest thou?"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He asks Joseph Smith: "What greater witness can you have than from God?"<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The Lord continues in our day to use this way of teaching. It may not be as visible as a brass ball sitting on the ground when you wake up, but sometimes a question will be sitting in your mind when you first open your eyes. Or maybe throughout all the mundane things we do all day a question gets asked that sticks around. Sticky questions. When this happens to me, when I take the time to ponder that sticky question, I get pointed or guided to prophetic information, and then I have a chance to respond and talk to the Father in prayer about my personal answer to the question he asked me. That conversation is an amazing journey and I never know where He is going to take me but it is almost always toward the promised land.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, I thought I would share with you three questions that have come to me in this way. They aren't mind-blowing, but they have gingered me into a path that has blessed my life and pointed me to great insights that have helped me grow. My testimony of the Lord as a Master Teacher of me&mdash;working actively in my individual life&mdash;is bold and sure. &nbsp;<br /><br />It was Christmas time when this question came to me. What do I personally do to express joy? Something that isn't created by someone else and consumed by me? Handel wrote the Messiah, Jewish elders sound the shofar, my mother sews matching Christmas dresses in taffeta plaid-but what do I create myself that shows the Lord I am feeling the Spirit and using my gifts in His world?<br /><br />Shortly afterward, a new baby was born into our family. My oldest nephew James was a firefighter in Kalispell, Montana. He and his wife Mary had their first little baby boy. I was a great aunt. I wanted to do something so this little boy would know when he grew up how much he was wanted and celebrated. But what could I do? When I myself was born my great grandmother made a quilt for me. Based on a nine square pattern, it was the quilt I hid under when I was scared, made forts out of in our basement, and dragged out to the couch and tucked around myself when I was sick.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I decided to make a quilt for this new great nephew. Only one problem: I was kicked out of sewing classes and had no idea how to sew. I had never made a quilt. I didn't know how to start. I didn't know any of the tricks to make the corners line up or the nine squares fit evenly. I worked on it doggedly for six months. I pored over the squares and actually prayed over the sewing machine bobbin not to tangle while I sewed because I had no way of fixing that. Making this quilt stretched me, but it was something I was creating to show joy and love.<br /><br />This is what President Uchtdorf has to say about our efforts to create:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Creation means bringing into existence something that did not exist before&mdash;colorful gardens, harmonious homes, family&nbsp;memories, flowing laughter...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Creation is your opportunity in this life....and your destiny in the world to come."</p>
<p>And so I ask you:&nbsp; What do you do to personally express joy? What do you create when you feel the Spirit of the Lord?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second question is about Spiritual Panicking. This is the idea that when things don't go right within a day or two of our praying for them or if we have been working on something for 1-2 weeks and we don't feel God is responding to our requests, we panic. We freak.&nbsp; We believe our prayer isn't being heard or that the Father is deaf to us or we aren't somehow righteous enough. We start taking things into our own hands and forgetting or ignoring that we asked him to intervene in his own time. We put the burden of the thing back on our own shoulders. All because we have about a two week window before we start to panic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best friend last year had a back injury that was creating severe pain. She had surgery scheduled but it was four weeks away and she was almost incoherent from the pain. Her faithful home teacher Ron Barney came and gave her a beautiful blessing that she would be pain free. But as days and then weeks went by, I believed the blessing was not coming to pass. "Nothing" happened between the blessing and her already scheduled appointment on December 31. I wanted relief for her that very night. I wanted a doctor to have a cancelation in his schedule and operate immediately. However a month from that blessing, after the surgery had been performed at its scheduled time, she called me up to say she had sat through ward council that day pain free and feeling great. She returned to her regular work and her back continues to heal from the very competent surgery that was performed by a very fine surgeon.</p>
<p>She also tells me that this was the best Christmas she has had in a very long time. She had time to really ponder the life of Jesus and also to think about other people who are dealing with physical and emotional pain. So I see that I am a spiritual panicker and yet how tenderly the Lord says, "Sharon, give me a month or two, or give me a year, or give me 10, or give me until your next life. I see the long view and I will never leave you comfortless."</p>
<p>Listen to what Elder Robert D. Hales says to those who spiritually panic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We may not know when or how the Lord's answers will be given, but in His time and His way, I testify, His answers will come. For some answers we may have to wait until the hereafter. This may be true for some promises in our patriarchal blessings and for some blessings for family members. Let us not give up on the Lord. His blessings are eternal, not temporary."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Elder Hales was the priesthood advisor in the Quorum of the Twelve for Relief Society when I served on the General Board. He was ill in his bed and not able to come to the office almost the entire time. He rallied at the end of 2011 and came to our Christmas dinner frail and fragile for an hour or so. He somehow communicated to me and others that night just how much he longed to do the work before him and how much the pain and the suffering he had been through had refined him. This talk was given during that time and reflects his own experiences of "waiting on the Lord." I like the idea that while we wait upon the Lord, He also waits upon us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In my life I have learned that sometimes I do not receive an answer to a prayer because the Lord knows I am not ready. When He does answer, it is often "here a little and there a little" because that is all that I can bear or all I am willing to do."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What should we do while we wait on the Lord? When His answers and the things we have longed for are taking far longer than we thought they should...?</p>
<p>Elder Hales gives some insight there too:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Waiting upon the Lord gives us a priceless opportunity to discover that there are many who wait upon us. Our children wait upon us to show patience, love, and understanding toward them. Our parents wait upon us to show gratitude&nbsp;and compassion. Our brothers and sisters wait upon us to be tolerant, merciful, and forgiving. Our spouses wait upon us to love them as the Savior has loved each one of us."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This isn't philosophical, it is real. He lived it. It came from the depths of his sorrow and it took much of his energy and will to say it. I want to be kinder to others and kinder to myself. I want to wait on the Lord for longer than two weeks and show my trust in his never failing kindness to me.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Will You Wait Upon The Lord?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The final question I want to consider today didn't actually come as a question but as a phrase in my mind that I had heard somewhere.&nbsp; Something about 'you will never be the same after an encounter with the Son of God.' I couldn't remember where it had come from and since I didn't have the wording exactly it took some digging to find it but it was this powerful talk of Elder Holland's from three years ago.<br /><br />"If ye love me, keep my commandments," Jesus said. So we have neighbors to bless, children to protect, the poor to lift up, and the truth to defend. We have wrongs to make right, truths to share, and good to do. In short, we have a life of devoted discipleship to give in demonstrating our love of the Lord. We can't quit and we can't go back. After an encounter with the living Son of the living God, nothing is ever again to be as it was before.<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The scriptures are full of individual and group encounters with the Son of God.&nbsp; We cannot just be consumers of their experiences or we soon become unmoved by them.&nbsp; Your job and my job use the scriptures to create our own encounters with the Son of God.&nbsp; So the question comes:&nbsp; How am I different since I encountered the Son of God?<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let me tell another story from my family. My mother didn't come from a very religious home. She married my dad when they were 19 and 20. My dad had stopped going to church when he was 14 and my mother was not a member of the Church. But in their neighborhood near their small apartment they became friends with another young couple who had both just joined the Church. Keith and Margaret Miller were on fire with the gospel and the scriptures. They loved to talk about how happy they were and what they were learning. They shared these things with my parents as they socialized and finally invited my parents to hear the missionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My parents came into the gospel just before I was born. Keith and Margaret's encounter with the restored gospel and with the Savior created something that did not exist before&mdash;a desire on the part of their friends, my parents, to have religion and truth guide their family. It drastically changed my parents' trajectory. Now they have lived more than 50 years in the gospel. And their encounter with Jesus Christ and his gospel changed everything about my own life. How thankful I am that when Keith and Margaret felt joy, they expressed it by creating a friendship that hadn't existed before. They were creators of eternal friends.</p>
<p>When we encounter Jesus, wherever that is, he usually&mdash;in some form or another&mdash;asks us the same question he once asked of Andrew and John when they followed him along the seashore: "What seek ye?"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;What do you want? In your deepest heart, in the longing of your soul, the things you never tell anyone because they sound lofty or unreachable or ridiculously small.&nbsp;<br /><br />What do I want? I want to understand the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. I want to be a friend of the prophets. I want additional records to come to light and I want to add my own records to the trove. I want to build up anyone who comes to me. I want to ease the poor. I want peace from whoredoms for the whole earth. I want my specific husband. I want to raise my children in the mortal way, even if they arrive after mortality. I want to be an extraordinary friend. I want to stop fearing my own power. I want to stand as a witness.<br /><br />Some of these desires I will create, and others I will wait upon on the Lord for, but each of these desires is a powerful encounter with the Son of God. How am I different since encountering Him? The Lord did with me what he has done with disciples in every age. He asked me what I want. I answered that question in my deepest child-like sincerity. And now He and I are working together every day to achieve the desires of my heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Liahona of learning through questions is available to you. It is the same kind of miraculous gift that it was when it was given to Lehi and his family when they woke up that morning. The questions that will guide you are scattered everywhere. In class. In a conversation with a friend. In your mind as you jog. In the scriptures as you study. Once they stick to you and you start to truly consider them, the Lord begins guiding you step by step to a new place.&nbsp;<br /><br />As an example, let me share this four minute video. This is a premiere. This is the first time this video has been shown and I got special permission to show it to you. It is from a very fine series by the Mormon Channel called Give Back and if you haven't seen the previous videos in the series, I encourage you to look them up. The video shows some of what your fellow saints are doing in Beirut, Lebanon to answer the question "What can I do to help?" They are Arab Latter-day Saints. The man you will see in the blue shirt is the first Arab district president the Church has had - maybe since Jethro! This branch is acting on its love and commitment to Jesus Christ to serve others and they are teaching their children by active example what it means to follow Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you leave this devotional, will you do one thing? Write it down somewhere you are going to see it every day. "What Will I Do Now That I Have Encountered the Son of God?"&nbsp; As you uncover the answer to that question over the next months, maybe you will participate in the Give Back series by sharing what you are doing in your own circles to Give Back and serve others. Or perhaps you will do something known only to you and the Lord. But whatever you do, make it be an action and not just a thought.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify we are made for joy. We are born to be creators in partnership with the Great Creator, Jesus Christ. I testify that while all our joys are not realized now, if we wait patiently on the Lord and stay faithful, we will have the desires of our hearts. I testify that in our sins and weaknesses as we encounter the Son of God we will never be the same. He strengthens us, changes us, cleanses us, teaches us individually, and shows us the future and our parts to play. May we have the courage to answer the questions He poses to us every day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presidency of the Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Donald L. Hallstrom was named a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2009.&nbsp; He was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy on April 1, 2000.&nbsp; At the time of his call as a General Authority, he was serving as an Area Seventy in the North America West Area.<br /><br />From 2005 to 2009, Elder Hallstrom was a member of the Asia Area Presidency, headquartered in Hong Kong, concluding that service as the Area President.&nbsp; From 2000 to 2003, he was in the Asia North Area, residing in Tokyo, Japan, also serving as the Area President.&nbsp; Additionally, he served as Executive Director of the Church Audiovisual Department, as a member of the Young Men General Presidency. </p>
<p>Elder Hallstrom graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in economics. &nbsp;At the time of his call to full-time Church service in 2000, he was president of The Hallstrom Group, Inc., a real estate consulting organization based in Honolulu, Hawaii. &nbsp;He has held various professional designations and certifications and also was an expert witness in state and federal courts.<br /><br />Elder Hallstrom has served on various boards, including the executive board of the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the President's Roundtable of Brigham Young University-Hawaii. &nbsp;He was also vice chairman of Hawaii Reserves, Inc., which manages non-ecclesiastical Church real estate in Hawaii.&nbsp; Additionally he served on the National Advisory Council of the Boy Scouts of America.<br /><br />Elder Hallstrom has served the Church as a full-time missionary in England, elders quorum president, stake high councilor, bishop, stake president and regional representative.&nbsp; He was called as an Area Authority in 1995 and as an Area Authority Seventy in 1997.<br /><br />Elder Hallstrom was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in July 1949.&nbsp; He is married to Diane Clifton and they are the parents of four children and have six grandchildren.</p>
<p>Sister Hallstrom (Diane) and I feel privileged to come to Rexburg for the July 2015 commencement exercises of Brigham Young University-Idaho. We love this university and have been here many times. For a portion of my ministry, the Idaho Area of the Church was part of my assignment. I traveled to Rexburg often and have participated in various meetings held on this campus. In this beautiful conference center I have spoken at university devotionals and at a special stake conference broadcast to 78 stakes. Every time we are here, we immediately feel the spirit of this institution because it is harmonious with the Spirit of the Lord.<br /><br />As a member of the Board of Trustees of BYU-Idaho and of the Executive Committee of that Board, I am regularly engaged in discussions and decisions about this university. Continually, I am inspired by how deeply the Lord and His prophets care about the youth of the Church and are willing to provide sacred resources to assist in their temporal and spiritual education. You are blessed to have this university and it is blessed to have you!<br /><br />To you graduates, I say, "Congratulations!" and "Well done!" But, I also acknowledge there is a reason this event is called "Commencement" and not "Conclusion." Yes, it may conclude your formal education, at least on this campus, but it is the beginning of a new season of life. You may find that exciting, you may find it a little overwhelming; but, in any case, it is going to happen. You are moving on to new ventures and, hopefully, they exemplify progression in your life's goals.<br /><br />Today, understanding this graduation event is not about me and that you will likely remember little, if any, of my message, I want to be relatively brief (insofar as a General Authority can be brief), I want to be practical, and I want to be clear. Considering your future, I will speak about priorities and seeking balance in your life. You will leave this institution and some of you will go on to further formal education.&nbsp; Some will begin your profession. Some of you will do both, simultaneously. Many of you leave married; several with children. You have held Church responsibilities, some quite demanding, and you will continue to do so. Life, if anything, will become even more complex, more demanding, and (if lived well) it will be even more rewarding.<br /><br />Before my thirtieth year, I was called to be the bishop of an 850-member ward. Two weeks prior, I, with a partner, founded a company that had just hired and was responsible for several new employees. At the time, Diane and I had three active children ages one to seven. The daunting responsibilities to properly care for my young family, the Saints entrusted to my stewardship, and create a viable business, seemed impossible. Would I know how to allocate my time when any one of these three important and complex aspects of life could become all-consuming? Was it possible to achieve a balance?&nbsp;In those days, I often recalled a childhood memory. When I was a boy,&nbsp;<em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>&nbsp;was one of the most popular programs on television. As a variety show, it featured performers with widely divergent talents. One was a man who appeared regularly.&nbsp; A number of poles, perhaps a dozen or more, were set up on stage, with stacks of dinner plates beside them. This agile individual would spin a plate on top of one of the poles; and then move to the next pole and spin a second plate; and then a third and a fourth. As he proceeded down the line of poles, the rotation of the plates on the first and second poles would begin to slow and the dishes were in danger of falling off and crashing to the floor. Seeing this, the man would quickly run back to those poles and with a gentle spin increase the motion that allowed the plates to keep spinning. The excitement of the act was to witness the ability of the performer to expand the number of rotating plates while not letting any fall. Invariably, a point would be reached where he was not able keep up. There was a limit to his ability to increase the number and properly care for the plates already in motion. The sight of dishes sliding from their precarious perches and the cacophony as they hit the hard floor vividly proved the point that even the most skilled performer has his limits.<br /><br />Of much greater consequence, each of us must decide how many "poles" we are able to manage in our life, and what they represent. Some individuals are spinning a single plate, with all their effort, ignoring all other poles. Others are attempting to spin so many at the same time that the crashing of "plates" is often heard.<br /><br />Leading a balanced life is difficult for many. There is not an exact pattern for everyone and even our own blueprint may change during different phases of our life. However, seeking balance&mdash;giving adequate time and effort to each of those things that really matter&mdash;is vital to our success in mortal probation. There are certain fundamental responsibilities we cannot neglect without serious consequence.<br /><br />What are the essential "poles" of our lives?&nbsp; I suggest four:</p>
<p><strong>Our Love for Our Heavenly Father and Jesus the Christ</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures speak powerfully of this sacred duty. A Pharisee, who was a lawyer, asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Describing it as part of the "doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father,"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Nephi taught, "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ...and a love of God."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our love of the Father and the Son is foundational to all else. The Savior, representing the Father, is the source of peace.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Love for Him is the supreme motivation to keep "in the right way."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Every other aspect of our life is enhanced when we truly love our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, as we will love ourselves and others more completely. Answers to our most challenging problems are found only when we love and have faith in Them.<br /><br /><strong>Our Care for Our Family</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</em>&nbsp;states: "Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each&nbsp; other and for their children...Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness...to observe the commandments of God."<br /><br />Prophetic counsel has taught us that "No other success can compensate for failure in the home,"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and "The most important of the Lord's work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Our desires and actions toward our family should be as exemplified by Lehi when he partook of the sweet fruit of the tree of life and immediately was "desirous that my family should partake of it also."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>For many, properly caring for our family is the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;area of compromise when other demands arise, as the results of neglect are not always immediately apparent. Nurturing the husband/wife relationship and building a spiritual home requires men and women of vision and commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Our Service to the Lord</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A natural extension of our love for the Savior is our desire to serve Him. "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The way we serve Him is by serving one another. "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Elder Dallin H. Oaks said "Service is an imperative for true followers of Jesus Christ."<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Our time spent in Church and community service may vary during different periods of our life depending on specific callings we may receive and our family circumstances. However, our desire and our availability to serve should never waver.<br /><br /><strong>Our Life's Temporal Work</strong>.</p>
<p>Although temporal work is temporary, it is still important as a support to the other, more long-lasting aspects of life and provides valuable service to others. Again, the Family Proclamation gives clear direction. "By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners."<br /><br />We strongly support obtaining a quality education (like you have done and may continue to do), which will allow choices in one's life work, and dedication to an honorable trade or profession that will serve our spiritual life.<br /><br />These four "poles" must not be neglected.&nbsp; Each needs constant care to fulfill its proper role in making us "whole."<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"I think...all of us in this Church...have a fourfold responsibility. One, they have a responsibility to their families, to see that their families have a measure of their time...None of us can evade that...That is basic and fundamental. If we are employed, we have a responsibility to our employer. We are not at liberty to short-change him...We have a responsibility to the Lord, of course, to do that which is expected of us as a servant in His house. And...we have a responsibility to ourselves to take some time to do a little meditating, to do a little exercise...How do you balance them? I don't think that is difficult. I served in many capacities in this Church. I am the father of five children, who were young and growing up when I was serving in those various capacities...We enjoyed life...We did what the Church expected us to do. There is safety in that program; it's inspired."<sup>13</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>As sincere followers of Christ, we must constantly evaluate what is most important. Are we so intensively focused on one pole that the plates atop the others are in danger of falling because of our neglect? Or, are we spinning too many poles and need to simplify our life to keep all that truly matters in proper motion?</p>
<p>How do we know if our life is out of balance? Well, most of us just know.&nbsp; We simply need to admit it and exercise the discipline to change, substituting higher values and better habits for those we have been living. We need to follow the counsel of President Spencer W. Kimball to "do it now" before any further damage is caused by our lack of attention to other indispensable parts of life.<br /><br />For others, recognition of imbalance may not be so clear. While serving as a stake president, I observed as a member of our stake grew in prominence in the business community. He had a growing family and held positions of responsibility in the Church. All appeared to be in order. Then it became evident that he was paying too high a price for his temporal success. The first indication was his request to be released from all Church callings because of their time conflict with his work related obligations. Even more alarming, through a series of behavioral problems with his children, priesthood leaders became acutely aware that basic family duties were being neglected. Communication with his wife and children had deteriorated as they seldom saw him. When they did, he was usually preoccupied by professional demands or simply too tired for family activities or even meaningful conversation. Only through tragic and agonizing events was this man brought to a realization of the consequences of his actions on his own spiritual health and that of his family.<br /><br />There are three magnificent resources to keep us in balance by seeing things "as they really are...and as they really will be."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Regular self-evaluation is critical to seeking a balanced life. These include public worship, family worship, and personal worship.<br /><br /><strong>Public Worship</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Public worship is when we assemble as children of God, as brothers and sisters, as a community of Saints. These meetings are sometimes large like stake or even general conference, or sometimes are small like a quorum or Relief Society meeting, or a Sunday School class. Our assembly today is a form of public worship. In each of these meetings, we pray, we teach, we testify, and we edify&mdash;all with the purpose of increasing our understanding of our Father in Heaven, Jesus the Christ, and the Holy Spirit. We then have the responsibility to translate our ever-increasing knowledge into wisdom&mdash;to continually lessen the gap between what we know and how we live.<br /><br />Temple worship is a sacred form of public worship because it directly involves ordinances and covenants which connect us with Deity.&nbsp; How connected are you to the temple and your covenants? Are you regularly using this holy form of public worship to strengthen your knowledge and your wisdom? As I have sought to live a balanced life, my prayers have focused more on a desire to live true to my covenants.<br /><br />The most important of public worship meetings outside the temple is sacrament meeting. In addition to the worshipful activities that are part of most Church meetings, this sacred gathering centers on the living ordinance of the sacrament. As we begin and end the meeting and specifically in preparation to partake of the holy sacrament, we sing and we pray. Are we full participants? Are our minds and our hearts there, or are they somewhere else? Are our smartphones off or do we text and tweet (or for us older people e-mail) during the ordinance or during any part of the service? When the speakers speak, especially if they are less polished orators, do we arrogantly disconnect, thinking "I've heard it all before."<br /><br />If we are guilty of any of these mistakes, what we are doing is reducing&mdash;perhaps eliminating&mdash;the ability of the Spirit to communicate with us. And then we wonder why we are not edified by sacrament services and other Church meetings?<br /><br />Public worship is an essential opportunity to develop and maintain balance.</p>
<p><strong>Family Worship</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Public worship should promote family worship. In 1999, the First Presidency counseled parents and children "to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely-appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Of course, these same principles have been repeatedly taught by numerous Church leaders in countless ways over many years.&nbsp;<br /><br />We live in a world of busyness. Traveling throughout the Church, I sometimes privately inquire of local leaders&mdash;and these are good Latter-day Saints&mdash;are you holding family prayer and family home evening? Often, I receive an embarrassed look and the explanation, "We are so busy. Our children's school and extracurricular activities, music and other lessons, social schedule, and Church functions keep them almost fully occupied. My spouse and I are tied up with work, Church, and other commitments. We are seldom together as a family." The spirit of the First Presidency's counsel is that if we are so busy doing good things that we do not have time for the essential things, we must find solutions.<br /><br />When children are raised with meaningful family worship, they are more likely to follow the divine pattern of a balanced life.<br /><br /><strong>Personal Worship</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ultimately, spirituality is a personal matter. Public worship leads us to family worship, which leads us to personal worship. This includes personal prayer, personal gospel study, and personal pondering of one's relationship with Deity. "For how knoweth a man the master ... who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder D. Todd Christofferson said: "The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this&mdash;if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The answer I found as a young bishop, and which has served me in the ensuing years, was simply that we must thoroughly understand the guiding doctrine and then do our best, each day. We organize, prioritize, and live worthy of spiritual guidance required when making the difficult decisions. Often, we seek counsel from those closest to us. From time to time, we may be "out of balance" for a brief period as the immediate needs of one portion of our life takes temporary precedence. When this occurs, we knowingly work through the issue and seek to stabilize ourselves as soon as possible, before the short-term need becomes a long-term trait.<br /><br />If we are out of balance, we can change. We can delay and be compelled by the tragedy of a failing family, or the sorrow of losing our own spirituality; or, we can be attentive and continually nudged by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. Seeking balance among the essential responsibilities of life is preparatory to salvation.<br /><br />We must "see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;However, to encourage our constant effort, we are counseled "it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore all things must be done in order."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;It is my witness that it can be done, and the prize is "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God."<sup>20</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Most of you already understand the principles I teach today. That is shown by how you are living. For others, perhaps some adjustment might be considered. For all of us, continual focus is required because we live in a world that can confuse us and societal priorities of material wealth, pleasure, or prestige can overwhelm the simple, but profound, personal characteristics that each of us must seek. My dear young friends, we need you&mdash;the Lord needs you&mdash;and you are needed forever&mdash;faith-filled, converted, and covenant-keeping. Bless you now, bless you in your critical next season of life, and bless you forever! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brigham Young University Idaho President </p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16th&nbsp;president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015.<br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.<br /><br />President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.<br /><br />President Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including counselor in a stake presidency, bishop, counselor in a bishopric, Young Men's president, Gospel Doctrine teacher, and Scoutmaster. He currently serves as a Sunday School teacher with his wife, Christine.<br /><br />President Gilbert was born in California and raised in Arizona. He and his wife, Christine, are the parents of eight children.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a day you graduates have looked forward to with anticipation and excitement for a long time. I hope each of you has a genuine sense of accomplishment and satisfaction with what is happening today.<br /><br />Three years ago this very week, I received a call from a graduating BYU-Idaho student named Jonathan, who I had mentored for over a decade since our time together in Boston. Jonathan clearly saw receiving his degree as quite a milestone and marker in his life. In many ways he deserved the opportunity to pause and celebrate his accomplishment. You see, Jonathan had come from a broken home in inner-city Boston, out of a community where very few students attended college, let alone finished, and he was about to become the first college graduate in his family.<br /><br />As we spoke, it was clear that Jonathan was almost overwhelmed with the idea that he would be donning his cap and gown as a BYU-Idaho graduate. It was also clear that Jonathan expected me to be just as taken with what was happening: "Clark, you don't seem to understand. Where I came from, nobody graduates from college!" My reply was loving, but firm: "Jonathan, I am so pleased with what is happening this week. You have come so far, and I am so proud of you. But you also need to understand that I have seen this in you for some time. It is actually just one step in a future path that the Lord has been preparing all along. Indeed, if you truly understood what the Lord expects, you would realize this is only just the beginning of a lifetime of personal development and spiritual growth."<br /><br />In the three years since that graduation from right here in this auditorium, Jonathan moved on to meaningful professional work. Then, just last month, he walked through another graduation from a master's program on the East Coast. More importantly, Jonathan has grown in the work of his family, strengthening his relationship with his remarkable wife, becoming a father, and expanding in his priesthood responsibility at home and in the Church. Indeed, the Lord was just beginning then, and He is just beginning now to show Jonathan the work and expectations he has ahead of him.<br /><br />All of us have a stewardship and responsibility for the opportunities and lessons the Lord has blessed us with. Like Jonathan, each of us has been given talents from the Lord; but He also expects us to return those talents with increase. In Matthew we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>To the servants who had returned the talents with increase, the Lord said: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But to the servant who had hid his talent, his lord said unto him, "Thou wicked and slothful servant"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and took that talent from him and gave it to his other servants.</p>
<p>Each of us has been given talents from the Lord. Many of them have come from our parents and from others who have served us in the Church. Some of those talents have come as gifts you have received from the Lord while at this university. They might have come from a faculty member who invested in your learning, or from a university bishop who extended a calling to you to serve in his ward. Those talents may have come in opportunities to serve in leadership roles on campus or in an internship between semesters. Regardless of the talents you have been given while here at this university, we all share a stewardship to return those talents with increase as we consecrate our lives to the Lord and to building His kingdom.</p>
<p>So today, take a moment to pause and celebrate what is happening. Take a photo with your family and loved ones. Hug your friends and, if you are married, kiss your spouse. Celebrate the accomplishment and the milestone that is your graduation. But also know that the word commencement means a beginning, not an end. Each of us has been blessed with opportunities and investments from the Lord. Each of us has a corresponding responsibility to return those talents with increase. I believe this is what Jacob Spori saw when he said, "The seeds we're planting today will grow and become mighty oaks and their branches will run all over the earth."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As you seek for ways to return your talents with increase, I promise you the Lord will bless you in ways that will help you amplify your stewardship to build the kingdom wherever you serve. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brother and sisters, I am pleased to be here with you on this joyous day of commencement. I commend each of you who are graduatin&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;g today for your diligence in pursuing and attaining this significant goal in your life.<br /><br />The outstanding education that you have received here at Brigham Young University-Idaho will assist you in fulfilling many of the personal and professional goals that you have formulated for your future. Long-term goals are good but need to be adaptable because of the numerous variables that can and will affect your plans. In addition, never forget that the Lord also has a wonderful plan for your life, which could necessitate changes to your own plans. There are many ways in which you can handle the changes that will come in your future, but I would like to suggest three keys that will assist you in achieving success in the midst of inevitable change: persistence, patience, and prayer.<br /><br /><strong>Persistence<br /></strong>Persistence is a valuable attribute in dealing with change. For some, the word&nbsp;<em>persistence</em>&nbsp;might have somewhat of a negative connotation, but being persistent in good causes should be a highly sought-after trait. Working hard to make things happen, especially when confronted with external forces and circumstances that impose changes to your plans, requires that you proactively act rather than waiting to be acted upon.</p>
<p>I have been blessed to know exemplary people who have successfully dealt with unexpected change with steadfast persistence. These individuals have overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges and have turned those challenges into triumphant successes. One such individual is here with us tonight and serves as a recreation management professor at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>Dr. Keith Barney suffered a spinal cord injury at the age of 14 while on a hunting trip. He has required the use of a wheelchair for his mobility since that time. Such a severe accident could have left him bitter and withdrawn. Instead, Keith determined to make the best of his situation, and he overcame the challenges that the accident presented to him. Through his persistent efforts he has set and accomplished many worthwhile goals, including the goal to achieve an excellent education. Through hard work and determination he has received a master's degree in social work and a doctorate in therapeutic recreation.</p>
<p>Dr. Barney has also been recognized for excellence in numerous athletic accomplishments, including handcycling 3,250 miles across the United States in just over 49 days. He was an Olympic torchbearer during the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics and competed in the 2002 Salt Lake Paralympics as a member of the U.S. Ski Team.<br /><br />And most impressive of all, Dr. Barney has devoted his life to the service of others, traveling throughout the world to help other wheelchair recipients learn how to be mobile and independent. He has persistently dealt with unanticipated changes in a positive way that has brought great blessings to his own life and to the lives of many others. Persistence, such as that demonstrated by Professor Barney, will help you deal with unforeseen changes to your goals and plans, and will be a means to bless your life in remarkable ways.<br /><br />Next, change requires patience, especially when the change involves a major adjustment to your plans from what you originally envisioned.<br /><br /><strong>Patience</strong><strong><br /></strong>Change has been ongoing at BYU-Idaho since its founding as an educational institution in 1888. Many of the changes that were experienced at the school were welcomed, such as the decision by the Church Board of Education in 1948 to change Ricks College into a four-year institution. However, change can just as often be difficult to accept, as illustrated by the surprising announcement only seven years later that Ricks College would revert to being a two-year junior college again.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the disappointing news of this unexpected announcement, Ricks College President John L. Clarke supportingly wrote at the time, "We feel that our course now is to go forward and develop the school as quickly as we can in accordance with the program."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Despite their disappointment with this change, the Ricks College community worked patiently for the next 45 years until the announcement was made by President Gordon B. Hinckley in June 2000 that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho and would again return to its previous status as a four-year institution.</p>
<p>You need only look around in this beautiful building where we meet tonight to understand that unimagined blessings have flowed to this university because of the patience and hard work exhibited by those early administrators, faculty, and students who were able to "bear all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. things with patience."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The apostle Paul taught, "For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I know you will be blessed as you manage change in your life with the patience exhibited by those early Ricks College stalwarts.<br /><br /><strong>Prayer</strong><strong><br /></strong>While persistence and patience are important in successfully dealing with inevitable change in life, prayer is essential. You and I each realize that our life does not always work out as we have planned. Major setbacks and reversals are not only possible in life but should even be expected at times. During these difficult times prayer will assist you in receiving the help necessary to overcome the challenges that you face. Prayer will enable you to access the aid that you desire and will allow you to "come off conqueror"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;when faced with your darkest hours. Prayer will open a conduit to the Holy Ghost, who will fill you "with hope and perfect love" as you earnestly plead for His presence.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And as you pray, remember that God has promised to help us turn our weaknesses into strengths if we will but come unto Him.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Tomorrow we commemorate the arrival of the first group of LDS pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley 167 years ago. These consecrated souls were superb examples of individuals who have successfully dealt with change. They had a sense of mission that propelled them through the trials they experienced while crossing the plains. They were persistent in their determination to do God's will and to be obedient to His commandments. They were patient in their long-suffering.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;They called upon God in His holy name for strength to deal with the constantly changing environment in which they found themselves.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;They counseled with Heavenly Father in all their doings and were blessed with peace in the midst of their trials.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As you face a future full of tremendous opportunities and unknown challenges, remember to be persistent, patient, and prayerful in how you handle any given situation. By so doing you will be blessed beyond measure and will find true success and happiness in your life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Communication Department Faculty Member</p>
<p>Brother Brian Howard started his broadcast career at a low-power AM station right here at Ricks College. He continued to work in radio and television as a student at Southern Utah University where he earned his bachelor's degree. He took his first full time job in television as a reporter/anchor at KPVI-TV in Pocatello,Idaho. <br /><br /> After several years there he left to work on a master's degree at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. At BYU he worked as an assignment editor for the university's student-run integrated television, radio, newspaper, and Internet newsroom. He also worked as a producer and video editor at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, and as a producer and director at KBYU Television. <br /><br /> He accepted a teaching position at Ricks College in 1999, and enjoyed the process of helping create a new four-year broadcast program as Ricks became Brigham Young University-Idaho. Brother Howard earned his Ph.D. in Education from the University of Idaho in 2010. <br /><br /> He currently teaches video journalism and mass media courses and is the host and executive producer of the television program Latter-day Profiles. Latter-day Profiles is produced by BYU-Idaho students, and is a talk show that features noteworthy members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The program airs every Sunday at 2:35 Mountain time on BYU Television.<br /><br /> Bro. Howard grew up in Chester, Idaho-a very small community about twenty minutes north of Rexburg. He served as a missionary in the Geneva, Switzerland mission. He has served in the Church as a counselor in two bishoprics and as a bishop. He is currently a counselor in the stake Sunday School Presidency in the Sugar City Stake. He and his wife Kami have been married for twenty years and have four children (two boys and two girls) ranging in age from seventeen to seven.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was a young boy, about ten years old or so, my grandparents gave me a portable AM/FM radio. I was fascinated. It was fun adjusting the dial to explore the available radio stations. The best time to find new stations was at night. At night the signal from radio stations on the AM band travel much farther than in the daytime. At night I could tune into basketball games from KSL 1160 in Salt Lake City, music and DJs from KOMA 1520 broadcasting at 50-thousand watts of power from Oklahoma City, or programming from other faraway places like KFI 640 in Los Angeles, or 680 KNBR in San Francisco. It was amazing to me that I could be in my bedroom in rural Idaho and listen to people and music broadcast from hundreds or even thousands of miles away.<br /><br />The AM radio technology that fascinated me in the 1970s is now very old school. Today anyone with a decent internet connection can read, listen to, or watch content from individuals, groups or organizations from just about anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;Of course sending messages hasn't always been so easy. In fact for thousands of years words were recorded on stone, metal plates, animal skins and scrolls. One could only send those written words as fast as a man or horse could run or at the speed of a sailing ship. For ages the only way to listen to music was to hear it performed live.<br /><br />We live in a time that most people throughout the history of the world couldn't have imagined. Emeritus Professor at the University of Washington, Don Pember created an interesting mass media timeline. He envisioned what all of mass media history would look like if it were condensed into one calendar year from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve.<br /><br />According to his calendar from January first to December 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;there was absolutely nothing&mdash;no mass media. In fact, it is not until two days after Christmas that we get our first mass media invention&mdash;the printing press at about 1450 A.D. It is not until New Year's Eve on this theoretical calendar that electronic media of radio, television and VCR's show up. It is a good thing or we'd miss watching the lighted ball dropping in Times Square on TV! The time in which we live today, with smart phones and digital and social media is 11:59...one minute until midnight on New Year's Eve.<br /><br />All of the technological innovations that we have today are amazing. They are evidence that the Lord is hastening his work. Over the past few years we've heard many of our Church leaders talk about hastening the work of salvation. In a recent Education Week address at BYU in Provo, Elder David A. Bednar talked about the dispensation of the fullness of times and technology:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We are blessed to live, learn, and serve in this most remarkable dispensation. An important aspect of the fulness that is available to us in this special season is a miraculous progression of innovations and inventions that have enabled and accelerated the work of salvation: from trains to telegraphs to radios to automobiles to airplanes to telephones to transistors to televisions to computers to satellite transmissions to the Internet&mdash;and to an almost endless list of technologies and tools that bless our lives. All of these advancements are part of the Lord hastening His work in the latter days."</p>
<p>In that same address, Elder Bednar shared a quote from Brigham Young from 1862:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Every discovery in science and art, that is really true and useful to mankind has been given by direct revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it. It has been given with a view to prepare the way for the ultimate triumph of truth, and the redemption of the earth from the power of sin and Satan. We should take advantage of all these great discoveries, the accumulated wisdom of ages, and give to our children the benefit of every branch of useful knowledge, to prepare them to step forward and efficiently do their part in the great work."</p>
<p>To help us to understand where we are now, it is important to review where we've been. In a 2003 General Conference talk, President Thomas S. Monson shared pieces of a treasure map to guide us to eternal happiness: Learn from the past, Prepare for the future, Live in the present.</p>
<p>With that in mind my talk today will focus on the use of media and technology in hastening the work of salvation. With President Monson's admonition to learn from the past, I went to familysearch.org to research some of my ancestors. I discovered that my great, great grandfather on my Father's side was born in 1828. That was just eight years after Joseph Smith experienced the First Vision and saw the Father and the Son in a grove of trees near his home in Palmyra, New York. The First Vision wasn't only the beginning of the restoration of Christ's Church on the earth after a long period of apostasy, it was also the beginning of a resurgence in secular knowledge inspired by heaven.<br /><br />At a BYU-Idaho devotional in 2007, Elder Merrill J. Bateman said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is apparent that secular knowledge has flowered since the time of Joseph Smith, that the Lord has been flooding the earth with temporal knowledge as well as spiritual."</p>
<p>Elder Bateman referred to a book titled, "The Birth of Plenty" by William Bernstein. In the book Bernstein wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Beginning around 1820, the pace of economic advance picked up noticeably, making the world a better place to live in. What happened? An explosion of technological innovation the likes of which had never before been seen."</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, My great, great, grandfather William Riley Howard Senior was born in 1828 and lived until 1902.</p>
<p>During his lifetime new technologies and innovations emerged like the electro-magnetic motor, the telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, and the incandescent light bulb.<br /><br />Can you imagine growing up in a time when you and your ancestors before you had never seen electric lights and had never heard a recorded voice.<br /><br />Imagine that the distance at which you could hold a conversation with another person was only as far as you could yell. How do you share the gospel? One way was to print copies of the Book of Mormon and send missionaries out on foot, horseback and boat. In 1803, all of sixteen new missionaries were sent out to proselyte in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.<br /><br />Although I couldn't find how my great great grandfather came in contact with the Church, he did. He joined the church and moved West to Utah in 1850.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that the Church produced a number of print publications in the early years of the Church including the Times and Seasons newspaper in Nauvoo and the Millennial Star in England. In June of 1850 the Deseret News was published in Salt Lake City and is still published today. Two other noteworthy events are the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 and the emergence of miles and miles of telegraph lines across the United States in the same general time period. It was getting easier to send messages and share the gospel.<br /><br />My great grandfather was William Riley Howard Junior.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was born in 1854 in Pleasant Grove, Utah. In 1885, William Riley was with a group that travelled to Wilford, Idaho to homestead some land. Wilford is a small community north of Rexburg. That trip of about 300 miles would take about four hours travelling by car today. Back in 1885 it was a two-week trip with horses and wagons.<br /><br />William Riley Howard Junior lived until 1916. In his lifetime there were many new inventions including the Kodak camera, the gasoline-powered car, the airplane, and the Model T automobile.<br /><br />Church membership increased from about 52,000 in 1850 to 400,000 in 1910, which incidentally was the year that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir did a recording for the Columbia Phonograph Company.<br /><br />William Junior and his wife Elizabeth Jane Davis had eight children&mdash;five of which lived to adulthood. One of those five was my grandfather William Carloss Howard.<br /><br />He was born in 1884 in Hooper, Utah. &nbsp;In 1919 he was called to serve a mission to the Southern States Mission. He was set apart by James E. Talmage.<br /><br />During my grandfather's lifetime there were amazing technological innovations, especially in the area of mass communication.<br /><br />The first licensed radio station, KDKA, went on the air in 1920. &nbsp;In 1922 the Deseret News was licensed to operate a radio station KZN which later became KSL. By 1923 portions of General Conference were broadcast and by 1929 the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began weekly radio broadcasts. The program would become the longest continuously running broadcast network program in America.<br /><br />While radio was taking off, Philo Farnsworth, a Mormon boy from Utah and Idaho invented electronic television in 1927.<br /><br />By 1930 Church membership was up to 670,000.<br /><br />William Carloss Howard passed away in 1964, three years before I was born. His oldest son, my dad, was born in 1926 in Chester, Idaho.<br /><br />He was a pretty smart guy. When he was in the seventh grade, a teacher asked him if he'd like to move on to high school because my dad had scored so well on the mid-year achievement tests. So he became a twelve-year-old freshman in high school.</p>
<p>In his journal he recalled his senior year in high school when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It was a Sunday when we were having stake conference . . .After conference we came home and listened to the news on the radio. There was no television, but the radio provided good news coverage from around the world. We had a little black radio that sat on a small shelf by the window in the living room of the little old log house."</p>
<p>My dad used the GI Bill to help him with his education. As a young father with two small children, he took the Greyhound bus from Chester to Rexburg each day to attend Ricks College. He received his four-year diploma in 1954 from the hands of President David O. McKay.</p>
<p>During my Dad's lifetime the rate of technological advances increased dramatically. We landed on the moon in 1969. The video game Pong was created. Bill Gates formed a little company called Microsoft and in the early 1980s the personal computer made its debut. It is interesting to think that my great grandfather was around for the debut of automobiles and in my dad's lifetime we were able to land a man on the moon.<br /><br />During my Dad's lifetime the Church's use of media increased markedly&mdash;KSL TV went on the air, Music and the Spoken Word began to be broadcast on TV as well as General Conference. In 1964 "Man's Search for Happiness", the church's first film written for a non-LDS audience premiered at the World's Fair in New York and was seen by five million people. The use of media and the growth of the Church was accelerating.<br /><br />I was born in St. Anthony, Idaho in 1967. No surprise, my middle name is Riley. Media and technology has changed a lot in my lifetime. When I tell my children stories about when I was young, they sometimes look at me as if I'm either really old or perhaps a bit crazy.<br /><br />As the youngest of ten children, one of my jobs was to change the TV channel. There was no remote control, so my job was to sit next to the TV and turn the knob. Of course we only had three channels to choose from so it wasn't very tough. I have boxes with eight track tapes, cassettes, vinyl records, and even reel-to-reel tape that are gathering dust as a testament to advances in media technology.<br /><br />In the early seventies, Church membership grew to around three million members. In an address to Regional Representatives 1974, President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">". . . when we have used the satellite and related discoveries to their greatest&nbsp; potential and all of the media&mdash;the papers, magazines, television, radio&mdash;all in their greatest power. . . then and not until then, shall we approach the insistence of our Lord and Master to go into all of the world and preach the gospel to every creature."</p>
<p>Through the eighties and nineties the Church's use of media increased. Mr. Krueger's Christmas appeared on network television, satellite dishes popped up at stake centers around the world, President Hinckley did numerous media interviews including an appearance on 60 Minutes, the Church launched its website LDS.org in 1997.</p>
<p>There are many, many more innovations that I haven't mentioned that we don't have time to list in this setting. Many of the dates and events I've mentioned today come from "Mormon Media History Timeline: 1827-2007" prepared by Dr. Sherry Baker from Brigham Young University. It represents years of research and you can refer to it for a detailed list of major media events related to the Church.<br /><br />We've looked to the past and we can clearly see the increasing pace of innovation in technology and media. We are now in the digital age, the age of social media. I teach a course called mass media and society here at BYU-Idaho. Over the past few semesters I have been giving a short quiz at the beginning of the semester.<br /><br />I show the students a list of media-related products and services such as Facebook, Twitter, the iPhone and iPad, Google Plus, Snapchat and so on.<br /><br />The quiz is to determine the year in which each of the products or services was first introduced. They usually get a few right on, however, getting the exact date isn't the point of the quiz. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I reveal the dates, I point out to the students that all of these products and services that many of us use every day were launched in their lifetimes.<br /><br />The Church has done an amazing job of producing media to share the gospel message. That list includes books, newspapers, pamphlets, videos, music, movies etc. In this new age of social media something has changed. All of the Church-produced media was wonderful, but in years past it wasn't easy to share. Now it is. In an address given in May of 2011, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before. . . . Perhaps the Lord's encouragement to 'open [your] mouths' might today include 'use your hands' to blog and text message the gospel to all the world! . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"With the blessings of modern technology, we can express gratitude and joy about God's great plan for His children in a way that can be heard . . . around the world. Sometimes a single phrase of testimony can set events in motion that affect someone's life for eternity."</p>
<p>In April of 2015 the Church released an Easter-themed video, "He Lives" on the Mormon Channel on YouTube.</p>
<p>Members were encouraged to share the video with others through any of their social media services and the use of the hashtag #BecauseHeLives. The video has received over five million views. This is just one of many examples where faithful church members have helped share the gospel through new media resources.<br /><br />Many of us may be unsure about sharing the gospel through social media. You'll find a list of the Church's official social media sites and well as tips and ideas on LDS.org under "Sharing via Social Media".<br /><br />Another great resource is a book called 101 Ways to Hasten the Work Online by Larry Richman.<br /><br />Brother Richman is an online marketing professional and the Director of Product Awareness and Evaluation for the Church. Some of his 101 ideas are as simple as following and repining images from the Church on Pinterest. Others are a little more involved like beginning a blog about something that interests you.<br /><br />Brother Richman has taken his own advice and runs the blog LDS Media Talk which I follow.<br /><br />On his blog he writes that the purpose of LDS Media talk is for him to, "share ideas with LDS parents and youth about how to use materials published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and others. The blog also shares ideas on using technology to strengthen families and share the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ."<br /><br />Although Brother Richman works for the Church, he makes it clear on his blog that it is not an official Church publication and the views expressed their don't necessarily reflect the views of the Church. That is following the counsel from Elder M. Russell Ballard offered in a commencement address here at BYU-Idaho in 2008. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Remember that while you as an individual Latter-day Saint in some ways represent the Church, be careful not to represent&nbsp;<em>yourself</em>&nbsp;as speaking officially for the Church."</p>
<p>While the advent of social media makes it easier than ever to share the gospel. Some of us may still be reluctant to share our beliefs openly through social media because we are afraid of negative responses from others. In a 2014 CES Devotional, Elder Ballard called for us to stand up and be courageous. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Lord invites you to get involved and use the social media platforms you prefer to share the gospel and stand as modern sons and daughters of Helaman in the great battles of the last days. He wants you to become the modern stripling warriors who stand strong and united to defend the truth. He wants you to be courageous and stalwart in the face of the enemy's advances. We know that in the end the Lord will win the day and Satan will be defeated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Through various social media platforms, you can have gospel conversations with family, friends, and, for you returned missionaries, even with former investigators and new members. You can stand as witnesses to the truth and defend the kingdom."</p>
<p>What really caught my attention from Elder Ballard's statement is that the Lord is inviting us to get involved in sharing the gospel through social media. However, as you and I know, it is very easy to spend hours with social media in what we might call, "less productive" activities. It is easy to scroll through Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat for hours reading posts, liking pictures, and watching videos. Earlier I referred to President Monson's council to learn from the past, prepare for the future and live in the present. I'm not sure if when he talked about living in the present he was referring to how we interact with social media, but I think it would be good advice. At the beginning of the classes I teach, I frequently remind students to "be present" and turn off their smart phones and tablets. Elder Ballard put it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Too often, young people find themselves in the same room with family or friends but are too busy communicating with someone not present, thereby missing an opportunity to visit with those nearby. When this happens, maybe you need to leave the room and send a text message back to them to get their attention."</p>
<p>One of my favorite projects I have students in my mass media classes work on each semester is keeping a media journal. I ask them to try their best to track all of their media consumption, music, social media, movies, books, etc. for about three days. It is a difficult task because the media is everywhere!</p>
<p>The idea for this project came, in part, through an experience I had with some friends in college. A young married couple we knew was trying to better manage their finances, so they met with a financial advisor. The advisor told them that before he could really help them, they needed to track every penny they spent over a period of a month or so. It was a tedious task, but in the end they had some interesting results. One finding was that the wife had a serious liking for bubble gum. They discovered that she was spending approximately ten to twenty dollars on bubble gum a month.<br /><br />She had no idea her sweet tooth was costing them that much. She enjoyed bubble gum and would pick up a pack what she thought was just every once-in-a-while. Now armed with this new information the couple could make some decisions. The wife enjoyed bubble gum so they could continue spending a good portion of their starving-college-student income on gum. Another option could be to set a limit on the amount of gum she purchased every month. They could even choose to cut it out all together and spend the savings on more extravagant college meals like mac and cheese or ramen noodles.<br /><br />Similarly, if we never really take a personal inventory of our media consumption, like with the class project of keeping a media journal, we may never really know where we are spending our media time. Is it possible that there is some "bubble gum" in the time we spend with social and other media sources?&nbsp; A little bubble gum may be okay, but a steady diet may have negative consequences even if it is just taking us away from time spent doing other things. Although the media journal project is not meant to be an "intervention", some students are very surprised and sometimes embarrassed at what they discover when they take a serious look at their media use. I would invite all of us to examine our media consumption. Take the time to review how much time we are spending on our smart phones and other devices and for what purpose.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy teaching at BYU-Idaho, and one of the things I like best is working directly with students. With the help of some hard-working and creative students a few years back, we came up with an idea to produce a TV program that we hoped would air on BYUTV. One of my colleagues in the Communication Department, Ron Weekes, came up with the title, "Latter-day Profiles." The idea was to do thirty-minute interviews with faithful church members who are involved in business, public service, entertainment, and a host of other worthwhile and noteworthy causes.<br /><br />The hope was that we could share often untold stories to inspire and encourage others, especially fellow church members. It has been a lot of work but it has also been a lot of fun. We've produced around two hundred episodes. "Latter-day Profiles" currently airs every Sunday afternoon on BYUTV and is available on our website latterdayprofiles.org. I host the program and have had the opportunity to interview hundreds of people. One of my favorite people to interview was then President Kim B. Clark when he was serving as president here at BYU-Idaho. The last time I interviewed him was just a month before his tenure ended as president in March of this year. We talked at length about the Pathway program. If you are not familiar with the program, here is a brief summary from the Pathway website:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Pathway is a low-cost educational opportunity that combines online courses with local gatherings. Students earn college credit that is eligible for transfer to BYU-Idaho and other universities. The program takes three semesters, or one year, to complete and can lead to professional certificates and degrees."</p>
<p>President Clark spoke of how the program had grown from about six hundred students to ten thousand in just a few years. I asked him if he felt the Pathway program was part of hastening the work of Salvation. Here is his response:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Oh there is no question, there is no question. The things that we see at the university are absolutely apart of that. Pathway for example, we made a decision early on not require students to be in endorsed, so to participate in Pathway you do not have to get a bishops endorsement or a stake president's endorsement which means we can go out and reach out to people who need to be rescued. Whose lives may not be in order or who have wandered from the path and invite them back.</p>
<p>So we have seen a lot a lot of less active people come back into the church and embrace the gospel and embrace the Lord that have not, that would not have had that opportunity come to them without somebody reaching out to them and say, you know, "why don't you come?" Because here's an opportunity to really improve your life and then the first thing you study is the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>And you take Book of Mormon for a semester and do a course we call Pathway Life Skills which is a great course and they feel the spirit, you know, they meet with other Latter-day Saints, they start to feel some hope in their lives and they come back. It's a really sweet, sweet experience.<br /><br />The Pathway program is one of many inspired innovations that have been made possible by the technological advances that are a result of heavenly inspiration. In a conference address in October of 1926, Joseph Fielding Smith spoke of new technologies and the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I maintain that had there been no restoration of the gospel, and no organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there would have been no radio; there would have been no airplane, and there would not have been the wonderful discoveries in medicine, chemistry, electricity, and the many other things wherein the world has been benefited by such discoveries. Under such conditions these blessings would have been withheld, for they belong to the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times of which the restoration of the gospel and the organization of the Church constitute the central point, from which radiates the Spirit of the Lord throughout the world. The inspiration of the Lord has gone out and takes hold of the minds of men, though they know it not, and they are directed by the Lord. In this manner he brings them into his service that his purposes and his righteousness, in due time, may be supreme on the earth."</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters. As President Monson counseled us, let us learn from the past. As we look back, we can clearly see the hand of the Lord in preparing the way for the gospel to be spread to all the earth. Let us prepare for the future. We must invest time and effort to learn and adapt to new technologies and methods of sharing the gospel so we can be part of Elder Bednar's call to "sweep the earth as with a flood." Lastly, let us live in the present. Be present! Don't let the easy distraction of social media and smart phone technology keep you from personal relationships with family, friends and most importantly, with Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>It is my testimony that we do live in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. The Lord is hasting his work. May we do all that we can to do our part in sharing the gospel and moving the work forward is my hope and prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The title of my talk is &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s Lessons from Liberty Jail,&rdquo; which sounds much better than &ldquo;Confessions of a Classic Worrier&rdquo; (sounds like I have company). I have been blessed with a great capacity to worry and I have discovered that I have a lot of company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure how it started or why, but it was when I was very young. I likely inherited it from my father and grandmother. Is my worry a personality trait, a learned behavior, or something buried deep in my genetic code? The answer is probably a little of each. On a positive note, my worry has not kept me from living a happy and productive life. It has been a hindrance at times and my ruminations have driven me to my knees, even compelling me to be humble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One benefit of my worry is I have spent a lot of time researching many of the hallmark self-help works. I even volunteer and continue to teach a class called &ldquo;Principles of Personal Achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years of teaching I have come to love and believe many of the principles in those great books. Fortunately, for most of my life the need for personal application have been few. However, that dramatically changed in 2006 when I learned my younger brother (a year younger than me) had terminal brain cancer. While this news would be devastating to anyone, it hit me particularly hard. We were both infants born in Southern Utah, me in 1960, my brother in 1962. Because of our location and timing, we are classified as &ldquo;Down winders,&rdquo; growing up in the path of radioactive fallout from the nuclear bomb tests conducted in Nevada. (now if they pulled all the shades and turned out the lights don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t glow in the dark! I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t think, still radioactive.) While vaguely aware of this as a young man, it suddenly became the proverbial elephant in the room, at least for me. I soon found myself not only grieving for my brother, but trapped in worry and &ldquo;what if&rdquo; thinking. It didn&rsquo;t help that my brother and his wife received a $50,000 dollar check from the federal government, basically an apology saying &ldquo;Sorry, we didn&rsquo;t know the dangers of the tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet and Google is a great thing, but I made the classic mistake of Googling the symptoms. (Don&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;ll be a long list of bad things). Hoping this would lead to some reassurances, it only compounded my worry and increased levels of anxiety. As I was about to turn 50, I experienced my first panic attack and now had even more symptoms to Google. Did this lead to more peace? Absolutely not. Thankfully, I was wise enough to turn to more traditional help and I began meeting with a counselor. After a few weeks, my therapist suggested mindfulness and meditation and she recommended attending the weekly workshops that we have here on campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time I became a novice impatient practitioner of meditation. Unfortunately, I had several internal conflicts with the whole mindfulness and meditation movement. First, meditative arts and mindfulness are based on Buddha and Hindu traditions. Also, several of my readings on mindfulness took a very scientific approach saying we suffer because of our reptile brain and the fact that we descended from caveman who woke up every morning with two questions: Am I going to eat? or be eaten? And those very secular philosophies didn&rsquo;t sit well with me at all. I wanted to have my healing come from my firm belief that I am a child of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I discovered is a growing movement, and you can see this all through the news, that some have called &ldquo;spiritual but not religious.&rdquo; So many are seeking peace and they doggedly pursue it through things like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, exercise, acupuncture, getting in touch with nature, and so much more. I&rsquo;ve tried all of those. In fact, it&rsquo;s become big business. True to form, I worried I was treading down some alternative spiritual path. I could just see the headlines, &ldquo;Former Mormon Bishop finds peace through Buddhism.&rdquo; So for me, I yearned to be both spiritual and religious, very much in the context of what President David O. McKay said when he taught: &ldquo;Spirituality is the consciousness of victory over self and communion with the Infinite.&rdquo; Spiritual but not religious is godless. My faith encouraged me to have God at the center of my healing. Thankfully, Heavenly Father answered my prayers, which surprisingly came with a simple program we sponsor with the BYU-Idaho Alumni office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each semester, we host a webcast featuring a teacher and topic from the university. The subject in March of 2015 was on the Prophet Joseph Smith. The presenter was religion professor Dr. Nathan Williams. I had the privilege of introducing Brother Williams at this event and settled into learn more about the prophet of the Restoration. The title of the lecture was &ldquo;If, Know, Therefore: Lessons from the prophet Joseph Smith on how to overcome all things.&rdquo; The presentation focused on the challenges the prophet faced in Liberty Jail and the lessons he received regarding trials. As I was listening it suddenly hit me, the prophet was being taught coping principles very much in alignment with mindfulness. You can view Brother Williams entire presentation on the BYU-Idaho Alumni website at www.byui.edu/alumni. And you can see dozens more webcasts on topics like meditation, the family, the Book of Mormon, effective scripture study and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what lessons can we learn from the Prophet Joseph Smith that can help you and me and especially those that deal with worry?</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith was very familiar with tribulation. He stated &ldquo;deep water is what I am wont to swim in&rdquo;. Who knows where Liberty Jail ranked for the prophet, but it had to be one of his most challenging trials. For sure it lasted the longest, nearly five months in the dead of a Missouri winter. The conditions were appalling. He and his fellow prisoners were tormented, fed poorly, had few visitors, and limited communication with friends and family. They had no bedding and had to sleep on a stone floor with just a bit of straw, which would have provided little or no comfort. Yet, in Liberty Jail was where the prophet received the revelations now canonized in Doctrine and Covenants 121-123.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Section 122, the Lord gives Joseph Smith several "ifs" starting with "if thou art called to pass through tribulation". Several of the &ldquo;if&rsquo;s had to be especially poignant, since the prophet had already endured them, like being &ldquo;accused of false brethren," having his &ldquo;enemies fall upon [him],&rdquo; and &ldquo;with drawn sword thine enemies tear [him] from the bosom of [his] wife, offspring, and elder son&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of all of these personally experienced and forecasted &ldquo;if&rsquo;s&rsquo;, the prophet was reminded to <em>know</em>. &ldquo;know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" and "God will be with you forever and ever". Finally, the prophet is admonished to "therefore, hold on thy way," and "fear not what man can do.&rdquo; In Section 123, the final &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; is given, when the Lord stated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A review of the therefores in these two sections instructed the prophet and his followers (you and I) to:</p>
<p>For each of us, we will face our own challenges and very hard times. In fact, "if" will certainly become "when." President Boyd K. Packer said:</p>
<p>"It was meant to be that life would be a challenge. To suffer some anxiety, some depression, some disappointment, even some failure is normal. Teach our members that if they have a good, miserable day once in a while, or several in a row, to stand steady and face them. Things will straighten out. There is a great purpose in our struggle in life.."</p>
<p>Following the prophet's example in Liberty Jail and &ldquo;If, know, therefore,&rdquo; this pattern, so clearly taught by Brother Williams, gives us an effective blueprint on how to face and overcome our challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if and when I have a real personal trial, first I need to exercise trust. I know my Heavenly Father is very aware of my needs and that "all flesh is in [His] hands" (D&amp;C 101:16). Because I have this trust, I can therefore act in faith and do those things that will help me productively face my challenges. Rather than grumbling, whining, and wallowing in self-pity, I can choose to "hold on my way," &ldquo;to fear not,&rdquo; and do my part to serve my Heavenly Father and His kingdom. If I do so with a positive outlook, taking time to ponder and be still, with faith, the Lord&rsquo;s hand and his plan for me will be revealed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; found in D&amp;C 123:17 just might contain the secret to solving almost all of our problems -- the ultimate self help in just 38 words. I have referred to this as my &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; scripture. If we are living the gospel, including receiving all of the saving ordinances, we cannot fail. Heavenly Father will not allow it and will not short us on any of the blessings we were foreordained to receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an in depth look at this scripture and consider how the Lord will help us &ldquo;overcome all things."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is easy to be grateful for things when life seems to be going our way. But what then of those times when what we wish for seems to be far out of reach? Could I suggest that we see gratitude as a disposition, a way of life that stands independent of our current situation? In other words, I&rsquo;m suggesting that instead of being thankful for things, we focus on being thankful in our circumstances&mdash;whatever they may be" (Ensign May 2014).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our lives, especially as we look back, we will remember times when we saw the &ldquo;salvation of the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;His arm . . . revealed.&rdquo; In my life I have had several, but one in particular stands out as proof positive God would not let me mess up and miss out on an all of my foreordained blessings. Anyone who visits our home, my office, or even our family blog will notice we have a unique family. How this unfolded for us, and for me personally, is a testimony of divine assistance. We had our &ldquo;ifs and whens,&rdquo; were blessed to &ldquo;Know&rdquo; and almost naively practiced some good &ldquo;therefores&rdquo; taking positive action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my wife and I started on our family journey, we talked fondly about our ideal family. Hopefully, just like her's with six children, three boys, three girls, all spaced out just right. (Now her family is more ideal than mine because we had five boys and one girl.) Sadly, like many couples just making a plan and hoping for a child did not automatically guarantee success. After a few frustrating years, with lots of research and trips to the doctor, we learned we were sub fertile, which we guessed was better than being infertile. We were assured that with some medical intervention, we could conceive. Being very poor college students, we decided to just wait one more year until I graduated from college and secured employment. We even dropped our maternity insurance, officially stopped trying and got pregnant. Which was our first happy experience with &ldquo;paradoxical intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next several years, we suffered the loss of a stillborn child and after some extended time and more help we welcomed two more children into our home, a daughter and a son. However, the spaces between each child were much longer than we had hoped, with return trips to seek medical assistance. And, just like with child number one, each time conception happened after we quit trying. After some time we settled into a very happy life here in Idaho. While we still hoped for more children, we tried to pretend we were not trying. I began to justify the size of our family by researching many of those, including two modern day prophets (President Monson, President Benson, Elder Haight, Elder Bednar, and the list goes on), who had small families. We were going to be okay. That was until our daughter started praying for a sister. Every family prayer she offered included this plea. After nearly a decade of these prayers and realizing her parents were not likely to get pregnant, she began to pray we would adopt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adoption! Of course my wife was all for this, but I was definitely not. You see, I adored my kids, but I doubted I could care for a kid that was not biologically ours. Plus, I am a huge cheapskate and adoption is very, very expensive. I would list a dozen reasons why we were okay and even more why adoption was foolish choice. Over the next few years, I patiently endured the prayers and adoption talk saying, "this too shall pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally relented to at least allow a home study and even helped my wife research different options. In the middle of all of this, almost miraculously and again paradoxically, we got pregnant for the fifth time. However, from the beginning this was different and within just a few weeks my wife miscarried and we were squarely back to the adoption question. However, this time I was more on board and even created a profile on a website called "Hope to Adopt."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within just a few days, we had our first promising contact from a young LDS lady. She was going to have a baby girl later in the year and we were her first choice -- a sister was coming! We corresponded, made plans, and even canceled my wife&rsquo;s trip with me to Europe. As the time drew closer, we started to talk about getting attorneys involved and determining the steps we would need to finalize the adoption. Suddenly, however, the communication from our prospective birth mother just stopped. I finally received the shocking news she never was pregnant, just lonely and needing some attention. To say we were disappointed was an understatement -- and any inclination I had to adopt was officially shot. Well, my wife was still "hoping to adopt" and my daughter kept praying. In fact, my wife received several very strong promptings and inspiration, one time in the temple, that there was someone, some child waiting for us to come, waiting to come to our family. Also, it seemed families who had wonderful adoptions success stories kept crossing our path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I enrolled on the &ldquo;Hope to Adopt&rdquo; web service, we were subscribed to some adoption email lists. One morning I was at my desk working when I received an email from an agency. The message stated that they had just learned of a baby that was going to be born within the month and they needed to find a family right away. The need was so great that this baby was on sale-discounted price. This email piqued my interest, but I quickly discounted it because this soon-to-be-born baby was an African American boy and we were hoping for a mixed race or Caucasian girl. For several moments my mouse and cursor just hung over the delete button. I knew by sharing this message with my family, especially my wife and daughter, there would be hours of discussion, even pleadings. I knew I would be ganged up on as the supposed voice of reason. If I hit delete, I would be spared, but I printed the email and shared the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True to my prediction, the discussions at home began in earnest and I was obviously the odd-man-out. I was still skeptical, especially since the gender did not match our plans and an agency adoption would be very expensive (even with the discounted price). After a few days and on a Sunday evening I exercised some patriarchal dad's-in-charge authority and called a family council and I asked everyone's opinion, which included my wife, daughter, and youngest son. The only one missing was our eldest son who was serving a full-time mission. All were positively in favor so I decided to forcefully state my opposition. I argued this type of adoption was risky, expensive, and not in line with our initial plans. I told them that I wanted to drop the issue. We were not going to volunteer for this little boy. Apparently my argument was convincing enough and they kind of just agreed. A resigned acceptance. I went to bed feeling like I had finally put this issue to rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I arose the next morning and followed my usual routine, including a three o&rsquo;clock walk to work. Along the way, I was puzzled because I felt particularly anxious, almost like I was sick to my stomach. I arrived at work and settled in at my desk, and began pondering why I felt so poorly. I rationalized that perhaps I was a bit strong the night before and knowing I had dashed the hopes of people I really loved. I felt like I needed at least one companion on my side, so I quickly composed an email to our missionary son. This was Monday, email day. &nbsp;I said something like "Dear Elder Davis, what would you think of having an African American baby brother?" You see, before his mission he was on my side and shared the same view that our little family was okay. He used the term, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t upset the apple cart, we would be okay.&rdquo; I impatiently waited through the morning because Monday was our email day our son and his message would surely support my position and "ease my pain." Well, the message came and my son said, &ldquo;I think it sounds like a great idea! I really feel good about it.&rdquo; So now I&rsquo;m all alone. I called my wife and asked her how she was doing. Coincidently, she was feeling exactly like me--feeling poorly, feeling upset. At that moment I learned the Lord can and will answer your prayers with very strong "negative" impressions and emotions. I literally felt like I had been kicked in the stomach and I knew that my decision to opt out of this adoption opportunity was incorrect. My wife and I concluded the Lord's message to us was crystal clear and we should pursue the chance for a new baby. Almost instantly, our anxious feelings disappeared and we both felt peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now started the adoption proceedings in earnest. After completing all of the necessary paperwork, we soon learned that the birth mother had narrowed her list of potential families to three, and we were on that list! The other families included a lesbian couple and another LDS family living in Alabama. Our chances looked pretty good! Sadly, we soon learned that the birth mother had selected the couple from Alabama. We were shocked and we wondered why the Lord would give us such strong spiritual promptings only to be denied? We surmised that perhaps the Lord was telling us, and particularly me, that pursuing adoption really would be okay. Still, this was a bitter pill to swallow. We had two failures at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monday night, a couple weeks later, I was shopping at a local grocery store when I received a phone call from the agency. They informed me that the other family had received two offers and we were now number one on the list. I decided right then that we would take this opportunity, even before calling my wife. I quickly called her and told her the happy news. The challenge, this baby boy was being born and we needed to get my wife to Atlanta. We rushed home and got our tickets secured and she was on her way within just hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What followed was a whirlwind of events as my wife met both birth parents, the birth grandmother, and brand new baby boy. Upon meeting my wife, the grandmother excitedly exclaimed that she was &ldquo;just as she imagined.&rdquo; My wife then met the birth mother and baby, and she was also excited to meet my wife. Sadly, the birth father didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with this intruder from Idaho. My wife was patient and encouraged to ponder and pray. She even taught them some basics principles of the Plan of Salvation. As it was the middle of the day, she offered to go buy everyone lunch and asked what was their favorite. They said Chick-fil-A, and she hurried off to get lunch. Once she returned, the birth father was now willing to meet and surprisingly he and my wife made an immediate connection. Within a short time, and we believe because of real promptings from the Spirit, they all decided to proceed with the adoption stating "you need to hold him because he is your baby." Soon, the attorney arrived the necessary paperwork was done and he escorted my wife and the baby to the rental car. Along the way, he shared that in all of his work with adoptions he had never felt the feelings he experienced in that hospital room. He said, "I'm not sure why I feel this way, but that is your baby." Well, we are confident that everyone involved, including a non-LDS attorney, were feeling the promptings of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within a few days my wife and our new son made it out west and he was united with two of his older siblings. Now it was time for my paradigm shifts! This was our fifth child, my fourth son, and I got to see and hold him for the first time in the middle of a flood of people in the Salt Lake City. It was so different and I was concerned those feelings of intimacy were not immediate. Thankfully, I was amazed at how soon we bonded and that my feelings of affection were no different than with my other children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few months we enjoyed three very sacred experiences. The first was at our local courthouse as our family became official. The second was with the baby blessing. You could see he wasn&rsquo;t a baby anymore. He was very big. And the final grand day happened in the temple as our son was sealed to us as his parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After just a couple of years, my wife and I started discussing the need for our son to have a sibling. So... adoption. This time, I would be all in! I was even willing to take on more debt. However, one day at the kitchen sink my wife heard the words in her mind "you are expecting." What?! It had been over a decade since our last successful pregnancy. Plus, I was approaching 47 and my wife 44 -- no way could we be expecting! A few months later, we welcomed a new daughter into our home. My oldest daughter finally had a baby sister. After 31 years of marriage and a span of 22 years from our oldest son, to your youngest daughter, we ended up with our 6 children. (You know you&rsquo;re a Mormon when your wife is expecting at your son&rsquo;s wedding.) So we had our family of 6 children. We take our 4 and 2 and happily look forward to the day when we will have a reunion with the son we lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At no time during this whole process were we perfect and always cheerful. Did we always &ldquo;stand still&rdquo; with &ldquo;utmost assurance?&rdquo; No. Yet, through our entire married life we have strived to be obedient and with hope accepted what &ldquo;came our way.&rdquo; We, especially our young children, never stopped praying and asking for the Lord&rsquo;s help. Somewhere, in the grand design for our family, it was in the plan all along for us to find and adopt our son. For sure, we could have messed it up because of a lack of faith or disobedience, but thankfully we lived our lives well enough to &ldquo;see the salvation of God and for His arm to be revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, for you and for me, if we can cheerfully &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; and &ldquo;fear not&rdquo; doing &ldquo;all things in our power,&rdquo; there is really no need to worry, fuss, or live in fear. We will receive every blessing God has in store for us. As we gain the skill of &ldquo;standing still,&rdquo; accepting and embracing all life brings, we will witness His hand in our lives. I know this to be true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last few days at Education Week we have learned much about the gospel, but what exactly is the gospel? The word comes from the Old English word <em>godspell&mdash;god</em> meaning good and <em>spell</em> meaning story or news. The gospel then means good news, but what is the good news? It is Jesus Christ. He came. He lived a perfect life. He completed the Atonement. He lives and because of Him we will all be resurrected and have the opportunity to live with God, and loved ones eternally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These realities and blessings are good news indeed, but surely we have more good news, surely this includes the restoration, the first principles and ordinances, priesthood keys that have been restored in our day, and temples. Yes, we are blessed to have a broad spectrum of good news to appreciate, to value, and to share. Today I would like to focus on one aspect of good news that has been called in sacred places, <em>the law of the gospel</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked a teenager once, &ldquo;What is the law of the gospel?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Commandments, more commandments and more commandments!&rdquo; Obviously, keeping commandments is part of living the gospel, but is that all it is? Once we covenant to obey and sacrifice, then are we simply given more items to be checked off our Mormon to-do list? Like this teenage friend, many associate the gospel with a proliferation of rules, but there is much more to it than standards and regulations. Remember the gospel is good news, not just more rules!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma 12:32 we read, &ldquo;Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption.&rdquo; The restoration of the gospel was not a restoration of rules. It was a restoration of reasons. The Ten Commandments actually made it through the apostasy; it was the reasons to keep the commandments that were lost and, as Alma taught, those reasons are found within the plan of redemption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The law of the gospel then has to do with our choices, but more important it extends to our motives. It has to do with the Law of Moses, but extends to the higher law taught in the Sermon on the Mount. The law of the gospel then has to do with controlling our external behavior, but extends to educating our internal desires. It has to do with who we are, but extends to who we can become. My friend Brett Sanders says, &ldquo;When we truly understand the good news of the gospel, we realize that standards become the framework that leads to Godliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The law of the gospel is associated with the charge to avoid any unholy and impure act. Why? Because ultimately our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ want to make us holy and pure. They invite us into Their <em>holy</em> house. They dress us in <em>pure</em> white clothing, and then They instruct us to avoid light mindedness and loud laugher, to refrain from speaking ill of our leaders, and to refuse to take the name of God in vain. Those are the rules. What&rsquo;s the reason? By complying with the rules, we take daily steps toward becoming more like our Father and more like Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Light-Mindedness and Loud Laughter</strong></p>
<p>Avoiding light-mindedness and loud laughter does not mean we have to live like monks in the Middle Ages who were not allowed to smile or laugh and were required to inflict pain on themselves when they did. No way! I love to laugh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being light-minded doesn&rsquo;t mean you tell too many jokes. Being light-minded means failing to take seriously things that should be taken seriously, including our Church duties and temple covenants. Loud laughter is not referring to a specific volume, but rather to inappropriate laughter at any volume. Avoiding both is the rule. What&rsquo;s the reason? God and Jesus want us to value what they value so we can experience the joy they experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never forget sitting several rows in front of two men in a plane bound for Salt Lake City. One said to the other, &ldquo;Do you think we ought to go see the blankity-blank Mormon temple?&rdquo; The other responded, &ldquo;You idiot. They won&rsquo;t let you in the blankity-blank temple. You have to go to a blankity-blank visitors&rsquo; center.&rdquo; He then proceeded to tell a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; story about how he and a buddy had once visited there and seen the statue of Christ with His arms extended. Instead of being moved spiritually, these two had plotted about how they might be able to tie a yo-yo to Jesus&rsquo; finger and take a picture without being caught. I was discouraged to hear these men talk so sacrilegiously. They, like the Roman soldiers who nailed Jesus to the cross, knew not what they did.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;These men were not laughing loudly, but they were laughing inappropriately about a sacred representation of our Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To many people, these men would have appeared happy enough. However God and Jesus are not interested in or fooled by appearances. They care about what we feel deep down and over time. My wife and I have just finished having a little mini family reunion. Having all of our five grandchildren together we went out boating. We went out on a lake and saw a group of young single adults. They looked like they were very &ldquo;happy&rdquo; with their alcohol, immodest bathing suits, and with their tattoos. As they laughed and swore, they looked &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; Drunks can appear happy on the surface and in the moment, but the fa&ccedil;ade soon fades and is replaced by regret, self-loathing, and misery. That&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t see when they are together with their friends. By refusing to mock that which is sacred<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and laugh inappropriately, our perspective is broadened and we learn to see as God sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God told Adam and Eve, &ldquo;Be happy. Find joy!&rdquo; There is no happiness or joy in being sacrilegious, disrespectful, or cruel. There is no lasting happiness or joy in the shallow ways of the world. Joy Lundberg and Janice Kapp Perry wrote a beautiful song and the lyrics say,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The peace I feel,</p>
<p>My joy in sacred things</p>
<p>Surpasses all the world could ever bring"<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only by living the gospel can we truly be happy. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf has called the gospel &ldquo;the ultimate formula for happiness.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Similarly, Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote, &ldquo;Zion . . . is where the pure in heart dwell and where there is joy of countenance. By contrast, in hell there are no smiles!&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Heber C. Kimball taught, &ldquo;God is the happiest of men. I am perfectly satisfied that my Father and my God is a cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured being. He is a jovial person and a beautiful man.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;As we fill our lives with suitable lightheartedness and positive, appropriate laughter we find the happiness that God enjoys. It will show in our countenances and we become more like Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refrain from Speaking Ill of Our Leaders</strong></p>
<p>Along with avoiding light-mindedness and inappropriate laughter, we are charged to refrain from speaking negatively of our leaders. That&rsquo;s the rule. What&rsquo;s the reason? Neither spirituality nor self-esteem can ever be found in tearing others down, but both are inherent in building others up. If we are ever to truly be like God, we must lift others for that is what He does. Thus, the charge to refrain from speaking negatively of our leaders also becomes a charge to support them&mdash;to raise our hands to the square and wholeheartedly sustain them even when others are screaming, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; in General Conference. This isn&rsquo;t a charge to follow blindly; rather, it is a charge to demonstrate faith in the Lord by showing faith in those He has called. By so doing leaders are uplifted, but we are also uplifted. We also grow and mature emotionally and spiritually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not speaking ill of leaders extends to not being easily offended. No bishop, Relief Society President, or stake president wakes up in the morning thinking, &ldquo;So, who can I offend today?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s never on somebody&rsquo;s to-do list. Yet offences come. Mistakes are made and feelings are hurt. Our leaders are human. Let&rsquo;s all cut them a little slack. Most of us will never be called to serve at the general levels of Church leadership, but let&rsquo;s cut those who are&mdash;past and present&mdash;some slack too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not speaking ill of leaders extends to not believing rumors and hearsay without researching issues for ourselves. We live in a day when anyone can publish anything on the Internet. What makes this dangerous is that some people assume it&rsquo;s all true, accurate, and unbiased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many of you have ever had your name in a newspaper? How many can say the article was completely accurate? Not as many hands this time. If the few times our names have shown up in print have been accompanied by mistakes, don&rsquo;t you think we should be a little slower to jump to conclusions when we read something about our Church leaders that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I hear something negative about Church leaders past or present I ask myself some questions: &ldquo;Is it hearsay? Is it out of context? Is it an unsupported generalization, a case of mudslinging, or an exaggeration?&rdquo; Only when I rule those options out do I begin to ask myself if it might be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Church history can be complex and sometimes things can even seem strange, but so does much of the Old Testament and yet I don&rsquo;t see anyone tossing out the Bible or leaving the Church because of the Song of Solomon. We&rsquo;ve got to realize that sometimes history has to be seen not through the lens of the present, but in the context of the past. Many young people grow up in Mormon homes where words such as <em>seer stone </em>have been explained in family home evening. Some of them even know that <em>Urim</em> and <em>Thummim</em> are in the running for the names of the next set of twins to be born in the family. These are words we are familiar with; they&rsquo;re words we grew up with. For others these terms are new and they can be confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While serving as a mission president in Chile, I spoke to a group of young single adults, many of whom were recent converts to the Church. They had seen information posted on the Internet about how Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon and they had questions. One asked, "What is the Urim and Thummim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;From what I understand it is two stones fastened together that functioned like a pair of glasses through which Joseph could look and see the text in English which he would then read to his scribes.&rdquo; The audience sat in stunned silence. One said, &ldquo;You mean to tell me that we are supposed to tell our friends that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon with a pair of magic glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I responded, &ldquo;How many have seen the movie <em>National Treasure</em>?&rdquo; It was a popular movie at the time and almost every hand went up. I said, &ldquo;You mean to tell me that there is an invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence that can be seen only through special glasses made by Benjamin Franklin?&rdquo; If we would all suspend our doubt and cynicism for as long as it took for us to watch that movie, perhaps we would realize that in this case fact is more fascinating than fiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another young adult said, &ldquo;But I read that Joseph Smith didn&rsquo;t even use the Urim and Thummim most of the time. Most of the translation was done with a seer stone. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;From what I understand it was a stone about the size of an egg. It was a dark color and had a smooth surface on which words would appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One person said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to tell our friends that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon with a magic rock? How is anyone supposed to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;How many of you have cell phones? They are about the size of an egg, are a dark color, and have a smooth surface on which words appear. How is anyone supposed to believe that? We may not be able to explain exactly how a cell phone works, but that doesn&rsquo;t keep us from using one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But President Wilcox,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;This article said Joseph Smith would put the seer stone in a hat. Why did he do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Just walk outside on a sunny day and you&rsquo;ll see dozens of people covering their cell phones with their hands so they can see them better. They wish they had hats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut Joseph Smith some slack. I have heard lots of criticisms of that prophet&mdash;but few that weren&rsquo;t first leveled against Christ Himself. Two thousand years of criticism and a Broadway play called <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> have not changed the truth about our Lord. Two hundred years of criticism and a Broadway play called <em>The Book of Mormon</em> have not changed the reality of Joseph Smith&rsquo;s divine call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson has said, &ldquo;The Savior has not had among mortals a more faithful witness, a more obedient disciple, a more loyal advocate than Joseph Smith.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;What a commendation! When we meet Joseph Smith as one day we will, may we live so that the person introducing us will say, &ldquo;Joseph, you never had a more faithful witness, a more obedient believer, a more loyal advocate than the person standing before you right now.&rdquo; That is a moment for which I strive. Joseph no longer needs body guards, but I can and will be his character guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karl G. Maesar, the man who established the Brigham Young Academy, was first drawn to the Church in his homeland of Germany after reading an anti-Mormon book. Why? Because he recognized that all the negative things he was reading could not be accurate. He sought and found the truth and spent the rest of his life loyally defending the Church of Jesus Christ and its leaders.<sup>8</sup> Who can accuse Karl G. Maesar, one of the most brilliant minds and greatest educators of all time, of being a mindless sheep following prophet leaders? His was a choice made not because he was blind, but because he had an extraordinary ability to see. May we follow his example of intellectual integrity and defend those whom the Lord has called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have our leaders always been perfect? Of course not. But I tend to agree with the father of President Henry B. Eyring who reasoned, &ldquo;If they [are] good enough for God&hellip; they [are] good enough for [me].&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;We have just lost two beloved apostles. We will miss them both. In our next General Conference we will probably sustain two new apostles. We don&rsquo;t know yet who they, are but I&rsquo;ll tell you this: I will lift my arm to the square. I will sustain those men &ndash;whether I know them, or not &ndash; with all my heart, with all my strength, and with all my testimony because I know the God who will call them, and I love the prophet through whom they will be called. They will have my complete support, and they will have my complete love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid the confusion created when philosophies of men are mingled with scripture, God will always send true messengers, just as He did to Adam and Eve. As we learn to seek them, to recognize them, and to be loyal to them as they did, then we are better able to lift others and that&rsquo;s how we will become more like God and more like Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refuse to Take the Lord&rsquo;s Name in Vain</strong></p>
<p>In addition to avoiding light-mindedness and loud laughter and refraining from speaking negatively of the Lord&rsquo;s chosen, we are commanded that we should not take the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain. Obviously this means we should not swear using the name of the Lord. That&rsquo;s the rule. What&rsquo;s the reason? Because ultimately He wants true disciples who refuse to take His name in vain&mdash;not only because it is so sacred, but also because it has become written on their hearts. Blasphemy is usually the height of thoughtlessness&mdash;literally. Most blasphemers do not think at all about what they are saying. In most cases, expletives escape their mouths without ever having passed through their minds. Their flippant words are knee-jerk reactions rather than careful and conscious choices. The Lord desires sincere thoughts, language, and actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another way of looking at taking the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain. When we partake of the sacrament we renew a covenant to take Christ&rsquo;s name upon us. When we do so out of habit rather than as a sincere choice, are we taking His name in vain? My friend Taylor Halverson told me that the Hebrew word that was translated in our scriptures as <em>vain</em> means meaningless and empty. He said, &ldquo;Perhaps the commandment in Exodus 20:7 should read thou shalt not take upon thyself the name of God with empty and meaningless intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we give up the hope Christ offers through His Atonement, are we taking the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain? Are we rendering His grace, His divine help, as useless, empty, and meaningless in our lives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One young man said, &ldquo;There is no chance for me. I have gone too far too often. I have let God down too many times. I am not worthy of His love or help.&rdquo; This young man was discouraged because he would make progress for a while, feel better, and then slip and decide all his efforts meant nothing. Argh! It sounds like my diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I explained that sometimes our growth and progress &ndash; and my diet &ndash; are like a game my friends and I would play on long bus rides home from debate trips in high school. It was called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Without breaking the rhythm of slapping our knees and clapping our hands we had to call out someone else&rsquo;s name or number. Anyone who made a mistake had to go to the back of the bus and slowly start moving toward the front again one seat at a time. Inevitably, when I had almost made it to the front I would mess up and get sent to the back. I felt like I was making no progress. What I realize now is that wherever I was sitting on the bus, the bus was still continually taking me toward home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon we read about people who loved God so much they had &ldquo;no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup> Does this mean they were never enticed again? Surely not, since that would have limited their agency. Does this mean they never made another mistake or had another bad day? No. They probably messed up just like we do, since they were living in the same fallen world where we live. The issue isn&rsquo;t whether or not they slipped, but that they didn&rsquo;t want to slip. The renewed people of King Benjamin probably sinned again (moved to the back of the bus), but they most certainly recognized the mistakes they had made, repented quickly, and kept trying. They lived in a constant spirit of repentance&mdash;continually renewing their covenants. In other words, they stayed on the bus as it moved steadily toward its destination.<sup>11</sup> Enduring to the end does not mean living without errors. Enduring to the end means enduring in the covenant despite errors&mdash;remaining in the bus and continuing to play the game no matter where we currently sit, or how many times we are taken to the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the hymn &ldquo;We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet&rdquo; we sing, &ldquo;Thus on to eternal perfection the honest and faithful will go.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Notice it doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Thus on to eternal perfection the flawless and faultless will go.&rdquo; Worthiness is honesty with self, God, and priesthood leaders. Worthiness is faithfully continuing to try as long as positive changes may take. The lie of this generation is, &ldquo;We cannot change.&rdquo; Not only does that lie deny the upward reach within each one of us &ndash; divinely placed, but it also denies the power of Jesus Christ&mdash;not His existence, but His power in our lives. President Henry B. Eyring has said, &ldquo;One great burst of effort won&rsquo;t be enough. Only a steady, ever-increasing effort will allow the Lord to take us to higher ground.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In sacred temples we make covenants. Then sometimes we surprise ourselves by how quickly we can slip backward despite these promises. We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, however, at how quickly Christ comes to our aid if we seek Him. God, who will not be mocked, does extend a hand to mockers who repent. Trying and slipping and trying again is not mocking God as much as it is honoring Him by using the gift of the Atonement that He and His Son so lovingly provided. Satan claims, with great boldness, to hold covenant breakers in his power. But what power does he have? His power is put on, much like an apron. It is not internal; it is external. It is self-proclaimed and manmade. He has power only if we give it to him. He cannot stop us from determining to start again. Christ&rsquo;s broken heart is more powerful than our broken promises and all of Satan&rsquo;s blustering and empty threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not bad people because we have bad habits. We are good people trying to develop good habits. When I slip, instead of saying &ldquo;I have failed,&rdquo; I try to say &ldquo;I have not yet succeeded.&rdquo; I was reading my journal the other day and it said, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m up to 220 lbs. and now I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;I wish I was down to 220 lbs.&rdquo; Instead of saying &ldquo;Look how far there is to go,&rdquo; I try to say &ldquo;Look how far God and Christ have brought me.&rdquo; Instead of saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep my covenants,&rdquo; I try to say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it now, but with heaven&rsquo;s help I can learn.&rdquo; Instead of saying &ldquo;I just got sent back to the last seat on the bus,&rdquo; I try to say &ldquo;At least I am still playing the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a Spanish saying: &ldquo;Sin prisa, pero sin pausa.&rdquo; (Without great hurry, but also without a pause.&rdquo;) West Africans use a similar phrase: &ldquo;Slowly by slowly, small by small.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> We might say &ldquo;Slow and steady wins the race.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t have to reach our goals by Friday. We have until Sunday and then the next Sunday and the next&mdash;each time we have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In sacred sacrament moments, can we really promise to never again make a mistake? Not when we know full well we will be back again the very next week needing the sacrament as much as ever. Rather, as we partake of the sacrament, we show we are <em>willing</em> to take upon ourselves His name, <em>willing</em> to always remember Him, and <em>willing</em> to keep His commandments.<sup>15</sup> We often feel we have to qualify for the very ordinance and grace that make us worthy. Such a focus on worthiness keeps us forever looking backward. By focusing instead on willingness, we look forward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder John H. Groberg, who lived many years here in Idaho, taught, &ldquo;What does it mean to partake of the sacrament worthily? Or how do we know if we are unworthy? If we <em>desire</em> to improve (which is to repent) and are not under priesthood restriction, then . . . we are worthy.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to pray,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to go to church,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to partake of the sacrament,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to go on a mission,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worthy to go to the temple.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t partake of the sacrament because we are worthy, we partake of the sacrament because we are willing to become worthy. We don&rsquo;t go to church because we are perfect, we go because we are willing to be perfected, and we certainly don&rsquo;t go on a mission, or to the temple because we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;made it&rdquo; in our Mormon culture. We go to these sacred environments because it is there that the Lord is making us. It is there that we allow him to continue to shape, and mold, and guide, and help us. As we renew our covenants, we are committing not to be perfect like Christ immediately, but to be willing to be perfected in Christ over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time is the medium through which the power of the Atonement is made manifest in our lives. One little glass of water may not make much of a difference, but many little cups of water over time create the Grand Canyon. One little piece of bread may not make much of difference, but Jesus can bless bread, a few loafs to feed thousands, and surely He can bless the bread that we partake of week after week and weakness after weakness to bless and to nourish us as well. In Doctrine and Covenants 50:40 we read, &ldquo;Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace.&rdquo; This is the growth process King Benjamin called retaining a remission of our sins &ldquo;from day to day,"<sup>17</sup> or we could say from Sunday to Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God will never give up on us even when we feel like giving up on ourselves. The love and grace of God and Christ are not bestowed like prizes for the righteous. They are the source of righteousness. They are not awards for the worthy. They are the means of worthiness. In Ether 12:27 we read the familiar words, &ldquo;I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me.&rdquo; As we speak the name of God more thoughtfully, take upon ourselves the name of Christ more sincerely, and endure in our covenants, we will feel His transforming power and we will become, slowly but surely, more like Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank heaven for events like Education Week. Here we have all learned more about the good news we call the gospel. May we leave more committed to live the law of the gospel and each charge associated with it. I know God and Jesus live. I know They love us, and I know They lead us in this Church today. Where would we be without that knowledge? We would be as lost and as lame as the world that surrounds us, and mocks us, but we know what we know! We know the God we worship. We know the leaders He appoints and sustains, and we know the spirit that bears witness to our spirits that we are not wrong. I say this and leave this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The musical number was amazing. Brother and Sister Tuhler, thank you for sharing your musical talents with us, and bringing in such a wonderful spirit.</p>
<p>Recently, the following note was brought to our home. It said, "Please, Help Me." It was delivered by a good sister. Her intentions were to leave it taped to our front door. However, before she could leave, my wife greeted her at the doorstep. Soni immediately noticed her despair and need for physical and medical assistance. I was troubled by her situation! It reminded me of times in my life when the same words, "Please help me," had gone through my mind. Those three words have significantly influenced and shaped me. I wish to share two personal experiences with you today.</p>
<p>In December of 1987, four months after Soni and I were married, we joined her family on a vacation to Hawaii. One afternoon, her family was on Waikiki Beach enjoying the sun and sand. However, I wanted to do something a bit more adventurous. I convinced Soni and her grandmother to come with me to the famous Hanauma Bay, located on the other side of the island. At the bay, the locals were body surfing. It looked fun and I wanted to try. Despite my Idaho tan line, I started to feel like a native in the water. My confidence grew as I learned to dive under the big waves to avoid getting pummeled. I was enjoying myself until three large waves came ashore.&nbsp;I dodged the waves, but had not planned on the rush of water going out to sea.&nbsp;I found myself trapped in a river like current. In a short amount of time, I was far from the safety of the beach.&nbsp;I panicked! I had no life preserver or understanding of what was happening. All I could think about was the big sharks that were certainly lurking beneath. I tried to swim against the current, but my efforts proved futile.&nbsp;I was frantic! A few yards away from me was a young man with a surfboard. Desperately, I swam to him and grabbed for his board pleading for help.&nbsp;Not knowing what was going on, he jerked the board out of my hands and I went down under the water again. Fighting to get to the surface and gasping for air, I choked up the seawater that was threatening to fill my lungs. I was certain, that I was going to die! I needed help. Surrounded by complete despair, I felt so helpless, hopeless, and full of fear. I had never been more aware of my limitations and nothingness while in this awful condition. I wanted to live.<br /><br />My second experience is tied to the account of Jairus and his daughter found in Mark 5: 22-23 &amp; Luke 8: 49-55:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."</p>
<p>Can you see and feel the pain of this father? He loves and cares for his daughter, but he cannot help her. He lacks power, knowledge, and capabilities to do any more for her. For a parent this is such a terrible place to be. Almost 22 years ago, our daughter Jessica was two and a half years old. We were living in Provo at the time. Due to early labor complications with our third child, Robert, Soni was hospitalized. Our two children, Jaren and Jessica, went to Rexburg to stay with grandparents. While in Rexburg, Jessica was involved in a serious accident. When we heard about the accident, waiting for more news was unbearable. We pleaded for help in the hopes that some divine miracle might intercede. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the scriptural account is in Luke 8 starting at verse 49:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."</p>
<p>Our Jessica died a few hours after the terrible accident. In some way I think I can empathize with Jairus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway."</p>
<p>I love this story.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours, after Jessica died, Soni delivered Robert. Now we had an 8 week premature baby to take care of and a daughter to bury. It seemed like nothing in our once perfect lives was right. The following days and weeks for Soni and I were numbing. There was extreme sadness, great frustration, and at times almost complete despair. We needed help! We had kind friends and a loving family that blessed us, but it was not enough. The lasting help we really needed and longed for came from a loving Father in Heaven and the Comforter. In our despair, we became completely aware of our need for the Savior and we obtained a greater understanding of the plan of salvation. I still think of Jessica every day. Now her memory is a constant reminder of wonderful days to come. Because of Jesus Christ, the daughter of Jarius lives and so does Jessica.<br /><br />Troublesome times, or just the woes of life, are actually important to our eternal progression. None shall escape the difficulties of mortality. This life's purpose is to try our souls. Trials and failures can wake us up. I testify that salvation is impossible, unless we have a spiritual awakening to a sense of our own nothingness, and begin to rely completely upon our Savior, Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Spiritual consciousness is the first step in making important and required changes to become prepared for our eventual return to Father in Heaven.&nbsp;You must know who you are and where you are going; otherwise you will just drift spiritually ending up in life's log-jams of disappointments, or marooned on the quicksand beaches of a false-sense of being.&nbsp;Spiritual consciousness will be the filter that will allow us to judge according to the standards of heaven. It is a firewall that will protect us from unwanted attacks of the adversary. In our weaknesses, trials, and failings, there arises an enduring humility and awareness of our complete reliance on the merits of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>King Benjamin spoke of this awareness as he began his famous sermon approximately 2100 years ago. He asked his people to give extra attention to what he was about to say. We read in Mosiah 4:5-7:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state&mdash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I say unto you, if ye have come to a&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;which has been prepared from the&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust&nbsp;in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body&mdash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation."</p>
<p>King Benjamin pleads with us to be aware of our own fallen condition and see the goodness and greatness of God&mdash;for this, and only this leads to salvation. Brothers and sisters, I hope and pray that this awareness begins to stir our souls to a remembrance of the necessity to rely on Him. Just as important as it is to be reborn, it is imperative that we are spiritually conscious.</p>
<p>One of the greatest examples of a spiritual awakening is that of Alma the Younger in Mosiah 27:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Alma the Younger's awakening to his nothingness, and seeing the greatness of God, is miraculous. Our awakening may not be as intense, but it will be miraculous nonetheless.</p>
<p>As the stories, and scriptures I have already shared so poignantly illustrate, awakening requires two things: a realization of our own sense of nothingness before God, and second, our absolute dependence on Christ. Then comes the mighty change of heart described throughout the scriptures.<br /><br />The counsel of King Benjamin was direct "awaken to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state." Why is this important? What are we to be taught by such an unsavory realization? The answer is simple: it teaches us humility and meekness. Compared to God's great and grand creations, we hold but a speck of significance as taught in Helaman 12:7-8:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God."</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf, in the 2011 October General Conference gave a talk entitled "You Matter to Him." He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This is a paradox of man: compared to God, man is nothing; yet we are everything to God. While against the backdrop of infinite creation we may appear to be nothing, we have a spark of eternal fire burning within our breast. We have the incomprehensible promise of exaltation&mdash;worlds without end&mdash;within our grasp. And it is God's great desire to help us reach it."</p>
<p>Just like King Benjamin's people, we are now ready to move to the second realization of our awakening: the need for Christ as our Savior and Redeemer. This account is found in Mosiah 4:2</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"... And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men."</p>
<p>Without the merits of Christ we are nothing, less than the dust. With the merits of Christ we are everything&mdash;the purpose of the creation, the reason for the fall, and ultimately the beneficiary of the atonement. Christ, in His pure and perfect state, sacrificed His will for us, suffered beyond our ability to understand, and willingly gave his life that we shall live. His virtues include all that is good and all that is from God. He is the best and greatest of everything that both God and man may ascribe. Of course, we must do all we can, for that is the requirement of His grace, but our all, and even our very best, will never do. We will fail, use our agency against God's will, and even break that which is most precious. But, Christ will restore, reclaim, and make right. Our bodies will be broken, sick, and afflicted, yet He will make whole. Our souls will wander to unrighteous and ungodly places, and He will save and redeem. Nephi stated it beautifully in 2 Nephi 31:19:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"... For ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What does it mean to rely "wholly on Christ?" The story of the rich man illustrates this best. It is found in Mark 10:17-22.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."</p>
<p>The rich man did not fully understand what it means to rely wholly upon the merits of Christ. He came to the Savior, assuming he had done all that was required. In his pride, you can almost hear the rich man say, "Look at all I have accomplished. What more could I possibly do to receive eternal life?" The Savior lovingly embraced him and asked him to forsake all. The Savior's invitation was simple "Follow me...in everything." Jesus will not make up&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;differences&mdash;Jesus will make&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the difference. Christ will make us whole, but only if we rely wholly upon His merits. Unfortunately, the rich man expected to find his salvation through his own good merits, and was ultimately deceived.</p>
<p>David A Bednar, in his devotional address given at BYU on October 23, 2001, taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Individual willpower, personal determination and motivation, effective planning and goal setting are necessary but ultimately insufficient for us to triumphantly complete this mortal journey. Truly, we must come to rely upon 'the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.'<sup>2</sup>"</p>
<p>Once we rely upon the merits of Christ, we are ready to bind ourselves to him. How do we do this?</p>
<p>It is not enough just to be a good person. We must enter into covenants and ordinances that bind us to Christ&mdash;the must be performed by His holy priesthood, by those trusted with His authority. Covenants and ordinances cannot be replaced or substituted with our own wishful or ignorant ways. Christ declares, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life." It must be His way.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar taught in the 2015 April General Conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Ordinances and covenants are the building blocks we use to construct our lives upon the foundation of Christ and His atonement. We are connected securely to and with the Savior as we worthy receive ordinances and enter into covenants, faithfully remember and honor those sacred commitments, and do our best to live in accordance with the obligations we have accepted. This bond is the source of our spiritual strength and stability in all of the seasons of our lives."</p>
<p>How do we best live in accordance to these sacred obligations and build our spiritual strength. Well, turn off unbecoming entertainment. Cut out unnecessary chaos. Take the time to be still and listen. We must be prepared to follow the uncomfortable whisperings of the Spirit, which will result in small course corrections that eventually lead to our seat at God's holy table. Of course, reading the word of God, participating in meaningful prayers, faithfully and joyfully attending church, and sanctifying our time in His holy house, may seem trite and even inconsequential, but I promise there is no better way to develop our relationship with God. Our relationship with Christ will be as individual and unique as our own fingerprint. Finally, service and sacrifice will allow us to call him "friend."</p>
<p>I have an invitation for each of us. Heed those uncomfortable suggestions from the Spirit. Judiciously evaluate your relationship with Christ. Commit more fully to keeping your covenants. I promise you that over time, improvements in just one of these things will help you win important victories and gain spiritual high ground.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately, our sojourn on the earth can be terribly frustrating, dealing with life's unavoidable setbacks. Our time is full of ups and downs, victories and failures, good, bad, and sad experiences. Our very best is not going to cut it. We will fail again and again, and we may feel that divine help never comes fast enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn this gloomy realization into something encouraging, even hopeful. But before I do, I want to make one thing clear&mdash;knowing that we will falter does not give us license to knowingly falter or to give up. Press forward with courage, and redouble your efforts, because God is trying to teach you something important. C.S. Lewis, on page 88 of his book "Mere Christianity," said it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We may, indeed, be sure that perfect chastity - like perfect charity - will not be attained by any merely human efforts. You must ask for God's help. Even when you have done so, it may seem to you for a long time that no help, or less help than you need, is being given. Never mind. After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again. For however important chastity (or courage, or truthfulness, or any other virtue) may be, this process trains us in habits of the soul which are more important still. It cures our illusions about ourselves and teaches us to depend on God. We learn, on the one hand, that we cannot trust ourselves even in our best moments, and, on the other, that we need not despair even in our worst, for our failures are forgiven. The only fatal thing is to sit down content with anything less than perfection."</p>
<p>The next time you find yourself discouraged; take courage in the fact that there is a lesson to be learned. Your failures and frustrations are opportunities. They condition us to trust Christ instead of ourselves. Never give up. There is always help and hope. The most important thing in life is to turn to Christ in our best and worst moments.</p>
<p>When I was in drowning in Hanauma Bay, I was certain I was going to die. Struggling to stay afloat and choking up seawater, I was desperate and eager for help. I did not know how to save myself. There was a man that was several yards away. He understood my situation and knew how to help. He encouraged me to calm down, pointed me at a 45-degree angle back to shore, and directed me to swim. I followed his council exactly, and within moments, I was back safely on the beach. Just like this man who helped me, I know that Jesus Christ knows our plight and how best to help.<br /><br />Soni's and my experience with Jessica's death has become one of my most difficult blessings. I became a better man who was more acquainted with a loving Father in Heaven and Savior. I better understood Their Plan of Salvation, exaltation, and happiness for me and my family. I know They live, love, and want us to return home. I testify that if we remember to be humble and rely wholly upon the merits of Christ, we will find strength and assurance to overcome our trials and, more importantly, return to live with Him. Ezra Taft Benson affirmed, "Only Jesus Christ is uniquely qualified to provide that hope, that confidence, and that strength we need to overcome the world and rise above our human failings."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Student Activities Resources Manager</p>
<p>Brother Derik Taylor was born and raised in Burley, Idaho.&nbsp; He is the third of five children.&nbsp; After graduating from Burley High School in 1996, he attended Ricks College before serving a mission to Recife, Brazil.&nbsp; <br /><br />He returned to Ricks College and graduated with an AS in Business.&nbsp;After a short stint at ISU, he returned to Rexburg and finished his degree in Business Management in 2003. In 2009, he completed his MBA from the University of Phoenix.<br /><br />He began working for BYU-Idaho in July 2004 as the assistant intramural director in Student Activities.&nbsp; His current position is the Student Activities Resources Manager, overseeing operations in the Hart Building, BYU-Idaho Center Courts and campus recreational facilities.&nbsp;<br /><br />He has served as a ward missionary, Sunday school teacher, in a young men's presidency, elder's quorum presidency, cub master, assistant scout master, venturing leader and currently as second counselor in a bishopric. <br /><br />He married Amanda in April, 2000 and they have been happily married for 15 years.&nbsp; They have two boys, Nathan (9) and Eli (6).<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Amanda and I have been married for 15 wonderful years. Yet I can still remember, like it was yesterday, the conversation we had in the first few weeks of our young marriage. I had just graduated from Ricks College with an Associate's degree in business and enrolled at Idaho State University to finish a bachelor and master's degree. I was ready to take on the world and I had a beautiful, loving and supportive wife by my side.<br /><br />Our discussion of the future drifted to children and when that process would begin. It became very clear to us then that what we wanted more than a promising career in business was to raise a righteous family, and that we didn't want to wait until we completed our schooling. From that moment on, we embarked on a journey of ups and mostly downs and a multitude of doctors' visits and procedures from Pocatello to Rexburg to Phoenix and back.<br /><br />For six years, we rode the rollercoaster of infertility until one day Amanda finally convinced me that if I wanted to be a dad and raise a family, we needed to adopt. This was not easy for me. At that moment, I viewed adoption as giving up and I had not given up on anything in my life that meant so much to me. However, the decision to adopt was not giving up, it was heeding the promptings of a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp;We were soon blessed to adopt two boys in three years. I love being a dad, and having the opportunity to raise my boys. As much as I love it, I've learned that it's a lot of hard work. I feel a lot of pressure to raise my family in a righteous manner but I knew that going in. Like Nephi, I too, was born of goodly parents and was taught in the ways of my father. I had the privilege to be raised in a righteous home by a mother and father that love each other, their children, and the Lord. I guess my passion to be a father came from being raised by a really good one. I found that as a young boy, I was in need of a lot of teaching and that's why the Lord blessed me with great parents and grandparents.<br /><br />I have pondered on this over the years and often wonder why I was so blessed to be raised the way I was, and what teaching moments made the biggest impact on me as I was growing up. I began making a list of moments in my younger years that made an impact on me and built a foundation for my testimony and ultimately who and what I have become thus far. My purpose today is not to trip down memory lane, but to reflect on a few foundational teaching moments in my life that have had a lasting impact and hopefully, through the Spirit, you too can identify those times in your own life when the foundation was laid for you.<br /><br />At a very young age I was taught to work. When I was five or six I began helping my two older brothers on their paper route. Since I was not yet in school or got home earlier than them, I would begin folding papers an hour or so before they got home so they could start delivering the papers when they arrived. As my brothers got older and busier, the paper route was passed on to me. My two younger sisters then became the folders and I the deliverer. I did this until I was 12.&nbsp;At 12 years old, I began working in my grandpa's restaurant in Burley at Prices Cafe. I bussed tables until I was old enough to wash dishes and then was later promoted to food prep. In my teenage years, some of my fondest memories were working at the cafe, in particular, doing caterings with my dad and grandpa. During the holidays, we would cater Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to the Simplot and OreIda potato processing plants. Because these plants ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we had to deliver and serve food to hundreds of employees on all three shifts: days, nights and swings. Not only did the food have to be delivered and served three times but also the cooking and prep time had to be just right. Hours were spent in the kitchen cooking turkeys, peeling and mashing hundreds of pounds of potatoes, baking rolls, and helping make grandpa's famous pies.<br /><br />These were times when I would see the best and worst sides of my grandpa. Grandpa always had a smile on his face but he never let a teaching moment pass. I'll never forget my very first day of bussing tables when I was 12. I was to be at work at 5 p.m. but I didn't get done with soccer practice until 5:00. So, I figured it wouldn't matter if I was a few minutes late. I smartly calculated the time it would take to ride my bike from the school to the restaurant. Five minutes wouldn't hurt anyone. So, I arrived a few minutes late and punched my time card and put on an apron and began clearing tables. I hadn't finished my first table when I looked back and saw my grandpa walking toward me. At first, I couldn't tell if he was happy for my first day of work or if he was going to give me a tongue-lashing. He simply put his hand on my shoulder and said: "Son, you were late for work on your first day." For which I quickly apologized and reassured him that it wouldn't happen again. Then he said: "And you don't come to work in soccer shorts and cleats. Go home, take a shower and come back when you're ready to work."<br /><br />When I got back to the caf&eacute; in my white shirt, black pants and black church shoes, I found my grandpa cleaning the tables that I had neglected for the last 30 minutes. I quickly put on a clean white apron and rushed over to relieve my grandpa from cleaning tables. I half expected another tongue-lashing but the lesson he taught was so much better. When I approached the table, he just smiled and said: "Now, that's more like it." And then, instead of going home after a long day of work, having opened the restaurant at 3 a.m., he spent the next half hour showing me how to be the best bus boy at Prices Caf&eacute;.<br /><br />My grandpa Taylor had a work ethic unmatched by anyone I have ever known, except maybe by my grandpa Clark. In the summers of my teenage years, my brother, Cory, and I would take time off from the caf&eacute; to spend a week or so in Pocatello with grandma and grandpa Clark. My grandpa owned a real estate company and several rental properties and apartments. We would spend a week or two working with my cousins cleaning, painting, putting up new siding, pulling weeds and mowing lawns. This was not fun work but I learned valuable lessons during the process.<br /><br />Grandpa would wake us up at 6 a.m. to get started on the day. When we would complain about getting up so early, he would tell us how hot it was going to be that day and that we should get as much work in as possible before lunch. Then he would rehearse to us the key to success in life: "To be successful, you have to work 12 hours a day. The sooner you start the sooner you can finish." Since we had plans to play after work, starting at 6 a.m. worked out okay. After all these years, I still drive by those apartments and the memories come flooding back (some not so good). But what I remember the most, is the time I spent with my grandpa, my brother, and my cousins in the hot sun working and playing together. This may be strange, but I loved the time it took to take the weeds and garbage to the dump. Most of the time we slept on the short drive, and grandpa would slap his leg so hard and loud to keep himself awake that it would wake us up in the process, but I loved the time we spent together.<br /><br />I learned a lot of lessons from my grandparents. My grandpas worked hard and taught me to do the same. They also taught me lessons in charity. I can't tell you how many times grandpa Taylor would hand me two hot sacks and tell me to fill them with chicken and rolls from the buffet and then he would say, "Come with me." As we walked out of the caf&eacute; with chicken, rolls, pies and whatever else we could grab (usually a gallon of milk, a dozen eggs and a loaf of bread), I never had to ask where we were going. We would get in the van and end up at an unknown house to drop off the food. I didn't know who these people were but he knew they needed help and he blessed a lot of lives. Over the years, I have heard stories of generosity about my grandparents and not just meals they provided but missions and educations they funded, Eagle Scout projects they pushed through, jobs they provided, and the lives they touched without anyone ever knowing about it. What a legacy to live up to.<br /><br />When I was about 14 or 15, I remember a family home evening when my dad taught us about the value of a name and carrying on the family legacy. My oldest brother, Brian, was about to enter the mission field and represent the Lord Jesus Christ for two years in Los Angeles, California. My other brother, Cory, and I were teenagers and our heads were filled with all sorts of wild and crazy ideas. Being very inspired, my dad shared stories from the Book of Mormon about fathers teaching their children and the importance of living up to the legacy of a good name.<br /><br />Starting from the beginning we talked about Lehi and the relationship he had with Nephi and also the difficulties Laman and Lemuel posed on the rest of the family; not just in the wilderness but for future generations. We discussed the prophet, Alma, and how his prayers rescued his son Alma and the sons of Mosiah&mdash;how their attempts to destroy the church were thwarted by a visit from an angel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And again the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of this people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightiest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith."<sup>1</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>Can you imagine how different the Book of Mormon would be if Alma the younger, Ammon, Aaron, Omner and Himni had not changed their ways? Their missionary work amongst the Lamanites changed the whole dynamic between the Nephites and the Lamanites for nearly a hundred years. They converted kings and kingdoms. Their converts called themselves after Ammon and among the posterity of those people were the 2,000 stripling warriors. The conversion and mission of these five brethren have inspired millions for over 2,000 years. I think the Lord knew what he was doing when he sent an angel to visit them.&nbsp;Of all the stories shared by my father in that family home evening, the one that sunk the deepest in my heart was in Helaman chapter 5. In this chapter, Helaman's sons, Nephi and Lehi, recount a family home evening they had with their father. Let's read verses six and seven:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>"Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them."<sup>2</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>Wow! What a lesson to teach your kids. All of us have a family name that we represent every day, for good or bad. When we are baptized we take upon us another name&mdash;Jesus Christ. We covenant to always remember Him and keep His commandments. Our obedience to our parents and to our Heavenly Father is the ultimate sign of respect and love. That is how relationships develop and grow. Let's go back to Helaman chapter 5 and read verse 14:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi..."<sup>3</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>I like how that is written. They "remembered" and then they "went forth." There was the thought followed by an action. In Mark chapter 12, Christ gives us the two great commandments. The first is to "<em>love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength..."<sup>4</sup></em>&nbsp;Then in John 14 He teaches:&nbsp;<em>"If ye love me, keep my commandments."<sup>5</sup></em></p>
<p>Is it really that easy? The answers are right in front of us and yet we fail time and time again to act accordingly. I've often wondered why it is so hard to do all that God asks of us. Could it be that we don't fully understand our relationship with our Father in Heaven? If we knew how much He loves us and wants us to come home would we strive a little harder? Or if we simply realized how much help we have along the way would it be easier? How wonderful it is to understand the plan of salvation&mdash;to know the end from the beginning.</p>
<p>The plan of salvation brings us happiness and joy because of the perspective we gain. We know where we came from, why we are here on earth and what happens after this life. We were born of heavenly parents before we were born of earthly parents. We lived with Heavenly Father in the pre-existence. He knows us like a father knows his child. President Brigham Young taught:&nbsp;<em>"I want to tell you, each and every one of you, that you are well acquainted with God our Heavenly Father... [You] lived in his house and dwelt with him year after year... there is not a person here today but what is a son or daughter of that Being."<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>How wonderful is that! We lived with our Heavenly Father before we came to earth. We were taught by Him. President Eyring taught us in the last General Women's Broadcast:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>You were tutored by Him before you came into this life. He helped you understand and accept that you would have trials, tests, and opportunities perfectly chosen for you. You learned that our Father had a plan of happiness to get you safely through those trials and that you would help bring others safely through theirs."<sup>7</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>We lived with God, the Father...in His home! Can you imagine those family home evenings? Elder Bruce R. McConkie said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The pre-existent life was thus a period, undoubtedly an infinitely long one, of probation, progression, and schooling. Mortal progression and testing is a continuation of what began in the pre-existence."<sup>8</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>And now on earth, the schooling continues. We are trying to merit the privilege of returning home to Him. He wants us to come back. In Moses, we read that His purpose or mission is to&nbsp;<em>"bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>9</sup></em>&nbsp;Elder Russell M. Nelson said<em>:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>"Simply summarized, God, our loving Heavenly Father, wants His children to return home to Him. How logical is that? What else would you expect from a loving Father? God wants His children to return to Him. But the amazing thing is, He allows them to choose that course; He doesn't force them. He sends His children to earth, causing a veil of forgetfulness to come upon them. They are here to gain a body, to be tested, and to make choices. The greatest of all choices they may make is to choose to return to their Father."<sup>10</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>Everything God does is to help us get back home. He has given us prophets and apostles, an organized church that teaches us these wonderful truths. He provided a Savior so that we can repent when things go bad. He gave us the scriptures so that we will always have the truths of the gospel that are unchanging. And when we are making tough decisions, he provided the Holy Ghost to prompt us and speak to us, and to be our companion throughout our lives as long as we do what's right. He has given us all of these wonderful things to help us come home and all He asks of us is to love Him and keep His commandments. I love my Father in Heaven and I know He loves me because of all of these things and because He has shown me many times in my life that He is with me, that He hears my prayers and lifts me up. I have felt his grace and tender mercies in my life in many different ways. I felt it differently as a youth than I did as a full-time missionary. And I feel it differently now as a father and husband. It could be my level of maturity and readiness to receive Him. But nonetheless, I feel it.</p>
<p>I would like to share a personal example of the Holy Ghost witnessing to me that Heavenly Father knows me and cares about me. Seven years ago, we took a small family vacation with Amanda's parents and siblings to Star Valley, Wyoming. We rented a house for a few days and spent time fishing, riding bikes and visiting the cemeteries for family history. One morning, Amanda's Dad, Al, mentioned that he had talked to a guy that rents rafts and said there was a nice family float just up the road from Alpine. Having never been to this area, I didn't really know where we were but thought it sounded like fun. I love rafting. I had the chance to go three times down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River with my dad when I was younger. I learned how to run a boat and read a river and I felt pretty confident taking the family on a nice easy float.<br /><br />So, we loaded up the boat and headed up the road from Alpine, following the map that was given to us. It was pretty quiet at the boat launch but there was an outfitter there with a couple of boats ahead of us and few kayakers. Ten of us loaded up in the boat including my 2 year old son. We got going with little trouble for the first 15 minutes. The weather was hot and it was a beautiful day. A couple of small water fights had already broken out and everyone was enjoying themselves. As we came upon the first curve, we got closer to the outfitter boats. Close enough to hear their chatter. I could hear them getting excited about what was up ahead and I remember hearing something about "Lunch Counter." Immediately, red flag warnings went off in my head. We were on the Hoback and this was not a family-friendly float that you take a 2 year old on. As calmly as I could, I informed my family that we were in for a ride and we needed cooperation, attention and no panic to make it through.<br /><br />Everything I had learned as a teenager on the Middle Fork came flooding back. We made seating changes in the boat to add power where needed. We talked about how to paddle through a rapid and how important is was to keep paddling all the way through. We went through a crash course in maneuvering the boat and how to take commands from the captain without question. And we talked about what to do if you went out of the boat and how to get that person back in the boat. My biggest fear was that my baby boy that we had waited so long to get would somehow fall in the water. Grandma took it upon herself to sit in the middle of the boat with a death grip around that precious child.<br /><br />After all of this, I still wasn't sure we were going to make it. At that very moment, two kayakers paddled up beside me in the back of the boat. The one asked me if I knew what I was doing. I assured him that I knew how to run a boat but I worried about swimmers in the water. He then told me to follow the outfitter in front of us, that they did this every day and they would keep us in the right path. And then he said that they would stay right behind us to help with any swimmers. Then the other kayaker quickly paddled up to the outfitter and let their guide know what was going on behind them. I can't tell you how comforting it was to know that we had everyone around us aware that we may need help. These people were trained professionals and knew exactly how to run the Hoback. However, they didn't jump in our boat and take over. They let us do the work and struggle through each rapid. It wasn't easy but the only swimmer we had was my dear wife Amanda and the only reason she went out was because she was paddling so hard that she let her foot slip out of the pontoon to get more leverage.<br /><br />As a family, we survived a very trying experience. One we will never forget. Personally, I felt the power of the Holy Ghost guiding my every command. In that moment, I remembered something about rafting that I hadn't thought about in 15 years. We hit every rapid just as we should and skirted around others in the safest way possible. And in the gospel, I don't believe in coincidences. Those kayakers were angels sent from Heavenly Father at the right moment to give us the comfort and security we needed. In the end, we didn't need their assistance in rescuing swimmers, but they provided sound guidance and security knowing that there was someone there to pick us up if we fell. In my family we have a saying that "God doesn't do random." Our Father in Heaven knows us so well and He wants us to be happy in this life and come home to Him in the end. He will give us every chance He can to right the ship and make it home.<br /><br />I know with all of my heart what a blessing it is to be raised in the gospel by wonderful parents that taught me to love the Lord and to recognize Him often. I am also well aware that not everyone has had the same opportunity. With or without a strong upbringing in the gospel, we have the chance to set our legacy now and determine the path that will lead our families back to our Heavenly Father. In Isaiah chapter 58 verse 12, it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of the paths to dwell in."<sup>11</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>We can make that decision now. I want to end with one more story. A family history treasure for me. A week after the death of my great grandfather, Gene Price, a local resident, Agnes Anderson, wrote a letter to the editor in the South Idaho Press in 1983. Gene Price was the founder of Prices Caf&eacute; and my grandpa Taylor married his daughter, Maxine, and later bought the caf&eacute; from Gene. I hope you will bear with me as I read an excerpt from this letter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"When Gene Price passed away last week, Burley lost a giant of a man. Gene came up the hard way. He had to quit school at an early age to replace his father when he became ill. So the family would have a check coming in. But Gene was one of the best educated men in our community. His education came, really, from the school of experience and hardship. In his lifetime he accumulated wealth but instead of choosing to live in luxury he chose to help those less fortunately than he. Many... have been the recipients of this good man's charitable nature. Widows by the dozens have received his quiet help. One told me how when she was widowed, each morning she would find a little bundle of kindling with which to build her fire, at the back door. She later discovered who was doing it. Such a little thing for him to do and yet such a big help to someone in need. He has gone about town delivering his delicious pies to the sick and lonely or for some special occasion. He taught his children and his grandchildren the value of honest work. He taught by example and with a keen sense of humor. The Price family...established themselves as honest merchants in this community many years ago. They were the kind of people the world sees little of in our day. The Price name is a monument to those us who knew them well. We just hope their posterity continues to keep the name and all its virtues alive throughout the years."</em></p>
<p><em></em>It is my prayer every day that I can carry on the good name of my family here on earth. And I hope that I can make the right decisions to show my Father in Heaven that I love Him and one day, with my whole family, return home to Him. I know we are His children and He loves us. He loves us so much that He sent our older brother, Jesus Christ to atone for us and provide the way back home. I pray that we will turn our hearts to Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>In our family we have captured a saying worth repeating here today. It is used when we really want to have that persons' full attention. It is from the movie&nbsp;<em>Knight and Day&nbsp;</em>- when Tom Cruise is speaking to Cameron Diaz, and he asks, "Are you with me? Or without me? With me? Without me?"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I hope today that all of you will choose to stay "with me" during our time together at this devotional, and that it will enrich and bless your lives as much as it has mine during the time I have been working on it.<br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, I do want you to know, how thankful and honored I am to be able to speak with you today. My heart is full, and my spirit is strong&mdash;and to tell you the truth, it has been like this for quite some time. Selfishly, I am grateful for an opportunity that will help me grow. If we look at our challenges, as opportunities, rather than unwanted experiences, then the reward can only be ours&mdash;never fear a chance to grow. I hope that what I share today might help you answer a question you have been pondering, or maybe even just give you a different way to look at your own personal situation. I pray that the spirit will be with me and you, in hopes that the intent of this devotional will reach your hearts and your minds.</p>
<p>I want to share a little bit more about myself, just to give you a quick glimpse of what type of person I am. I am a true-blue farmer's daughter, and very proud of it. I was taught that you must earn your respect&mdash;it's never just given. Always work hard. There will be someone that learns from you. And make time to play often&mdash;life is too short.<br /><br />It was very important to my father to make sure that all his daughters could drive a potato truck. So at 12 he started teaching, and at 13 I was put in my very own truck. Not only did you have to manage driving your 10-wheel truck underneath a potato combine, but you also had to be able to back the load into the pit by yourself. He had a lot of trust in us. But he was a great teacher. When he taught, it was always without worry. The confidence you felt from him truly made you want to do your very best. He also had us paint mainline, move pipe, weed potato fields really early in the morning. I remember loosing many tennis shoes in the field because the mud would suction them right off of your feet. He wanted his children to know how to work and to work hard.<br /><br />In my free time, I enjoyed all sports. It didn't matter whether it was tetherball, basketball, softball, volleyball, kickball, dodge ball&mdash;as long as there was a ball, I wanted to play, and I wanted to be good. I would keep practicing, and practicing until I felt satisfied with my abilities. I loved, and still do enjoy sports, and just being outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am the type of person that doesn't always get the message the first time through. For instance, I would be the one that if someone said, "do not stick your tongue on a flag pole when it is negative 20 degrees outside" - I may just be curious enough to try it, just to see what would happen. Do you know it really does take a long time for your taste buds to grow back? Some may have a different word for me, I am just going to say it's just curiosity.<br /><br />So now that you know a little about me, let's begin. I have one question for you to think about, and it happens to be the title of my talk, "Are you ready?" Are you ready for life? Are you ready to graduate? Are you ready to go on a mission? Or, how about marriage? Are you ready to study more and learn about the gospel? Are you ready to meet the Savior?</p>
<p>In John 7:6<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Jesus said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>(I want you to keep that in mind, "your time is always ready.") Now I want to take you for a ride and it's going to be the ride of your life! Do you trust me? Remember, I am the curious one. Try and close your eyes and clear your minds. I want you to imagine stepping up to a roller coaster ride. You have been waited for a very long time to take this ride. As you approach the conductor, he motions you to the cart. Your adrenaline begins to accelerate because of the unknown possibilities. You sit down with excitement as you are buckled in, and a bar is placed in front of you. Your anticipation increases as you hear the rest of the bars snapped into place. The coaster begins to pull away from the station and you start the climb. You can hear the clicking of the tracks underneath you while your back starts to press against the seat because of the steep incline. Just as you begin to peak at the top, the coaster hesitates for just a couple of seconds, and then your ride begins. You quickly begin to descend, the speed picks up, and your heart is racing for the unknown. All of a sudden, you slide hard to the left, and then to the right, your speed is increasing. You are trying to keep your eyes open, but the wind is blowing forcefully in your face. You hit a couple of small bumps, that lift you completely out of the chair, but you have the bar, and you grab on.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the coaster slows, and for a half a second you wonder, is it over? But then you start to climb again, this time even higher. You peak once again, with a slight hesitation at the top and then you begin another descent. You take on more curves, and bumps that leave you breathless. All of a sudden your cart is completely upside down as you find yourself in a loop-to-loop. You're thankful for the seatbelt and bar that was given to you for your protection. You wonder how much more you can take. There are a few more turns and curves, and ups and downs, but you can see the end in sight. All of a sudden the brakes are applied, and you feel your speed decrease. It is finally over; it has come to a screeching halt. The smile on your face is priceless as you look into the eyes of the conductor, the one that sent you on your journey, and the only thought that comes to mind, is "Wow! What a ride!" You can open your eyes now if they are still closed, and let's start from the beginning and take this ride again, piece by piece.<br /><br />This ride represents your life. The Conductor is our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the seatbelt is our Heavenly Father's spirit and love that surrounds each one of us. The bar placed in front of you, is the Word of God. The anticipation is the unknown, but the intent and hope is to always return home. The clicking of the tracks is the angels that surround us&mdash;they are always there, even though we can't really see them. The tops of the peaks are decisions you have to make in life. The curves and bumps are the choices and consequences that can lead us astray, and make us loose our grip on the iron rod. The loop-to-loops are the dangerous situations that can leave you hanging, and in total darkness because your mind has not been made up. The screeching halt is that unexpected end that comes, that, hopefully, will lead you back into the arms of our Savior, Jesus Christ&mdash;and when you look at him, I hope you will be able to smile and say, "Wow! What a ride?" The journey is yours; will you be ready to meet the Savior?<br /><br />I am a very visual person, and I learn and understand better when I can liken the topic to something in my life. Hopefully your roller coaster ride today will help you look at things in a different light. In fact, my talk today has a lot of parallels to life. I hope you will be able to see them and apply them for the intent in which they were meant.<br /><br />I have taught many Relief Society lessons over the years, and one of my most favorite quotes is by Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I don't want to drive up to the pearly gates in a shiny sports car, wearing beautiful, tailored clothes, my hair expertly done, and with long, perfectly manicured fingernails.<br />I want to drive up in a station wagon that has mud on the wheels from taking kids to scout camp.<br />I want to be there with a smudge of peanut butter on my shirt from making sandwiches for a sick neighbors' child.<br />I want to be there with a little dirt under my fingernails from helping to weed someone's garden.<br />I want to be there with children's sticky kisses on my cheeks and the tears of a friend on my shoulder.<br />I want the Lord to know I was really here and that I really lived."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Right behind her quote I want to give you another quote to think about, and it's by President Spencer W Kimball:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let us remember, too, that greatness is not always a matter of the scale of one's life, but of the quality of one's life. True greatness is not always tied to the scope of our tasks, but to the quality of how we carry out our tasks whatever they are."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I have thought a lot about how I want to live my life. I do not want to coast, I do not want to just get by, I want to live, and learn, and experience, all that is righteous for me. I have watched some people wait their entire life for that famous saying "I'm going to do it tomorrow" -don't wait. Prepare yourselves now, and get ready!</p>
<p>When I met my husband he already had his pilots' license. He had been flying for almost three years, with over a hundred flight hours underneath his belt. He was licensed as a VFR pilot, which means he was a "visual flight regulation pilot." He could fly by using the ground and landmarks as his map. Now I tell you this part because he loved to fly. I however, was not the best co-pilot. My sense of direction is not so good. I get lost driving in a car with a map in hand, and a GPS going at the same time. So you can image my skills of trying to find the bumps and hills on a navigation map from the air. But I went, because I loved him, and you kind of do those things for the person you are in love with.<br /><br />Sometime after we were married my brother had asked if my husband and I would be interested in flying my mom and him over to Eureka, California to pick up a new car. Tod, my husband, joyfully said "yes," and my answer was "okay." The plan was to leave Rexburg in a 4-seater Warrior Piper Airplane. My mom and I were scheduled to sit in the back with a whole bunch of magazines and things to help us get through the flight, while Tod and my brother were in the front. Tod could fly just fine, but he needed a co-pilot who could read and navigate the map-obviously I wasn't first pick! The plan was to fly from Rexburg to Winnemucca, Nevada, fuel up there, and continue on until we reached Eureka, California. It was a great plan. My husband had studied the maps and plotted the route we would be taking.<br /><br />Tod and I have what people call a blended marriage. There was his and mine before we got married. After we were married, they then became all of ours. Our second daughter was only about a year old when we left for this little adventure, and my sister committed to watching our children overnight for us.<br /><br />We left bright and early on a Friday morning, and landed in Winnemucca to fuel up right on schedule. My brother was starting to feel a little sick, so while we were fueling up, he got a Diet Coke and a candy bar, in hopes that it would help him make it the rest of the way. Shortly after take-off, my brother the navigator could no longer be the co-pilot. He was too sick. That left me and my mom (and no, we did not play rock, paper, and scissors); it was going to take both of us. Just to give you a side note, I think I got my navigational abilities from her.&nbsp;Did you know that it can be totally calm on the ground, but blowing really hard up in the air? With me and my mom's navigational skills, and due to high winds, we landed in Medford, Oregon-not our destination, but close enough. My brother rented a car, and we drove the rest of the way, about 100 more miles to Eureka, California to get the new car. I was never so excited to see the hotel that night.</p>
<p>The next morning they drove us back to Medford to get the airplane and fly home. We were noticing a lot of clouds in the sky, but Tod continued to check the airplane, and get it ready for takeoff. The flight service told us not to worry about the clouds, and that it should clear off, and that travel would be favorable. I remember looking over at my husband and thinking how incredibly confident he looked. I believed in him. He would take care of me no matter what the situation was. We were a team. I am totally sure that he felt the same way about me, with all my map skills and everything. We were young, and ready for the adventure.<br /><br />In the beginning, the flight was going great. I actually was starting to get the hang of reading the navigation map. I wondered, "could I be his co-pilot?" I was learning what to watch for, and how I could be a help to my partner. He was willing to trust me with the map to get us home. After we had been in the air for a few hours, the clouds really started getting thick, which meant we had to fly lower, in order to see the landmarks. I remember him saying, "I hope these clouds burn off, it's getting harder to see." Pretty soon we were totally consumed in clouds, and were lost. Tod didn't dare fly any lower because we couldn't see how close we were to the ground, yet we couldn't see very far in front of us either. I remember feeling so helpless, Tod must have felt the same way, because at that point he decided that we would have to call in a "Mayday" and possibly make an emergency landing. While he was doing this, I remembered this calm feeling that came over me. I wasn't afraid. I remembered feeling that I was ready! I was with my eternal companion. My life was in order, and I would do whatever our Heavenly Father had intended for us that day.<br /><br />Now I want to stop this story for just a second, I haven't always felt this way in my life. The start of my freshman year (so I was only fourteen) Heavenly Father decided it was time to bring my own father back home. My father was killed in an Ultra-Light accident. Needless to say, my world fell apart. I remember feeling so sad, and alone. I was angry with our Heavenly Father for taking someone away from me, that I selfishly needed more. Because of those kinds of feelings and that type of attitude I started not caring about the choices I was making. It just didn't matter. I didn't have an opinion on much, and I'm sure that my face and countenance showed it. Because of that, and letting go of the iron rod, my life would take a huge turn. I had many "curves" and "bumps" and "loop to loops" and sometimes it was hard to just see the light. It has taken a humbled heart and many prayers, for me to get through the consequences of my choices and turn my life around with the help of the atonement. What I didn't know then, but I do now, is that you are never alone. He loves you unconditionally, he knows you, and he will never give up on you. Sometimes, you have to hit rock bottom in order to humble yourself enough to feel our Savior's love and see the light again.<br /><br />So while Tod was calling in a "Mayday," I waited patiently for instruction. There was no yelling or arguing between Tod and I, but you could definitely feel a spirit. We never talked about it then, but later when we did, we both knew my father was in that plane with us that day. We both could feel of his spirit, love, and confidence that he had in us.<br /><br />Tod made contact with flight service right before we had to cross the Oregon/Idaho Mountains. They told us to look for a place that we could make an emergency landing. Luckily the clouds parted just enough that we were able to fly into a valley where we could keep circling until hopefully the clouds lifted, or worse case, we ran out of fuel and had to land. Although it wasn't looking good for us, we never panicked. Out of complete silence, flight service came back on the radio and said<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>"We have a military C-141 coming out of Seattle." Someone was coming to find us. They told us to hang on, and look for this plane. With all those clouds, it would be really lucky to even see them before it was too late. We were in that valley for probably an hour, just circling, when I saw a glimpse of an aircraft. I was never so excited to see such a big plane. They hadn't seen us, and Tod hadn't seen them, but I did, and I made sure he used the radio to tell them. We ended up flying on the wing of this aircraft to Burns, Oregon. There we landed safely on the runway. They had us wait until the weather cleared to make a new flight plan. While we were waiting, they told us that we were one of three planes, circling within a seventy-five mile radius of each other. We were all caught in the same storm, yet somehow we never saw or ran into each other. The first plane had already crashed into the mountains and there were no survivors. The second plane had to make an emergency landing, and had minor injuries. We were the only plane that landed on the runway. When the clouds cleared we took off for Boise and then onto Rexburg. It seemed so clear after that, the landmarks were easy to find and the flight home was easily made. The lesson we learned about each other will never be forgotten, nor will the love and the spirit we felt in that plane.<br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson counseled us by saying, "Learn from the past, prepare for the future, and live in the present.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;We all know where we want to go, and it does matter which way we go, for by choosing our path, we choose our destination."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Letting fear, having no motivation, and not willing to challenge yourself, can only eliminate talents and opportunities that our Heavenly Father has in store for you. No one is ever too old, or too young to learn, be prepared, or to be ready. There is a scripture that comes to my mind often, and I can't wait for the day, if I am worthy to have my Heavenly Father say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou in the joy of thy lord."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Those words alone, "well done," what more could you ask for? What more could you strive for from our Heavenly Father? He knows your potential. Seek for his help and guidance to uncover the talents you have been given, and be ready for whatever may come your way.</p>
<p>In a talk given by Sister Mary Ellen Smoot:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I fully believe that our talents are developed as we are called upon to serve. If we will faithfully accept the call, hidden talents will be discovered, such as love; compassion; discernment; being a good friend, peacemaker, teacher, leader, homemaker, writer, researcher- these are all talents." "If you are to walk in the light of the Lord, discover your individual strengths and develop them. You will find great joy as you unselfishly share all that the Lord has given you."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I understand now why our Heavenly Father helped us land safely that day we were in the airplane. He had one more spirit that he needed to send down to complete our family, which is our youngest son that recently graduated from high school and has accepted a call to serve a mission. I recently visited a local bookstore and had to purchase this plaque with the quote: "missionary, (noun) a person who leaves their family for a while, so others can be with their Families Forever." That description pretty much says it all doesn't it?</p>
<p>Watching our son's spiritual growth over the years from a small boy into a young man has been incredible. I have been so blessed to be a witness to that. The influences of primary teachers, scout leaders, young men leaders, home teachers, seminary teachers, family members, and great church leaders have all made an impact on him, and on us, in preparing him for a mission. It's incredible to see the hand of our Heavenly Father take effect on each of us. We need to trust in Him and let Him lead us in the direction he has in store for each of us. I know that we must also be ready, and worthy for it to work. He will not give us challenges that we cannot handle, but we must trust in him, and humble ourselves to be ready and receive. I pray that your life lessons will be just that&mdash;lessons to prepare you to get ready, and to be ready, so that when your time comes, He will welcome you into His arms and say, "well done, my good and faithful servant." And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Counselor</p>
<p>Kyle R. Walker was raised in Logandale, Nevada. He has worked as a Counselor in the Counseling Center at BYU-Idaho since 2002. He received his doctorate degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from Brigham Young University. He is the author or editor of two books about the Joseph Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith family, and has recently published a biography on Joseph Smith's younger brother, William Smith. He served as a full-time missionary in the Wisconsin Milwaukee Mission, and currently serves as the bishop of his ward. He and his wife Daylene are the parents of five children, four boys and one daughter.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you today at BYU-Idaho. It's a privilege for me to work here with so many great students and employees. And I believe it is a privilege for you to be connected, in some form, to this special university. It's truly a sacred place.<br /><br />I am amazed by the great young people that come here to BYU-Idaho. It is also a great opportunity for me to work in the Counseling Center here at the university. And to hear firsthand accounts of the many trials and challenges that you wrestle with in your lives. I am continually amazed and inspired by the way you cope and overcome those challenges. Like you, I am grateful that I have the framework of the gospel to assist in understanding the purpose of trials and opposition in our lives.<br /><br />Joseph Smith once said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force . . . - all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will [in time] become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In this instance, the Prophet Joseph referred to the role that opposition plays in helping to refine us and make us fit for the kingdom of God. He could certainly speak to that topic, as he had more than his fair share of opposition and trials.&nbsp;There are so many different kinds of challenges and trials that we face.</p>
<p>The focus of my thoughts today will be to highlight some general principles that might assist you in whatever trial you might be facing in your life. To do so, I want to tell you my son Josh's story.<br /><br />Now I have to tell you a little about Josh so you get a feel for his personality. He is our oldest son, and his temperament is fairly easy-going. He is somewhat introverted. He doesn't like a lot of fuss or attention, and he's pretty independent. Unlike some of our other children, he didn't require much discipline growing up.<br /><br />I remember when he was around age three, that I could go play basketball and I could sit him on the stage at the church house with some treats, and he could sit there eating his snacks quietly for more than an hour as he watched me play. (That's pretty remarkable). That's just Josh. None of our other children could have done that, but he was blessed with a calm demeanor. His temperament would assist him in enduring the great trials that were ahead for him.<br /><br />When my son was five years old he sort of trotted into the room one day and very casually said, "Dad, can you see out of this eye the same way you see out of the other eye?" Somewhat concerned, we had him cover his eye and did a little test on his sight. It was apparent that he could not see the same out of both eyes. So, we thought he might need glasses, and took him to an ophthalmologist that same week. As the doctor shined a light in Josh's eye, to examine the optic nerve, I will never forget the look of alarm on the doctor's face. He wouldn't tell us what was wrong, but he immediately scheduled us for an appointment at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. (Not a good sign, right?).<br /><br />Shortly thereafter Josh was diagnosed as having a large tumor directly behind his eyes, that was pressing on his optic nerve, and damaging his vision in one eye. Surgery was scheduled immediately. I'll always remember him being wheeled into the surgery room in a little car, with an angel nurse by his side. To us it was like our lamb was going to the slaughter. And, if you saw him afterward, you would think that he had gone to the slaughter.<br /><br />Normally they would go through the nasal cavity to access this type of tumor, but because of his age, they had to cut an incision from ear to ear, and go in through his skull. In this picture you can see Josh shortly after he came out of surgery. We prayed hard, and hoped for the best. Within a day after surgery his eyes were completely swollen shut and everything was dark. He was all alone that first night after surgery, as we were not allowed in the room.<br /><br />That was painfully difficult for all of us. While the surgery was successful in removing the tumor, in the process they&nbsp;destroyed his pituitary gland--the body's master gland. Josh would need to have all his hormones synthetically replaced for the rest of his life.<br /><br />He received many blessings during this time, and afterward, including blessings that discussed his healing. That healing did not come in the form we expected. We, of course, wanted him to be healed to the extent that he would not be dependent on any more medicine. But instead, the blessing was that he responded miraculously well to all of the medicines he was required to take. It was also a miracle that all of his hormones could be synthetically replaced. 30 years earlier that would not have been possible.<br /><br />Years passed. By the time he was in high school he was 6' 3" tall. We had one doctor tell us he had never seen someone as tall as Josh, who was entirely dependent on growth hormone from such a young age. We were grateful for that blessing. Josh learned to endure the health challenges that were an everyday part of his life, and our family gradually learned to adjust to his medical routines.<br /><br />When I think of Josh's experience when he was a little boy, I am reminded of Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin's talk entitled "Come What May and Love it!" I sometimes like to think of that statement as "Come What May and Accept it." Elder Wirthlin said, "How can we love days that are filled with sorrow? We can't&mdash;at least not in the moment."<br /><br />Referring to his mother's counsel of "Come What May and Love it," Elder Wirthlin explained, "I don't think my mother was suggesting that we suppress discouragement or deny the reality of pain. I don't think she was suggesting that we smother unpleasant truths beneath a cloak of pretended happiness. But I do believe that the way we react to adversity can be a major factor in how happy and successful we can be in life."<sup>2</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Elder Wirthlin taught us to make the best out of difficult circumstances, and to still find joy in the journey.</p>
<p>One example from the scriptures about how we might respond to adversity comes from the account of Nephi and Laman and Lemuel. In 1 Nephi 17:1-2, Nephi says,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; . . . And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness."And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmuring."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In that same chapter listen to what Laman and Lemuel said of their experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Nephi and Laman and Lemuel seem to be describing two different journeys, but in reality they are describing the very same experience.</p>
<p>How could Nephi see the great blessings of the Lord during their journey, while Laman and Lemuel say that it would have been better if their families would have died before they left due to their intense sufferings? I think the answer to that question comes much earlier in the record.<br /><br />In chapter 2 of 1 Nephi, Laman and Lemuel murmur about their father's revelation to leave Jerusalem, while Nephi says, in verse 16:</p>
<p>"I did cry unto the Lord, and behold he did visit me and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Can you see those same attitudes playing out during their subsequent journey?&mdash;Laman and Lemuel murmuring about their trials, while Nephi continues to "cry unto the Lord" for support and understanding. I think there is a lesson in that account for successfully enduring trials. We also will need to cry unto the Lord to soften our hearts during times of difficulty, and look to Him for understanding.</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who knew much about "enduring" from his own eight-year battle with leukemia, insightfully explained,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Patient endurance is to be distinguished from merely being 'acted upon.' Endurance is more than pacing up and down within the cell of our circumstance; it is not only acceptance of the things allotted to us, it is to 'act for ourselves' by magnifying what is allotted to us."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I believe that sometimes, due to our shortsightedness, we might think we have endured enough. In essence, we seek to counsel the Lord as to the timing and extent of suffering we experience, with our own limited wisdom. "If certain mortal experiences were cut short," Elder Maxwell continues, "it would be like pulling up a flower to see how the roots are doing. Put another way, too many anxious openings of the oven door, and the cake falls instead of rising. Moreover, enforced change usually does not last, while productive enduring can ingrain permanent change." Let me emphasize that last sentence,&nbsp;<em>enforced change usually does not last, while productive enduring can ingrain permanent change.</em></p>
<p><em></em>During the summer before our son Josh's junior year of high school he began experiencing painful headaches. We thought he was experiencing a prolonged sinus infection, but after visiting many doctors and seeing no improvement, a doctor finally ordered an MRI. To our shock and horror, when we looked at the scans, we discovered he had multiple brain tumors&mdash;cancer spreading throughout his brain cavity. These tumors were unrelated to the one he had when he was five. One doctor told us that the odds of having two different types of brain tumors were something like one in 150 million! One of these tumors was blocking the brain fluid from draining properly and that was what was causing his headaches.</p>
<p>A local doctor did immediate surgery, inserting a fairly large shunt at the base of his skull in order to alleviate the pressure caused by the accumulation of fluid in his brain cavity. They then did a second surgery, also through the top of the skull, in order to take a biopsy to determine if the tumors were malignant or benign. That surgery failed to get a proper biopsy, and we found ourselves back at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where, after a third surgery, it was determined that his tumors were indeed malignant. That meant months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He spent his entire junior year of High School receiving treatment. Fortunately, Josh responded amazingly well to both treatments in the intervening months, and by the end of his Junior year of high school he was cancer free! We were again, deeply grateful for this blessing.<br /><br />In the book of Mosiah there is a great story about Alma the elder and his people who had gathered to a place called Helam. Amulon, a former colleague of Alma's, who had also been one of King Noah's wicked priests, was eventually appointed to oversee Alma and his people. Beginning in Mosiah 24:9, it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him . . . yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put taskmasters over them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosover should be found calling upon God should be put to death.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Several things stand out to me in this account about how we should endure our trials, including Alma and his people crying out "mightily to God." I am impressed with their total submission to the will of the Lord, exercising "great faith" and "patience" during their difficulty. My favorite phrase in this passage is when it describes Alma and his people submitting "cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord." What a great example of how to persevere and cope during a very trying time. Like Alma and his people, we are also the covenant people of the Lord, and He will not leave us comfortless during our times of trial.</p>
<p>In our experience with Josh he was a great example of enduring cheerfully. He literally never complained once through the whole ordeal. His Mom and I were certainly not at that level of endurance, and I'm sure I would have done my fair share of complaining had the roles been reversed. Nearly every picture we have of him during his chemotherapy treatments shows him smiling. I couldn't personally imagine going through chemotherapy and radiation treatment and still smiling? This is a picture of Josh with his youngest brother towards the end of his treatment. Now, there were tough days. He certainly wasn't always smiling during times of painful treatment and suffering. But he seemed to remain optimistic and even "cheerful" throughout the experience.<br /><br />Our family learned many life-changing lessons through these experiences with Josh, and perhaps there are some things that may be of use to you as you experience your own challenges.<br /><br />First, as you go through your own trials, work to be submissive to the will of the Lord. So often it seems that we try and change the will of the Lord to fit our own view of how&nbsp;things should go. I testify that we can experience great peace when we are submissive to our Heavenly Father and His purposes. We experienced that peace with an assurance that no matter what happened to our son the Lord would not leave us comfortless.<br /><br />In Mosiah 3:19 it reads,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love. . ."</p>
<p>Now, pay attention to this part of the verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I love the words "yield" and "submit." The dictionary says that when we submit we "Stop trying to fight or resist something: [we] agree to accept something that [we] have been resisting or opposing."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Wow! Is there anything in your life of a spiritual nature that you have been resisting? Do we sometimes resist the very trials that could help refine and purify us? Could submitting and yielding our hearts to God allow for much greater growth and ultimately, even sanctification?</p>
<p>The second lesson we learned was this: Allow others to help you. This was one of the most painful lessons I had to learn as we went through our trial with Josh's health challenges.<br /><br />Now you should know that I am very independent, and before this experience with our son I prided&mdash;and I underscore the word pride here&mdash;I prided myself on being self-reliant. However, through this experience I have learned that we are all self-reliant in some realms of our lives, and we all need help in others. Also, we may be self-reliant during different periods of our lives, but need help during others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, how can we "lift up the hands which hang down," or "strengthen the feeble knees" if we are all completely independent and self-reliant all of the time? How can we mourn with those that mourn, or comfort those who stand in need of comfort if we, as saints, are all independent?<br /><br />During one particularly difficult time when Josh was to return to Salt Lake City for chemotherapy, we needed help with our other four children. My Mom was scheduled to come up from Nevada to help, but she came down with a kidney stone at the last minute.</p>
<p>I remember that in our desperate circumstance, gathering the family together, kneeling in a circle, and petitioning the Lord in family prayer to help us. No sooner had we got off our knees than the phone rang, and a sister in a neighboring ward felt impressed to call and ask how she could help. My wife told her of our plight, and she said, "Done.&nbsp;I'll take care of it. Don't even worry about this week." And she took care of the children for the entire week! We couldn't have done it without her timely help. Later on, ward members called and asked if we would be okay with a special fast for our son. After wrestling with that decision some, we finally said "yes." It was one of the best decisions we ever made, as the primary children began to pray for us. If you ever need great faith and extra blessings, get the primary children involved in praying for you.<br /><br />The third lesson we came to understand was that during trials we need to cling to our faith with all the strength we have. We clung to the words of our prophets and apostles during this time of trial, carrying the most recent general conference issue with us wherever we went. I remember discussing conference talks continually with my wife Daylene while we waited in the hospital, and waited, and waited. We found great strength and pertinent counsel as we studied and pondered the words of our leaders. Here is one nugget of truth I remember from President Monson's talk that conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When compared to eternal verities, most of the questions and concerns of daily living are really rather trivial. . . These questions . . . lose their significance when times of crisis arise, when loved ones are hurt or injured, when sickness enters the house of good health, when life's candle dims and darkness threatens. Our thoughts become focused, and we are easily able to determine what is really important and what is merely trivial."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We found that counsel was so true in our situation. Immediately after Josh's diagnosis all the trivial things of life dropped out of our lives.</p>
<p>Personal prayer also played a critical role. I remember at one point before he started chemotherapy his local surgeon felt like the shunt he had inserted was no longer working. He was concerned that Josh would begin retaining fluid again, which fluid, if there was too much retained, could even cause his death. My wife and mother-in-law were at the doctor's office for a routine appointment when this was discovered. I was at home with our other children. They called me with the news, but I felt unsettled about what the doctor was recommending. Our younger kids were in bed, and I was alone in my home.<br /><br />I remember kneeling by my bedside and praying fervently for direction. I was given to know that this surgery was unnecessary with an unmistakable answer. I called and informed my wife about my impression, and they cancelled surgery. When she and my mother-in-law came home they were pretty upset with me because of what the doctor had told them. My mother-in-law looked me square in the face, and said, "You realize Josh could die don't you?" Now, for those of you who aren't married yet, just a word of advice here: When attempting to maintain healthy relationships with your in-laws, it is not wise to contradict your mother-in-law. Keep that in mind. But in this case, I stood firm. I got a call from the doctor at 2 am, basically saying the same thing&mdash;"Do you realize your son could die?" I heard him out, but stood firm. I had prayed and received clear direction.<br /><br />What would you do if you had received a spiritual answer that contradicted what everyone else around you thought was the right course, and your son's life hung in the balance? The next day we traveled to Salt Lake, where doctors reassured us that Josh's shunt was okay, and it did not need to be removed. I was so grateful that I listened to the Spirit, and that Josh did not have to go through an additional surgery.<br /><br />For Josh, during his ordeal, he clung to statements contained in his patriarchal blessing, that specifically referenced his future missionary service and fatherhood, as well as promises he received from priesthood blessings.<br /><br />Daylene and I increased our temple attendance during this time of difficulty. You might think you haven't the time to increase your spiritual activities during difficult times, but I know that it can be a great blessing to you if you do, and I testify that we received great strength from worshiping more frequently in the House of the Lord. Our burdens were easier to bare&mdash;even light, as was the case with Alma and his people&mdash;due to these spiritual practices.<br /><br />Finally, seek to serve others while experiencing trials. During the time Josh was being treated for cancer, he was granted a wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Perhaps you have heard of that organization. They were famously highlighted a year or so ago when a five-year-old battling leukemia wished he could be Batman for a day, and so he helped save San Francisco from the Riddler, while tens of thousands gathered to watch and cheer him on. It was a touching experience that has since been made into a film.<br /><br />In our case, Josh could ask for anything he wanted, and his brothers and sister chimed in on what he should wish for&mdash;including meeting NBA great Lebron James, going to Disneyland, or going on a Caribbean cruise. However, when we went to Josh and discussed his wish with him alone&mdash;away from his siblings&mdash;we discovered that he had already decided what he wanted. He said that so much of the year had been focused on him and his treatment, that he decided he wanted to give his wish away to his siblings. It was the first time in Make-A-Wish's history in the state of Idaho that someone gave what they termed a "give-back" wish. His wish was to give his siblings a surprise Christmas. We were amazed about his request, and we tried to determine whether this is what he really wanted--but he assured us that this was what he wanted most.<br /><br />He spent weeks gathering information about what his brothers and sister wanted for Christmas, and then spent several days in Salt Lake City after one of his chemotherapy treatments shopping for presents. It was a great distraction from his own suffering. We will never forget that Christmas as long as we live! Josh&mdash;all dressed up in a Santa suit&mdash;handing out presents to his siblings.<br /><br />In giving his "wish" away to his family, I believe that it helped Josh have time where he could distract himself from his own burdens, and have joy in witnessing the happiness of others. I find that principle is true in my profession as a counselor.<br /><br />There have been many occasions where I am burdened with my own challenges, and then I sit down and listen to the difficulties of others. And by the end of our visit, all of the sudden my problems don't seem very big. I think most of us&nbsp;understand that principle, but I believe that it is especially important to remember when going through difficult times.<br /><br />After waiting an extra year to obtain medical clearance, Josh is now serving as a full-time missionary in Oklahoma. Josh is on your right--pictured here with his younger brother Drake, who is currently serving in the Domincan Republic. Notice that Josh is still smiling.<br /><br />We are grateful for the miracles he has experienced, and will yet experience in his life. Through the lens of experience, we now see many of the purposes of the Lord in his not being healed immediately from all of his health challenges when he was a little boy. Our whole family, along with countless others, have been blessed by his faith and his patient endurance of his trials.<br /><br />I hope that we can view our trials not as irritants or a time to ask "Why me?," but rather as an opportunity to deepen our discipleship and draw close to our Heavenly Father. I pray that our times of trial might have a sanctifying effect upon us through submitting to the Lord's will and purposes. That our trials might be a time where we truly exercise our faith in the Lord, and like Alma and His people, we will endure patiently&mdash;even cheerfully, in waiting to see the Lord's purposes of the trials that come to us in our lives. I bear testimony that the Lord will not leave us comfortless during our extremities, if we will turn to Him with full purpose of heart. I am a witness of his tender loving support. I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Preparing for this talk has seemed like one of the toughest things I have had to prepare in a long time. It has caused me to reflect and ponder on many things in my life. I am, indeed, grateful for this opportunity and for the many things I have learned about myself, this topic, and many other topics that I've explored during this process.<br /><br />I pray the Holy Ghost will testify to you what you have come here to hear, and it will be delivered to you in a way that will be pleasing to our Heavenly Father. Throughout my address you will hear and be prompted with questions. I hope you will take the opportunity to seek for your own answers to those questions.<br /><br />I have had a theme going on in my life throughout the past few years and the theme is potential and perspective. This theme has run through my life by interactions with my students, my family, and my calling in the Church. It is funny how the Lord works when he is trying to mold you into what you can become. He gives you opportunities, experiences, and challenges. It makes total sense why he sent us all here to receive a body and have experiences instead of just preaching to us from Heaven. By us being actively engaged and allowing us to observe others, we become empowered to learn for ourselves.<br /><br />Three years ago my husband and I were called into the Stake Presidents office. I thought they wanted to talk to us about a position for my husband. To my surprise they asked me to be the Stake Young Women's President. Now, I have never been a president of any auxiliary before so I was pretty sure I looked behind me to see who else was in the room. There sat only me, my husband, and the Stake Presidency. I asked them first of all, are you sure? Then of course I cried out of fear and disbelief. Why would they be inspired by our Heavenly Father to call me? I felt I did not fit the mold or potential of someone to be called to this calling based on my perspective of others I had observed.<br /><br />After I was set apart I was talking to one of my colleagues at work and I told her of the inadequacy I felt and how I had no idea how or why I would have been called to this calling. Still crying as I spoke to her about my concerns, my friend said to me, "I understand how you feel." She told me she had those same feelings when she was called to that same position. She said, "Euleza, let me tell you what helped me when I felt as you feel right now." It was something one of her stake presidents had said to her when she was called. He said, "Kris, you are not called because of who you are, but who you can become." I felt, as I heard those words, Kris was an angel that was trying to give me a message from my Heavenly Father. Those words may have been for Kris at the time she heard them, but they were for me right now. Her knowledge and understanding of what and how I was feeling was valid to me because I knew she had a similar experience and she had lived through some of my same concerns. She had walked in my shoes.<br /><br />We are here to help ourselves and others make it home. I am thankful for all the people on this earth and on the other side of the veil that has helped me not give up. They are the ones that when I asked for help instead of giving me a pity party would cheer me on. On one occasion I was going through a tough time. To this day I cannot even remember what that challenge was but I have never forgot her words to me. She said, "Euleza, I see you looking at yourself from what may seem to you to be a deep, deep hole. As you stand there at the bottom of that hole I see your hand reaching up. You want so badly to be pulled up to where you know you need to be; where you can feel safety and peace. But I also see you at the top of that deep hole, Euleza. You are reaching down to grab your own hand and pull yourself up." Then my friend added, "Grab on Euleza. Grab on and pull yourself up. You know where you want to be, and where you should be, you know it! Let yourself be rescued."<br /><br />In Ether 12:27 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."</p>
<p>One of the challenges I have been blessed with (ah, perspective) are chronic migraines. One morning I woke up with one and I knew that day I had to go to work, because I had signed up for a workshop in which tithing funds had been used for me to attend. So I took some medicine, said a prayer, and went. That day we learned about strengths and how we all have been anointed with strengths by our Heavenly Father. We learned that those strengths we have are unique to us. When we use our strengths for good, we can be better used as a tool by which we were designed.</p>
<p>Perceptions of others in my eyes were also changed. One of the things that had the biggest impact on me that day was when she talked to us about toxic conversations. She taught us that when we are frustrated with someone it's because they have strengths that are not connecting with our strength. When this happens we need to stop and look out (see it through their lens), and then look up. Turn to your Heavenly Father realizing that those same strengths that seem to be frustrating us are the same strengths that our Heavenly Father possesses. Perspective.</p>
<p>Now, can we see them and the conversation in a different way? When we look at those experiences in that way can we put our own perceptions away and listen, observe, and learn from them? Can we just try to see them through our Heavenly Fathers eyes?</p>
<p>In D&amp;C 3:3-4 it says,</p>
<p>"Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him."</p>
<p>When I think of what I could have missed that day if I would have let my challenge get in my way. I would be different, even this talk written today would be different. That day I gained knowledge, understanding, and learning through my observations and being actively engaged. I have been able to use those things I learned in just that one day in all areas of my life.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father has sent us all here to be His tools and His hands. It is up to us to do our part to be allowed to be molded to become and reach our full potential. Sometimes our part is just having the courage to say or do something when moved upon by the Spirit without knowing why. By having trust in the Lord and the Holy Ghost, knowing there is a greater plan (and that His plan is a better one) we can help others succeed and get closer to our Heavenly Father's eternal perspective and our potential. That day my life was molded in a way I was not expecting and with that touch in my life I have been able to take what I learned to help others see maybe what they had not seen before.<br /><br />We also read in Isaiah 64:8,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our&nbsp;potter; and we all are the work of thy hand."</p>
<p>The next few pictures are of three girls in my stake taking us through a process of making a personalized vase out of clay. I asked them to do this for something we would be using later that year in our Stake Young Women in Excellence. As we will notice they are all going through the same process and each vase, depending on their decisions, or maybe even challenges, will each turn out different and beautiful.</p>
<p>This first picture is of them holding dirt that has many imperfections and is not ready to be pliable. I love how one girl is holding the dirt and the others are helping lift from underneath. Has there been a time in your life where you felt helping hands beneath you lifting you up either from a complete stranger or someone you know? The three of them are about to tackle a journey together, which this picture may depict them saying to each other, "We can do this together". Can you imagine us saying that in heaven to each other before we left His presence? I can.<br /><br />Here is the block of clay. It is now ready and willing to be put in the hands of the girls, and now it is up to the girls to create their masterpiece. The girls have worked with clay before. I know this because I have personally seen a couple of the girl's projects. They took a class, gained knowledge about the process, and learned through observing others and by practicing.<br /><br />In order for us to meet our full potential, we are expected to gain knowledge, observe, and learn. We do this from gaining knowledge from the scriptures, our prophets, attending church, observing others, obeying and keeping our covenants, and by asking questions and seeking to understand.<br /><br />We read in Proverbs 9:9-10:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.<br />"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding."</p>
<p>I could read a book on how to sculpt a vase out of clay, but until I really tried it and went through the process could I truly say I understand. Elder Bednar said in his book,&nbsp;<em>Increase in Learning</em>, the following, quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Many facts are helpful or merely interesting to know. Some knowledge is useful to lean and apply. But gospel truths are essential for us to know and understand and live if we are to become what our Heavenly Father yearns us to become."</p>
<p>We also read in D &amp; C 88:118</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...Teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."</p>
<p>As we know the Lord's hands are in all things. I have seen it personally in my life and I am sure you have seen it in yours, too. If I may, I would like to compare some realizations I made with the process of the vases and our potential and perspective or perceptions we may have had in our own lives. Even though each girl was given the same instruction each girl took on the assignment in a different manner. Using their own perspective from their past experiences, knowledge and observations all began to form the clay how they felt was best and may have even seen the finished product in their mind before they began. Each had to make choices about what tool to use, how to use it, and when to use it. Each had to decide how much pressure if any, was needed. I imagine that there were times they asked each other for help, knowing that the other person may have some insight about how to create a handle or how to make a pattern on the vase.</p>
<p>Putting things into eternal perspective, aren't we all faced with challenges and trials? We all need each other.<br /><br />I have a friend that was struggling with something very near and dear to her heart. I had no way of knowing how or what to say to her. I had been praying for her and I wanted her to find the peace that was there for her to feel, but I really had no way of knowing (really knowing) or understanding how she felt. I finally had words impressed upon my mind of what I needed to tell my friend. These words, although I believe were meant for her, they may also be meant for someone hearing this talk today. Here are the words I said to my friend:</p>
<p>"I want you to know that you will get through this journey. I want you to know that I am not sure how long it will take but [you will get through it]. I also want you to know that this journey you are on, is not for you. What I mean is that this journey you are on, is for you to help someone else that will be facing something similar. I am not sure when that will be, but this person will approach you and tell you their story. You will recognize it as your own. Then you will be able to tell them, 'I know how you feel, I not only know how you feel, I understand how you feel because I have walked in your shoes.' You will be the one that was sent to their aid to help them get through their journey because you have made it through yours."</p>
<p>Perspective.</p>
<p>We have been given a choice to make a difference and to prove ourselves. What we choose to do with the decisions or experiences we have is up to us. We have the strength within us and through the Holy Ghost to choose a better path.</p>
<p>With each picture you can see a little piece of the girls personalities are coming to life. As they all molded the piece of clay in different ways. They softened parts, rolled other parts, pulled and carved. One created a handle for her vase, they each could see potential and purpose in their own unique vase. All vases took time and effort on their part. They spent many hours and days through months of preparation. The time away from the shop I am sure their creation was on their mind. What step they should take next?<br /><br />Finally it was time to put their creation in the hot fire to help refine any imperfections and to make the vases stronger.<br /><br />I relate this to us after we have been through a challenge&mdash;whether we made choices that took us there or whether we were blessed with a trial to make us stronger. Whichever the case may be, we now are a stronger vessel for walking through the experience.<br /><br />In 2 Nephi 31:20 it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."</p>
<p>The girls then put the finishing touches on the vases by painting them white and then a last coat of glaze to make them shine. They all knew the plan, the deadline, the purpose, and what was expected of them. When I met them about nine months later to pick up the vases, their humbleness was evident. As the girls looked at me looking at their creations you could feel their vulnerability. As I picked up each one and examined it, I was in awe! I had always wanted to be talented in this craft but haven't spent the hours of learning and perfecting as they have. They were adorable trying to take credit for someone else's work as they picked up a vase they had not created. As I examined each vase I could not see one mistake&mdash;only beauty.</p>
<p>I could see the light in their eyes as they humbly posed for a picture with their own masterpiece. There was something about their unity they had discovered as they had worked on this process and journey together.<br /><br />As we all know we are not only relying on ourselves and others, but on our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. He will never leave us. Jesus has walked in our shoes. He knows everything that we are, or will go through and He completely understands. He is there to help us. We need to do our part by actively living the gospel so we can trust and feel His love and His hands in all things. I have witnessed myself being pulled up from that deep, deep hole and then realizing and feeling the comfort that comes from His almighty hand that reassures me and again I know I am not alone.<br /><br />Can I ask all of you to take a look at this picture for a moment? Take a few seconds to get the image in your mind. Now while looking at this picture can you envision a scene I will describe to you. You are coming into the presence of our Heavenly Father. You see Jesus there with open arms. As you walk closer to Jesus you notice and feel the presence of all the others standing around you. You feel as if you may not know the angels around you, but there seems to be something familiar about them. Then you realize you are feeling something special from them. Something that you know you have felt before. You realize it is love you are feeling from them. Unconditional love. You feel as if they are looking at you in, awe. You feel so much love as you continue to walk to Jesus that you almost cannot contain yourself. You feel as if the people around you are looking at you without judgment and with so much appreciation for things you may have done in their life or in the life of one of their loved ones here on earth. You just do not want this feeling to go away because it is so inviting to your soul and you are so happy.<br /><br />Now in this same picture imagine the scene a little different. This time you are the angels in this picture in the crowd looking on to someone coming into the presence of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You are the one in awe, without judgment, and you feel so much appreciation for that person and the part they have played in either your life when you were here on earth, or in the life of one of your loved ones when they were on this earth. This is the eternal perspective.<br /><br />How can we play and be a part of that familiar setting we just felt? Could we do this by seeing the potential in others through our perceptions and perspective? Now, I know all these words came to my mind to say today because my Heavenly Father has blessed me with the strength and experiences to learn what I personally need to work on. In fact, I was driving into work early one morning as I was having all these thoughts about looking at others through Heavenly Fathers eyes and not judging others, when I was given an opportunity to do just that. I came up on a four-way stop where three cars were waiting their turn. As each took their turn there was one driver just sitting there and not taking his turn or looking up. He just sat there. As it appeared to me he may have been looking at his phone. It was past his turn to go but he was not moving. So I started to pull forward to make eye contact. "Hmm..." I thought. "I wonder if everything is okay."<br /><br />I started driving through the intersection and then stopped in front of his car. He looked up and I mouthed, "Are you okay?" He seemed annoyed, by my perception, for his reaction was with his hand and he mouthed to me, "Just drive through". The next thought into my head was "Really? That is not a parking lot. That is a stop sign."<br /><br />"Oops," I immediately said to myself. That is not looking at him in an eternal perspective. Maybe he is lost. Maybe he just felt the need to say a silent prayer. Give him the benefit of the doubt. So you see I am the one that needs to work on this whole concept the most, but I am thankful I have the opportunities to try and try again.<br /><br />Perhaps this talk was mostly written because of the things I needed to be reminded of and what better way than to be asked to search, ponder, and pray and teach something that you need the most. I hope that we all can learn something from the things shared today, and look at others and ourselves in an eternal perspective&mdash;to see ourselves, neighbors, friends, family members, and strangers the way our Heavenly Fathers sees them. Practice right now, knowing and believing that everything I need to go through has a purpose and is carving my life into something beautiful, if I allow those opportunities to become a better person. Showing our Heavenly Father that through our challenges or trails we will be faced with can be looked through the eternal perspective lens. And that we can look at them as ways we can strengthen ourselves and others.<br /><br />Heavenly Father makes no mistakes but we do and because of that He sent His Only Begotten Son to die for our mistakes, and to make us stronger in the process. As we strive to become everything our Heavenly Father sees and believes that we can become we will be happier and feel His love more abundantly. We will know that Jesus is the Christ; that we are sons and daughters of a living God. We can make a difference in this life, and we will make it to see his glorified body. I believe this with all my heart, might, mind and soul in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a pioneer&rsquo;s heart that enabled the Lord to gather His Saints at the opening of this dispensation. Those early pioneers brought a spirit of frugality, a faith and optimism for the unknown, a longing for prophetic direction, and a spirit of personal sacrifice to their trek west. It was those same attributes that allowed the Lord to reveal the ideas and innovations needed to gather His people. For the pioneers, innovation started with vanguard companies and wagon trains. Later developments included handcart companies and the Perpetual Emigration Fund. These subsequent advancements were different in design and less familiar than the earlier innovations, but they allowed many more Saints to gather to&nbsp;Zion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BYU-Idaho we draw on that same pioneer&rsquo;s heart, a gift of the early settlers who came to this valley and eventually founded this college. The pioneer&rsquo;s heart has been preserved by the Lord in the very location of this campus. It has been carefully cultivated in the Spirit of Ricks.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Regardless of its origin, the pioneer&rsquo;s heart was held in this valley &ldquo;for such a time as this&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;when the Lord would significantly expand His educational gathering across the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 21, 2000, President Gordon B. Hinckley announced the creation of a new university,<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;stating: &ldquo;BYU-Idaho will operate on an expanded year-round basis, incorporating innovative calendaring and scheduling while also taking advantage of advancements in technology which will enable the four-year institution to serve more students.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, a pioneering faculty and staff created a three-track calendar, the BYU-Idaho Learning Model, and an unambiguous student-centered culture. They developed a cohort-based online curriculum and launched the global Pathway program to open educational opportunities across the Church. Since President Hinckley&rsquo;s announcement, the number of students at BYU-Idaho has tripled even as the relative cost per student has declined<sup>5</sup>&mdash;a miracle within the Church and a model for &ldquo;rethinking education&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;more generally. Let me pause to thank my colleagues on the faculty and staff. None of this would have been possible without your sacrifice, dedication, and effort. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has declared, &ldquo;What you are undertaking [at BYU-Idaho] . . . is virtually unprecedented in the world of higher education. You are making your own inspired, pioneering journey.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And as Elder David A. Bednar has said, &ldquo;The creation of BYU-Idaho is one of the most important educational events of the Restoration.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we remain on a &ldquo;steady, upward course&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;of growth and discovery. We face a dual challenge: to continue to strengthen our core campus experience, even as we pioneer new ways to reach students around the world. Quoting President Henry B. Eyring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible to serve world needs as well as those of our local students if those who come here have a personal self-discipline and . . . a spirit of sacrifice.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me first address this campus. One of the hallmarks of BYU-Idaho is the personal investment of faculty who unapologetically build their professional focus on teaching and advising students. That this institution has been able to expand so dramatically while preserving this individual attention is a testament to the university&rsquo;s design and to the character of the faculty. I see the faculty&rsquo;s love for students leading to greater discovery in instructional strategy, measurement, and learning from peers. I see a faculty creating innovative curriculum at the intersection of disciplinary depth and instructional excellence. I see the scholarship of learning and teaching at BYU-Idaho increasingly reaching a wider community of practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must remember that being student centered goes beyond simply being teaching oriented. Providentially, BYU-Idaho&rsquo;s founding design included an emphasis on applied learning. Under President David A. Bednar, university-wide internship and activities programs were developed. The already high levels of participation in these programs can be further expanded and more tightly connected to our academic programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a temptation in higher education to fall back on approaches that, while professionally familiar, may ironically detract from meeting <em>students&rsquo;</em> needs. We must consistently ask, &ldquo;Why are we doing this, and are there ways of doing it better?&rdquo; For example, applied degrees that are not bachelor&rsquo;s centric will benefit many of our students.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Separately, we must develop more rigorous and holistic ways to measure and track student outcomes. Clearly, some of those efforts will be academic. But if we are truly student centered, we must also be able to strengthen student outcomes that include life skills, career stewardship, family life, and spiritual leadership.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, let me speak to the needs of students who will never physically come to Rexburg. If designed correctly, the innovations on campus and online will be mutually reinforcing. Our online organization has the responsibility to learn from the campus experience. Our campus faculty will, in turn, bless students they will never meet through the curriculum and course content they create for online students. But even as we draw on the principles, outcomes, and spirit of the campus, we must avoid the temptation to impose the exact pattern of a campus model with online students who may have very different needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, as with <em>classroom</em> instruction, we must strengthen the scholarship of learning and teaching for <em>online</em> instruction. Similarly, curricular innovations that are less bachelor&rsquo;s centric, including certificates and applied associate degrees, will benefit numerous campus students. However, for many of our online students, these programs may be their <em>primary</em> academic experience. The university must develop formal and informal capabilities to understand the needs of non-campus students. Finally, as online learning continues to expand, we will need to amplify opportunities for local gathering in centers of strength around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we reflect on the need to continue to build both our campus and our online programs, we must recognize the implications of a university with increasing reach and scope across the Church. It is incumbent upon BYU-Idaho to continue to find ways to expand its reach while <em>decreasing</em> relative costs to the Church. Moreover, part of our responsibility will be to work beyond the boundaries of the university itself. We must increasingly look for ways to collaborate with other entities within the Church Educational System, across LDS membership, and even in missionary work. The Lord will reveal the pattern for this to happen, but the university must continue to prepare its heart in ways that will allow it to be a resource to a worldwide Church.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Kim B. Clark often summarized the mission of BYU-Idaho as developing disciple leaders.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;President Eyring has said that &ldquo;every innovation, every change, [should be] measured against this test of the heart.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;To build disciple leaders in the last days,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;we must help our students have the conviction to stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ. We must also teach the doctrine of the family with increasing force and application, for &ldquo;marriage is more than something personal&mdash;it is a [&lsquo;post of responsibility&rsquo;], an office&rdquo;<sup>17</sup>&mdash;a disciple&rsquo;s covenant. Our students must understand the principle of moral agency and learn how to act and not be acted upon.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Finally, disciple leaders will need to understand and apply the Atonement in their lives. These attributes of disciple leadership will increasingly prepare our students to fulfill Jacob Spori&rsquo;s prophetic vision: &ldquo;The seeds we&rsquo;re planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, BYU-Idaho&rsquo;s influence on the world will continue unabated through the lives and impact of its graduates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the painting by Minerva Teichert entitled: &ldquo;Handcart Pioneers,&rdquo; we see both our past and our future as the pioneers enter the valley. Looking back, may we remember the pioneer&rsquo;s heart that enabled the BYU-Idaho educational gathering to commence. Looking forward, may we recognize the purpose for our gathering as we work together to build disciple leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that the Savior lives and that He loves each of us. It is through His Atonement that we can change and become more than who we are today. I pray for a pioneer&rsquo;s heart and ask for the Savior&rsquo;s mercy and enabling power in this responsibility. We are blessed by living prophets who lead and guide this Church and this university. The gospel has been restored on the earth today, and BYU-Idaho is part of that great work, I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, dear friends, distinguished guests.&nbsp;I am pleased and grateful that President Monson has allowed me to celebrate with you the inauguration of President Clark G. Gilbert as the sixteenth president of Brigham Young University-Idaho and as the new leader of this great university. President Gilbert has served at BYU-Idaho very effectively since he took office last April. This inaugural ceremony confirms the confidence of the Board of Trustees as it officially inaugurates his presidency today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Clark Gilbert, this is a great institution over which you preside. We welcome you into the family of institutions that are known as the Church Educational System. We are confident that you will follow the trail marked by your distinguished predecessors and move BYU-Idaho forward and upward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have known, worked with, and learned from President Kim B. Clark since you both were at Harvard University. Some years ago President Clark even brought you to BYU-Idaho to help with some key projects in preparing the university for the future. The First Presidency didn&rsquo;t let you stay here very long because we needed you in Salt Lake&mdash;but now you are back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we also honor President and Sister Clark for their many accomplishments as they led BYU-Idaho for the past ten years. Their educational ideals and achievements, spiritual and temporal, will always be fixed at the heart of this University and its worldwide family of students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho students come from all parts of the United States and from across the world to receive an excellent education that will be spiritually strengthening, intellectually enlarging, and character building. This education will lead students to embrace lifelong learning and service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proud of our faculty, staff, and administration who work together in an exemplary way to see that these objectives are realized.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Ricks College became BYU-Idaho. Let me quote from the official statement of that day: &ldquo;Ricks students currently number about 9,000... BYU-Idaho will operate on a year-round basis. No large increases in enrollment are expected. Minimal changes to physical facilities are expected [in the near future].&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say that this was at least a slight understatement of the future of this great institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total enrollment is now more than 43,000 (including online and Pathway students). I am told that this is the largest group of students among its BYU sister institutions. In these fifteen years the Rexburg Idaho Temple and the BYU-Idaho Center were built, the Manwaring Center was expanded, and many other wonderful physical facilities have been added that have a direct impact on the daily life of this great university. What a great development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course all these wonderful accomplishments cost money. In our meetings as Board of Trustees and Church Board of Education we are always reminded by our dear Prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, that these resources come from the tithing funds of the Church. They are sacred. They represent the widow&rsquo;s mite as well as the rich man&rsquo;s tithe. We need to be cognizant of that and the need to be prudent, careful, wise and always eager to seek the Lord&rsquo;s guidance on how to use these sacred funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worldwide Church has grown to a vast family of more than 15 million members. Many of our young people would love to come and study at a Church university. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate all of them. Each year this challenge grows and becomes more acute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We teach our church membership the importance of education in their lives. The Lord was clear when He instructed His people,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily I say unto you, my friends, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>Helping our members to live up to these instructions from the Lord is a challenge which constantly demands our attention, and one for which we do not have an adequate answer yet. We are grateful for the tremendous seminary and institute programs which are all a part of our world-wide educational effort. We recognize that today&rsquo;s challenges cannot be solved with yesterday&rsquo;s tools. We are very grateful for the inspiring innovations we have seen in past years like the Pathway program, online learning, learning model, and the balanced tracks. These are efforts in the right direction, but we must not forget that the foundation for past and for future innovations must always be grounded in divine gospel truth and the inspired charted course of Church education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my childhood and teenage years we lived in an area without seminary or institute. Later as parents, it was our responsibility to teach seminary and institute to our children in our home. When I was 15 the first temple outside the US and Canada was built. It took us many hours of travel to get to this house of the Lord in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very early during the restoration of the gospel the Lord instructed the Church, &ldquo;organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in Rexburg, Idaho, we have this significant university and this beautiful temple right next to each other. How much better can it get?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, my dear students, you are among the favored ones to be part of this great university with a temple in walking distance. May I ask you to always be grateful for the privilege and joy of being part of this wonderful institution, whether it be as student, faculty or staff. This gratitude can best be shown by daily living gospel principles, respecting one another, learning and working hard, building strong individuals and families as described in the plan of happiness. Remember to always have a current temple recommend and attend the house of the Lord regularly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As President Hinckley once said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Brigham Young University-Idaho] represents an important part of the overall responsibility of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to assist the Almighty in bringing to pass His work and His glory, in leading His children to immortality and eternal life. &hellip; [Recognizing the plan of salvation] inherently leads to the recognition that all men are brothers [and sisters] &hellip;The great overriding objective of this University must be to lead the minds of youth in the discovery of those great unchanging principles which come from a loving Father [in Heaven] for their blessing and happiness now and forever.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert, we are grateful that you have responded to the invitation to come and preside over this wonderful institution of higher education. You are well qualified and you have been well prepared. All of your past experience has led to this opportunity.</p>
<p>You grew up in Arizona. You served a mission in Japan. You studied at BYU, Stanford, and Harvard. You taught at Harvard. You have worked with President Kim Clark at BYU-Idaho. You have built our own Deseret Digital Media and you have greatly strengthened our Deseret Management Corporation. Besides all these impressive accomplishments you served in the Church as a bishop, in a stake presidency, and as a youth leader.&nbsp;Whenever you are asked what you love most, on top of that list is always your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no surprise to anyone who has met your wife, Christine, and your eight wonderful children. Christine was raised in Provo, graduated from BYU, taught elementary school in California, and was also an early morning seminary teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gilberts are a fun family. I remember one day when I was returning from a hike on the Bonneville Shoreline trail near Salt Lake City. It was a quiet summer morning when I saw a large group of people coming up the hill. From the distance they appeared a little like the people of Israel &ndash; you could hear them well and they were moving steadily, forward and upward. It was the Gilbert family - Clark, Christine, their children and many, many friends. This family is impressively strong, united, happy and focused. For me, they are an authentic LDS family who are living the gospel - and living it joyfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Clark Gilbert, for a season the Lord has placed the destiny of this institution in your hands. This remarkable school had its beginning during humble pioneer years. It is now heading into a period often described as the days of the new American university. You are particularly well prepared and suited for leading this university during such a time. Some describe you as a visionary. At Harvard you studied disruptive innovation. Here at BYU-Idaho you helped to establish an innovative approach to online learning. This university and all the schools of our Church Educational System must prepare for further worldwide growth of membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its resulting educational needs. Please work closely with your sister schools. One hundred years ago Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote that we &ldquo;will find a surprising harmony between the Gospel and all discovered truth.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert, follow the charted course of Church education. Help students and faculty build their lives around a strong testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is by faith in God, our Heavenly Father, and by the Spirit of Christ that we can recognize what is good and true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness that the hand of the Lord has guided and prospered this university and its leaders. God will continue to do so.</p>
<p>President Gilbert, dear Christine, dear Gilbert family, welcome to BYU-Idaho. We love you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you begin this exciting journey, I invoke a blessing of the Lord upon you. I invoke a blessing upon this faculty, upon all your associates and staff. I invoke a blessing upon our precious students who come here year after year. I invoke a blessing upon this beloved Brigham Young University-Idaho, that its influence for good will spread throughout the world and God&rsquo;s purposes will be fulfilled. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To President Uchtdorf and the other brethren and sisters from Salt Lake joining us today, we admire and respect you so much and are grateful for your presence at this inaugural event at BYU-Idaho. Also, to the faculty and staff from BYU-Idaho, we are so grateful for your commitment to the students and to the mission of this university. President Gilbert will address this today in his inaugural message, but both of us remain in awe of your dedication, sacrifice, and leadership. And of course to our dear family and friends, we love you and are grateful to be with you today. Our parents planted a love in us for learning, and for Church Education in particular, that began long before this appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are so grateful for all of you and for your investment and impact in our lives. Indeed, this day feels very much like our wedding day, almost 22 years ago in the Salt Lake Temple. Our parents and dearest friends are all here. And like that day, Clark and I are once again asked to speak briefly before hearing from Elder Holland. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been just 8 months since we sat outside President Uchtdorf&rsquo;s door in the Church Administration Building wondering &ldquo;why are we here?&rdquo; We wondered whether it was an assignment to serve in the mission field or a change at Deseret Management Corporation. But we had no idea it would be a call to return to Rexburg and the work of Church Education that we love so much. The counsel we received that day from President Uchtdorf was short and similar to subsequent counsel from President Nelson, who was then serving as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Church Board of Education. Their counsel was simply: &ldquo;Put your family in front of the students.&rdquo; We have pondered that counsel and reflected deeply about the tremendous opportunity and responsibility it is for our family. President Uchtdorf, please know this is something that President Gilbert and I, and our children, take very seriously and want to magnify to the best of our ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have thought about this charge, impressions have come about how to teach the doctrine of the family to the students. Through spending time in the scriptures, studying conference talks, and participating in student forums and campus home evenings, we have felt strong feelings about how we can teach these doctrines through both word and deed. We know that the Lord is trying to teach the young people of the Church the joy that is possible in families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</em>, we read: &ldquo;Family is central to the Creator&rsquo;s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I have a testimony of this doctrine. I know it is true. We all have the opportunity as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ to be defenders of this doctrine. As Sister Bonnie Oscarson has said in a recent conference address: &ldquo;Everyone, no matter what their marital circumstance or number of children, can be defenders of the Lord&rsquo;s plan. . . If it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s plan, it should also be our plan!&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this moment in time, I have found myself in a unique opportunity to stand as a defender of marriage, of motherhood, and of family to the students at BYU-Idaho. I love being a mother to James, Paige, John, Emma, Mary, Grace, Lucy, and Claire. Even as I am called upon to support university functions and events, I am a mother first and foremost. I pledge my devotion and commitment to you this day and leave you with my testimony as I bear witness that Heavenly Father lives and loves each of us. His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want to thank Clark and Christine for organizing this belated wedding luncheon so that I would be able to attend. You see it was 21 years, seven months and three days ago&mdash;February 5, 1994&mdash;that I had the great privilege of sealing Clark and Christine in the Salt Lake Temple. However, I was not able to attend the wedding luncheon and in fact almost didn&rsquo;t make it to the sealing itself as I remember. I have told the Gilberts all these years how disappointed I was not to join in the festivities that day; they in turn have always said they would make it up to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But really, kids&mdash;all of this? Just for me? I apologize to President Uchtdorf, Elder Oaks and all the rest of you for the extraordinary effort that has been put into this inauguration just so we could have that long promised luncheon. But what a tribute to Clark and Christine&rsquo;s tenacity that they would go to such lengths, including looking for a new job, just to be kind to me. You shouldn&rsquo;t have done it but obviously I am impressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At our luncheon today there is a special guest whom I would like to acknowledge. She is part of the official Gilbert party but I want to claim at least part of her. Janet, would you stand up. Folks this is Janet Calder. She is Christine&rsquo;s aunt, a sister to Christine&rsquo;s father, Jim. She is famous enough for all that she has helped Clark and Christine grow up to do, but Elder Oaks and I claim her because she served as personal secretary to both of us during our years at BYU in Provo. She also served three presidents after us&mdash;Presidents Lee, Bateman and Samuelson. And make no mistake about it&mdash;everyone on that campus knew who you were to talk to if you really wanted to know what was happening at the university. You had to go over to the president&rsquo;s office to do it, but it wasn&rsquo;t to talk to the president&mdash;it was to talk to Janet. She was the de facto CEO of the university, so Clark when your back is to the wall and you don&rsquo;t know which way to leap, pick up the phone and call Aunt Janet. She has seen university presidents leap every possible way they can leap, so she will have plenty of options for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share just a few informal pieces of advice with you, President Gilbert. We are so proud of you and know how successful you will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, always remember whose university this is. That temple, which is virtually an integral part of the physical plant of this campus, will be a bright and beautiful, constant reminder of why we have this school, what we want for the students who come here, and what your real measures of success will be. This university exists as a gift from the faithful tithe payers of this Church, including millions of them who will never set foot on this campus let alone enroll as a student here. We have an obligation to them and to the prophets of God who account for that tithing that the school will always teach, defend, stand for and represent the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church He has restored to the earth in these latter days. Always remember whose university this is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, lean into the wind. As commissioner of education I used to come here and kid the faculty that they all walked around campus at a 45-degree angle. They said that was because in Rexburg you have to &ldquo;lean into the wind&rdquo; to keep from getting blown away, and inasmuch as the wind blows in all directions simultaneously, everyone walks at a 45-degree angle regardless of where they are going. President Gilbert, winds will blow during your administration. Welcome them, face them, and lean into them. They will be carrying opportunities to you with every gust. Far be it from me to touch on a point of aviation with President Uchtdorf here but if I am not mistaken, a pilot always wants to take off and land &ldquo;into the wind.&rdquo; Ironically, that is how a plane gets its lift and the pilot keeps control. On a tough day, remember that the Jaredites in the Book of Mormon endured furious winds that tossed their new barges about, but those were winds which came forth &ldquo;out of my mouth&rdquo; said the Lord, and they blew toward the promised land. When winds blow, President Gilbert, welcome them as coming from the mouth of the Lord. &nbsp;Lean into them and seize the opportunities there. They, too, will lead to the promised land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, enjoy this assignment. Savor every minute of it. It is a great privilege to preside here and the blessings will far outweigh the burdens. Be happy. Keep that terrific Clark Gilbert smile. Be thankful for the opportunity. Make it the happiest time of your marriage and family life. These years won&rsquo;t come again so embrace them, magnify them, and remember them long after a comparable group of Church leaders not unlike ourselves come to release you at some future day. Be of good cheer always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me conclude my little portion of the day&rsquo;s activities by quoting John Masefield, England&rsquo;s poet laureate during the difficult days of World War II. It was a time when individuals, communities and entire nations were looking for something to cling to, something to believe in, something to cast light into the dark shadows of war. In that challenging time and setting he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university. They give to the young in their impressionable years, a bond of the lofty purpose shared, of a great corporate life whose links will not be loosed until they die. They give young people that close companionship for which youth longs and that chance for the endless discussion of the things which are endless, without which youth would seem a waste of time. There are few earthly things more splendid than a university. In these days of broken frontiers and collapsing values, when the dams are down and the floods are making misery, when every future looks somewhat grim and every ancient foothold has become something of a quagmire, wherever a university stands, it stands and shines. Wherever it exists the minds of men urged on to full and fair inquiry may still bring wisdom into human affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God bless you, Clark and Christine, to bring wisdom into human affairs and into the kingdom of God of which you and this university are a magnificent part, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters. On behalf of the Faculty Association, I am grateful for the opportunity to welcome President Gilbert and his family back to Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One purpose of the Faculty Association is to facilitate constructive communication and collaboration between the university administration and the faculty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our first meeting with you, President Gilbert, one goal of the executive board was to address that purpose. However, you arrived with a different aim. After extending your smile and hand in an enthusiastic greeting, you looked each of us in the eye and asked to learn about us, individually. Moreover, you expressed a genuine concern for the faculty as a whole. Your dedication to the faculty was shown in both word and action as our twenty-minute meeting stretched on for nearly an hour while your assistant kindly attempted to move you on to other tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through your example, we were reminded that as faculty, we are not here merely to teach classes, but to love individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Walt Whitman wrote, &ldquo;The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert, we support you in a shared purpose to expand the universe of BYU-Idaho, both collectively and individually. We look forward to working with you to increase the professional engagement of our faculty while inspiring students with immutable spiritual, cultural, and scientific truths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please accept our warmest welcome. We are ready to follow your lead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Ricks College President John L. Clarke stated &ldquo;Ricks was founded upon the firm belief there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past 127 years, our alumni and graduates have proven the validity of President Clarke&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently over 110,000 of our alumni attended this school when it was known as Ricks College.&nbsp; Over the past 15 years, nearly 100,000 more alumni have passed through the halls of Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is true many of our graduates do have extraordinary titles and have received honors and awards, I believe it is more important that our graduates, by-in-large, are extraordinary in those things that matter most&mdash;they are exceptional fathers, mothers, and disciple leaders in their homes, communities, and in the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hallmark of BYU-Idaho, including the Pathway program, is the possibility for the ordinary to blossom and become extraordinary, and as President Henry B. Eyring prophesied, even &ldquo;legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I would not be so bold as to give myself the title of &lsquo;extraordinary,&rsquo; I do know that this school, my teachers, and my classmates helped a shy underachiever gain a testimony of the restored gospel, a desire to serve a mission, and the confidence to succeed in college and the blessings of a happy life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of over 200,000 members of the BYU-Idaho Alumni Association, we extend a special welcome to President Clark G. Gilbert as the 16th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho. We pledge our collective support and look forward to a new era of continued growth and innovation as we strive to perpetuate the &ldquo;Spirit of Ricks.&rdquo; This legacy, which is the Holy Ghost working through the service of caring people, will continue to bless thousands of students on their own paths to extraordinary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters. On behalf of the student body, I am honored to welcome President Gilbert to Brigham Young University-Idaho. This university has been blessed over the years to have many great and inspired leaders.</p>

<p>Students have been coming to Rexburg for generations to be edified and educated. As a result of the emphasis placed on helping each student become a disciple-leader, we have been and continue to become lifelong learners and teachers, and in turn become legendary as prophesied by President Eyring in his address entitled <em>A Steady Upward Course</em>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Gilbert already has that vision of legendary students. As she stated so powerfully in the spring, &ldquo;It is not the greatness of the man or woman, but their willingness to rise to the call that leads to power in the Lord. When we look up and truly understand the call the Lord is extending and let go of our self-focus, the Lord will empower us and make us mighty in His hands.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert, it is easy to see that you truly love your family, and it is undeniable that you also love the Lord and are willing to rise to the call He has entrusted to you. Through your faith the Lord has empowered you, and with your continued diligence you will most certainly be mighty in His hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very grateful for your example and dedication, and are confident the Lord has brought you to BYU-Idaho at this time for a specific purpose. Here you will bless the lives of the students, faculty, and employees in a unique way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful for your willingness to lead. We love you and Sister Gilbert and are ready and willing to follow as the Lord continues to guide this university through you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Today is a very significant day in the history of the Restoration. On September 22, 1827, one hundred and eighty-eight years ago, Joseph Smith received from the angel Moroni the plates from which Joseph translated the Book of Mormon. On this same date four years earlier, following three visitations from Moroni the night before and a fourth visitation from Moroni in the morning, Joseph went to the Hill Cumorah, found and opened the stone box containing the plates, and saw the plates for the first time. On or about this same date until 1827, Joseph returned to the Hill Cumorah to receive "instruction and intelligence" from Moroni preparatory to his receipt of the plates.<br /><br />Last week, my wife, Joyce, and I had the privilege of visiting once again Palmyra, New York. We stood once again in the Sacred Grove where God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith in the spring of 1820.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We visited the reconstructed frontier home of Joseph Smith's youth, and stood in the upper room of that home where Moroni visited Joseph Smith three times in the night. We visited the field where Joseph Smith was visited the fourth time by Moroni. We visited the Hill Cumorah where Joseph found and recovered the Book of Mormon plates under Moroni's direction.<br /><br />Subsequently, Joyce and I traveled to Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>There, we were privileged to witness the dedication of a new Church History site by President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. At this new Church History site, my wife and I visited the reconstructed home of Isaac and Elizabeth Hale, the parents of Joseph's wife, Emma. After Joseph received the Book of Mormon plates, Joseph and Emma left Palmyra and took up residence in this home for a short time. It was in this home that Joseph began translating the plates for the first time, with the assistance of Emma and her brother Reuben.<br /><br />At this site, Joyce and I also visited Joseph and Emma's first home of their own, reconstructed in its original place on the Hale farmstead. Purchased by Joseph and Emma from Emma's parents, this home was the place where Joseph translated most of the Book of Mormon. Joyce and I also visited the wooded place where John the Baptist gave Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, and the place in the Susquehanna River where Joseph and Oliver baptized themselves with Aaronic Priesthood authority. In these same general precincts, other sacred events occurred, including the visitation of Peter, James, and John bestowing Melchizedek Priesthood authority on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and Joseph's receipt of revelations that now make up 15 sections of our Doctrine and Covenants.<br /><br />Having visited in recent days these important sites in the history of the Restoration and having been in the company of one of the Lord's special witnesses of the Restoration, I come to you today with a deeper spiritual witness of a fundamental claim of the Lord's restored gospel, namely that the heavens are open again. As in times past, God in Heaven is speaking again to man on earth. As Joseph Smith proclaimed to the early Church, "Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven!; and a voice of truth out of the earth; ... a voice of gladness for the living and the dead ... how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>With this renewed witness of the heavens being open again, and on this day of repeated angelic ministration in our history, I desire to teach and testify today regarding the reality of the heavens being open again to mankind. Drawing from the revelations given to Joseph Smith and others, I desire to share doctrines and principles, which if accepted and practiced, will allow the heavens to open up to you, and allow you to hear in your life the voice of gladness, the voice of mercy, the voice of glory, which is the voice of the Lord.<br /><br />In my 18th year of life, I was approaching the time that young men in the Church are expected to serve full-time missions. I had grown up in an active LDS family, and I had heard the President of the Church, then Spencer W. Kimball, declare that every young man should serve a mission. Yet, as the time of my serving a mission approached, I was uncertain whether I should serve. I simply could not say for myself that the Church was true, and if I could not say it for myself, I did not feel I should say it to others.<br /><br />One evening, I was sitting in my bedroom pondering my circumstances. I had recently finished reading the Book of Mormon for the first time, but doing so had not caused me to feel any differently about the Church. As I sat pondering in my bedroom my desire to know whether the Church was true, a thought came to me: "Read the Joseph Smith story."<br /><br />Responding to the thought, I opened the Joseph Smith story and read it earnestly for the first time. I read of a young man, not much different from me in age, who found himself in a state of confusion on the subject of religion. He described a "war of words and tumult of opinions" among the religionists of his day, which left him uncertain on which of all the parties was right. "What is to be done?" I read him asking himself. "Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?."<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup>As I read Joseph's description of his circumstances, I felt that Joseph's story was my story. I too was confused and uncertain on the subject of religion, and how to act I did not know.<br /><br />I continued to read that Joseph came upon a verse in the Bible inviting him to pray. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally ... and it shall be given him."<sup><sup><sup>3</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;I read how Joseph said that this verse penetrated his heart with great force, and finally moved him to do as directed, that is ask God. I read how Joseph retired to a quiet wood near his home, knelt down, and offered up the desires of his heart to God.<sup><sup><sup>4</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;And I read how in response, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and answered his heart-felt prayer.<br /><br />After reading Joseph's account, I knew that I needed to do the same thing that Joseph had done. I needed to pray. I did not have a quiet wood to go to. I had only the quiet of my bedroom. I therefore closed the door, knelt at my bedside, and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God, not knowing what the outcome might be. I had prayed before, but not like this. As Joseph had described his prayer in the Sacred Grove, this was my first vocal prayer on a subject of intense and personal interest to me. On this occasion, my prayer went something like this: "Heavenly Father, if you are really there, and if Jesus is really your Son and the Savior of the world, and if Joseph Smith really saw the two of you, would you please, please tell me?"<br /><br />Almost immediately, I had a feeling come over me that was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my life up to that point. It was a feeling of love that entered into my heart and consumed my entire being. With it came an assurance to my mind that infused my whole being with a profound peace. So overwhelmed was I that I began to weep -- not out of fear, but out of joy. In this moment, the intense feelings of love and peace that were filling my soul delivered to me knowledge and intelligence that are more deep and enduring than can be obtained through the physical senses alone. Without seeing, touching, or hearing, I knew that there is a God in heaven, that He is my Father, that Jesus Christ is His Son and the Savior of mankind, and that Joseph Smith saw them both, just as he reported.<br /><br />As the intensity of this experience abated, I wiped the tears from my eyes, and sat myself on my bed to reflect on what had happened. God the Father had answered my prayer. He loved me. I now had a witness from Him regarding fundamental truth claims of the Church. I felt such profound gratitude for having this witness, and I felt a great responsibility to act on that witness. Thereafter, I served a full-time mission. I married in the temple. And I have tried to remain true to this witness from that moment to the present hour.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Revelation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>From this and other sacred experiences in my life, I know that the heavens are open. I know that they are open not only to the prophets; they are open to every child of our Father in Heaven. However, for the heavens to open up to the sons and daughters of God, they must understand and follow certain principles.<br /><br />In saying this, I do not want to suggest that divine revelation can be produced at will. We are not in a position to demand, compel, or constrain anything from heaven. Such words do not describe our privileges with the heavens. All we can do is establish the conditions in our lives that may move the Lord to speak to us, when and as He wishes. We must always remember that God opens the curtains of His heaven and speaks to us "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will."<sup><sup><sup>5</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup>That said, what are the conditions that need to exist in our lives for the Lord to part the curtains of heaven and speak to us? What are the fundamental principles of revelation? I will identify four.<br /><br /><strong>1.&nbsp;Exercise Faith in God our Father</strong></p>
<p>First, you must exercise faith in God our Father. You must believe that He is there to hear you, and that He loves you enough to want to answer your prayers. Without such faith you will not be moved to pray, and without prayer the curtains of heaven will remain closed to you.<br /><br />Some might ask, "How can I have faith in One from whom I have never heard?" In the language of Alma, "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things . . . if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen [or yet known], which are true."<sup><sup><sup>6</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;At a minimum, you must simply "desire to believe" and "let this desire work in you" such that you are willing to "experiment" on the word of God and try to pray.<sup><sup><sup>7</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup>In this regard, it helps to "desire to believe" that the One to whom you are directing your prayer is a loving, personal Father in Heaven. As the Bible dictionary suggests, most difficulties with prayer arise from a failure to exercise sufficient belief in the "relationship in which we stand toward God, namely God is our Father, and we are his children."<sup><sup><sup>8</sup></sup></sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In teaching his followers to pray, Jesus encouraged just such a belief. Said He: "What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"<sup><sup><sup>9</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><strong>2.&nbsp;Sincerely Inquire of God</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Second, you must sincerely inquire of God. By this I mean that you must actually call upon the name of the Lord, speaking to Him out-loud and asking of Him what you desire. To his disciples in Jerusalem, Jesus said: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."<sup><sup><sup>10</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;Jesus gave the same counsel to his disciples in Bountiful. "For everyone that asketh, receiveth; he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened," He said to them.<sup><sup><sup>11</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;And at the outset of the Restoration, the Lord reiterated again and again the same counsel. As Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery commenced the work of translating the Book of Mormon, the Lord said to them: "If you will ask ofme, you shall receive; if you will knock, it shall be opened unto you."<sup><sup><sup>12</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;This instruction was, of course, the same that Joseph had found in the first epistle of James and that had moved him to go to the Sacred Grove to pray.<br /><br />It has been said that there is no more common instruction in all of scripture than to call upon God our Father and ask of Him what you desire. This instruction, invariably accompanied by the promise that God will answer, is strong evidence of Heavenly Father's deep love for us and His readiness to provide us His counsel and wisdom on all issues of concern to us. But, our Father's love for us and His readiness to answer our prayers should not be understood to mean that we need to provide little to no effort in securing answers from Him. God our Father intends for us to grow and progress to become more like Him. Thus, He provides us His counsel and wisdom only after we give substantial effort to understanding and addressing the matter of concern we present to Him in prayer.<br /><br />At the outset of the Restoration, the Lord made this point to Oliver Cowdery, as he sought for revelation in Harmony, Pennsylvania. "[Y]ou have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me . . . [B]ehold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me."<sup><sup><sup>13</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;Joseph Smith followed this counsel almost instinctively, and we can see the results in his life. Before going to the Sacred Grove, Joseph had given considerable thought and study to the issue of which Church was right and which he should join. And before he began to translate the Book of Mormon, Joseph pondered over and studied carefully the characters on the plates in an effort to understand them. Earnest study and pondering deepens and demonstrates one's sincerity to hear from the Lord, and it makes one's mind and heart more sensitive to and ready for the Lord's eventual answer.</p>
<p>In addition, we demonstrate our sincerity when calling upon the Lord by being committed to act as He directs. Again, Joseph Smith is our example. Joseph did not go to the Sacred Grove and pray simply to find out which church was right. He wanted to find out from God which church he should join. Knowing what was right was a pre-condition to doing what was right. "My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of the sects was right," Joseph said, "that I might know which to join . . . I [therefore] asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right . . . and which I should join."<sup><sup><sup>14</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;This was not a casual curiosity for Joseph; he was committed to act.<br /><br />&nbsp;Indeed, Joseph was committed to act on whatever he received from God, even if it was contrary to his own expectations. Remember, Joseph's original question to the Lord was "which of all the sects was right." In other words, in going to the Lord Joseph was presuming that one of the religious sects in his day had to be sufficiently right for him to join. As he later observed, "at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong."<sup><sup><sup>15</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;Thus, for the Lord to tell Joseph that he "must join none of [the sects], for they were all wrong" must have come as a great surprise to him. Yet, Joseph acted on what the Lord told him to do, notwithstanding all the subsequent difficulty it posed to him.<br /><br /><strong>3.&nbsp;Earnestly Listen for God's Voice</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The third principle of having the heavens open to you is to earnestly listen for the voice of the Lord.<br /><br />As often as the Lord and his prophets enjoin us to call upon God, equally often, if not more so, is the scriptural injunction to listen for and hear the voice of the Lord. There is perhaps no more powerful example of this than Joseph Smith's experience in the Sacred Grove. When the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph in response to his sincere prayer, our Father said to Joseph: "This is my Beloved Son, Hear Him!"<sup><sup><sup>16</sup></sup></sup>Note well our Father's injunction to Joseph, and to all of us who accept Joseph's account&mdash;hear my Son, listen to Him, give ear to Him, hearken to His voice. Over and over again, the Lord and his prophets repeat this command. In this regard, it is significant to note that the very first word in the Lord's preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, our collection of modern-day revelation, is "hearken." "Hearken, O ye people of my church ... hearken ye people from afar ... listen together."<sup><sup><sup>17</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup>Where and how might we find the voice of the Lord? His voice may be found in three ways. First, the voice of the Lord may be heard in the voice of His servants. Before the Church was even organized, the Lord said to Joseph Smith in Harmony, Pennsylvania: "this generation shall have my word through you."<sup><sup><sup>18</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;A year later, on the day the Church was formally organized the Lord told the members of the Church: "thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments," referring to the presiding elder of the Church, Joseph Smith. "His word ye shall receive, as if from my own mouth, in all patience and faith."<sup><sup><sup>19</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;From such statements, it should be clear to us that, as far as the Lord is concerned, "whether by my own voice, or by the voice of my servants, it is the same."<sup><sup><sup>20</sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup><sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></sup>Second, the voice of the Lord may be heard in the accepted scriptures of the Church, both ancient and modern. Nephi pled with the reader of his writings: "hearken unto these words . . . for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me."<sup><sup><sup>21</sup></sup></sup>&nbsp;Centuries later, the Lord himself affirmed Nephi's statement to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer in Fayette, New York: "these words are not of men nor of man, but of me . . . it is my voice which speaketh them unto you . . . Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words."<sup><sup>22</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Finally, the voice of the Lord may be heard in the ministration of the Spirit directly to one's soul. "[M]y voice is Spirit," said the Lord to Joseph Smith.<sup><sup>23</sup></sup>&nbsp;And, as Nephi taught, the Spirit carries the words of the Lord and his servants "unto the hearts of the children of men."<sup><sup>24</sup></sup>&nbsp;This is enormously important to understand. What this means is that it is the Spirit of the Lord that allows you to hear His voice, whether it be through his servants, through the scriptures, or directly to your soul.<sup><sup>25</sup></sup>&nbsp;Thus, in the final analysis hearing the voice of the Lord depends on discerning the ministration of the Spirit to your soul.<br /><br />So, how does the Spirit minister to the souls of men? At the outset of the Restoration, the Lord answered this vitally important question. In Harmony, Pennsylvania, the Lord told Oliver Cowdery that as often as he had inquired of the Lord, the Lord had given him instruction. The instruction came, He said, through the "enlightening" of Oliver's mind by the Spirit,<sup><sup>26</sup></sup>&nbsp;and by the Lord "speak[ing] peace" to his mind.<sup><sup>27</sup></sup>&nbsp;On another occasion in Harmony, the Lord promised Oliver that he would "receive a knowledge of whatsoever things [he would] ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that [he] would receive."<sup><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;</sup>If he would ask in this manner, the Lord promised Oliver: "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost ... this is the spirit of revelation."<sup><sup>29</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Note how the Lord describes His manner of speaking by the Spirit. He "speaks peace" to the mind. He "enlightens" the mind. And He speaks to the mind and the heart. Other scriptures describe the voice of the Lord as being still, small, mild, and whisper-like, rather than loud, harsh, thunderous, or a tumultuous noise.<sup><sup>30</sup></sup>&nbsp;Reflecting on these scriptures, President Boyd K. Packer once observed: "The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses ... gently."<sup><sup>31</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Now, if the voice of the Lord manifests itself to us in the form of whisper-like thoughts to the mind and gentle feelings to the heart, then if you wish to hear the voice of the Lord you will need to search your mind and heart for such small and quiet impressions in response to sincere petitions to the heavens. While the voice of the Lord does press itself firmly enough on us from time to time to ensure we pay heed, most of the time His voice is so soft and gentle that you will miss it if there is too much distracting noise in your life. Therefore, to hear the voice of the Lord, you need to set aside a time and place of quiet reverence where gentle, delicate impressions of the mind and heart can be felt and discerned. When such impressions come, trust them; this is the Spirit speaking to you.<sup><sup>32</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><strong>4.&nbsp;Act in Faith on What you Receive</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Trusting the gentle, delicate impressions that come to you leads to the fourth principle of opening the heavens to you -- act in faith on what you receive from the Lord.<br /><br />As you begin to receive the voice of the Lord, you will find that He does not reveal to you everything that you want to know, or think you need to know. Rather, you will find that He gives you only what you need to know to take the next step forward. "For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little."<sup><sup>33</sup></sup>&nbsp;Referring to this declaration of the Lord, Elder David A. Bednar has observed that while we may want big answers quickly and all at once, the Lord's pattern for speaking to us is to give us "many small answers over a period of time."<sup><sup>34</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>For example, Nephi did not learn to build the ship that carried him and his family across the great ocean to the promised land all at once; rather, he was shown by the Lord "from time to time after what manner [he] should work the timbers of the ship."<sup><sup>35</sup></sup>&nbsp;Likewise, Joseph Smith did not receive the doctrines and ordinances of the restored gospel all at once; rather, he received them over a period of time with one revelation building on another. In all of this we learn the Lord's pattern for having us grow and develop. Of the Lord himself, the revelations say that He "received not of the fullness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness; and thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first."<sup><sup>36</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>The Lord gives us line upon line, precept upon precept in order to try and prove us.<sup><sup>37</sup></sup>&nbsp;If we faithfully act on what He gives us, we receive more. If we do not, we receive no more, and indeed lose what we once had. "[B]lessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel," the Lord taught Nephi, "for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have."<sup><sup>38</sup></sup>&nbsp;Thus, to have the heavens open to you and to keep them open to you, you must act in faith on what the Lord reveals, no matter how small or meager it may be. Trusting the light you receive and moving forward to the edge of that light will put you in the position of having to ask for more light to illuminate your way. In asking for more, you will receive more, and when you trust what you receive and move forward again to the edge of the light received, you will need to ask and receive and act again. This is the process of receiving "revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge," which is promised to the faithful inquirer of the Lord.<sup><sup>39</sup></sup>&nbsp;It is indeed the process by which you grow from "grace to grace," as the Lord Himself did,<sup><sup>40</sup></sup>&nbsp;and in time acquire the "mind of Christ."<sup><sup>41</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Now, you may ask what you should do if you ask God in faith and earnestly listen for His voice, but do not discern Him speak to you by His Spirit? Here is my answer - proceed with the best judgment you have, while continuing to listen for the voice of the Lord. If you have thoroughly studied the matter of concern to you, have prayed sincerely to the Lord for His guidance, and have sought earnestly to hear the voice of the Lord, which includes studying the Lord's scriptures and seeking the counsel of His servants such as your bishop, then act using the best judgment you have on the matter, while continuing to listen for the voice of the Lord. If you start to move in a direction that is wrong or otherwise injurious to your spiritual welfare, I promise you that the Lord will clearly warn you before you make a serious mistake. You may need to exercise the courage to heed that warning and change your direction, but you can be sure that the warning will come before any spiritual harm occurs. Likewise, if you start to move in a direction that is right, I promise you that the Lord will confirm to you very clearly that you have chosen right and well.<br /><br />Why does the Lord sometimes put us in the position of not hearing clearly from Him before we have to make a decision and act on a matter of concern to us? The answer is again that He desires that we learn to think and judge as He does. We are His children, and His work and glory is to have us become all that He is. Therefore, from time to time our Father will not clearly speak to us, letting us instead exercise our best judgment. If in exercising our best judgment, we choose to act contrary to His mind and will, the Lord will tell us so in a clear and unmistakable way before we act to our detriment. Likewise, if in exercising our best judgment, we choose in accordance with His mind and will, the Lord will confirm to us in due course that we have chosen well. In this manner, the Lord teaches us to think and judge as He does, and helps us acquire the "mind of Christ."<br /><br />My young friends, I know from my own sacred experience, shared in part with you this day, that the heavens are open. I testify that the heavens will open to you as you make Joseph Smith's story your story. Have faith that God is your loving Father in Heaven. Sincerely call upon Him, asking of Him what you most desire. Earnestly listen for His voice, understanding where you may find His voice and how His voice will come to you. When His voice comes to you, act in faith on what He counsels you to do. Pursue this course, and you will grow up in Him and, in due time, become even as He is, "grace for grace."<br /><br />I bear witness of the reality of the Father and the Son, and of the reality of the Restoration initiated by the Prophet Joseph Smith and continued by living prophets and apostles, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I are very grateful to be here, very grateful to have the assignment from the First Presidency and the Twelve to dedicate this facility. As I walked among some of the apartments and entered into one of them, it caused me to reflect upon my own living arrangement when I first entered university at Brigham Young University in Provo. I had great friends; I had great experiences there. Similar to the kinds of experience that young people will have here as they come into these precincts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what I have been thinking about is how sacred that place was for me. It was sacred for a lot of reasons, but principally it was because my testimony deepened and strengthened while I was living in that BYU approved dormitory, as we called it there. And it caused me to think about this verse of scripture from Mosiah 18:30. Reflecting on all the wonderful things that had happened to Alma and his people near the waters of Mormon, this summary statement is made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a forest, or a river, or a student-housing unit, if one comes to know their Redeemer in that place, it is a blessed place forever. It is a place of beauty. It is a place of praise. It is a place that will be forever remembered. And so as I reflect on how that place was for me and reflect on how this place will be for all of those who come here to learn ultimately of the Savior and His truths, both religious and secular, then this place will be praised in this same way that we read of in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful to President and Sister Gilbert for their kindness and their generosity, their warmth of reception to us, to those others who have received us this morning and given us the quick tour of this facility. And I now thank you for joining us as I offer this dedicatory prayer. I invite you to bow your head and to close your eyes as we petition together our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dedicatory Prayer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh God, our Eternal Father, we humbly bow our heads and subdue our spirits as we approach thee in prayer. We acknowledge thy Fatherhood in the heavens. We thank thee for the knowledge that we are thy sons and daughters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful that we have the assurance that we lived with thee before we came here&mdash;that we were loved, cherished, and nurtured. We&rsquo;re grateful for the knowledge that we have that thy Son, Jesus Christ, was there too&mdash;that we knew Him and loved Him, and had the faith in Him that He would come and do what He said He would do to redeem us all from death and sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&lsquo;re grateful that He did come in the meridian of time and that He has come again in the latter times to restore The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We thank thee, oh Father, for the Holy Ghost&mdash;the companion that has been given to us or promised to us through the ordinance of baptism. We&rsquo;re grateful for his guidance, his love, his sweetness, his counsel, his correction; for, in short, his companionship as we move through mortality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We express unto thee our gratitude for prophets and apostles who provide the leadership, the seership, the prophetic voice to us who are looking unto thee in this world. We&rsquo;re grateful, Father in heaven, for the members of this church who have responded to covenants by paying tithes and giving offerings, which permit, oh Father, the construction of this facility and so many others in thy church. We ask thee to bless these faithful tithe payers. We ask thee to bless, particularly the widow, who has given her mite that we might enjoy these things here this day on this campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re grateful, Father in heaven, for the leadership of this university and ask thy blessing to be upon President and Sister Gilbert, and all those who are associated with them that they may be inspired to lead, and guide, and direct the affairs of this university to the betterment of all&mdash;both those who come here to work as well as those who come here to study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask thee, Father in heaven, to bless all who will come here this day and in days to come, that they may come to know thy Son and thee, and come to rejoice in that knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, our Father in heaven, we are gathered here this hour to dedicate unto thee this facility for student housing at Brigham Young University-Idaho. We ask thee to bless this place, in particular, this day. We ask thee to bless the grounds, to keep them beautiful and inviting. We ask thee to bless those who have designed these grounds and constructed these facilities, that they may have joy in their workmanship and gratitude for the privilege of having labored on such a project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask thee to bless those that will manage these grounds, that they will do so with love and kindness; that they&rsquo;ll see in every soul who enters into the doors of these facilities a child of thee, and feel constrained to love, to nurture, and care for each one in such a way that they may feel at peace and comfort and safety here. We ask thee to bless those who will administer these grounds that they will exercise wisdom and good judgment, not only in the days to come, but in all the years that these facilities will stand here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask thee, our Father, to bless the apartments here; to bless the electrical workings, the plumbing, the walls, the roofs, all the physical features of this magnificent facility that they may fulfill their intended purposes; that they may function properly; that they may provide protection against the elements that can be hot and can be cold at times in this environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most particularly, Father, we ask thee to bless every student that will come here and live here. May each who come be reverent and feel that they are entering into sacred precincts. In their reverence, Father, we ask thee to hear their prayers, to answer them, to give them testimony, to help them to love each other, to have respect for each other, and to share the responsibilities that have been outlined for them with regard to each other. We ask thee, Father, that students and faculty and others who come to these grounds will be safe so long as they are used for their intended purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dedicate, now, this facility for the purpose for which it has been constructed; that it may be a place of learning, a place of fasting, a place of prayer, a place of acquired testimony, a place of learning to live with others, and to do so in the manner after the plan of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dedicate these grounds for all of these purposes and thank thee for the privilege of gathering here this day, asking in conclusion that thou wilt preserve and protect these grounds and these facilities for all the decades that lie ahead; that the earth that may shake, and the winds that may blow, and the storms that may come, whether physical or spiritual, will not topple over these grounds, these facilities, or the people who will occupy them and live here. And may in the coming day, they who have been here, will be able to reflect back on their stay here, their residence here, that they have come to know thee and come to know thy Son, and will express gratitude for the many blessings that they have received at thy hands in this place. We invoke these blessings, most humbly, our Father, upon all who are gathered here, will yet gather upon this place. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My Dear Brothers and Sisters, I am honored and humbled to be able to stand at this pulpit today. I've stood here once before when I spoke at my son's high school graduation, and I was about as nervous then as I am now (which is pretty nervous). I'm thankful to have my family here&mdash;my kids, my parents, and in-laws. Their love and support is a constant blessing to me, especially my dear wife Heidi. I will be eternally grateful that, in her single moment of weakness, she agreed to marry me.<br /><br />Preparing for this address has been an amazing season of growth for me, and I pray that even a small portion of what I have felt, and now feel, gets through to you today. I trust that as you open your minds and hearts to the Spirit, that God will help you hear and remember what He intends for you.<br /><br />In Alma chapter 30, Korihor is brought before Alma to defend his reviling of the faith of the people of Zarahemla. Although there is a lot that could be said about this encounter, I want to focus on a key part of Alma's response to Korihor. In verse 40 Alma asks,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only. But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true..."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Please note that crucial phrase, for that is my theme:&nbsp;<em>All things testify that these things are true.</em></p>
<p>When I was younger (well, I still like to sometimes) I enjoyed playing video games. I understand some of you do as well. I discovered fairly early on that game designers loved to put little surprises in their games, so that if you activated a certain subroutine within the game, then a special little something happened. Gamers call these 'Easter Eggs', and nearly every popular game now has them. Sometimes they're additional levels, or a stash of extra coins, or suddenly a rabbit drives a Cadillac across the screen, or your warlike player character busts out a Michael Jackson dance. Sometimes they're obvious and you encounter them in the course of the gameplay and sometimes they're deep within the game and you only find them by intently searching.<br /><br />Well, God did the same thing creating you, the earth, and everything&mdash;in everything He does. Elder Gerald N. Lund called them "divine signatures."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;They're sometimes big and obvious, where He might even say, "For God so loved the world,"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;to make it absolutely clear. And sometimes they're tiny little personal insights, prepared especially for you&mdash;a place in the foundation stones of reality where God signed his work, then waited patiently and lovingly for you to find it. Each one testifies, not only that God exists, or even just that He was involved in creating that thing, but that He loves you. He loves each of us, not only enough to send His Son to atone for our sins, but to build into the fabric of creation, signatures of His presence and love. I would like, today, to point out for you, a couple of these things that I hope you have noticed, or think you should notice, or that I have seen, in hopes that they will help you to come unto Him, stay with Him, remain His true followers, and return to His presence with your family and friends.<br /><br />Now, these places that testify of him are everywhere. Anywhere you look, when you pull back the cloth of the superficial, you see evidence of His handiwork. It's in the earth, in the heavens, in our families, and the way our social and civic structures work. It's in the elements, art and music, and the very fabric of space-time.<br /><br />When I was a kid, Benoit Mandelbrot described a simple mathematical formula that formed repeating and scalable patterns.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The patterns will look the same from every angle and no matter how close you zoom in or out. Then, people began to notice that these fractal geometries appeared in several natural settings as well, like nautilus shells, stock market prices, river deltas, lightning paths, and many others. God's hand in our lives is like that. The patterns that show His love for us are everywhere, and at every scale. Zoom out, and we see it. Zoom in. There it is again. Turn over there. There it is. And well, it's everywhere.<br /><br />First, I would like you to consider the family. The way God designed us to fit together in families, I think, gives us a clear and shining window into His love for us. In our primary program last year, my kids learned the song, "The Family is of God." The first verse goes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our Father has a family, It's me!<br />It's you, all others too: we are His children.<br />He sent each one of us to earth, through birth,<br />To live and learn here in fam'lies.<br />God gave us families to help us become what He wants us to be&mdash;<br />This is how he shares His love, for the family is of God."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I was told in my patriarchal blessing that in learning obedience to my earthly parents that I would also learn obedience to my heavenly parents. I testify this is absolutely true. I have discovered additionally, that my reverence and love for my parents and siblings, as well as my wife and children is a model for the intended relationships we will carry with us into the eternities. The things we experience, the signposts and moments of our lives in our families, can give us insight on earth into how it is in heaven.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Earlier this summer I drove my son down to Provo to drop him off at the MTC. He is our eldest child, and it was just me and him for those four hours since his mom and sisters were at Girls Camp, and the youngest was at Grandma's house. We had a really nice time together on the way down, and we visited together on the steps of the Provo Temple for a few minutes before I dropped him off. We took a picture, had a big hug, shed a tear, and off he went. He didn't look back. I know because I watched him all the way.</p>
<p>I drove away, around the corner and down the street. By the time I got over, adjacent to Lavell Edwards stadium, I was overcome by the grief and pain of the departure of my little boy&mdash;my hiking and climbing buddy, our lawn mower and babysitter, my son. I pulled over, sobbing, unable to see the road in front of me through my tears. I knew what he would be going through. I knew it would be wonderful and hard, exciting and scary, that he needed to experience that, and I knew God would guide and keep him, but I missed him, and it hurt. In this my moment of sorrow, I cried out to my Heavenly Father, "How can I do this?" and He said, so clearly I could hear it, "How do you think I felt when you left?" Pow. It hit me right in my heart. If God loves us like this, sending us to earth, eagerly anticipating our return, hearing my prayers in the same way I can hardly wait for each P-day with its accompanying pictures and precious email&mdash;wow! That's how it works. This experience has become a touchstone for me, a persistent example of things Heavenly Father prepared to remind us of Him, His love for us, and His hand in our lives. All things testify of him.<br /><br />Let me give you a couple of examples more related to my profession as a scientist. Last year I agreed to become part of a three-man team to develop a new foundations of science issues class. We envisioned a course that would start with the Big Bang and go through the steps required to prepare, create, and maintain a habitable planet, using the earth's creation as an example&mdash;a survey of the history of the universe in 13 weeks; piece of cake, right? This semester will be the third time I've taught it, now. Working with Dan Moore of the Geology Department and Brian Tonks of the Physics Department in this class has been a highlight of my career, and I have learned a lot.<br /><br />Let me just point out to you two little testaments: meteorites and granite. When I was younger I had several chances to visit the Smithsonian Museum of Natural Science in Washington, D.C. I vaguely remember there being an exhibit about some geology stuff, but I think I wandered through it quickly and perfunctorily. Well, since then and now, I have studied a ton about how the earth was put together, and it turns out meteorites tell us a lot about the earth's creation. This is so because the original raw materials that formed the early solar system are still around, unchanged, in some of the meteorites that fall to the earth for us to study.<br /><br />Nearly all the rocks on earth have been altered by plate tectonics and erosion over the earth's life. But some of these meteorites are left over from the cloud of gas and dust that four and a half billion years ago became the sun and planets in our solar system. So the chance to study this primordial matter is almost a sacred experience for people who know what they're looking at.<br /><br />Most of this special class of meteorites have even been named, usually either after where they fell, or who discovered and studied them extensively. Remarkably, some have been found to have water, amino acids, and even tiny diamonds in them. Using reliable scientific techniques we can fairly accurately put the age of these meteorites at about the same age as we think the sun turned on.<br /><br />Now, some of the very oldest rocks on earth contain tiny diamond-like crystals called zircons. And zircons are really hard to break down, so that these tiny grains will weather out of rocks on the earth or even be metamorphosed inside the earth without having their internal structure altered. They also can incorporate heavy metals like uranium into their crystal structure, which is cool because uranium is like a natural clock that, because it's radioactive, allows us to date these rocks. (Not to go out with them, but to tell how old they are). And guess what: many of the important and prominent elements and compounds we observe on earth are the same as those we find in meteorites; same structures, same isotopes, same age. So, finding water, carbon, and amino acids in meteorites then gives us clues to how God may have put the earth together, and got oceans and life on the earth.<br /><br />Now, armed with this knowledge, over the summer break we took our family on the grand 6,500-mile road trip of awesomeness. We drove, over 13 days, from Idaho to Maine, to Georgia and back. We had a great time. But, my point...Yes, my point is that this time when we visited the Smithsonian, which I learned holds the best and most comprehensive collection of meteorites in the world, my family literally had to drag me away from that exhibit. I marveled over each carbonaceous chondrite, lunar breccia, and Martian shergottite.<br /><br />"Look!" I exclaimed to my patiently disinterested daughter. "That's the Allende meteorite! Ah, Look at those calcium aluminum inclusions. Oh! Those are olivine crystals in that pallasite. Do you know how rare those are?" In tears I tried to explain to her that those rocks show unique, handwritten signatures of God's love for us. He took of those materials, and created an earth upon which we could dwell<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;because He loves us. For "any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And granite. Do you realize how amazing granite is? Granite is amazing, and not just because it makes almost indestructible counter tops. Granite is a late-inning player in the rock-making game on earth. To produce abundant granite, first you have to separate the original rocky materials from which earth was made into a metallic core, a dense rocky mantle, and a primitive basaltic crust.<br /><br />This means the earth was at one time melted completely enough for this to occur. Later, this basaltic crust partially melted to form lower-density rocks such as granite. Once formed, granite stays on the surface, because it's less dense than the stuff around it. Over time, granitic rocks built the first small continents. The early continents formed the cores of today's continents, which continue to grow even now.<br /><br />If granitic rocks had never formed on Earth, there would be no continents, and without continents life on our planet would have to have taken a much different path&mdash;reptiles, mammals, and humans likely wouldn't inhabit the earth. That little piece of granite often found beneath your feet or decorating your garden, if only you could see, is evidence of God's love for His children; a testimony of His presence; His signature on His handiwork.<br /><br />Our relatively new understanding of all this, growing even now, I'm sure is fulfillment of God's promise to us in the 101st section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day...he shall reveal all things&mdash;Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof&mdash;Things most precious, things that are above, and things that are beneath, things that are in the earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Because&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;things testify of him.</p>
<p>You want more? They're everywhere. Okay, let's look closer at light. Over the Christmas holidays of 1832, and later in the spring of 1833, in the upstairs rooms of the Whitney Store in Kirtland (which we visited on our grand trip of awesomeness) Joseph Smith revealed,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings; Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space&mdash;The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne . . ."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our modern physical understanding of light, which includes all kinds of electromagnetic radiation from radio waves to infrared heat, visible and ultraviolet light and x- and gamma rays, dates back from Newton, Huygens, Hertz and Maxwell, to Young, Einstein, and Feynman&mdash;some of the greatest minds of history.</p>
<p>Light radiates from atoms with extra energy and is absorbed by atoms with lower energies. The quantum mechanical properties of atoms govern what wavelengths of light are emitted, absorbed, and reflected; and the exchange of light moderates the forces experienced by electric charges on each other, the stability of atomic nuclei, and the condensing of matter from light and annihilation of matter into light.<br /><br />The speed of light and matter also governs the passage of time through relativity. Light from the sun is used by plants to create carbohydrates and release oxygen through photosynthesis. Life uses this oxygen and these carbohydrates for energy to move, stay warm, and reproduce. Light being passed back and forth between adjacent atoms can form resonances used in lasers and radios similar to the resonances we rely on to form speech and musical sounds.<br /><br />So Heavenly Father's explanation to the prophet Joseph sounds remarkably close to everything we now understand about the nature and function of light, which Latter-day Saints also understand to have a spiritual aspect, since light and truth are connected&mdash;"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Even our testimonies, gifts from God through His Spirit, which testifies of truth, rely on light, in more than just a figurative way&mdash;for "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And "if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I could go on and on. The physical chemistry of water and its amazing properties testify. The form and function of the human eye and brain testify. The finely tuned relationships of the fundamental forces&mdash;gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces&mdash;testify. If the strength or tension of the Higgs field, which gives matter its mass, the amount of charge on a proton or electron, the gravitational attraction between things, or the speed of light through space-time, were a little stronger or weaker, bigger or smaller, faster or slower, atoms wouldn't hold together and bond into compounds and molecules, galaxies and stars wouldn't form and light the earth, or create the elements we need to make planets and moons and DNA and plants and bones and hearts.<br /><br />Said Paul: "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;his eternal power and Godhead."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;God put all this together in this way because He loves us, so that all things testify of him.<br /><br />I think the structure and functioning of the church also testifies to His love, showing these same kinds of patterns. Quite often people ask me, "So how is it being a bishop?" My usual short answer is, "It's hard." But if you have another minute I will tell you, that my faith has grown immensely these past few years, to where I have absolute trust in my Father in Heaven.<br /><br />As I look back onto my life, I can see the places where Heavenly Father was preparing me for what was coming. Patterns on my mission, in my marriage, my classes at school, my kids, my previous callings, all in hindsight (I can't imagine being able to notice them as I was living through them - mostly they were just hard) all were helping Him explicitly prepare me personally for what He had in store for me, and those testaments are, for me, among the most precious I have. And now, from the moment I was called to be a Bishop, He has never let me down; from calling the right counselors, to helping me know what to say in interviews, to counseling with my dear singles, to preparing for this address.<br /><br />Our fear of disappointing Him, postponing our repentance, is unfounded and needs to be dispensed with promptly. I know this because when I visit with people, when I have His spirit, my keys allow me to feel for them the way He feels, and I never feel any of a spirit of accusation, recrimination, or condemnation. I only feel love.<br /><br />In a devotional address last fall, which I felt was given especially for me as a newly called bishop, my former first counselor Garth Hall said, speaking about his experience as a mission president interviewing his very first incoming missionary,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"About three minutes into the interview something happened. A spiritual feeling came over me; I knew this missionary as well as I had ever known anyone. I had a deep feeling of love for them. That love I can only describe as the kind of the love I have for my own children. I recognized their strengths, weaknesses and more importantly their potential.... This same thing happened each time I interviewed our missionaries. I came to understand one of the powers of priesthood keys is to convey God's love and His personal concern for His children. I would later try to express this by saying, priesthood keys allow you to think things you wouldn't normally think, to see things you wouldn't normally see, to say things you wouldn't normally say, and to feel things you wouldn't normally feel. That was my experience every day of my mission."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This has been my experience in every calling I've held with accompanying keys and I feel sure each leader would testify to the operation of the keys of the priesthood in this manner. God explicitly put together the Church in such a way as to help us each feel His love for us as often and as abundantly as possible.</p>
<p>Recently we travelled with my daughter and the local high school choirs up to Seattle for their annual choir trip. While we were there they performed for the Sunday noon Mass at the Cathedral of St. James, and sang Mack Wilberg's arrangement of "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing." Even though I'd heard that song many times before, they sang it so purely, so beautifully, in that glorious space, as the final words of that hymn washed over me, "Take my heart. Oh, take and seal it. Seal it for thy courts on high,"<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;the words of that prayer were my prayer, and God heard, took my heart and changed it. He accepted my offering, and has touched my life in such a way that I will never be able to deny that He lives, that He knows and loves me, has work for me to do, and eagerly anticipates my faithful return. For all things testify of him.</p>
<p>The lyrics of another of my favorite songs by Sally DeFord complete the circle:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In all thy works I see thy glory<br />In mighty wonders; in small and simple things<br />My heart rejoices in the bounty set before me<br />And my grateful spirit sings<br />Each rising sun tells of thy goodness<br />The rain proclaims thee in the life it brings<br />All creation bears thee sure and silent witness<br />And my grateful spirit sings<br />The stars that crown the realms of space<br />Reflect the image of thy grace<br />The rolling seas, the earth and sky<br />Declare thy pow'r, thy majesty and might<br />I see thy hand in man's compassion<br />Thou art the font of kindness whence it springs<br />Thy boundless charity hath wrought my soul's salvation<br />And my grateful spirit sings<br />For changeless love and endless mercy<br />For countless blessings beyond the wealth of kings<br />For every perfect gift thou sendest, Lord, I praise thee<br />And my grateful spirit sings."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I urge you, I exhort you, to pay attention to the patterns God has left for&nbsp;<em>you</em>, in&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;life, in your studies, in your families, in everything, in all his creation, to testify of His love for&nbsp;<em>you</em>. Record them in your journal, acknowledge them in your prayers, and teach them to your children.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made... And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I know He lives. I know He loves me and that He loves you. He has left testaments for us to that love everywhere, if we know where to look and look with eyes of faith and love. "Yea, ... all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;All things testify of Him, and so do I, with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. I know these things are true. And so witness and testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters. What a tremendous, spiritual feast we experienced this past weekend. How blessed we are to listen to and learn from our dear prophet<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;as well as from the other general authorities and auxiliary leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />I am humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today and I express my gratitude for your attendance. I wish to express my appreciation for the inspiring music that we just heard as well as for the music we are blessed to hear at every devotional. I am so grateful for those who have developed this particular talent that touches the innermost parts of our souls,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and oftentimes bring me to tears. I would also like to thank those who work behind the scenes to make the devotionals a spiritual feast for us all. Now I invite us all to pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to teach us today so that we can all be uplifted and edified<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;while we are here together.<br /><br /><strong>What a new convert needs</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>President Gordon B. Hinckley said "Bring people into the Church. Bring them in with love. Bring them in with kindness. Bring them in with the example of your lives. So live the gospel that they will see in you something of wonder and beauty and be encouraged to inquire, study the gospel, and join the Church."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Tomorrow marks the 37th anniversary of my convert baptism and confirmation in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Although I had been in contact with members of the Lord's church as I grew up in Mesa, Arizona, I had no particular interest in religion. But a simple<sup>5</sup>invitation from a courageous young woman changed all of that. I remember very well Colette Christensen<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;asking me what I was doing while I was standing outside waiting for the lunch bell to ring. After I told her I was waiting to eat a second lunch, she simply said, "Why don't you come to seminary with me?" To be honest, she was cute and so were the other young ladies I saw going to seminary, so I said okay. The next day, she invited me to go again, and I went. I went almost every day that year because she or someone else invited me to go. Sometime during the very first week of seminary, the teacher showed the movie,&nbsp;<em>The First Vision</em>.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>This was the first time that I had ever seen this movie, and I was riveted. As I watched the portrayal of the Prophet Joseph's experience, the Holy Ghost bore witness to me that it was true; that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith to usher in the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness. And I testify to you that it is still true today!<br /><br />Despite the fact that I knew the First Vision was true, it took me a while to join the church. I received a lot of pressure from others not to join; and I also did not think that I could live up to those covenants that we make in the waters of baptism. I didn't think that I could change. I didn't think that I could put off the natural man.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;What I didn't realize was that the church is like a hospital, as Elder Dale G. Renlund<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;reminded us, and that we are all sick and need help; or as President Dieter F. Uchtdorf<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;taught, that the church is like a service center and we all need a little maintenance. At first, I needed a lot of repair work (I still do today). Fortunately, members of the Lord's church have always left the lower lights burning<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;for each of us.<br /><br />For example, immediately after being confirmed a member, bishop Doug Holladay of the Mesa 16th Ward asked me to speak in church. I protested because I had never spoken in front of a large audience before. He persisted, and I thought he had lost his mind; I mean, my hair wasn't even dry yet. I told him that I couldn't speak in church. He then said you can bear your testimony. I told him no again. To this day, I am amazed that he was able to persuade me to bear my testimony on that Sunday because I was terrified. Yet, these opportunities to serve continued - I was assigned as a home teacher. I remember calling my first home teaching companion, and after exchanging the normal courtesies I told him the purpose of my call. He, in essence, commended me for doing my duty, but said that he wasn't interested in doing home teaching. As I hung up the phone, I had a little bit of anxiety because even though I had never had home teachers, nor had I been home teaching, I knew that wasn't the way it worked. So I reported to my Elder's Quorum President what had happened. A change was made and I was given a new companion: Daniel Zimmerman. He taught me what it was like to be a true and faithful home teacher - we made appointments in advance, we prayed for our families prior to the visit, we visited with the families, we delivered a message, and we left with a prayer. I am grateful to have passed this pattern on to my own sons.<br /><br />As I learned more about my duties<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;in the church, I was called to serve a mission. At first, I resisted the promptings to serve a mission because I thought I was too inexperienced to serve. One day as I was rationalizing my decision not to serve a mission to a friend of mine, J.C. Jackson, he merely said, "President Kimball has said that every worthy male member of the church should serve a mission." A short time later, I was called to serve in the Peru Lima North mission. When I opened my call, my mother asked me where that was, and I replied that I did not know. She said, "Well, you aren't going because I don't know where it is." So, a friend of mine who was there when I opened the letter found Peru on our globe, and then my Mom said, "Well, you still aren't going because that is too far away." I said, "Mom, this is from President Kimball." She said, "I know. But you still aren't going." At that point I started to wonder about serving a mission because things weren't starting off very well. So, I called my home teacher, Gil Greer. Come to find out, he had served in the exact same mission! I testify that the Lord is involved in the very details of our lives.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Brother Greer came over later that evening and reassured my mother that her son would be okay as he served the Lord as a full-time missionary.<br /><br />President Hinckley said that "every new convert needs three things: a friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with the 'good word of God.'"<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;These rank and file members of the church certainly provided that for me then, and I continue to feel that support today.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I have had so many friends, both of our faith and of other faiths, uplift and edify me since I have joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that I cannot possibly thank them enough. I would also like to add that I am grateful for the love and support that I have felt and continue to feel from my parents,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;my sister, and other extended family members, who, although not of our faith, continue to support my church activity. My parents, in particular have supported my family in simple, yet remarkable ways. For example, even though they could not come inside the Salt Lake Temple when I was blessed to be sealed to my wonderful, beautiful, eternal sweetheart, my parents drove up from Arizona and patiently waited outside, on a very cold day in late December. Likewise, they have supported our five sons in their academic and athletic activities, and most impressively, on their baptisms, ordinations, missionary farewells and reports, as often as they could. I cannot adequately express the love and gratitude in my heart that I have for them. I testify that we need each other, that we need responsibilities, that we need to be nurtured with the good word of God, as President Hinckley taught; and most importantly, we need the Savior's atonement, while we deal with life's challenges as we seek to become more like the Savior and Our Heavenly Father.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>The Challenge to Become</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught that in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we are not only supposed to be knowledgeable, but more importantly, we are to become something.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said "Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Likewise, Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: "Part of discipleship should be to become high-yield, low-maintenance members of the Church. These members are not high profile; they won't be on the six o'clock evening news when they die. But they have done what Heavenly Father has wanted them to do meekly and humbly."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The implication of this challenge to become high-yield, low-maintenance, is that people can change. When all is said and done, changing and helping each other improve so that we can build Zion is what this work is all about;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;hence, the admonition to "ponder the path of our feet."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>One of the stories of latter-day prophets that I have enjoyed that illustrates the principle of becoming is that of President Heber J. Grant. In his talk, "The Power of Self-Mastery," President James E. Faust<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;related how President Grant had started off as a less-than-stellar baseball player, yet through deliberate practice, he progressed enough until he played on the team that won the championship of the Territory of Utah. Likewise, President Grant's handwriting was so bad that his friends made fun of him. So, again, he engaged in deliberate practice sufficient enough that he later taught penmanship at the University of Utah.<br /><br />Quoting directly from President Faust: "Singing was another challenge for President Grant. As a small child, he could not carry a tune. When he was 10, a music instructor tried to teach him the simplest song and finally gave up in despair. At age 26, when he became an Apostle, he asked Professor Sims if he could teach him how to sing. After listening to him, Professor Sims replied, 'Yes, you can learn to sing, but I would like to be forty miles away while you are doing it.' This only challenged him to try harder. By practicing all of his life he made some improvement in singing but perhaps not as much as in baseball and penmanship, which he mastered. President Grant had a favorite quotation . . . which he lived by: 'That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased.'"<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;In reality, most of the improvements that we make in life will typically come in the form of "line upon line, precept upon precept"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;experiences.<br /><br />Of course, with the challenge to become there will be opposition as father Lehi taught.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;There will be difficulties for various reasons throughout our mortal journey. As we learn from scriptural accounts, sometimes the thorn in the flesh is not removed;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;similarly, we are given weakness so that we may be humble; . . . and if we humble ourselves and exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, He will make weak things strong unto us.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, sometimes the Lord chastens us in order to try, test, and stretch us.<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;The Lord said, "We must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;But we also must remember that whosoever puts their trust in the Lord will be supported through their trials and will be lifted up at the last day.<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Our burdens may not be removed, but the Lord will strengthen us sufficiently so that we can endure faithfully to the end.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Elder Orson F. Whitney taught that "No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God... and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, there is hope smiling brightly before us<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;if we are true and faithful.<sup>35</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>When others are experiencing their trials in life, we are commanded to "succor the weak, lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees."<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;President Spencer W. Kimball taught, "The Lord answers our prayers, but it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;There are many ways in which we can meet the needs of others. One of the ways in which we do this is by fast offerings - this is a picture of two of our sons; Caleb, the handsome dark-haired young man with his younger brother Hunter, the handsome red-haired young man. This was Hunter's first time collecting fast offerings, and who better to show him the ropes than his older brother. It is vitally important that we teach our children, at an early age, the importance of looking after others because we truly are, fellowcitizens with the saints.<sup>37</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>&nbsp;<strong>Help from beyond the veil</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Not only are we fellowcitizens on this side of the veil, but the tender mercies<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;of our Heavenly Father are extended to us from beyond the veil. If you remember the account found in the sixth chapter of 2 Kings, the king of Syria wanted to defeat the Israelites. But the Syrians were thwarted because the prophet Elisha had counseled the king of Israel on how to defend themselves against the warring Syrians. Of course, the King of Syria wanted to rid himself of this prophetic problem.</p>
<p>"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. ...(They) compassed the city both with horses and chariots." (2 Kgs. 6:14-15.)<br /><br />In reference to this scriptural account, when he was serving as the commissioner of the Church Educational System, Elder Jeffery R. Holland taught the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If Elisha is looking for a good time to be depressed, this is it. His only ally is a boy who in modern times might be the president of the local teachers' quorum. It is one prophet and one lad against the world. And the boy is petrified. He sees the enemy everywhere&mdash;difficulty and despair and problems and burdens everywhere. He cannot leave... With faltering faith the boy cries, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?" (2 Kgs. 6:15.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And Elisha's reply?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha." (2 Kgs. 6:16-17.)</p>
<p>Elder Holland continues with these powerful words: "In the gospel of Jesus Christ you have help from both sides of the veil, and you must never forget that. When disappointment and discouragement strike&mdash;and they will&mdash;you remember and never forget that if our eyes could be opened we would see horses and chariots of fire as far as the eye can see riding at reckless speed to come to our protection. They will always be there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham's seed."<sup>40</sup></p>
<p><strong>Social Perception</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let us also remember that while we are nurturing each other along the path toward perfection, that at one time or another, we will be like President Grant with his singing - we are making improvements, but we have a long way to go before we attain mastery. All of us fall short in one respect or another.<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Sometimes we do things that annoy, frustrate, anger, and disappoint others - and vice versa. In fact, some of our greatest joys and challenges in life come from other people. We would be wise to stop and consider the other person's perspective before we rush in to correct<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;or help; if we could take some time to think through situations so that we can see things a bit more clearly, we can avoid a lot of heartache, not only for ourselves, but also for others.<br /><br />Social perception has been one of my favorite things to study and I really like what the Lord is teaching us through the prophet Samuel. I am sure you remember the story; Samuel was sent by the Lord to the house of Jesse to anoint the new King of Israel. He calls Jesse and his sons to the sacrifice, and Samuel sees Eliab and thinks that Eliab will be the new king. "But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." More recently, our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, reminded us that we need to be very careful with how we view each other.<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Let us view a Mormon Message, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbFiB7oiQs4">Looking through Windows</a>," that is based on his talk, "Charity Never Faileth." Let us review some of what he is teaching us. He asks if we are looking through dirty windows as we perceive others. He asks if we are making judgments when we don't have all of the facts. Likewise, President Uchtdorf taught us a similar lesson about dandelions in our neighbor's yard.<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;Whether we are looking at others' so called dirty laundry or dandelions, we need to remember what President Monson taught "there is really no way we can know the heart, the intentions, or the circumstances of someone who might say or do something we find reason to criticize."<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;Hence the importance of the Savior's lesson about beams and motes: "Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ... First cast out the beam of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."<sup>46</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In this context, the Savior is using the Greek words that are translated as "mote" which is a tiny speck, and "beam" which refers to a large wooden beam used in the construction of houses. In essence, He is teaching us to focus on our own faults, not the faults of others.<sup>47 48</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And there is good reason for this lesson because there are several processes involved in social perception, and I will mention those that I consider to be relevant for us to remember:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these processes, we must remember that there are sociocultural influences as well as our current emotional state that can affect how clearly we see things. Many, if not most of us in our culture, are more likely to focus on the characteristics of an individual, and ignore the situational factors that are involved and commit what is referred to as "the fundamental attribution error."<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;I hope that we will be more mindful of the challenges involved with perceiving things as they really are,<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;particularly when we are interacting with each other.<br /><br /><strong>Be Kind</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In a similar vein, let us be kind to those around us. President Monson taught that love is the essence of the gospel<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;and I am indebted to the author who penned these words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have wept in the night<br />For the shortness of sight<br />That to somebody's need made me blind;<br />But I never have yet<br />Felt a tinge of regret<br />For being a little too kind.<sup>53</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I am so grateful for Jesus Christ and His restored Gospel. I testify that He is our Lord, our Savior, and our Redeemer; that through His atonement, if we build our foundation upon Him,<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;not only will we be able to faithfully endure our trials together, we can also become more like Him and our Heavenly Father, and regain their presence.<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Three years ago, Jennifer and I took our children on a trip to see Nauvoo and other places in that area of Church historical significance. Many of you have likely been to these places in person or perhaps you plan to visit in the future on a "bucket list" as I did. It is difficult to describe the feelings I felt as we visited Independence, Liberty, Carthage, and Nauvoo for the first time. My understanding was deepened. My heart was touched. All my life I had certain pictures in my mind as I learned the stories of Church leaders and convert members early in this dispensation of time. Those images were probably influenced by photos or paintings I had seen in seminary and institute manuals or Church museums visited in my youth. Now I was seeing it in living color. We walked down roads and paths and entered doorways into buildings where Joseph and Brigham and many other notable saints had walked. In some cases, we saw and entered visitor centers or replicas of buildings, which provided insight into that important time of growing, building, suffering, revelation, and teaching. In short, many stories of the restoration were made more vivid to me.<br /><br />As we visited the location of Liberty Jail and viewed the reconstructed jail cell, I pondered how Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were unjustly confined there, suffering from winter weather, filthy conditions, hunger, and sickness. The prophet suffered additionally, knowing that the Saints were being driven from Missouri under "an extermination order" from the governor. As recorded in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 122:7, he was taught that in the end "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."</p>
<p>We often consider this scripture in context with the very negative experiences at Liberty Jail and perhaps other trials and adversity faced by ourselves or others&mdash;experiences we normally wouldn't choose. Let me pose this question: What about the experiences we choose to give ourselves? How can we help ensure the choices we make will provide experiences that will be for our good?<br /><br />The Lord has counseled us that,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Speaking in General Priesthood Meeting in April 2008 about how our decisions impact our lives, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "We... have the responsibility and the power of self-direction."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;As we heed the Lord and use our agency to pursue many good things, we will be blessed with positive experiences that will be for our good.</p>
<p>I'd like to give you a little background on myself. Something most people probably don't know about me is that in my younger life I was a rodeo cowboy. From the time I was a little boy, I dreamed about riding bucking horses and roping. When I was really small (about five or six years old) I used to ride my Shetland pony to the fairgrounds and, with nobody else around to watch, I'd ride my horse into one of the bucking chutes and then, after announcing my own name, I'd push the gate open with my foot and gallop my horse from one end of the arena to the other. Now that I think of it, I'm sure it would have looked pretty silly. Well, this explains why my talk today might have a dose or two of cowboy logic.<br /><br />Since it was in my blood, I kept those kinds of activities going for a few years, eventually competing nationally, including at Ricks College. Because of my love of horses, I have spent a lot of time around them and have learned a great deal about horse behavior and training techniques. In fact, from the time I was a young teenager and continuing to this day, I receive a great deal of satisfaction riding and training young horses for myself and others. My former biology teacher and rodeo coach at Ricks College was Brother Mel Griffeth. Although this quote is commonly attributed to Winston Churchill, Brother Griffeth was fond of saying, "There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man." I agree with that thought. I have found some of my greatest pleasures and thoughtful moments in life being around horses or on the back of a horse. During the time I was preparing this talk I have been training one of my own colts we named Chip. You may be wondering what this has to do with a gospel topic. Actually, I think some of the principles of training a horse and the ways a young horse is given experiences are very applicable.<br /><br />For instance, after a foundation of trust is developed between the horse and its rider, much of what it takes to train a horse is offering it a variety of good experiences that build upon each other. There is a window of opportunity with a young horse when learning is accelerated and a horse seems to absorb and retain understanding gained from the initial training experiences. When I'm working to teach a young horse, I try to introduce the horse to as many different scenarios or experiences as I can ranging from crossing rivers and streams to my wearing a big scary yellow rain slicker. Over time, the horse's trust and capacity increase, and it no longer tries to shy away or flee. Many experiences we have in life can seem daunting or frightening until we enlarge our capacity and we recognize they are for our good.</p>
<p>I am inspired by the stories about Heber J. Grant, seventh president of the Church. Last week Brother Clay also used examples of the way President Grant overcame challenges in his life and turned them into strengths. Several weeks ago, I felt impressed to include these examples in my talk as well. President Grant learned to throw a baseball so he would be accepted on the top team and struggled to improve his penmanship so it would represent him well. His handwriting was eventually considered unusually beautiful.<br /><br />Brother Leon R. Hartshorn, a former BYU professor and author, wrote an article about Heber J. Grant for the New Era. He wrote,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He only needed some good reasons why he should do something, and then he was off trying. If it wasn't an easy task, he worked to bring about the proper result anyway. He tackled the impossible with enthusiasm, rising to the challenge in seeming glee. If he didn't seem to have the natural gift to accomplish a certain thing, he practiced and prayed until he developed the skill.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heber J. Grant was a man without excuses, whether it came to saving the Church from financial ruin or singing the hymns of Zion on key! This was how he was reared to be. Both President Brigham Young (in whose home young Heber spent countless beautiful hours) and Rachel Ivins Grant (widowed mother of Heber) had one thing in common: They had learned the value of self-discipline, demanding of themselves the best they had to offer. Young Heber absorbed this attitude and went one step further. He grew up believing that there was no reason why he, with the help of the Lord, could not accomplish anything he made up his mind to do. He often quoted Emerson: 'That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do&mdash;not that the nature of the thing has changed, but that our power to do has increased.' And he practiced what he preached.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What kinds of experiences do we want to have? Do we work at giving ourselves good experiences?</p>
<p>Being a university student is an important developmental phase of life&mdash;a special window of time to focus on personal development and self-discipline with an eye to the future. As I look back on that part of my life, I realize I was growing at a significant pace and was provided many opportunities in a relatively short period of time. May I suggest some things you should experience or improve on while you are in school&mdash;a special time of learning? I believe these suggestions will enrich your lives and provide an increased opportunity for success while you are attending school, and will also form a reasonable basis for continued success throughout your lives.</p>
<p>First, establish good habits. President Spencer W. Kimball counseled young people, leaders of youth, and all Church members to take a careful inventory of their habits. "Change," he said, "comes by substituting good habits for less desirable ones." Then he added, "You mold your character and future by good thoughts and acts."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Maintaining good personal habits allows us to improve ourselves and also to be an example to others&mdash;roommates, loved ones, neighbors and other associates. By using our agency to consistently do good things we enrich our lives and call down blessings from heaven in accordance with the promise that "when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>A few months following my high school graduation I found myself at Army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. In the early days of this experience I was stripped of my lifelong support structure of family, friends and Church leaders. I remember like it was yesterday when I had the realization it was entirely up to me to decide if the habits I had practiced during my upbringing were going to be maintained or cast aside. Nobody cared if I said my prayers, read my serviceman's copy of the Book of Mormon, or attended church services. I remember my first few prayers were offered as I lay in my top bunk in a barracks room with seven other guys. How was I going to kneel to pray at someone else's bedside? I learned to kneel in bed.<br /><br />I remember packing my copy of the Book of Mormon in my cargo pocket or in my ruck sack and squeezing in reading when I could. I remember being asked if we wanted to attend Catholic, Jewish or Protestant worship services whose buildings were nearby. When most of the other soldiers fell out of formation having chosen one of those options, I was asked why I was still standing there. When I told them I wanted to worship with the Latter-day Saints, I was informed that they met in a small office building on the other side of the base. On the base, LDS services were two hours (sacrament and priesthood meetings.) The drill sergeants thought that was a little excessive&mdash;I didn't mention it was normally three hours. As I settled into my weekly Sunday routine of attending my meetings, I soon found a phone booth along the way and, if I ran almost the entire way, I could fit in a short phone call to check in with loved ones at home. I was blessed to find ways to maintain my habits while away from home. You will be blessed as you seek to develop and maintain good habits while you are in school and wherever you may find yourself.<br /><br />Elder Delbert L. Stapley spoke on habits and said, "We are not born into this world with fixed habits. Neither do we inherit a noble character. Instead, as children of God, we are given the privilege and opportunity of choosing which way of life we will follow&mdash;which habits we will form.<br /><br />Confucius said that the nature of men is always the same. It is their habits that separate them."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Developing worthwhile habits requires work and commitment. There are no shortcuts to anyplace worth going.<br /><br />Second, get involved. Each of us seems to learn the importance of giving of ourselves and the value of working with others at different points in life. While I still have much room for improvement in this area, I had an experience or two as a student here that have helped to shape my attitude about getting involved.<br /><br />I returned from my mission in October and decided to live at home and commute to school from Saint Anthony for a few classes during the second block. On one of my first days on campus, I was approached by a student body officer I knew who said, "Hey Shane. You should consider getting involved in campus activities. We need someone to chair the annual Christmas Tree Lane event. Would you be interested in doing that?"<br /><br />My first thought was, "Oh no. Not me. I remember coming to that event on this campus from the time I was just a young boy and it was bigger than life. What would I know about doing something like that? I don't have time for that." Well, I must have been saying "no" on the inside and something kind of like "yes" on the outside because, before I knew it, I was being whisked into some office in the Manwaring Center and lined out for my new assignment. I soon found myself looking around campus for people to help on the committee and diving into something that turned out pretty well despite my weaknesses. I enjoyed it. I felt I was somehow investing in my future and helping with a needed project.<br /><br />I went back for more. The following spring I threw my hat in the ring to run for student body president. And guess what happened? I didn't win. At that time at Ricks College, there were several elected student body offices and a couple of appointed positions on the council. A couple of days after the election, the student who did win the election asked to speak with me and asked me if I was willing to serve in the appointed capacity of Student Relations Officer. I agreed. For the next year, I was out of my comfort zone. I had a variety of experiences I could not have foreseen. I learned something about serving in a different way. I made new lifelong friends.<br /><br />The words to the second verse of the hymn "Have I Done Any Good?" seem to encourage getting involved in worthwhile things&mdash;particularly in serving others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are chances for work all around just now,<br />Opportunities right in our way.<br />Do not let them pass by, saying, "Sometime I'll try,"<br />But go and do something today.<br />'Tis noble of man to work and to give;<br />Love's labor has merit alone.<br />Only he who does something helps others to live.<br />To God each good work will be known.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>My third suggestion is to plant your roots. Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there. One of the sayings that you would hear periodically if you spent much time around rodeo bronc riders or bull riders is that all you need to do in order to be successful is to, "keep one leg on one side and the other leg on the other side and your mind in the middle." In life, this translates into being physically where you should be and also having your mind and spirit where they belong.</p>
<p>When Jennifer and I were newly married and attending school in Logan, Utah we were faced with a choice. We could attend the resident ward based on where we lived or we could attend a married student ward. Honestly, I can't tell you now any of the items we discussed as we considered our choice. But in hindsight, we made the right decision for us.<br /><br />In our married student ward we had a bishopric and a stake presidency who were focused on providing experiences to us as young married students that would shape the rest of our lives. We received service opportunities accompanied by excellent training. Our bishop emphasized planting our roots and being in the ward on Sunday fulfilling our callings rather than looking for chances to be other places. Sure, there are appropriate reasons to be away occasionally. But as we took the challenge we realized this principle doesn't only apply to our Sundays and our church meetings, but also to our family and home life.<br /><br />This and similar patterns of behavior, where we are regularly found where we should be and doing what we should be doing, speak to commitment, diligence, and being "steadfast and immovable."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Establishing these patterns can provide an anchor in a harbor when the winds of life blow.</p>
<p>Finally, but greatest in priority, my suggestion is to use this season to learn wisdom&mdash;learning and living the gospel. This phrase comes from Alma as he transferred responsibility for the keeping of the records to his son Helaman in Alma 37, beginning in verse 35:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Then he teaches his son about the Liahona and its workings and its spiritual guidance. As Helaman received this wise counsel and then recorded it so we have it today, I picture him making these mental notes: Learn wisdom...keep the commandments...learn to pray and receive answers to prayer...learn to love the Lord...learn to understand the spirit and the guidance it provides.</p>
<p>Similar to many of you, I have heard this same counsel from my parents or other leaders. How am I doing with those things? What do I need to do today to better learn these things? As students, we have assignments and preparation for quizzes or tests to help us know what we need to do to learn geology or calculus or anatomy. I invite us each to take a few minutes before the end of the day to consider a commandment we need to keep better. Or to think of a question or a request we need to pray about in order to stay up with our learning about prayers and answers to prayer. Or, as with the Liahona, to dare to follow a still small prompting of the spirit so that we can be privileged to receive other future promptings and directions.</p>
<p>Another scriptural reference to learning and wisdom I like is the story of Daniel and his young brethren. "As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom." The king had them brought in to be trained for service in his court. Eventually, the king took counsel from these young men. We don't know much of their upbringing but in their youth they were founded in truth and revelation from God. Therefore, "In all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In conclusion, as we look back on the adverse experiences the prophet Joseph Smith had in Liberty Jail and throughout his short but important life, we know that he was the means of so many good things "for the salvation of man." I believe he was able to do such things because he continued to use his agency to focus on and direct the important work he was called to do amidst his trials. As with Joseph Smith, we can't always choose to avoid the adversity which will come to us. However, we have the ability to choose many good experiences that will help us to grow to become the person God intends for us to be.</p>
<p>I'm thankful for the opportunity to speak to you today and share some things I hope will be useful to you as you strive for good experiences. In review, they are:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to have the pleasure to work at BYU-Idaho and be with great leaders, coworkers, and students. Just as some of the foundational learning experiences in my life occurred at this place and during my time pursuing my college education, I continue to be taught here and have experiences for my good.<br /><br />I know God lives and that He is our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. I know that His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ is our Savior. I know He lives and loves us. I am comforted and strengthened to know these things.In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was nine years old, my sister Page had her first baby and changed my life. Babies were incredible! They were sweet and innocent and darling, and I knew from that moment that all I wanted to do&mdash;forever and ever&mdash;was to have babies. I wanted to care for them and tend to their every need. Even changing diapers and getting up to feed the baby at all hours of the morning seemed somehow dreamy and even fun. I was sure being a mother was the romantic and greatest job that ever existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young girl, I daydreamed about me in my 20&rsquo;s rocking a baby in the nursery (that looked like Peter Pan&rsquo;s nursery) with books spread about my feet and a few other older children gathered around me reading or drawing or whatever, it just seemed fantastic and I was happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I got older that image grew stronger, more vibrant and distinctive. Except now there was a man&mdash;a husband, a father in the picture. He was always handsome and capable and had good strong hands and tender eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that man at the age of 18, the summer after I had graduated from high school. We met at my dad&rsquo;s office one spring morning. I was filling in for the regular secretary who happened to be sick that day. It was a day I will never forget, a day that changed my life forever. I was very shy (and had a missionary) but felt something change inside me. I didn&rsquo;t know his name, but as I watched him leave, something completely unexpected happened. A feeling came over me like electric waves pulsing through my body. It was trumpets sounding and angels singing, as if a real-life cupid&rsquo;s arrow had struck my heart. I&rsquo;d never felt anything as powerful and specific in my life and that was the boy I was going to marry. The image I had of a husband in my fairy tale story, the guy with the strong hands&mdash;well, that was him. I knew without a doubt. I was sure I was going to marry him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That afternoon after work, I went to my bedroom shut the door and lay on my bed. I felt like Mary, the mother of Jesus in Luke 2:19 where she &ldquo;kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been taught, and believed, that heavenly help would guide my life. I often prayed for answers or assistance and trusted that God would deliver the guidance I needed, especially for something as important as marriage. So while I was a little surprised at the content of the message, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to receive it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian and I went on our first date in May of 2000, and after a three-month service trip to Africa, Christian asked me out on our second date in August. We were engaged in September and married in December (during winter break) in the Provo temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a surprise to anyone that our first child, our daughter, Claire Elizabeth was born 10 months after Christian and I were married. Christian bought me a perfect old rocking chair at D.I. when we found out I was going to have a baby. That rocking chair has followed us to every house we&rsquo;ve ever lived. Christian and I continued to have children, even through the debilitating, depressing nine months of my pregnancies that I experienced, or the endless homework Christian always seemed to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst were days I didn&rsquo;t see Christian because he went to school, then went to work and then to the lab to do more homework. Then we dealt with the job changes, our epic move across the country to New Jersey, and all of this coupled with the fantastic stress of financial woes, yet we continued to have children, and it felt right. I once had a young mother ask me how we pulled that off when she felt uneasy about even the thought of bringing children to the world. She didn&rsquo;t feel like she and her husband could make enough money, and provide the necessities of life. I said one word. Faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure there were nights Christian and I sat in bed late at night contemplating our future and I enviably would cry a little bit because I was worried and tired, and of course a little overwhelmed as a young mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian and I were married just seven and a half years, in 2008 when our lives changed in a massive way. We were living in Arizona at the time, Claire was just six, our second daughter Jane was five. Oliver was three and Nicholas was 18 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claire had begun first grade while Jane was in the morning class of kindergarten. They rode on the bus together each morning. Two little girls walking hand-in-hand to the bus stop each day was just about the cutest thing you ever saw. I had just turned 27 and felt fulfilled at the role of mother. I was teaching yoga at a local downtown studio, my best friend Lindsay and I had just earned our concealed weapons permit and enjoyed shooting at the range on weekends, and I was very involved with my church calling and missionary work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That summer Christian and I were talking about having another baby, it was a very busy time of my life, to say the least, but full of goodness and color and memories&mdash;really good memories. Then on Saturday, August 16, my life fell apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On that hot day in New Mexico, Christian and I, along with our good friend&mdash;a retired air force pilot&mdash;were in a small airplane that crashed shortly after takeoff. When the plane crashed it burst into flames, and all three of us were trapped. Because of the violent impact, we were all knocked unconscious, and the cockpit was totally engulfed in flames causing burns on over 80 percent my body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember after the plane crashed and I coming to, I was in a feeling of shock and despair&hellip;was this really happening to me? I was in so much pain and had so much fear. I realized quickly, after several unsuccessful attempts trying to get out of the burning airplane, that there was no way I was going to make it out alive, and I knew if I just endured this horrid pain it would eventually take me, and the pain would be gone, and I would be with my grandmother and others who had left this world before me. My mind raced to each of my children, I saw their faces, I could smell them, and in my mind I held them, and said goodbye to them. I remember screaming loudly with pain in hopelessness. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was going to die. But the moment I let myself give up was the moment I felt heavenly help. I was encouraged, lifted, and had the energy and power I needed to get my seatbelt off, my legs to stand up, and the strength to roll, and roll, and roll&mdash;extinguishing the flames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I rolled for what seemed like hours and I stopped in the front yard of a home we had crashed in on fire, exhausted and in shock. I remember lying on my back looking up at a tree. I saw the leaves of that tree sway back and forth with thick black smoke from the nearby wreckage. I had no idea where Christian was, and I felt so much pain. I lifted my hands up to my face and most of my skin was gone and my bones were exposed, and all I could think about was the pizza dough I had laid out that morning to make dinner for my children. I needed to get home to make our traditional Saturday night pizza, teach a yoga class, pick out the church clothes, and prepare my Sunday school lesson for the next day. In short, I needed to get home. But when people came running up to me to help me, I could see in their eyes I was not ok. In fact, I sensed the fear they had and the worry in their voices when they talked to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The airplane roared and crackled as fire engulfed it and a woodpile we happened to have crashed next to. We also crashed just yards away from a large propane tank. I was so frightened, and I remember frantically looking for Christian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon ambulances arrived and put us all three in different helicopters and flew us to the Phoenix, Arizona burn center. I can still hear the EMT&rsquo;s relaying to the hospital that they probably had an 80-90. I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant at the time, but after pieced it together&mdash;they meant 80 or 90 percent burned. I just couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Were they actually talking about <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, my feet were protected by a pair of leather moccasins that I had bought not 15 minutes before the crash, and it was in my feet they were able to get an IV line. I was put in a medically induced coma, which lasted for over three and a half months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian had broken his back, and was also taken by helicopter to the burn center where he lay in a coma for over five weeks, and our friend and pilot passed away the next day from his injuries. He was burned on nearly 100 percent of his body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During these months while Christian and I slept in a coma, my eight siblings and Christian&rsquo;s 10 siblings together with our parents took over everything. They took care of the children, meals, our home, the mail, our dog, and everything in-between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our families were being counseled by the burn surgeons and hospital therapists to prepare for troubling times&mdash;if I actually lived. Soon, Christian began getting better and he would live, but I was still in a deep coma, enduring surgeries almost daily to patch me back together. I was teetering on life and death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They told my family I would most likely not have legs, fingers, ears, lips, and nose. My quality of life would be painful and difficult.</p>
<p>They explained that burn injuries are not only physically agonizing, but also my appearance had changed significantly and it&rsquo;s often very traumatic for loved ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They went on to explain that this could end our marriage. It&rsquo;s exhausting on the partners, and draining on the children, and sometimes it just doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, that may be the case in other situations, but not ours. Christian and I built our love and trust on the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. He was and always has been the center of our home, lives, and marriage. We built trust and a family together and married one another&rsquo;s souls with all the love and respect we knew how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing this, our family could confidently tell the hospital staff that divorce or separation would not only <em>not</em> be an option, but that this trial would actually bring us closer together&mdash;and it has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I awoke from my coma, it was November. I remember opening up my eyes, and seeing my mom standing over my bed. Her green eyes were comforting, but I knew something was wrong. I couldn&rsquo;t move my body, I&rsquo;d tell it to move, but it wouldn&rsquo;t. I was still on a ventilator and couldn&rsquo;t talk or communicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days went by&mdash;long days of frustrating silence and so many questions, and pain&mdash;so much pain. Since my burned skin had been scrapped off, new skin was being grafted on in sections, like a patchwork quilt. Temporary grafts used pig skin or cadaver skin, so the surgeons harvested my healthy skin where they could, which were some part of my abdomen, some parts of my chest, and upper legs. They also eventually shaved my hair off and used my scalp skin. But I had so little healthy skin to even donate to myself, that I had to manufacture more. They would harvest tiny samples of my healthy skin and send them to a lab in Boston, which then grew a genetic match. It took three weeks to grow a rectangle five centimeters by ten centimeters at which point it was flown back to Phoenix, where it was stapled on to my skin. Once the new skin had taken and begun to grow (if it took, in most cases the graft failed). It was very delicate skin and the process was painstaking and even the smallest infection could compromise the weeks of progress the doctors had made with my new skin, so keeping the wounds clean was vital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the grafting surgery my wounds were wrapped in white gauze bandages. Because of the potential for disastrous infection, the bandages had to be changed twice a day and the fresh wounds scrubbed clean with agonizing amounts of solution and saline. If the new skin hadn&rsquo;t attached, the unsuccessful grafts had to be scrubbed off, wounds kept open and clean until the next time in the operating room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process was excruciating&mdash;one of the major downsides of being conscious&mdash;and the pain started the moment they bent my limbs and joints to move my body. But, then again, I learned that I was lucky enough to even have limbs. During my first days in the burn center, most of the skin on my body had been scraped raw and was and was thus dangerously susceptible to infection. The doctors had warned my family that amputation of my arms and legs was very likely if new skin didn&rsquo;t arrive from the lab fast enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when I thought things couldn&rsquo;t get worse for me, I would remember the blessing of having arms and legs. Sure they were in terrible shape, but I was so grateful I still had them. My future would be infinitely more devastating if I&rsquo;d lost limbs, and I tried to keep that in mind when the nurses worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A team of burn techs and nurses who specialize in dressing changes worked quickly, but the process still took over two hours. Sometimes my dressing changes took place in my bed or often in a special room down the hall with a tub where the bandages could soak before they were removed, and where my whole body could be emerged and scrubbed. I always closed my eyes against the onslaught of pain and stared intently at the old ceiling tiles. I&rsquo;d breathe deeply through the agony. It was like having duct tape being ripped off an open raw sore over and over again. I tried going somewhere else&mdash;somewhere where I was healed, beautiful, and happy, but that seemed too much to even visualize, so I would just sob like a baby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the nurses were done, they wrapped me up tightly in white gauze and I was essentially raw&mdash;but clean. Within minutes I could see bright red blood oozing on the white bandages and before I knew it, it was time for another dressing change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my surgeries I was told to lay carefully and very still so not to compromise the graft. During that time I thought a lot. I wondered about my children. I wondered and agonized over who greeted Jane as she got off the bus after kindergarten. What if she walked home alone and no one was home? Where would she go? What would she do? She was only five, and school had only been in session one week. I was worried she wouldn&rsquo;t know where to go without me. I worried about my baby Nicholas who had just started to walk&mdash;did whoever had him know that he likes soy milk and has to have his blankie with him at nap times?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my coma, I missed my daughter Claire&rsquo;s seventh birthday and my Nicholas&rsquo; second birthday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was so confused and very emotional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recovery was long. Each day I was in excruciating pain while doctors and nurses changed my bandages, sometimes twice a day. I still couldn&rsquo;t move on my own. Each day I was discouraged. Each day I became a little more depressed, and my dream of motherhood disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the accident, I was busy during the day, teaching, cooking, cleaning, playing, kissing, hugging and all kinds of different motherly duties, including changing diapers. Now the tables had turned, and someone was taking care of all my needs&mdash;holding me when I cried, kissing my pain away, reading me stories and letters my children sent me. I also was having <em>my</em> diaper changed, which was equally humiliating as it was disappointing and frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure all of you have dreams and goals. If you think about your wildest dreams, what comes to mind? During those hard times in the hospital, I would fantasize about cleaning my toilet, because that would mean my hands would stretch and bend freely&mdash;no sores or bandages, and no pain. I also used to dream about me picking up Nicholas&rsquo; gross diapers that my dog would get into and destroy our backyard with, because that would mean I could walk, bend, and feel the sun on my face and wind in my hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew that I wanted that life again. I knew that if I wanted to be a mother again, I needed to work like I had never worked before. I spent hours in skin ripping physical therapy. Often times I would pass out from the pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these tough therapy sessions, I learned to bend my newly graphed and scarred skin. Small easy tasks were so complex and so frustrating to me. Simple things, like putting a spoon to my mouth, turning my head, and even smiling seemed impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children are not allowed in the Arizona burn center, but I thought about them everyday. I wondered where they were, what they were doing; I wondered if they missed me or wanted to see me again even if they knew I looked so different. I doubted it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The children would send me hand-drawn pictures of us together holding hands in fields of flowers, and me cooking with an apron on. The nurses always taped them up near my bed, and I thought they were darling, but asked the nurses to take them down. I was not that woman anymore. These pictures were of me with pretty white skin and brown freckles&mdash;my lips red with rosy cheeks. Now, I wasn&rsquo;t even close to that woman. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even feel like a woman. I felt like a monster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had almost been five months since the accident, and I had been away from my children all that time never seeing them once. In all that time I hadn&rsquo;t even seen my own reflection either. I had been putting it off all this time, so frightened to see my new face. I knew I looked different, but I was so terrified to actually see and deal with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One December evening Christian walked through my door, like he always did. This time he had a mirror in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you can do it Stephanie. Lets do it together.&rdquo; He said sitting on the edge of my bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat there for hours and he gently nudged me the whole time. &ldquo;Ok, Ok I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; I would say then chicken out right before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I decided I needed to do this myself and alone. Christian kissed my forehead and told me that he&rsquo;d go get dinner for us while I looked at my face. He left my room and quietly I said a prayer. Please Heavenly Father, help me. Help me like what I see. Help me be brave. Please bless me to find the old me, somewhere. That prayer went straight to heaven because almost immediately, I felt calm and peaceful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and turned the mirror over. I started at my bandaged chest and worked my way up. My neck looked a lot like the skin on my arms, scarred and blotchy. I kept going. I looked at my chin, then my lips, Could those be my lips? They were huge and looked the way they felt&mdash;painful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to my nose, I cried out and put the mirror down. My nose was completely different, smaller and misshapen. I was unrecognizable to myself. My cheeks were blotched with bloody scabs, and raised scars, and half of my ear was burned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My face scared me, and I knew it would scare anyone. I felt like I was wearing a Halloween mask. Panic took me over. How on earth could my children see me like this? I actually considered having my sisters who were taking care of my children to put me somewhere where my children would never have to see me and deal with my inadequacies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in that moment something also happened. I saw my green eyes looking back at me in the mirror as tears dripped out of them, and oddly enough, I felt hopeful. These green eyes that I had inherited from my father still had the golden flecks that Christian loved. I caught my breath. I saw God in my eyes. I saw reassurance. I even maybe thought I saw a glimpse of triumph. This broken sad woman was still me. Those eyes were <em>mine. </em>The life I saw in them came from God, and that gave me hope for the life of my body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underneath all these bandages and medicines, I still had all my toes, fingers, ears, a nose, eyes, and I could see, smell, hear and best of all I had my children, and they were taken care of while I was sick. I had my husband who stood strong and immovable by my side defending me and encouraging me on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, the burn specialists and therapists met with my children to help prepare them to see me. No matter how hard they tried, I don&rsquo;t think their efforts could have prepared my children to see their new mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the visit, I asked the nurses to put a pair of earrings in my ears; they straightened up my room, and stocked my mini fridge with root beer and treats. One of the sweet nurses who had been with me through thick and thin put her lip-gloss on me, just to try and make me look and feel feminine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That first meeting was horrible, my 5-year-old daughter Jane was so excited to see me, and she ran enthusiastically in my room. Her eyes beamed and then in terror at the sight of me turned white as a ghost and looked at the floor for the rest of the meeting. In fact she begged Christian to take her out of my hospital room. It took Jane three months after that initial visit for her to look and accept me again.</p>
<p>After that visit, which ripped my heart out, I decided I never wanted to be their mother. Any image I even had&mdash;at any point of my life was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the days that went on after that initial meeting, and the daunting reality of actually coming to grips with my new image, and the whole situation, I was emotionally exhausted and depressed beyond words. I think for the next week I cried non-stop, but through the endless tears and hopeless thoughts I also couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how those events could make or break my next move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thoughts and actions that followed those horrific moments could elevate me from victim to survivor. But I didn&rsquo;t want to just be a survivor; I wanted to be a thriver. And I knew it was my choice, and I also firmly knew that the only way I could achieve happiness again was through my Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night I poured out my heart and soul to God. I told him that I wanted my job back again, and I didn&rsquo;t just want to be a bystander in my family, I wanted to be in charge again. I wanted to do everything I did before the accident. I was determined to be present and active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the doctors were telling me that I would probably have a very limited lifestyle. I would probably be in pain all the time, and my skin would be overly sensitive. I appreciated their advice and concern for me, but I knew better. I was going to own this trial, and not one single tear I shed in the process would be in vain or unproductive. If I cried it would be because I worked so hard in physical therapy that my skin ripped, tears because I was so worn working so hard at the end of the day, and tears because I know that &ldquo;by small and simple things are great things brought to pass;&rdquo; and &ldquo;And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes;"<sup>1</sup> and I actually believed I one of His eternal purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I admit, I still cried here and there because I missed me. I missed my long hair and healthy body. I missed holding my babies and I missed snuggling up to Christian after a long day, but each day I found success knowing that I was that much closer to getting my apron back on, or my fancy heals on for a weekend date, and boy did I miss those!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was finally released from the hospital the day before New Year&rsquo;s Eve to a new life and a new home in Utah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back frequently to the burn center for surgeries and skin releases, Sometimes staying in the hospital for weeks while I recovered. With each surgery I felt like this new life was being breathed into my heart and soul because it meant I was getting better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually before doctors put me out for the surgeries, I made sure Christian knew that if I didn&rsquo;t make it out alive, that I loved him and if he remarried I couldn&rsquo;t promise I wouldn&rsquo;t haunt his new wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your trials and hard times can set into motion eternal lessons for each of you, and through these tests we can learn things that ultimately we can be grateful for. I have to believe that! I have to hope and believe there is a plan for our lives and purpose behind our struggles. I know at times that hope may be thin, but these challenges seem more manageable if I believe there is a purpose behind them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ, is absolutely essential for us to maintain a balanced perspective through times of trial and difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what it feels like to look different, and sometimes it hurts. I know what it feels like to feel ugly and worthless. I know all too much about the endless nights of loneliness and frustration, the depressing and devastating feelings that cause despair, pain and worthlessness. In contrast, I also know what it feels like to be protected and loved. Christian has been my greatest strength and an advocate for me every single day. He cheered me on when I felt like I was being defeated over and over again. We must do this for one another. We don&rsquo;t have time to tear each other down or criticize others&rsquo; weaknesses or shortcomings. We cannot be bitter, resentful, or mean-spirited when we are grateful, and we have so much to be grateful for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that when the hard times come, you understand that pain and suffering happens to everyone&mdash;no one is exempt, but it&rsquo;s how we deal with trials that can withstand the outcome. It is the lessons learned, our attitudes, and the souls we can touch and teach along the way, those things matter. Our trials and pain can also become our greatest strengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My family has been my greatest accomplishment in this life, and the sole reason I came back from the dead&mdash;because I knew that I was irreplaceable, and how thankful I am that I plugged away on those dark days after the accident when all I knew was different and painful. I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want my daughters to see beautiful moments can still be evident in trials, and my sons to know that their father loved me, their mother, fiercely through it all the pain, ups, and downs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now men, listen up. Be strong and stay clean. Please do not indulge in the filthy grasp of pornography. It is demeaning to the beautiful woman you will someday marry. It corrupts your minds and hearts and distorts what a normal loving relationship and marriage is. I mention this because there was a time along our journey where Christian was given the opportunity to indulge in pornography to help him cope and deal with the situation. He recalls how thankful he was that he didn&rsquo;t ever think about even considering that. He had never tampered with pornography before we married, and before as a young man, so it wasn&rsquo;t hard for him to shun it when times got hard. I can&rsquo;t imagine having to compete with pornography when I was in such a fragile place in my life. I already was sure he would never want me again. I was sure he would have to drag me around as his sad, sick, ugly wife. I think recovery for me would have been very different if Christian and I had to climb that hurdle as well. But we didn&rsquo;t, and maybe when he was told by the prophet, his father, or young men leaders as a young boy not to look at pornography he wondered &ldquo;why? Who would it really hurt?&rdquo; He probably never would have thought his choices could and would effect him and our marriage in this particular way. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever publicly thanked him for being strong; for being my champion and faithful dedicated husband, and not giving in to something that would have been really easy. If only there were more Christians in the world&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just trust me, <em>don&rsquo;t</em> go down that path. It&rsquo;s ripped too many families apart, too many marriages broken, and hearts shattered. Just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know my skin isn&rsquo;t considered beautiful. I know my face is different and it took me a long time to accept and understand that. But now, I look at how far I have come, and now when I look in the mirror I see a woman of faith, a woman of courage, I see a mother of three beautiful girls, and two energetic boys. In the oddness of my skin I see strength, I see hope, and I see miracles, I see God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am learning to be proud of my scars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Jeffery R. Holland told me in his office one day when I lamented to him about how I felt ugly with all these scars, he told me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look for Christ&rsquo;s scars because they are evidence of what He did for us. They&rsquo;ll be the first things he shows us when we see him again. Your scars tell a story too. They might not make you feel attractive, but they are a witness of a miracle, that God blessed you to live, and that you have accomplished very difficult things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharing my story has been challenging and painful. There have been lots of moments that would have been more easily left in the past. But the motivation to share my story always outweighed the difficulty of the process. That motivation has come, first and foremost, thinking of my children and their children. I want them to understand how I got through this time in my life, and how God blessed me through it all. He had help of course, from many people on earth. I am so grateful that I have learned about myself, about life, and about my faith. I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, of course, but almost dying has taught me valuable lessons about living, lessons I wouldn&rsquo;t trade for anything, lessons I&rsquo;m honored to share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made it through the weeks and months after the crash, and through every day since because I have faith in something larger than myself&mdash;faith that God has a plan for me. That belief is a source of inner strength that leads me to peace, comfort, and the courage to cope, even when I don&rsquo;t really feel like coping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cornerstones of faith, family, and community were the frameworks of my life before the accident, and I thank God that they were strong enough to support me afterword too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the worst happened, that foundation withstood tremendous pressure but didn&rsquo;t collapse. The opposite happened, and it carried me and in doing so confirmed my belief that the single most important thing in life is to hold your family and friends close. Beautiful possessions and our material comforts are so nice to have and looking and feeling great are blessings too, but the connections I had with my Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ, and my husband and children, and family had always absolutely been my priorities in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With so much that was offered me by the doctors, therapists, hospitals and other places and people, I realized along the way that ultimately nothing they did could make me happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I stubbornly thought that the only thing that would make me happy was for life to look like it did before the accident. But no one could give that to me, and no one else could make me happy. Happiness was my choice, and though it is hard won, I am the only person who can stand in the way of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I could leave you with anything, I would want to share with you the knowledge that I have gained since enduring my terrible accident. The knowledge that we are tougher than we think, and if we desire to be strong, happy we actually can achieve that even among the worst of situations, but only if we rely and put our faith in our Savior and His healing power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are great people of strength and passion, and that will carry us on the days we find most difficult, but those moments have changed my life to continue to carry on, to strive for better, and be a wiser mother and woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have grown up a lot since my ordeal, and I hope I continue to gain and learn from my trials. I hope that I will continue to progress forward and take my family along and those I love right along with me. Everyday we are continuing changing and growing. We all have moments of success and failure. That is just the way life is, and you can chose to learn and grow from it, or carry on holding on to the life that we know and are comfortable with. Go for it. Embrace change and challenges whatever they may be. Follow them through with concern and prayers. Don&rsquo;t stay behind wishing for life to stay the same, because it won&rsquo;t and because you won&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sensed the accident had set into motion eternal lessons for my little family, and we would learn things that ultimately we&rsquo;d be grateful for&mdash;at least I hope so. I have to believe there is a plan for our lives, and a purpose behind our struggles. Lots of time that hope was very, very thin, but my challenges seemed manageable if I believed there was purpose behind them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right after the accident, there were moments when I was convinced I would never be happy again; that, in an instant, the life I&rsquo;d built and longed for had been destroyed. I&rsquo;d been lost, and in pain, and depressed, I had often despaired, but my faith and my family had nudged me forward when nothing else could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still that girl, (a little older now) I daydreamed about rocking a baby in the nursery. There really are books spread about my feet sprinkled with Legos and plates of toast (my kids love toast).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That man in my dreams is Christian. His hands strong from hard work, physically caring for me and his children; his eyes soft, his heart pure and clean, and our love even stronger than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe in fairy tales, I believe that &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; is real, and happily ever after is true, but only with God. Remember that nothing is &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; unless God&rsquo;s hands bless it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that our hardest days will come to an end. That our trials and bad days will stop and that one day we will be free from pain, hurt, and heartache. I testify that faith is supreme and God always keeps his promises if we do our part. I testify that God has provided for our day tangible evidence that Jesus is the Christ, and for my children, I am that tangible evidence. I testify that the physical body is a gift from God and needs to be properly cared for and respected. And I testify God our Heavenly Father knows us by name and deeply loves and cares for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, thank you for being here. I am grateful for the invitation to address you, and pray that the Spirit of God may be present and teach us this afternoon.</p>
<p>In 1984, Elder Bruce R. McConkie described a survey that was given at the Missionary Training Center in Provo.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>&nbsp;The missionaries were asked to evaluate their own testimonies about ten different truths, including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quote what happened next from his biography:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a very sober tone, Elder McConkie asked: "Would you be interested in knowing which of these [ten] areas was the lowest in terms of testimony?" Everyone nodded. He said: "The lowest area of testimony across elders, sisters, and couples [was]:&nbsp;Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...Elder McConkie [then] raised his voice and said: "Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong!"<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, Elder McConkie is right. If Joseph Smith&mdash;and the Restoration of the gospel through him&mdash;is not a fundamental part of our testimony, then something&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;definitely wrong. As President Joseph Fielding Smith said, "we link the names of Jesus Christ and of Joseph Smith."<sup><sup>3</sup></sup>&nbsp;President Brigham Young taught the same principle. He said, "What I have received from the Lord, I have received by Joseph Smith...If I drop him, I must drop these principles...no man on the earth can say that Jesus lives, and deny, at the same time...the Prophet Joseph. This is my testimony."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>We should expect intense opposition to surround Joseph Smith because the experiences of his life represent, in the words of President Gordon B. Hinckley, "the hinge on which turns the gate that leads to salvation and eternal life."<sup><sup>5</sup></sup>&nbsp;After the angel Moroni introduced himself to Joseph Smith, he told him that his "name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."<sup><sup>6</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Today, it is obvious that Moroni's prophecy is fulfilled among the nations; but I invite each of us to sincerely reflect on his prophecy as it relates to our individual hearts. In your own heart, is Joseph Smith's name had for good&mdash;a name of virtue, purity and righteousness? Or, is his name had for evil&mdash;a name of a questionable character or wavering inconsistency? Elder McConkie believed that "the measure of a person's spiritual maturity is found in his or her loyalty to the Prophet Joseph Smith."<sup><sup>7</sup></sup>&nbsp;How loyal are we to him?<br /><br />We live in a time when the character of Joseph Smith is under attack. The attacks against him come from every quarter&mdash;both flagrant attacks from outside the Church, and more subtle and deadly attacks from among some members within.<sup><sup>8</sup></sup>&nbsp;President Hinckley taught that now is a "day of fulfillment for [the] prophecy"<sup><sup>9</sup></sup>&nbsp;recorded in Section 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord tells Joseph Smith that: "The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;&nbsp;While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The devil knows that if he can only destroy the character of the Prophet Joseph Smith in our hearts, then we will be barred from the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ. As President Brigham Young testified:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No man or woman in this dispensation will ever enter into the celestial kingdom of God without the consent of Joseph Smith. From the day that the Priesthood was taken from the earth to the winding-up scene of all things, every man and woman must have the certificate of Joseph Smith, Junior, as a passport to their entrance into the mansion where God and Christ are&mdash;I with you and you with me. I cannot go there without his consent. He holds the keys of that kingdom for the last dispensation.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Today, I would like to mention three things that can help each of us to prepare to know the Prophet Joseph Smith as he really was&mdash;and as he really is&mdash;that we may gain "entrance into the mansion where God and Christ are."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><strong>Avoid False Voices</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>First, beware of the many voices&mdash;whether out of the Church or inside it&mdash;that humanize Joseph Smith by calling into question any aspect of his character. These voices come from those who "lift up the heel against [the Lord's] anointed, and cry that [he has] sinned when [he has] not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but [has] done that...which I commanded [him]."<sup><sup>13</sup></sup>&nbsp;As the Lord warned, they "cry transgression...because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves."<sup><sup>14</sup></sup>&nbsp;President Ezra Taft Benson warned of those who point out<em>alleged&nbsp;</em>weaknesses of prophets like Joseph Smith. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There have been and continue to be attempts to bring [a humanistic] philosophy into our own Church history...We would warn you teachers of this trend, which seems to be an effort to reinterpret the history of the Church so that it is more rationally appealing to the world...Some want to expose the weaknesses of Church leaders in an effort to show that they too are subject to human frailties and error like unto themselves...In view of the covenants taken in holy places, I would not have such temerity.<sup><sup>15</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Our beloved President Boyd K. Packer, who departed this life just a few months ago, echoed President Benson's warning. He said, "I have on occasion been disappointed when I have read in writings of those who are supposed to be worthy members of the Church statements that tend to belittle or degrade...past leaders of the Church."<sup><sup>16</sup></sup>&nbsp;President Packer continued, "That historian or scholar who delights in pointing out the weakness and frailties of present or past leaders destroys faith. A destroyer of faith&mdash;particularly one within the Church&mdash;places himself in great spiritual jeopardy. He is serving the wrong master, and unless he repents, he will not be among the faithful in the eternities."<sup><sup>17</sup></sup></p>
<p>These prophetic warnings expose real dangers that lurk around us now. Historical writings about Joseph Smith that are "more rationally appealing to the world"<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;fail the Lord's test as set forth by the prophet Nephi. He said, "Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world."<sup><sup>19</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Some readers are attracted to writings that point out some&nbsp;<em>perceived&nbsp;</em>character flaw in the Prophet Joseph Smith because they think it will make them feel better about their own flaws or sins. Brothers and sisters, it is Satan who wants us to feel at ease about our sins; God, on the other hand, wants us to repent of them. Dwelling on the faults of anyone&mdash;especially&nbsp;<em>assumed</em>&nbsp;faults of the Lord's anointed&mdash;only leads to destruction. Remember, in the scriptures it is the devil, called a "liar from the beginning,"<sup><sup>20</sup></sup>&nbsp;who is described as "the accuser of [the] brethren...which accused them before our God day and night."<sup><sup>21</sup></sup>&nbsp;But Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum "have overcome [their accuser] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; for they loved not their own lives, but kept the testimony even unto death."<sup><sup>22</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>What many see as wrongdoing in Joseph Smith was actually obedience to God. The Prophet taught that "the devil has great power to deceive; he will so transform things as to make one gape at those who are doing the will of God."<sup><sup>23</sup></sup>&nbsp;If any hope to find a particle of evil in one so pure as Joseph Smith, they will find, as the Lord said, that "their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun."<sup><sup>24</sup></sup>&nbsp;Any evil they think they may find in Joseph Smith&mdash;no matter how widely believed&mdash;will be a lie, for he was righteous and pure.<sup><sup>25</sup></sup>&nbsp;As President John Taylor testified:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was acquainted with Joseph Smith for years. I traveled with him; I have been with him in public and in private...I was with him when he died...I have seen him under all these various circumstances, and I testify before God, angels, and men that he was a good, honorable, and virtuous man, that his private and public character was irreproachable, and that he lived and died a man of God.<sup><sup>26</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Joseph Smith declared, "I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent..."<sup><sup>27</sup></sup>&nbsp;And he was innocent! "He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people."<sup><sup>28</sup></sup>&nbsp;He said, "...I do not the wrongs that I am charged with doing...Do you think that even Jesus, if He were here, would be without fault in your eyes? His enemies said all manner of evil against Him&mdash;they all watched for iniquity in Him."<sup><sup>29</sup></sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ was sinless and perfectly obedient.<sup><sup>30</sup></sup>&nbsp;But remember, it was the&nbsp;<em>guilty hypocrites</em>&nbsp;who accused him&mdash;even God&mdash;of being mad,<sup><sup>31</sup></sup>&nbsp;of being gluttonous<sup><sup>32</sup></sup>&nbsp;or greedy,<sup><sup>33</sup></sup>&nbsp;of being a Sabbath breaker,<sup><sup>34</sup></sup>&nbsp;of being austere<sup><sup>35</sup></sup>&nbsp;or harsh, of being a winebibber<sup><sup>36</sup></sup>&nbsp;or a drunk, or of things that we would call "black magic," or casting out devils by the power of the prince of devils.<sup><sup>37</sup></sup>&nbsp;And above all, they even said that God himself<sup><sup>38</sup></sup>&mdash;"the greatest of all"<sup><sup>39</sup></sup>&mdash;"hath a devil."<sup><sup>40</sup></sup>&nbsp;It is interesting that many of the accusations made against Jesus Christ have been and continue to be made against the Prophet Joseph Smith. Such accusations are evidence that he was more&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;the Savior than any other person on this earth. Please take a moment to ponder such testimonies of the Prophet Joseph Smith, given by those who knew him best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Brigham Young</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>"Who can justly say aught [or anything] against Joseph Smith?<sup><sup>41</sup></sup>&nbsp;I was as well acquainted with him, as any man. I do not believe that his father and mother knew him any better than I did. I do not think that a man lives on the earth that knew him any better than I did; and I am bold to say that, Jesus Christ excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth. I am his witness."<sup><sup>42</sup></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup><sup></sup></sup><em>John Taylor</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>"Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it."<sup><sup>43</sup></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup><sup></sup></sup><em>Boyd K. Packer</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>"...I know that Joseph Smith was a mighty prophet, seer, and revelator. With the exception of Jesus Christ, he is the greatest being who ever walked the face of this earth."<sup><sup>44</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Many others have also testified of the greatness of Joseph Smith. Let's take a moment to watch President Gordon B. Hinckley share his witness of the Prophet:</p>
<p>Though Joseph's life was taken at an early age, his testimony of the Eternal God and the risen Lord lives on with luster and eloquence. I look to him. I love him. I seek to follow him. I read his words, and they become the standards to be observed in guiding this great Church as it moves forward in fulfilling its eternal destiny. To slightly paraphrase the words of our wonderful hymn:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.<br />Ever and ever the keys he will hold.<br />Faithful and true, he&nbsp;<em>has</em><sup><sup>45</sup></sup>&nbsp;entered God's kingdom,<br />Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.<br />Such is my solemn and sacred witness to you, my brethren and sisters.<sup><sup>46</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>What President Hinckley revealed about Joseph Smith is most sacred&mdash;I hope you felt it. I hope you also noticed that he, as president of the Church, said "I look to [Joseph Smith]. I love him. I seek to follow him. I read his words, and they become the standards to be observed in guiding this great Church."<sup><sup>47</sup></sup></p>
<p><strong>Search the Scriptures</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>This leads to the second thing we can do to more fully know the Prophet Joseph Smith&mdash;to study his words. Joseph Smith's words are still, and always will be, the standard for guiding the true Church of Christ. The Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;words and commandments which&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;shall give unto you as&nbsp;<em>he</em>receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.<sup><sup>48</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>The Lord also told Joseph Smith that "this generation shall have my word through you."<sup><sup>49</sup></sup>&nbsp;The word of the Lord&mdash;the standard works&mdash;have all come to us through Joseph Smith. He gave us the Bible&mdash;in particular those plain and precious excerpts in the Joseph Smith Translation; the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift of God; the Pearl of Great Price; and the Doctrine and Covenants. These books "contain the fulness of the everlasting gospel"<sup><sup>50</sup></sup>&nbsp;of Jesus Christ, and they are essential for our salvation.<sup><sup>51</sup></sup>&nbsp;King Benjamin's words have special meaning to us today, when he said, "...were it not for these [scriptures], which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God...even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should...know nothing concerning these things."<sup><sup>52 53</sup></sup></p>
<p>In writing the scriptures, the ancient prophets had their eyes fixed, not only on Jesus Christ, but also Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith taught that "prophets, priests and kings have...looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day."<sup><sup>54</sup></sup>&nbsp;We can come to see the Prophet Joseph&mdash;including his mission and his character&mdash;all throughout the scriptures. We can see him extensively in the words of Isaiah;<sup><sup>55</sup></sup>&nbsp;in the great King Josiah;<sup><sup>56 57</sup></sup>&nbsp;in the "stone...cut out of a mountain without hands"<sup><sup>58</sup></sup>&nbsp;prophesied of by Daniel; as the "faithful and wise servant"<sup><sup>59</sup></sup>&nbsp;spoken of by Jesus; and as the "choice seer" spoken of by Joseph<sup><sup>60</sup></sup>&nbsp;and Lehi.<sup><sup>61</sup></sup>&nbsp;We can find him hidden in parables such as the leaven hid in the three measures of meal,<sup><sup>62</sup></sup>and the servant who converses with the Lord throughout Zenos' allegory of the olive tree.<sup><sup>63</sup></sup>&nbsp;We can find him with his brother Hyrum as the fellow-servants slain "under the altar that John saw,"<sup><sup>64 65 66</sup></sup>&nbsp;and all throughout the Book of Revelation.<sup><sup>67</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>As we humbly search the scriptures, we will come to know both Jesus Christ and his servant, Joseph Smith. In this connection, may I offer a suggestion to all of us? If we truly desire to know the Prophet, we must go to the right source&mdash;and that is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>a Google search. As President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "Today, with the abundance of books available, it is the mark of a truly educated man to know what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to read."<sup><sup>68</sup></sup>The Lord gave us the key to knowing Joseph Smith when he said, "seek ye out of the&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;books words of wisdom."<sup><sup>69</sup></sup>&nbsp;And what are the&nbsp;<em>best</em>books? They are the scriptures.<sup><sup>70</sup></sup>&nbsp;The Savior taught that we "shall know them by their fruits."<sup><sup>71</sup></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>We will come to know the Prophet by daily partaking of his fruit&mdash;the scriptures&mdash;more than any other writings.<sup><sup>72 73 74</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup><strong>Be Loyal to the Church</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The third thing we must do to come to know Joseph Smith is to be loyal to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We cannot know the Savior or Joseph Smith without being one hundred percent loyal to this Church, and to the priesthood keys held by the prophets who now preside over it. Elder Heber C. Kimball prophesied of a time "when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work."<sup><sup>75</sup></sup>&nbsp;I believe that time is at hand. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us a key for navigating such troubled times. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All Saints! Profit by this important Key&mdash;that in all your trials, troubles, temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments and death, see to it...that you do not betray Jesus Christ; that you do not betray the brethren; that you do not betray the revelations of God, whether in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doctrine and Covenants...Yea, in all your kicking and flounderings, see to it that you do not this thing, lest innocent blood be found upon your skirts, and you go down to hell.<sup><sup>76</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>As President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "Our task is to stick with the kingdom, not to let anything or anybody disaffect or sour us toward that great gift which Christ has given us&mdash;his church."<sup><sup>77</sup></sup></p>
<p><strong>Who is Joseph Smith?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Today, we have reflected on a few testimonies of and about Joseph Smith. We know he is a mighty prophet. We know that he is a choice seer, and the great revelator and testator. Although we have received so many blessings through him, do we really know him? Do we know how great he really is? He said "...You don't know me; you never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it...I never did harm any man since I was born in the world...I never think any evil,<sup><sup>78</sup></sup>&nbsp;nor do anything to the harm of my fellow-man. When I am called by the trump of the archangel and weighed in the balance, you will all know me then. I add no more. God bless you all."<sup><sup>79</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Perhaps we will only fully know the greatness of Joseph Smith after this life. According to those who associated with him, the Prophet said, "Would to God, brethren, I could tell you who I am! Would to God I could tell you what I know! But you would call it blasphemy, and there are men upon this stand who would want to take my life."<sup><sup>80</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Such evil men&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;take the life of Joseph Smith. But, as Brigham Young testified, "though they have killed his body, yet he lives and beholds the face of his Father in Heaven."<sup><sup>81</sup></sup>&nbsp;Today, I believe, and am sure, that Joseph Smith has "triumph[ed] over all his enemies...and the last enemy was death."<sup><sup>82</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><strong>In Due Time</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Brothers and sisters, we have not seen the last of Joseph Smith. He is not merely a prophet of the past. When Joseph and Hyrum were in Carthage, Elder Parley P. Pratt was traveling on his way home to Nauvoo from a mission. In the very hour their innocent blood was being shed, "a strange and solemn awe" came over Elder Pratt, "as if the powers of hell were let loose."<sup><sup>83</sup></sup>&nbsp;When he later heard that Joseph and Hyrum had been killed, he cried out in anguish:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O Lord! In the name of Jesus Christ I pray Thee, show me what these things mean, and what I shall say to Thy people [in Nauvoo]? On a sudden the Spirit of God came upon me...and while the spirit of revelation glowed in my bosom with as visible a warmth and gladness as if it were fire. The Spirit said unto me: "Lift up your head and rejoice; for behold! It is well with my servants Joseph and Hyrum. My servant Joseph still holds the keys of my kingdom in this dispensation, and he shall stand in due time on the earth, in the flesh, and fulfill that to which he is appointed.<sup><sup>84</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>President Brigham Young gave the same witness. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph Smith, Jr. will again be on this earth dictating plans and calling forth his brethren...and he will never cease his operations, under the directions of the Son of God, until the last ones of the children of men are saved that can be, from Adam till now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Should not this thought comfort all people? They will, by-and-by, be a thousand times more thankful for such a man as Joseph Smith, Junior, than it is possible for them to be for any earthly good whatever. It is his mission to see that all the children of men...are saved, that can be, through the redemption.<sup><sup>85</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Now, brothers and sisters, when compared to these testimonies of the Lord's prophets, my own testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith may mean very little to you. But, it is&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;to me. All spiritual blessings from the Lord have come to me because of Joseph Smith. All of the scriptures, the priesthood, my baptism for the remission of my sins, the Gift of the Holy Ghost which bears a true witness of the Father and the Son to me, the ordinances of the temple which bind my ancestors and my posterity to me and my precious wife&mdash;all of these blessings and endless others are given unto me because of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I love him. It is because of him that the very blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ can be fastened and made sure unto us.</p>
<p>I invite all to gain a sound and enduring witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, which has come through him. It is my prayer that each of us will reverence the name of Joseph Smith in word and in deed, that in a future day many of us&mdash;perhaps millions&mdash;"shall know Brother Joseph again."<sup><sup>86</sup></sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith revealed that the three measures of meal in this parable represent "three witnesses." Although it has been suggested that these three witnesses were the witnesses of the gold plates (i.e., Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris), the Prophet taught that the three witnesses were actually the scriptures revealed through him (i.e., the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Inspired Version of the Bible). He said, "It may be understood that the Church of the Latter-day Saints has taken its rise from a little leaven that was put into three witnesses. Behold, how much this is like the parable! It is fast leavening the lump, and will soon leaven the whole...For the works of this example, see the Book of Mormon coming forth out of the treasure of the heart. Also the [Doctrine and] Covenants given to the Latter-day Saints, also the translation of the Bible-thus bringing forth out of the heart things new and old, thus answering to three measures of meal undergoing the purifying touch by a revelation of Jesus Christ, and the ministering of angels, who have already commenced this work in the last days, which will answer to the leaven which leavened the whole lump."&nbsp;(Joseph Smith,<em>History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>, 2:270, 272.).63. See Jacob 5:7-76, especially note verses 62-63 and 70-72; compare with D&amp;C 103:21.64. See Revelation 6:9-11; D&amp;C 135:7. Also note that John the Baptist-who (along with his father Zacharias) was likely the first martyr John saw after the opening of the fifth seal-personally addressed Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery as "my fellow servants" when conferring the Priesthood of Aaron upon them (see D&amp;C 13:1; Joseph Smith-History 1:69).65. The declaration in D&amp;C 135:7-which identifies Joseph and Hyrum Smith as the fellow servants John saw in vision-is corroborated by an interesting experience of Captain John Lawn, as reported by his son: "My father was one of the guards, placed by Governor Ford, at Carthage Jail, the day before Joseph and Hyrum Smith were martyred; and heard each of them speak from the stairway to the guard below; and when Hyrum spoke, he told them to take their pencils and note down Revelation, the sixth chapter, from ninth to eleventh verses inclusive; 'For,' said he, 'that is now about to be fulfilled.'...My father made a note of it, at once, and was so much affected by what he had both seen and heard while there, that as soon as he was released from duty that evening, he came home and read those three verses to my mother, and turned the leaf down. The above incident was told me by my mother, some years afterward, as nearly as I can remember, as related by her; and she showed the Bible to me, with the verses marked, and the leaf down. I have this Bible now, just as he left it in 1847, when he died."&nbsp;(J. H. Lawn, "The Story of My Conversion: How I Heard and Accepted the Latter-day Message", from&nbsp;<em>Autumn Leaves</em>, 22:61-62; see also Randal A. Wright,&nbsp;<em>The Book of Mormon Miracle: 25 Reasons to Believe</em>, 323.).66. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, "Hyrum Smith became a president of the Church with Joseph Smith, which place Oliver Cowdery might have held had he not wavered and fallen from his exalted station. I am firmly of the opinion that had Oliver Cowdery remained true to his covenants and obligations as a witness with Joseph Smith, and retained his authority and place, he, and not Hyrum Smith, would have gone with Joseph Smith as a prisoner and to martyrdom at Carthage." (Joseph Fielding Smith,&nbsp;<em>Doctrines of Salvation&nbsp;</em>(1954), 1:219.).67. The following claim Joseph Smith made about the Book of Revelation may be an indication that a substantial part of the book is actually about himself. He said: "Now, I make this declaration, that those things which John saw in heaven had no allusion to anything that had been on the earth previous to that time, because they were the representation of 'things which must shortly come to pass,' and not of what has already transpired...<em>The book of Revelation is one of the plainest books God ever caused to be written</em>. The revelations do not give us to understand anything of the past in relation to the kingdom of God."<br />(Joseph Smith,&nbsp;<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, comp. by Joseph Fielding Smith (1976), 290; emphasis added.).68.

McConkie, "Joseph Smith: A Revealer of Christ",&nbsp;<em>BYU Devotional Address</em>, 3 September 1978, 6-7.73. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "...the Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth...and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book." (See Introduction to the Book of Mormon.).74. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, "It makes no difference what is written or what anyone has said, if what has been said is in conflict with what the Lord has revealed, we can set it aside. My words, and the teaching of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them. Let us have this matter clear. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man's doctrine. You cannot accept the books written by the authorities of the Church as standards in doctrine, [except] in so far as they accord with the revealed word in the standard works."&nbsp;(Joseph Fielding Smith,<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>&nbsp;(1956), 3:203.).75.

Prior to coming here he pursued his formal education at BYU, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the University of Montana. Over the past 15 years he has taught various classes, including Writing and Reasoning Foundations, Introduction to Literature, Drama as Literature, Fundamentals of Literary Interpretation, and Writing Poetry. <br /><br /> Mark's work in the church includes assignments in the Primary, Young Men's, Elders' quorum, and bishopric.</p>
<p>While Mark enjoys writing, reading, collecting sports' cards, running, and playing any sport with a racquet, above all he loves traveling and spending time with his wife, Kristine, their four daughters and one son.</p>
<p></p>
<p>President and Sister Gilbert, faculty, staff, students and friends, I am humbled by the invitation to speak to you today. As I share some thoughts I pray the Holy Ghost will sanction my words and convey to all of us a specific invitation to become more like our Savior Jesus Christ. I further pray that the Spirit will edify us during this time together.</p>
<p>You've all entered a remarkable season of life. For many of you, it's your first time living away from home. You're making decisions on your own, feeling a measure of freedom, figuring out your likes and dislikes, and seeing how your experiences measure up against your parents' advice. In the university setting you encounter a variety of knowledge, ask all kinds of questions, write about everything from geology to visual art, take exams, and try to anticipate future trials and blessings. As you gain an education, live with roommates, work part-time jobs, and socialize with others, you develop a greater sense of identity and purpose. It is an exciting and terrifying time&mdash;a time of hope and ambivalence. Elder Hales, speaking of you, called this season the "decade of decision."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;He said this because, generally speaking, the decisions we make between the ages of 18 to 30 will establish powerful patterns for the rest of our lives. What you do now will impact your life in grand and subtle ways in the years ahead.<br /><br />Near the end of last semester I ran into a student who took two classes from me during my first year as a teacher. I was thrilled to see her, meet her husband, and learn about her family. We spoke at length about her trials and triumphs. I rejoiced to see that her testimony of the gospel had grown and that she was staying true to her temple covenants. Our reunion reminded me of Alma when the scriptures share with us what it was like for him to see the sons of Mosiah after fourteen years of preaching the gospel among the Lamanites. It had been approximately the same amount of time since I'd seen this student. The book of Alma relates, "Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;This dear student still lived a life of burning faith and committed discipleship. Life had presented its share of personal challenges. Amid her various trials and decisions, she continued to live a life of faith, humility, integrity, and charity. I trust you've had similar reunions with friends and family members.<br /><br />There is supernal joy in seeing someone we love make righteous choices, keep their sacred temple covenants, and diligently serve the Lord. This joy is especially sweet when we reunite after a long season of absence. On the other hand, there is pain when we see those we love make decisions that limit their growth, turn away from God, and by and by reject His gospel.<br /><br />When you and I run into each other at some restaurant or park in twenty years, what will our response be? What will our walk with the Lord be like at that point in our lives? My desire and prayer is that we'll still be "brethren [and sisters] in the Lord,"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;that we'll feel what Ammon did, being "swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength,"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;that we'll still live according to our baptismal and temple covenants. With an eye toward your eternal well-being and a desire for all of us to remain firm in the faith until the end of our lives, I share three scriptural paradigms or examples that can help us stay true to the Lord and His restored gospel regardless of what may beset us along the road home to our Father in Heaven.<br /><br /><strong>Paradigm #1: The Penitent Woman</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In the book of Luke we learn that Simon, a Pharisee, invites the Lord to eat with him. While the Lord dines in Simon's home, a woman who has a reputation as a sinner comes to worship the Savior. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. After this cleansing, she then kisses his feet and anoints them with valuable ointment. Jesus welcomes this experience, yet Simon and others within his household are suspicious of both the Lord and the woman. Simon says to himself that if the Lord knew who this woman was He would not associate with her. At this point, the Lord discerns Simon's thoughts and tells him the story of the creditor and two debtors. One debtor owed 500 pence and the other owed 50. The creditor forgives both debts and Jesus asks Simon, which of these two individuals most loves the creditor? Simon correctly replies that the one who had the larger debt loved the creditor more. Jesus concludes this story by relaying how it is analogous to their current situation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this&nbsp;woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her&nbsp;sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is&nbsp;forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.&nbsp;And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this&nbsp;that forgiveth sins also? And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee;&nbsp;go in peace.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Over the next twenty years, you and I will make mistakes. We will sin and fall "short of the glory of God."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Often when we choose poorly, our first reaction is to cloak our sin. We are like the persona in George Herbert's poem "Love (3)" when he admits, "Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back, / Guilty of dust and sin" (1-2).<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We become adept at fooling everyone, even ourselves at times. But we can never deceive the Lord. What strikes me about this woman is her ability to recognize her sin. While she doesn't come out and say she has sinned, we see this acknowledgement as she weeps. Her expression of remorse evidences a broken heart and contrite spirit. Instead of running away, she owns her mistake and tries to "restore the pledge"<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;to make reconciliation. Unfortunately, others had labeled her; however, she does not let these appellations stop her from drawing close to the Savior and worshipping Him. Since the time Jesus enters Simon's home this good woman keeps the full measure of her thoughts, attention, energy, and focus on the Lord and on Him alone. She does not seem to care what others think or say of her. Rather she cares only what Christ thinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, she serves and loves by doing some uncomfortable things. She publicly washes, kisses, and cleanses the Savior's feet. Repentance requires us to do some demanding tasks. We may need to visit with the bishop and confess our sins. We may be required to not partake of the sacrament for a season. We may have to apologize publicly for behavior that affects a large swath of people. We may have to break ties with individuals, groups, or organizations. We may be subjected to unjust and condemning labels. Repenting completely will entail doing something strenuous now to avoid agony in the future. Our whole focus on the Lord will have far greater consequences for us in the present and will be far less painful than what might happen in the future if we run and hide from Him.<br /><br />Furthermore, this dear sister gives a valuable gift to the Lord: an alabaster box of ointment.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;This costly present was an extension of her heartfelt desire to repent, know the Savior, and understand His will for her. She extends to Him one of her very best gifts, treating Him as the Beloved Son of our Heavenly Father; whereas Simon seems to treat the Lord like a curiosity or movie star. Similar to the penitent woman, do we repent with all our hearts and bestow our most precious talents of time, effort, honesty, goods, and love to the Lord? Or do we hold back a portion of our hearts and casually worship Him? Speaking of repentance, Elder Holland admonishes us:<br /><br />You can change anything you want to change, and you can do it very fast.&nbsp;Another satanic sucker punch is that it takes years and years and eons of&nbsp;eternity to repent. That's just not true. It takes exactly as long to repent as&nbsp;it takes you to say, "I'll change"&mdash;and mean it. Of course there will be&nbsp;problems to work out and restitutions to make. You may well spend&mdash;indeed&nbsp;you had better spend&mdash;the rest of your life proving your repentance by its&nbsp;permanence. But change, growth, renewal, and repentance can come for you&nbsp;as instantaneously as they did for Alma and the sons of Mosiah. . . Do not&nbsp;misunderstand. Repentance is not easy or painless or convenient. It is a bitter&nbsp;cup from hell. But only Satan, who dwells there, would have you think that&nbsp;a necessary and required acknowledgement is more distasteful than permanent&nbsp;residence. Only he would say, 'You can't change. You won't change. It's&nbsp;too long and too hard to change. Give up. Give in. Don't repent. You are&nbsp;just the way you are.' That is a lie born of desperation. Don't fall for it.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In short, when we sin, may we go quickly and humbly to the Lord. Don't wait, thinking you're not redeemable. Be wary of feeling you can repent later or on your own or that you need to be better before you ask the Lord for help. Don't wait, thinking you'd rather not burden the bishop and the Redeemer. Go now.&nbsp;<em>Recognize your sins and give them to God.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Remember He died for all of us. Remember this dear woman and go with your whole soul and everything you hope to become. In turn, you'll receive his benediction, "Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Paradigm #2: The Lad</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>While here at BYU-Idaho and upon graduating, you'll participate in diverse wards. You have been and will be called upon to feed those for whom you have a particular stewardship. The Lord teaches us about our responsibilities when He and His disciples fed the 5,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When Jesus lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he&nbsp;saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? And&nbsp;this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. Philip&nbsp;answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them,&nbsp;that every one of them may take a little. One of his disciples, Andrew, . . .&nbsp;saith unto him, There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two&nbsp;small fishes: but what are they among so many? And Jesus said, Make the men&nbsp;sit down. . . . So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus&nbsp;took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples,&nbsp;and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much&nbsp;as they would.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As Christ's disciples, we are responsible to feed the flock regardless of our official calling. Some of you currently work in visible capacities. Others serve behind the scenes. Our stewardships will change depending on the seasons of our lives. Within each of our duties in the kingdom, from time to time we face complexities that seem insurmountable. The Lord knows how He can help us, yet sometimes He asks us a question to prove our willingness to trust in Him and Him alone. Philip and Andrew think it is impossible to feed the 5,000. Yet the account mentions a lad who has presumably done his part to prepare food for perhaps his family or others in need. The lad is at best inconspicuous in this story; nonetheless, the Lord uses this boy's offering and multiplies it a thousand-fold.</p>
<p>At one level we are this lad. Each of us has skills and talents, which in the aggregate do not amount to much. We bring the equivalent of five loaves and two small fishes to our corner of the kingdom. Some of you may feel a bit overwhelmed by your current assignment in the church. You may serve in an elders quorum or Relief Society presidency and feel the daunting task of helping your brothers and sisters come unto Christ. Somewhat like Andrew you may question, "What can I do among the needs and challenges of so many?" Yet, remember the Lord knew what He would do. He multiplied the lad's offering, providing so much food that we learn "[w]hen they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Will the Lord not do the same for us as we ask in faith and believe that He can bless us in our callings?<br /><br />Now you may say, "But, Brother Bennion, I am only a visiting teacher right now and the women I work with are fine." Or you may think, "I serve as the secretary in the Sunday School organization, and my responsibility seems mundane and at times pointless." The lack of real and/or perceived duty may make you want to slack off or cause you to think that the Lord does not care about you and your offering. However, let me assure you He does care and will use you as you are in the right spot at the right time doing the right thing. The key here is for us to engage in His work. The Lord knows that when you and I perform our duty we'll save souls and that soul may be our own. President Heber J. Grant, seventh President of the Church, offers the following insight regarding duty: "There is no danger of any man or woman losing his or her faith in this Church if he or she is humble and prayerful and obedient to duty. I have never known of such an individual losing his faith. By doing our duty faith becomes perfect knowledge."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;President Grant promises, "There is no power given to the adversary of men's souls to destroy us if we are doing our duty."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;It does not matter how small or grand or insignificant or visible our responsibility. What matters is that when we accept our task and act in faith, asking for God's assistance He will multiply our efforts just as He did the lad's. &nbsp;<br /><br />Remember, too, Adam's response when he received the commandment to sacrifice. "[H]e was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Like most of us when called to a new assignment, we do not know most or any reasons for such a calling. In fact, we are usually overwhelmed and nervous. However, when we serve consistently over an extended time period, the answers come quietly, naturally, and certainly. After he offers sacrifices,&nbsp;<em>not before</em>, Adam learns that his offerings are in the similitude of the Son of God. He imparts of his goods to show his dependence on the Lord, and God in return blesses Adam with the presence of the Holy Ghost and a sure knowledge that redemption through the Savior will come. The lad also presents his loaves and fishes, akin to Adam, with an eye single to God's glory; the Lord&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;multiplies that small yet wholehearted effort.<br /><br />He will do the same for you,&nbsp;<em>yet the rewards may not be feeding 5,000 individuals.</em>&nbsp;Nonetheless, He may give you time to accomplish your academic work. He may multiply your energy, allowing you to feel physical health in spite of little sleep. He may multiply your ability to discern the needs of others so that you can lift, encourage, and bless their lives. He may multiply your spiritual gifts so that you can teach your children to be better prepared to fulfill their missions on this earth. I cannot say how He will help you, but I submit that He will at the very least add to the strength of your testimony, your peace, your safety, and your joy in this work.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have an official calling in your ward, please know that our covenant relationship with the Savior is enough to prompt us to action. Praying daily, serving others, keeping the Sabbath Day holy, treasuring constantly the Lord's words, and following the counsel of&nbsp;<em>latter-day</em>&nbsp;prophets and apostles will keep us in the path of duty. Sometimes the temptation exists to think, "Well, I don't have to go to church this Sunday. I don't have an official assignment." Going to church is our duty. Worshipping the Lord with all we are is our responsibility. We shouldn't need an official calling to move us to action. We simply need to associate among our brothers and sisters and find ways to serve. If you feel like the bishop has overlooked you, don't feel slighted or grateful, simply pray to our Father asking, "Lord, please help me utilize my loaves and fishes to nourish those in need. And, Lord, if it be thy will, please multiply my efforts for the benefit of others."</p>
<p><strong>Paradigm #3: Zacharias &amp; Mary</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Over the next twenty years, you and I will encounter circumstances that defy description. We may experience the deaths of loved ones, health challenges, the results of others' poor choices, unemployment, marital problems, family crises, and a score of other difficulties. Conversely, as we look for it we will recognize God's hand working in miraculous ways. Zacharias and Mary were two such souls who experienced nearly the same ineffable, glorious situation.</p>
<p>Zacharias and Elisabeth had prayed to have a son, but for whatever reason that blessing was not forthcoming during the early part of their lives. Several years later, an angel appears to Zacharias, the high priest, as he's officiating in the temple, proclaiming that his wife will bear a son, a child that will turn "many of the children of Israel . . . to the Lord their God."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;This son, the angel asserts, will be an Elias figure, preparing the way for the holy Messiah. The same angel, Gabriel, appears to Mary some six months later. He tells her, "And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup><br /></sup>Both individuals have received holy communication from an angel of the Lord; they have been told that their sons' choices will alter the history of the world. Zacharias and Mary initially feel fear when the angel appears, they experience confusion, and both eventually rejoice at receiving these divine announcements. Even their response to the angel seems similar. Regarding the birth of a son, Zacharias asks, "Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Mary ponders, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;While these questions are nearly parallel, the angel answers them differently. He reproves Zacharias for his unbelief, causing him to be speechless. In the case of Mary, he answers her question and explains what will happen. I have wondered why the angel would have such a different response to both individuals, especially when they've asked nearly the same question. Brother Alan L. Wilkins, former Academic Vice-President at BYU, suggests the following idea:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Both Mary and Zacharias ask how the miraculous, promised events will occur. Yet Zacharias' question must have been uttered in a spirit of doubt. In addition, some have argued that Zacharias is asking for a sign when he says "whereby shall I know this?" If that is true, Gabriel probably took that as further evidence of unbelief. By contrast Mary's question appears almost paradoxical. It appears to question the announcement and yet believe it simultaneously. Of course Mary's question isn't paradoxical at all. She simply is asking for the understanding that she lacks, all the while believing that the event will occur. Her question is . . . remarkable, because it is so fresh and honest.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Zacharias asks from a space of doubt and unbelief. Mary, though, probes out of a sincere and honest heart. This story shows us that asking questions is central to our lives as disciples, yet the way in which we ask questions is equally important.</p>
<p>When we encounter such a moment&mdash;either trying or miraculous or both as was the case with Zacharias and Mary&mdash;we may naturally ask "Why, Lord, did this happen? Why do I not understand? Why am I the recipient of this action or this temptation?" The late Elder Richard G. Scott invites us to frame our challenges and queries in a new way:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">When you face adversity, you can be led to ask many questions. Some serve a useful purpose; others do not. To ask, Why does this have to happen to me? Why do I have to suffer this, now? What have I done to cause this? will lead you into blind alleys. It really does no good to ask questions that reflect opposition to the will of God. Rather ask, What am I to do? What am I to learn from this experience? What am I to change? Whom am I to help? How can I remember my many blessings in times of trial? Willing sacrifice of deeply held personal desires in favor of the will of God is very hard to do. Yet, when you pray with real conviction, 'Please let me know Thy will' and 'May Thy will be done,' you are in the strongest position to receive the maximum help from your loving Father.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>All of us have had, have now, or will have questions about our discipleship, our trials, our doctrine, our history, and/or our relationship to others and God. There are anxieties within our own hearts that are known only to the Lord. He values our queries and yearns to answer us according to the righteous desires of our hearts as well as what's in our best eternal interest. The beauty of the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that it started in response to a young boy's sincere question. Joseph Smith's inquiry to know which of all the churches was right has become a pattern for our own lives today. As Latter-day Saints, we trust and know that God will hear and answer our honest, real-intent, heartfelt prayers. Our task is that when tough personal, professional, or spiritual dilemmas arise from time to time, as we know they will, we take them to the Lord and like Mary probe from a space of sincerity, humility, and belief, making sure we have the faith and courage to submit to the Lord's will as it is made manifest. We must be willing and ready to receive the answer wherever and whenever it may come. Remember Mary's stunning reply to the angel, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;<em>Mary's response foreshadowed and possibly inspired her Son's reaction when He suffered in Gethsemane and prayed to our Father "nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<sup>24</sup></em></p>
<p><em><sup></sup></em>Sometimes answers come immediately and sometimes they come slowly. Often they come "line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little," and then the Lord reassures us by promising, "[B]lessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, . . . for unto him that receiveth I will give more."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Answers&nbsp;<em>reach us</em>&nbsp;through various means. Sometimes they arrive from prophets and apostles. The scriptures tell us that as we receive their words "as if from [the Lord's] own mouth, in all patience and faith . . . [then] the gates of hell shall not prevail against [us]; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before [us], and cause the heavens to shake for [our] good and his name's glory."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;In other moments we may obtain direction from the Holy Ghost, loyal friends, dreams, or personal experiences. Regardless of how inspiration&nbsp;<em>occurs</em>, let us remember that God delights to answer us, but He will do so according to His will, time, and way. He may prove us to see if we will exercise faith in Him. In a period when we rapidly glean information via Google searches and Facebook messages, we would do well to remember that obtaining anything worthwhile in this life requires effort, patience, persistence, and courage.</p>
<p>Finding out His will and then aligning our will with His is one of discipleship's greatest challenges. We worry about what we might lose if or when we turn our lives over to Him, but this test is as ultimately rewarding as it is difficult. Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed, "So many of us are kept from eventual consecration because we mistakenly think that, somehow, by letting our will be swallowed up in the will of God, we lose our individuality (see Mosiah 15:7). What we really are worried about, of course, is not giving up self, but selfish things&mdash;like our roles, our time, our preeminence, and our possessions. No wonder we are instructed by the Savior to lose ourselves (see Luke 9:24). He is only asking us to lose the old self in order to find the new self. It's not a question of losing one's identity but of finding . . . [one's] true identity!"<sup>27</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>The Penitent Woman, The Lad, and Mary</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>These three paradigms can help us stay the course as we finesse the tribulations of mortality. They also relay interesting parallels for us to consider.<br /><br />First, the Lord teaches us&nbsp;<em>life-changing</em>&nbsp;lessons in unassuming, simple ways. In these three experiences, He works through humble and meek individuals to teach us about repentance, duty, and questions. More often than not, the Lord reveals himself to us via natural, quiet means and works through modest servants and straightforward friends. We may miss wonderful, plain, and even unexpected blessings if we get caught up in "looking beyond the mark."<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>Second, in the story of feeding the 5,000 and when the angel appears to Zacharias, we see Philip, Andrew, and Zacharias making mistakes, exhibiting a lack of trust in the Lord. However, later in the scriptures we learn that Zacharias's tongue was loosed; eventually he gave his life as a martyr at the altar of the temple.<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;We also know that Philip and Andrew went on to become diligent defenders of the faith, giving their all for the kingdom's cause. Their examples encourage us to become more valiant and believing. I like to think, too, that Simon the Pharisee accepted and applied the&nbsp;<em>lessons</em>&nbsp;taught to him by the Lord and the penitent woman.<br /><br />Third, two of these three individuals are unnamed. At one level it's unfortunate that we don't know the names of the woman or the lad. However, perhaps we learn through these stories that it's more important to apply gospel principles than to receive credit for doing so. It does not matter to the Lord our station, class, bank accounts, prestige, honors, or lineage. What does matter is that we take up our cross daily, deny ourselves, and follow Him.<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;He will reward us even if and when others do not.<br /><br />Fourth, this past General Conference Elder Neil L. Andersen taught us, "Faith is not by chance, but by choice."<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;As the woman, the lad, and Mary chose faith, they turned taxing experiences into marvelous blessings. Our own difficulties may be the very&nbsp;<em>factors</em>&nbsp;that point us to the Savior, allowing us to see His redemptive hand working in our lives. Faith in Jesus Christ always requires a willingness to risk. That risk will be tested, but if we hold on, we'll witness God's glories and the grandeur of his work. The late Catholic nun and poet Marcella Marie Holloway affirms this concept in her poem "The Risk":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You take a risk when you invite the Lord<br />Whether to dine or talk the afternoon<br />Away, for always the unexpected soon<br />Turns up: a woman breaks her precious nard,<br />A sinner does the task you should assume,<br />A leper who is cleansed must show his proof:<br />Suddenly you see your very roof removed<br />And a cripple clutters up your living room.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There's no telling what to expect when Christ<br />Walks in your door. The table set for four<br />Must often be enlarged and decorum<br />Thrown to the wind. It's His voice that calls them<br />And it's no use to bolt and bar the door:<br />His kingdom knows no bounds of roof, or wall, or floor.<sup>32</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Finally, the paradigms of the penitent woman, the lad, and Mary all lead us to the greatest example of all&mdash;our Savior Jesus Christ. He knows our toils, idiosyncrasies, inner revolutions, joys, pains, failures, and victories. He loves each of us perfectly and yearns to give us the spiritual grace to handle and overcome the vicissitudes of mortality. He is the perfect Exemplar, the great Physician, and our&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;Friend.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic I do not know when or how or if we'll again interact once you leave BYU-Idaho. When you graduate from here, there will be some friends and acquaintances that you will not see until the next life. Irrespective of where we go and how our lives unfold, may we live in such a way that when we ultimately meet again, we'll "still be brethren [and sisters] in the Lord."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;May nothing derail any of us from following Him and His prophet. I testify that the Savior lives and loves each one of us. Repenting weekly, doing our duty, and sincerely petitioning the Lord with an eye single to His will and glory will keep us on the path that leads back to our heavenly home. That reunion will be glorious because we'll each know we've been valiant in applying the atonement of our Redeemer and living our testimony of Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>CEO, Deseret Management Corporation</p>
<p>Keith Brigham McMullin has been the Chief Executive Officer of Deseret Management Corporation since April 2012. He served in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1995 to 2012 with worldwide ecclesiastical and business responsibilities. <br /><br /> Previously, he served as managing director of the Church's Welfare Services activities. He had earlier been with Ford Motor Company and also managed several small businesses. He is a banking and finance graduate of the University of Utah. <br /><br /> He married Carolyn Jean Gibbs and they are parents of 8 children and 26 grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several weeks ago, I awoke early and began preparing for a meeting that was to take place in a distant city. While preparing, the most unusual thought came into my mind. It was this: "Judah and Joseph are going to meet today." The thought caused me to wonder, "What did it mean?" Then, as is so often the case with us mortals, the press of time overwhelmed the "thought for the day," and I was soon on a plane winging to my appointment.<br /><br />Upon landing, my colleagues and I made our way through the airport to the car and driver that had been arranged for. As we approached the vehicle, our driver, Eric (not his real name), greeted us, helped with our bags, and made certain we were comfortably situated. I was in the passenger seat next to him, and as he prepared to pull away from the curb I asked: "Eric, are you a believer?"<br /><br />It was obvious that the question took him by surprise, but he was polite, thought for a moment, then somewhat awkwardly began to answer: "Well," he said, "I am Jewish, and suppose..." Sensing his discomfort, I continued: "You see, Eric, we are going to an important meeting, and we are believers. With your permission, we would like to pray. Is it alright with you if, before you pull away from the curb, we have a prayer together here in your car?" Eric readily agreed, a dear friend of mine said the prayer, and we proceeded on our way.<br /><br />Later that day, Eric drove some of us back to the airport. In the course of the return trip we learned about him, his work, his wife and family, and some of his hopes in life. Then the conversation went something like this: "Eric, you must have really wondered about us this morning when I asked if you are a believer."<br /><br />Eric replied: "I have thought about that question throughout the day. As I said, I am Jewish. Some days I believe there is a God. Other days, I am not sure."<br /><br />He was genuine and open in his answer. My heart was deeply moved. I explained to him the impression that had come over me earlier that morning about Judah and Joseph. "Eric," I said, "you are from Judah, we are from Joseph, and we have met as described. We want you to know there is a God in Heaven. He is our Heavenly Father, and we are all His sons and daughters. On this truth you can rely." At parting, Eric accepted my business card and the invitation to come to Utah and allow us to show him some of the things he might otherwise not see.<br /><br />We are all a bit like Eric&mdash;sometimes we act as we know; on other occasions we are uncertain. Mortality is the time to cure this problem, for every accountable mortal faces three certainties: death, resurrection and judgment. We make a huge mistake if we allow the forces of time and circumstance to crowd from our consciousness these three inevitable happenings. As one beloved apostle observed: "Truly, of all the errors mortals could make, God's plan of salvation is the wrong thing to be wrong about! No error could be more enormous or more everlasting in its consequences!"<sup><sup>1</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>We acknowledge the irrevocable truth that each of us will die. Smart lifestyle choices may postpone it for some, while for others it may come in budding infancy or the prime of life. But come it will. Regardless of time or circumstance there is no uncertainty for any of us about death. Whether protracted or in the "twinkling of an eye"<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>, it will happen to each of us. And while there is no need to worry about it, there is ample reason to prepare for it.<br /><br />There is nothing more central to our faith and future than the holy resurrection. It "is the center point of hope in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the most glorious of all messages to mankind."<sup><sup>3</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>From the Prophet Joseph Smith we have this declaration: "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."<sup><sup>4</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Of this sacred event, President Thomas S. Monson has said, "The most glorious, comforting, and reassuring of all events of human history [is Christ's] victory over death. The pain and agony of Gethsemane and Calvary had been wiped away. The salvation of mankind had been secured. The Fall of Adam had been reclaimed.<br /><br />"The empty tomb that first Easter morning was the answer to Job's question, 'If a man die, shall he live again?' To all within the sound of my voice, I declare, if a man die, he shall live again. We know, for we have the light of revealed truth."<sup><sup>5</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>The evidences of this sacred event are numerous and unassailable. There is the witness of ancient scripture, setting forth with clarity what would occur, and Christ's resurrection happened as scripturally attested.<sup><sup>6</sup></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Our Lord died publicly, undeniably, and mercilessly upon the cross. It took place under the public gaze of family, disciples, and perpetrators alike. He gave up the ghost&mdash;into our Father's hands He commended His spirit. His body hung lifeless for all to see.<br /><br />His body was then removed from the cross, carried and reverentially placed in a rock hewn tomb owned by one Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Sanhedrin, a senator of some repute. The burial is a matter of public record.<sup><sup>7</sup></sup>&nbsp;The entry to the tomb was sealed by a stone, heavy and solid, and presumably impossible for woman or man to move. Even a Roman guard of several soldiers was posted to further ensure that all would know&mdash;Jesus of Nazareth was dead and buried.<br /><br />Within but a few hours of this very public event, women of faith approached the tomb, "found the stone rolled away...and two angels standing by it in shining garments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they entered into the sepulcher, and not finding the body of the Lord Jesus, they were much perplexed thereabout;<br />And were affrighted, and bowed down their faces to the earth. But behold the angels said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<br />He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you ...Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br />And they remembered his words.<sup><sup>8</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Jesus Christ was resurrected. He had burst the fetters of the grave. He had passed from mortality to immortality.</p>
<p>In the days and weeks to come, this would be affirmed again and again by thousands of people in different hemispheres. They would see Him, touch Him, listen to Him, eat and drink with Him, be blessed by Him. The Only Begotten of God the Eternal Father in the flesh, became "...the first begotten of the dead."<sup><sup>9</sup></sup>&nbsp;Thereafter, as further witness, "the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept [or who had died] arose, and came out of the graves...and appeared unto many."<sup><sup>10</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Because of our Lord, Jesus Christ, we are all going to get out of this life alive. The scriptures, ancient and modern, are replete with testimonials and evidences affirming the truth that all of us will resurrect. There is no end to this experience called life. There is no "nothingness" we can go to and be unaccountable for anything or untroubled by truth or severed from tomorrow's opportunities. Quite the opposite! In the words of the Psalmist:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up...thou hast healed me...thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his anger kindleth against the wicked; they repent, and in a moment it is turned away, and they are in his favor, and he giveth them life; therefore, weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.<sup><sup>11</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>As we have noted, the scriptures and personal witnesses affirm the resurrection of Christ and the truth that all men and women, boys and girls, will also resurrect. It seems to me, a point of great importance to note, that in many such accounts, the absolutely certain events of resurrection and judgment are linked. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>"...the atonement bringeth to pass the&nbsp;<em>resurrection</em>&nbsp;of the dead; and the<em>&nbsp;resurrection&nbsp;</em>of the dead<em>&nbsp;</em>bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be<em>&nbsp;judged</em>&nbsp;according to their works..."<sup><sup>12</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>"...the<em>&nbsp;</em>bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the<em>&nbsp;resurrection</em>&nbsp;of the Holy One of Israel."And . . . when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, . . . they must appear<em>&nbsp;</em>before the judgment-seat<em>&nbsp;</em>of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the&nbsp;<em>judgment</em>, and then must they be<em>&nbsp;judged</em>&nbsp;according to the holy judgment of God."<sup><sup>13</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>"...the power of the&nbsp;<em>redemption and the resurrection</em>, which is in Christ, will bring you to stand<em>...before the bar of God</em>..."<sup><sup>14</sup></sup>For us all, resurrection is the time of restoration&mdash;a restoration of body and spirit and a restoration to the mental and spiritual acquirements and attitudes attained in this life.<sup><sup>15&nbsp;</sup></sup>The scriptures say: "O, my son...the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish&mdash;good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.</p>
<p>"Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things...ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again."For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored..."<sup><sup>16</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>The day of judgment is the moment when what we desired most, what we worked for most, what we loved most, we receive in measured fullness. And the final day of judgment inexorably follows the resurrection.<br /><br />"It is requisite with the justice of God," said Alma, "that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good."And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil...for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil."<sup><sup>17</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>It should be evident, however, that we needn't wait until the day of final judgment&mdash;the formal occasion when every soul will stand before the judgment bar&mdash;to learn what the verdict is. We can know that bit-by-bit, day-by-day by the behavior we choose. Therefore, the prospects of resurrection and judgment day can and should guide the daily realities of our lives.<br /><br />One day, while reflecting upon this subject, the notion flooded over me&mdash;"Make an appointment!" This is not as curious as at first it may seem. We are accustomed to making appointments for everything. An appointment is little more than deciding to do something at a certain time. Consciously or subconsciously, formally or informally, we do it daily with ourselves and others. In many ways appointments govern our lives, and the more important they are to us, the more attentive we are to them.<br /><br />Moved by this prompting, I made an appointment&mdash;I decided: on resurrection morning, I am going to be there!<br /><br />After making this appointment in my mind, I became aware I did not want to be there without Carolyn. So I said to her: "I have made an appointment. On the morning of the first resurrection I have decided to be there. Will you join me?" She readily agreed and made a similar entry into her calendar of life.<br /><br />This is an appointment over which each of us has complete control. Such are the divine workings of agency, accountability and the atonement of our Savior. In fact, no one else is going to make this appointment for us. We alone have the power to make this most crucial decision. And time's a wasting.<br /><br />The fullness of all good things, the substance of which an eternal, exalted life is made, come to those present on the morning of the first resurrection. I ask you, therefore, this question:&nbsp;<strong>Where will you be on resurrection morning?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In a cemetery near our home, there stands a head stone designating the burial spot of a beloved father. In addition to the name and dates of birth and death are also engraved the words: "Goodnight. See you in the morning." Can you see the profound, stirring message of this simple epithet?<br /><br />Decide today that you will be present on the morning of the first resurrection. Write it down in the calendars of your heart and mind. Make it guide your daily routines. Do not question, postpone, or change the appointment. Keep it and you, with the Lord's help, will make up any deficiencies that may exist. After all, you do have a lifetime to get ready.<br /><br />There is a pathway that leads to this appointment. Put your feet on that path and you will arrive on time. In the words of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, it works this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You get on the path that's named the 'straight and narrow.' You do it by entering the gate of repentance and baptism. The straight and narrow path leads from the gate of repentance and baptism, a very great distance to a reward that's called eternal life. If you're on that path and pressing forward, and you die, you'll never get off the path. There is no such thing as falling off the straight and narrow path in the life to come, and the reason is that this life is the time that is given to men to prepare for eternity. Now is the time and the day of your salvation, so if you're working zealously in this life&mdash;though you haven't fully overcome the world and you haven't done all you hoped you might do&mdash;you're still going to be saved...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What you have to do is stay in the mainstream of the Church and live as upright and decent people live in the Church&mdash;keeping the commandments, paying your tithing, serving in the organizations of the Church, loving the Lord, staying on the [strait] and narrow path. If you're on that path when death comes&mdash;because this is the time and the day appointed, this is the probationary estate&mdash;you'll never fall off from it, and, for all practical purposes, your calling and election is made sure. Now, that isn't the definition of that term, but the end result will be the same.<sup><sup>18</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Said President Brigham Young:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no spirit but what was pure and holy when it came here from the celestial world... He is the Father of our spirits; and if we could know, understand, and do His will, every soul would be prepared to return back into His presence. And when they get there, they would see that they had formerly lived there for ages, that they had previously been acquainted with every nook and corner, with the palaces, walks, and gardens; and they would embrace their Father, and He would embrace them and say, 'My son, my daughter, I have you again;' and the child would say, 'O my Father, my Father, I am here again.'<sup><sup>19</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>Mortal life is like unto the traveler on a homeward journey. The miles seem long, the minutes slow, the events of the day protracted and tedious. Eventually, however, familiar scenes come into view. They may be hills or valleys, country landscapes or towering buildings, a teeming thoroughfare or a quiet neighborhood street. Whatever the scene, its familiarity quickens the traveler's step, invigorates his wearied soul, and restores sweet feelings of anticipation, hope and peace.</p>
<p>The resurrection is the sure and certain destination of every creature. Our Eternal Father wants us home, and the way to the resurrection is through Christ the Lord. Though the resurrection is the same for all, time and judgment and eternal blessings are as varied as we mortals are.<br /><br />With all the power of which I am capable, I bear witness to the truthfulness of these things. The fullness of all good things, the substance of true joy, exaltation, and eternal life, come to those present on the morning of the first resurrection. So make your appointment today and keep it. Let this journey take you back where you belong. Recalling a familiar refrain, I leave with you with this testimonial:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O my Father, thou that dwellest<br />In the high and glorious place,<br />I do yearn to once again be<br />With Thee, and behold Thy face.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then shall I, in adoration,<br />Bow before my Savior dear,<br />Thank Him for His great Atonement,<br />Wash His feet with many tears.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And with grateful heart a-swelling,<br />Seeing I am not alone,<br />Will feel Thy love and hear Thy greeting&mdash;<br />Sons and daughters, welcome home!<sup><sup><sup>20</sup></sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup><sup></sup></sup></sup>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p><strong>Elder Mervyn Bennion Arnold </strong>was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2009, after serving in the Second Quorum of the Seventy since April 5, 2003. He is a former president of the Costa Rica San Jos&eacute; Mission, counselor in a stake presidency, stake high councilor, bishop, elders' quorum president, and full-time missionary in the Northern Mexico Mission.<br /><br />He is currently serving at Church headquarters. He previously served as Area President in the South America South Area in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He has also served as Assistant Executive Director in Salt Lake City, in the Temple Department and on the Boundary and Leadership Change Committee, the President of the Brazil South Area, and as a counselor in the Brazil North and Brazil South Areas.<br /><br />Before his call as a General Authority, Elder Arnold earned a bachelor's degree in business and a master's degree in public administration from Brigham Young University. He founded and co-owned a building and development company. Later he expanded and was a co-founder of Guardian State Bank. After he retired, he became Director of Training and Field Services in the Missionary Department of the Church, where he was working when called as a General Authority.<br /><br />Elder Arnold was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. He and his wife, Devonna Kress Arnold, have six children.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Last evening we had a wonderful experience with Brother and Sister Eyring and their family. They spoke with fondness of how wonderful you are. I sincerely pray that each of you will feel of the love that Sister Arnold and I have for you, and that you will join us in seeking the "fulness of the Holy Ghost" so that you will feel more than you hear.<br /><br />A few days before each general conference, the General Authorities and auxiliary leaders gather in an auditorium in the Church Office Building. We sit at the feet of prophets and apostles and are taught by them.<br /><br />Near the conclusion of one of these training sessions, President Henry B. Eyring, a member of the First Presidency of the Church, invited each one of us to experience an increase of the Savior's image in our countenance prior to returning to the next general conference in six months. I promise you that I sat up and took notice! This invitation to experience an increase of the Savior's image in our countenances has had a profound effect on my life.<br /><br />We are all aware of the account in the Book of Mormon when Alma asked the members of the Church: "Now behold, I ask of you, my brethren [and sisters] of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?"<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Ponder with me this question: What am I doing to increase the Savior's image in my countenance?<br /><br />Let's review an incident that occurred involving John the Baptist.<br /><br />When the disciples of John the Baptist came to him expressing concern that John's followers were now seeking out Jesus, instead of continuing to follow John, John responded:<br /><br />"I am not the Christ."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;"He must increase, but I must decrease."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;What a profound seven&mdash;word sermon. Let's ponder for a moment this phrase&mdash;"He must increase, but I must decrease"-and liken it unto ourselves.<br /><br />First, we know that John the Baptist remained true to his mission and his testimony, and continued to fulfill&nbsp;a ministry that spanned three dispensations.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;So how did John decrease? Did his importance decrease? Did Jesus's love for him decrease? Did his usefulness in God's kingdom decrease? Of course not! Just as John recognized that Christ must increase in his life, so too must Christ increase in our lives so that we can become, as the Savior taught, "Even as I am."<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>What might need to decrease in us? Notoriety? Selfishness? Pride? The natural man? The Guide to the Scriptures teaches us that the natural man is "a person who chooses to be influenced by the passions, desires, appetites, and senses of the flesh rather than by the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Such a person can comprehend physical things but not spiritual things...Each person must be born again through the atonement of Jesus Christ to cease being a natural man."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Ponder this question. Does your spirit, which was created by your heavenly parents, rule your physical body, or does your physical body rule your spirit? How can you tell? The Apostle Paul, speaking to the Corinthians, explained this very important concept:<br /><br />"There is ... no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit...<br /><br />For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<strong></strong><br /><br />For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Satan is working overtime to have your physical body rule your spirit and "mind the things of the flesh." Sexual transgressions, including pornography, are unclean things. Pornography in any of its forms&mdash;including Internet images, verbal messages, sexting, magazines, and anything like unto it&mdash;clearly violates the law of chastity.<br /><br />Satan would have you think that pornography is not affecting anyone but you, that no one else will know, that you can quit anytime, or that when you are married, you can do whatever you want and it certainly will not affect your marriage. Each of these examples are untrue. Pornography is worse than any plague I have witnessed in my entire life. It is destroying the lives of many children, youth, young adults, prospective missionaries, husbands, and wives.<br /><br />In the most recent October 2015&nbsp;<em>Ensign,</em>&nbsp;Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke clearly on the issue of pornography. He counseled:<br /><br />"Pornography ... is destructive of spiritual sensitivity, it weakens ability to exercise priesthood power, and it harms precious relationships...<br /><br />... Scientists have discovered that sexual images produce chemicals in the brain that reward sexual feelings, which then encourage more attention to sexual behavior."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We should do everything possible to create a safe environment that drastically reduces access to pornography and other sexual triggers, and we encourage those in need to seek support from priesthood leaders, groups such as the Church's Addiction Recovery Program, aids on the Church's website, and, as needed a trusted counselor or therapist who has had special training and success in treating such issues. If you are involved in any type of pornography, please go see your bishop. He will lovingly help guide you through the needed steps to help you repent and heal.<br /><br />Oftentimes pornography use can lead its victims down the path of other sexual transgressions. Concerning moral transgressions, including the sin of viewing pornography, the prophets have clearly spoken when they taught, and I quote: "Never do anything that could lead to sexual transgression.&nbsp;<em>Treat others with respect</em>, not as objects used to satisfy lustful and selfish desires. Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body. Pay attention to the promptings of the Spirit so that you can be clean and virtuous. The Spirit of the Lord will withdraw from one who is involved in sexual transgression."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Could there be any clearer instruction?</p>
<p>Satan would deceive you by trying to convince you that the advice of the prophets is old fashioned, outdated, and no longer applies, and besides it is no big deal to be immoral&mdash;you are young and can quickly repent. The prophet Nephi warns us of the consequences of thinking we can premeditate sin and then quickly repent:<br /><br />"Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.<br /><br />... Nevertheless, fear God&mdash;he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, ... and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.<br /><br />Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated:</p>
<p>"We are concerned that some people...say, 'I'll just have a few free ones, and then I'll repent quickly and go on a mission [or get married in the temple], and everything will be all right.<br /><br />&nbsp;... Members of the Church who commit serious transgressions knowingly and deliberately, relying on their supposed ability to repent speedily and be 'as good as new' ... want to experience the sin but avoid its effects."<br /><br />There are no shortcuts to repentance or quick fixes.<br /><br />And "the Holy Spirit of Promise [must put his] divine stamp of approval ... upon our ordinances and covenants ... [and he] cannot be deceived."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Those who feel they can break the commandments, leaving those persons they use or abuse with scars of depression, lowered self-esteem, and&mdash;at times&mdash;a lifetime of emotional disarray, and then feel they can quickly repent and be immediately forgiven with few if any consequences are sadly mistaken.<br /><br />If anyone, or anything, is influencing you to decrease the image of Christ in your countenance, you must recognize that force and do as Joseph of old did when he was tempted by Potiphar's wife. You must flee! I love the word&nbsp;<em>flee</em>! Get out! Fire in the hole! Danger! Run! You can do that. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once said regarding pornography, once you flee, "do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;leave a forwarding address."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And what miraculous things happen when, through the Atonement, we can repent, be cleansed, and receive forgiveness. The word Atonement describes the setting "at one" with those who have been estranged (removed from a customary environment<sup>13</sup>), and denotes the reconciliation of man to God. To be reconciled means "to restore to friendship or harmony<sup>14</sup>." When we are removed from God's presences because of sin, all of us require reconciliation with God. Sin is the cause of the estrangement (removal from God's presence), and therefore the purpose of the Atonement is to correct or overcome the consequences of sin and allow us to be reconciled and eventually live once again in God's presence. The natural man decreases within us as the Savior increases. We let our light shine so that others may glorify Him. He increases not only in influence and power generally, but He also increases&nbsp;<em>in us</em>. We become like Him, "the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters<sup>15&nbsp;</sup>who desire to have the Christlike characteristics that He exemplifies. We can actually become not simply a better version of ourselves but as He commanded us to be&mdash;"Even as I am."<br /><br /><strong>How do we begin to receive His image in our countenance?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, when speaking at a mission presidents' seminar, taught to begin with the end in mind, with [our] minds focused on the temple.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>If you begin with the end in mind, what is your vision of yourself? Would it surprise you that it might be somewhat the same vision if you begin with the beginning in mind?</p>
<p>In the beginning, we were born of heavenly parents, raised in the mansions of our Father<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;for thousands of ages,<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;received our first lessons, including the plan of salvation, which included the Fall, the Atonement, our purpose for coming to earth, and the challenges we might face to strengthen us and draw us closer to God.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;We&nbsp;received gifts and talents to be multiplied,<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;and then God picked the time and the place we would be born.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Life with our heavenly parents can be both our end and our beginning, and we can begin, or continue, our transformation with both the end and the beginning in mind. But our ending does require us to strive throughout our mortal experience for Christ to increase in us, so that we receive His image in our countenance. Because of our mortal experience, our end can be more glorious than our beginning as we qualify for exaltation in the celestial kingdom.<br /><br />Today I would like to share two stories that I hope will illustrate the principles we have been talking about thus far.<br /><br /><strong>Story number 1</strong>&nbsp;is a true story about my friend Doug. I tell you this story with his and his family's permission.<br /><br />Doug learned there are no shortcuts to repentance or quick fixes.<br /><br />Much like many of you, Doug was a faithful youth who grew up surrounded by goodly parents, family, and Church leaders. As a youth, he loved the temple and enjoyed going there.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Doug turned 16, he began his first job, where he worked with people who had values&nbsp;different from those he had been taught. Gradually, Doug turned away from the gospel altogether, and many poor decisions led to various life-threatening addictions. His family realized&nbsp;that after many years of continuous efforts, it would be very difficult to save Doug, who had changed to the point that his countenance was hardly recognizable.<br /><br />Feeling the deep terror that only parents who have had children take such a path understand, and&nbsp;having exhausted every avenue possible, Doug's parents put his future in the hands of the Lord.<br /><br />Ironically, the help they were seeking came when Doug was arrested for selling drugs and put into solitary confinement as a suicide risk. Then a miracle occurred! Doug's heart began to change and, much like the prodigal son, "he came to himself."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;After wading through much tribulation and working hard to overcome his addictions, experiencing the true "godly sorrow [that] worketh repentance,"<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;which involves personal suffering, Doug experienced the change&nbsp;true repentance brings, and he once again began the process of increasing in Christ. Eventually, his countenance began to change.<br /><br />Doug forgot himself and began serving others in the Addiction Recovery Program. As Doug began increasing in Christ, the Savior's&nbsp;image became more evident in his countenance. Doug began keeping the Sabbath day holy and attending church, where he met a truly&nbsp;extraordinary&nbsp;young woman, whom he married, and they are now raising a beautiful family. Like Alma the Younger, Doug became "[a] new creature."<br /><br />What a wonderful thing&nbsp;happens, through the Atonement, as we diligently strive to overcome the natural man within us and as we seek to walk after the things of the spirit instead of the things of the flesh. We truly experience "life and peace"24 as we desire to have the Christ-like attributes that He exemplifies. We can actually become as the Savior commanded us to become-"Even as I am." We can do this.<br /><br /><strong>Story number 2</strong></p>
<p>When President Nelson was young, he attended church without his parents. His biographer writes that "it became a source of increasing concern ... to be reared in a family where the daily application of the gospel was not a high priority." Young President Nelson worried that perhaps they would never be sealed as a family in the temple.<br /><br />He "remembers the day he was looking through the home's storage room and found some bottles of alcoholic beverage. In righteous indignation, and perhaps as an indicator of his growing testimony, he smashed the bottles on the cement floor of the laundry room, pouring their contents down the drain."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;He clearly understood the blessings we receive when we live the Word of Wisdom and recognized early that the body is a temple.<br /><br />But his career as an internationally renowned heart surgeon and medical researcher did not come easily. Because of advanced training and military service, the time between President Nelson getting his doctor's degree and going into practice was 12&frac12; years. During those long and lean years, the Nelsons welcomed their first five children.<br /><br />Of his financial struggles as a newlywed, he remembers: "Finances eventually became so straitened that [my wife] Dantzel took a second job, working evenings as a clerk in a music store downtown. Once, when there was too much month at the end of [our] money, [we] found [our]selves in the hole by about forty-three dollars. On this occasion, [I] picked up Dantzel after school and took her to the LDS Hospital, where [we] each sold a pint of blood for twenty-five dollars. This gave [us] enough cash to retire [our] bills. As the needle was withdrawn from Dantzel's arm, she said, ... 'Don't forget to pay tithing on my blood money!'"<sup>26</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Sister Arnold and I started out in about the same financial condition as President and Sister Nelson. I met Sister Arnold at BYU. After dating for a few months, I decided I wanted to ask her to go steady, so I bought some Neil Diamond tickets and asked her to go to the concert with me. On the way from Provo to Salt Lake, I asked how she would feel about not dating other boys for a time. She thought for what I felt was eternity at the time and then replied, "I guess we can try it for a little while." On the way home from the concert, I asked her to marry me.<br /><br />When we got married a few months later, we had a mere $42 to buy all our furniture. My mother bought us a bed for our wedding present, and the rest of our furniture we purchased from an older woman who was moving into an assisted living center. She gladly sold us all of her very old furniture for the $42.<br /><br />I must admit that most of it looked like Moses had drug it through the Red Sea. The table and chairs were badly worn. The washer and dryer looked as though they had not been used in years, but, to our surprise, they both worked. The couch had only three legs. This actually turned out to be a blessing because my brother Robert gave us an old TV, and when you turned it on, the picture on the screen was on exactly the same slant as the three-legged couch.<br /><br />At the age of 37, I was called to be a mission president in Costa Rica and Panama, we had six children under the age of 11.<br /><br />In our last general conference, Elder Robert D. Hales spoke to the young adults about marriage.<br /><br />He reminded you, "The track that leads to marriage passes through the terrain called dating!"<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Often I hear the young single adults say things like let's just "hang out" for a few years, get a degree, get a good job, or buy a car before ever considering marriage.<br /><br />President Nelson, whom I testify is a prophet, seer, and revelator, chose to move forward in faith, get married, and have children while finishing his college education. You can do that. He became a renowned heart surgeon who spent his early years repairing and strengthening diseased and defective hearts, and in his later years, he has become an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, ministering to those with wounded hearts and inspiring millions to have a mighty change of heart.<br /><br />What can we do to increase in Christ and receive His image in our countenance?<br /><br />By heeding the words of the Savior, the scriptures, and modern-day prophets, we can learn how to increase in Christ, integrating the Savior's teachings into our very beings&nbsp;by doing what He did,&nbsp;becoming more like Him each day, and decreasing the natural man within ourselves over time. There are many examples we can follow as we study the life of the Savior that will help us increase in Christ. Let me share just two of many.<br /><br /><strong>Example number 1</strong></p>
<p>The Savior taught us to "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;We can do that. When speaking about Sabbath-day observance, President Nelson posed the question, "What&nbsp;<em>sign</em>&nbsp;do I want to give to God?"<sup>29</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>For me, one of the most spiritually uplifting times that helps me to increase in Christ and feel very close to Him is when we have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament each week. Perhaps when you partake of the sacrament, you could ponder the meaning of the Atonement in your personal life. I know that if I am going through a difficult time, it helps me to think about our Savior, who suffered not only for my sins but also suffered for my pains, afflictions, sicknesses, and temptations of every kind&mdash;"that he may know according to the flesh how to succor [you, me, and all of] his people according to their infirmities."<sup>30</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>&nbsp;During the sacrament prayer, we hear the great promise each week: "That they may always have his Spirit to be with them."<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that when you have the Holy Ghost with you, He "will teach [you what] to do and where to go; ...[He] will whisper peace and joy to [your] souls, He will take malice, hatred, envying, strife, and all evil from [your] hearts; and [inspire you that your] whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God."<sup>32</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Example number 2</strong></p>
<p>The Savior literally fed thousands and gave living water to multitudes that were thirsty. How blessed we are to have the law of the fast. It feeds our spirits and gives us the opportunity to&nbsp;consecrate our fast with a generous fast offering,&nbsp;which literally does&nbsp;feed thousands who are hungry and provides other essential needs. We can do that.<br /><br />What happens as we increase in Christ, thus allowing us to receive His image in our countenance? We can experience&mdash;usually gradually&mdash;a physical manifestation of the&nbsp;spiritual&nbsp;reality that Christ is increasing in us. The Savior declared "that all [people], must be born again; ... changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; and thus they become new creatures."<sup>33</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As our spirits increasingly direct the natural man, we can someday be prepared to enter the presence of God. The temple is a place where we can learn how to be comfortable in the presence of God. The celestial room in the temple represents being in the presence of God.&nbsp;As I conclude, may I ask, "What will your story be?"&nbsp;Did you know our stories of how we are becoming more like Christ are being recorded in heaven in our book of life,&nbsp;which,&nbsp;in one sense, is "the sum total of one's thoughts and actions."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;"When [our] book of life is opened on the Day of Judgment, [our] bodies will show what law [we] have lived."<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Will we have lived a&nbsp;telestial, terrestrial, or celestial law?<br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks teaches: that the three-fold degrees of "good, better, and best" even have their counterparts in the kingdoms of glory for which men and women will qualify in the Day of Judgment.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;We can say that it is&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;to be in the terrestrial kingdom with the "honorable men of the earth" who receive the glory and "presence of the Son."<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;It is&nbsp;<em>better&nbsp;</em>to make and keep the baptismal covenants that are necessary for the glory of the celestial kingdom, where God the Father reigns.<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But it is&nbsp;<em>best&nbsp;</em>to receive eternal life in the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom, which is called the "fulness" of the Father, or exaltation.<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;This comes only by making and keeping all the covenants of the temple, including the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.<sup>40</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Today, I extend the same invitation President Eyring extended to the General Authorities. I invite each one of you to experience an increase of the Savior's image in your countenance prior to our next general conference. I know the Holy Ghost will guide you in your journey.<br /><br />I testify that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son, and that the Church was restored. The Book of Mormon is true. The Savior lives. He guides His Church through our living prophet, Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson, whom I testify is a prophet who holds all the priesthood keys here on the earth. I know that God our Father deeply loves us, listens to us, and wants us to return to our heavenly home. I know He lives. I know that Christ is our Redeemer, our Advocate, our Friend. Of that I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sister Eda Ashby was born in Connecticut and raised in Tennessee.&nbsp; She served in the Utah Salt Lake mission shortly after that mission was created.&nbsp; She earned two bachelor's degrees from BYU: one in Family Studies and the other in Piano Performance.&nbsp; She began her choral studies at BYU, and went on to earn both a Master's and Doctorate in Choral Music from the University of Southern California.&nbsp; She taught nine years at Utah Valley University in Orem before coming to BYU-Idaho in 1999.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Ashby's hobbies include composing religious choral music, including hymns and hymn arrangements. She wrote an oratorio for the Sacred Music Project here at BYU-Idaho in 2007.&nbsp; She enjoys working on her fruit trees, and has proved that even peaches can grow in the harsh Rexburg climate.&nbsp; She also likes reading the words of Isaiah.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although Sister Ashby has served repeatedly in music callings in the church, she most enjoys teaching gospel doctrine and Relief Society lessons because it gives her an excuse to study the gospel more.&nbsp; She is currently the ward organist in her ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am glad to be with you today. You are my friends, students, and colleagues. I hope to share with you a few things of great value to me. The first is the testimony of Christ, His gospel, His church, and His prophets. Maybe you have always believed these things, but haven't clearly recognized the Spirit, so you are not sure that you know these things. The first story is for you.<br /><br />I grew up in a faithful Mormon family in the mission field, in the southern Bible belt, where there was a good deal of misinformation about Mormons, requiring strong defense. Family activities revolved around church service and driving west to visit the relatives. Serving in the church was a major commitment. Our branch stretched 60 to 80 miles in diameter, and district meetings were 100 miles away. Picking up people for church took hours. But the Lord brought us there to build His kingdom. That branch area has now become a stake of Zion.<br /><br />But back to my story. Racial unrest in my high school caused me to leave for college a year early. During my first year of university I met challenges that made me want to know for myself, absolutely, the truth of the things I believed. My religion teachers encouraged the quest by assuring us that the revelations and gifts of the gospel are for all of us, not just special, privileged people. They also quoted Joseph Smith saying, "Make yourselves acquainted with men who, like Daniel, pray three times a day toward the temple."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So, I began fasting frequently, and praying formally an extra time, at midday, while my roommate was in class. One midday several months into the experiment, I was again being very honest with the Lord about my need to know, and there came upon me an exceedingly sweet, powerful, full-of-love influence that seemed to enter into every molecule of my body and record indelibly there that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith and our current prophet are truly prophets of God, and that the gospel which I had been taught from youth up was true&mdash;priesthood authority, the Atonement, the Book of Mormon, the temple, the great plan of happiness&mdash;they are all true and right.<br /><br />&nbsp;That sweet influence of light and love stayed with me for about 24 hours. Under its influence, I was filled with love and saw the world and even my fellow men differently. I was amazed that, although I felt very different, I did not appear different to others. I felt changed. Though there have been other experiences since then, that experience has remained a touchstone in my life. It did not come easily, but I know that I know. No knowledge you gain here will be of more importance than the knowledge of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and His church. Do whatever it takes to gain this knowledge.<br /><br />For all of us, testimony is the beginning of a journey. For those who joined the church in the early days, testimony was the beginning of their journey to Zion&mdash;a journey filled with hardships and challenges, but a satisfying journey, for on it they obtained the promises that would assure them of the blessings of eternity. We, too, have now begun our journey to Zion.<br /><br />Just as we begin an academic journey by registering for classes, we begin our spiritual journey when we register for the Lord's program by covenanting with Him in baptism. We sign up for additional instruction from the Lord through the covenants of the sacrament and the temple. When we sign up, we sign up to be transformed, both individually and as a group. Our sign-up also declares that we are willing to play a significant role in the Lord's latter day work of preparing for the second coming, because the service we render is a major factor in our transformation process. Of course, the benefit we get from the Lord's courses depends heavily upon our doing well our heavenly homework and attending His classes&mdash;church and institute. If we listen to our teacher&mdash;the Lord and His Spirit&mdash;attentively, and do our heavenly homework faithfully, we will gradually become "conformed to the image of His Son."<br /><br />So changed, when we go forth into the world, we will go forth with his power upon us, in other words, with His name and nature upon us. His name represents and includes His nature, power, and attributes. As His servants, we will do things "in His name," meaning "in His power, nature, and authority." And when we speak or close a prayer in His name, there will be attached to that prayer or speech the power that is His. The whole universe honors Him, and runs under His power and His name. Each week in the sacrament we say we are willing to take upon us His name&mdash;His nature. In time, He puts His name upon us, as he did upon Abraham&mdash;think of the temple&mdash;"Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, and my power shall be over thee."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord promises guidance, companionship, power, and protection.<br /><br />When an individual is transformed, he becomes a Zion person. When a group is transformed, we see a Zion society. Elder D. Todd Christoffersen stated in conference that the destiny of the church, as the "Kingdom of God" on the earth, "is to establish Zion in preparation for the return and millennial rule of Jesus Christ."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I believe one of the purposes of BYU-Idaho, situated "on the edge of nowhere," as President Hinckley said is to be a seedbed of Zion, a gospel greenhouse, where we start, incubate, and nurture Zion seedlings that will be planted throughout the earth to prepare for the second coming. We are gathered here to learn and practice Zion, the gospel. When we leave here, we are to take Zion with us, no matter our major. That means we need practice and experience here. So, what would Zion look like at BYU-Idaho? We are partly there. What can we gain that we don't yet have?<br /><br />If we at BYU-Idaho live and practice Zion&mdash;and we read that Zion can only be built up on the principles of the celestial kingdom<sup>4&mdash;</sup>then our lives and the whole campus will be filled with light. When we teach and when we study, enlightenment will fill our minds and illuminate our subjects. We will learn more quickly and more clearly. Our classes will be filled with light. And we will have light in our personal lives and surroundings. Our interactions will be Zion-like, based on celestial principles. Our faith and hope will grow and flourish. Miracles will be frequent among us, even in our personal lives.<br /><br />Each summer for the past five years, I have watched the establishment of a mini-Zion in the Nauvoo Pageant cast. Participants come together for just two weeks, and with just a little demonstration and instruction, they start living as a Zion society, which they just transfer onto the pageant stage. The effect is powerful, because it is real. Certainly pageant conditions are challenging: heat, mosquitoes, lack of sleep, but all "seek the interest of their neighbor"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and are happy to help each other in the cause of the Lord. Their unity in purpose calls down blessings much greater than would come to one individual alone.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The society where people keep all the commandments, hearken to the Lord, and have the light and power of God, is Zion&mdash;the kind of Zion that the Lord is pleased with, that he unites with heaven, like the City of Enoch. If we really sanctify ourselves, and live the gospel, we can have heaven in our lives. Always very practical, Brigham Young said, "Do we realize that if we enjoy a Zion in time or in eternity we must make it for ourselves? ...When we conclude to make a Zion we will make it, and this work commences in the heart of each person...he must sanctify himself..." We don't have to wait until we are old, either!<br /><br />D&amp;C 133:17 calls us to this preparation: "For behold, the Lord God hath sent forth the angel crying through the midst of heaven, saying: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight, for the hour of his coming is nigh,"<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and a similar verse adds "repent, repent."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Because we have joined the latter-day restoration, we are privileged to work on God's path-straightening "crew," under the direction of his appointed officers, to aid in the preparations for the second coming of Christ. Our charge is to take the message of preparation&mdash;repentance&mdash;to all, and to make His paths straight by getting the rocks and obstacles out of the King's road. Today, in awe, we watch His earthly path straighten as impenetrable walls come down, and nation after nation opens for the gospel and temples.</p>
<p>But there is also a path to be cleared to our hearts, a road within that allows his light and power to come into us and prepare us to "abide the day" of His coming. We must clear away the piles of worldly trash, non-heavenly entertainment, false precepts, destructive emotions, and sins, so they don't block the path of the light&mdash;and so they don't take up space in our hearts that would instead be filled completely with the Spirit of God. The path to our hearts must be free and clear to allow his light to flood in and fill us.<br /><br />Recently, I watched a health professional shine a small laser beam through a treatment remedy to transport the frequency of the remedy into a person who needed it. There were no obstructions so the power of the light shining through the remedy picked up and carried the remedy's frequency into the person. In a similar way, the light of God, the Spirit, shines through and illuminates divine truth&mdash;the remedy we need&mdash;and carries it into us, to help heal us. The path must be clear and straight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when a powerful light is applied to a substance, the light overcomes and consumes the substance. Scriptures warn that the presence of God will consume the unprepared. However, scientists have discovered an exceptional circumstance. When all the molecules of the substance are perfectly lined up, the light and power that previously would have melted and destroyed the substance simply makes it translucent and radiant. Lining up the molecules is analogous to our trying to be perfectly obedient, or lining up our hearts with God's will. Could we be translucent and radiant? When Moses descended from Sinai, his face shone. When Joseph Smith received section 76, his face shone. Nephi aligned himself and prepared himself to receive greater light by praying his heart would be softened to believe his father's vision. "Who may abide the day of [the Lord's] coming?"<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Can you see, now, that the honor code is just a means to help us get our hearts "lined up," so that we can handle more light? It is the Lord's desire to bless us with greater light, but we must be prepared to receive it. We read in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, "God has not revealed anything to Joseph, but what he will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them..."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>It seems clear that the first key to receiving what the Lord is anxious to give us is obedience&mdash;being willing to do the will of God&mdash;to receive His guidance in faith when it is given, and obey it. President Ezra Taft Benson said, "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Obedience to the Lord and his appointed messengers&mdash;His prophets and His Spirit, opens the spillways of heaven to begin pouring out His light on us. The obedience that brings the blessings of heaven includes obedience to the small promptings and nudges we receive to guide our personal lives. This obedience is how we "seek... the Lord to establish His righteousness"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;instead of establishing our version of righteousness.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith gave this advice to Brigham Young at Winter Quarters in 1847:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tell the people to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice... Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Getting the obstacles out of our hearts will "make straight the path" of the Lord's light into our hearts. We will still need to ask for God's light, but it will come so much more readily; our spiritual healing and transformation will accelerate! And when we operate "in the Spirit," the Spirit will expand and enhance our contribution, just as the loaves and fishes were expanded to feed a multitude.</p>
<p>As we work to learn the Spirit, remember there are three types of voices we will hear:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Our own voice, as we weigh and consider.<br />2. The Spirit, often very brief, with direct commands or suggestions.<br />3. Evil, usually arguing against a prompt or nudge we just received.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith listed characteristics of the Spirit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Spirit of the Lord will whisper peace and joy to their souls, and it will take malice, hatred, envying, strife, and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I tried an obedience experiment one day when I knew I would not be distracted by deadlines. "Today," I said, "I will try to do whatever the Spirit seems to direct." I felt nudged to revisit some of my visiting teachees and tried to follow the nudges all day. I got almost nothing done on my long to-do list, but the next morning when I opened my scriptures to a passage that was usually very run of the mill, it now seemed filled with incredible, powerful spiritual light. It is clear that if we work to obey his voice, the Lord will pour down his light on us. That light will be a protection against the evils of the world, spiritually and physically, just as the divine cloud and pillar were a defense for ancient Israel. Protection promised to Zion is real.</p>
<p>If it feels hard to identify promptings, it may be because of false beliefs and fears, which cloud or block the path of light. Here are some common false premises:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. "I am not good enough." But, if you are willing to do God's will, you are good enough. He will help you, guide you, and transform you.<br /><br />2. "I can't because of my circumstances." This is victimitis. If Nephi had played the victim, he would have said, "I can't because Laban is impossible," or "I can't because my brothers won't help," or "I can't because I have never been taught how." But, in the Lord's setup, our challenging circumstances are perfect to teach us the truly important things.<br /><br />3. Another false premise is: "I always fail." On our own, we often fail. But, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."<sup>15</sup>Nephi said, "I will go and do."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;We must not discount the wagonloads of help we receive from beyond the veil. As Elisha said, "They that be with us are more than they that be with them."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Of the 12 spies Moses sent to Canaan, 10 came back truthfully saying, "There are giants, this is scary, we could fail." Two rejoiced in God's promises.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;We must believe God. He has promised victory. Focusing on the scary parts won't help. "When the earth begins to tremble, bid our fearful thoughts be still."<sup>19<br /></sup><br />I remember my world trembling in a state of overwhelm one September. I had just finished a very stressful time preparing and sending off a family member to work overseas for the first time. I came straight home and launched into my long list to be completed before school started on Monday. I wasted no time, but Saturday night arrived much sooner than it should have, and my list was not done, particularly staking the leaning peach tree, which I knew would never get done once school started. Tired and spent, I literally cried to the Lord, explaining that I had done my best but was greatly distressed that there was not time to stake the tree. It was too dark now for me to do it, and very late. As I worked to finish the house chores before Sunday, I began hearing noises outside, but when I started to look out, I thought, "Oh, it is just a neighbor making some noise." When I awoke Sunday morning, I saw my tree beautifully staked. I had never spoken to any of my neighbors about staking the tree. I believe it was a gift from God to soothe my troubled heart.<br /><br />4. Another falsehood is: "They won't want me." The Lord definitely wants you. He has a plan for you and also a mission for you to do, just like the heroes who go on a great journey to save their people against great odds. He even sends angels to help. If you stick with it, you will be transformed and capacitated for the work. Converts can be transformed, and so can any of us.<br /><br />5. A tricky premise is: "I am not perfect." None of us are. That is true. But the resultant fatalistic attitude that leaves Christ out of the picture is a worldly lie. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but through Christ, we can conquer. Perfection is possible, but only through Him.<br /><br />6. A popular false premise is: "The world owes me." Neither the world nor God owes us. God has already given us all we have. We have the opportunity to do things here in the world, but no "birthright" of ease and comfort. Our current earthly birthright is "the sweat of thy face" and a lot of other trouble, all perfectly designed for our hands-on learning experience.</p>
<p>Our fears are usually based on false premises like these. Fears, lurking in our emotional rather than mental areas, can cause us to super control and engage the arm of flesh, blocking the Spirit. The Lord says, "inasmuch as ye strip yourselves of jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves..., the veil shall be rent."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Instead of dwelling in fear, we can trust in God&mdash;He is the master of bringing about positive results from bad situations. We ask, "where is God's love in this injury or that great disappointment?" God's love is in the healing of it, and in our learning from it. His schooling of us is careful, and guided. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Stick with it. Submit.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;We have to submit to God to experience the transformation.</p>
<p>Dropping all our falsehood baggage will greatly lighten our load and speed our journey. Purifying our hearts from sin, fears, unbelief, and false premises will let in the light and strengthen us on our trek.<br /><br />Here are a few other things to help on the journey to Zion:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Brigham Young said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In all your social communications, or whatever your associations are, let all the dark, discontented, murmuring, unhappy, miserable feelings, all the evil fruit of the mind, fall from the tree in silence and unnoticed; and so let it perish, without taking it up to present to your neighbors. But when you have joy and happiness, light and intelligence, truth and virtue, offer that fruit abundantly to your neighbors, and it will do them good, and so strengthen the hands of your fellow-being.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Instead of picking at faults, hold up the good that people do; hold up the yet-future good they can achieve, and the way to get there. This encourages people to do good works much more than pointing out failings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Speak honestly with the Lord. Covenants are based on honesty with Him. You can't hide anything from him anyway, and it will give you a lot to talk about in your prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A prayer story: I was not a great singer, but managed by other skills to get in a very fine college choir. For the sake of that choir, I wanted to be a much better singer, so I sought every learning opportunity, and prayed every day, for about ten years, that the Lord would help me learn to sing. Bit by bit, inspirations came as I pondered and practiced&mdash;nudges to try things I hadn't thought of, and understandings of how the voice worked. It is one of the Lord's miracles that I now teach voice, and the understandings I have gained continue to bless my life both spiritually and vocally.<br /><br />Some of my favorite vocally-based premises are these:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience, the Lord does marvelous things with the willing and diligent. You are enough. If you seek the Lord, He can work with you. The same Lord who can teach someone to sing, or teach someone to build a boat, like Nephi, or who can transform a New England farm boy into the great prophet of the restoration, can also teach us how to build Zion in our hearts and lives. Joseph Smith said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The building up of Zion... is a theme upon which prophets... have dwelt with peculiar delight; but they died without the sight; we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory;... when the Saints of God will be gathered in one... The Spirit of God will also dwell with His people, and be withdrawn from the rest of the nations... The heavenly priesthood will unite with the earthly, to bring about those great purposes; and whilst we are thus united in one common cause, to roll forth the kingdom of God, the heavenly Priesthood are not idle spectators: the Spirit of God will be showered down from above, and it will dwell in our midst...This is a work that... his destined to bring about the destruction of the powers of darkness, and renovation of the earth, the glory of God, and the salvation of the human family.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This is our calling.</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie has spoken of physical/spiritual Zion in the last days:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...From the top of the peak where the soles of our feet now tread, we can look forward, crest upon crest, to the Zion of God which one day will be ours if we walk in the course charted by those who have gone before. We cannot see the whole course; many things are hidden from our view. Mountain trails wind through valleys and over crests, around ledges, and through forests. We do not know the length of the journey nor the perils that await us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We see the Lord break down the barriers so that the world of Islam and the world of Communism can hear the message of the restoration...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We see stakes of Zion in all parts of the earth; and Israel, the chosen people, gathering into these cities of holiness, ... to await the coming of their King.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...We see the Saints of God who are scattered upon all the face of the earth, rise in power and glory, and stand as lights and guides to the people of their own nations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We see evil forces everywhere uniting to destroy the family, to ridicule morality and decency, to glorify all that is lewd and base. We see wars and plagues and pestilence. Nations rise and fall. Blood and carnage and death are everywhere. Gadianton robbers fill the judgment seats in many nations. An evil power seeks to overthrow the freedom of all nations and countries....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But amid it all, the work of the Lord rolls on. The gospel is preached... The kingdom grows and prospers, for the Lord is with his people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Amid it all, there are revelations and visions and prophecies. There are gifts and signs and miracles. There is a rich outpouring of the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...the world is and will be in commotion, but the Zion of God will be unmoved. ...<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>D&amp;C 65:2, 4-6 declares: "...the stone cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth."</p>
<p>I imagine looking down on the earth from space, seeing many points of light dotting the earth, representing groups of faithful believing people. The lights grow and spin off new lights, which light up new places or add power to older lights. The points of light multiply, brighten, and grow, until, like the light of the morning coming out of the east, "the Son of Man... [descends]..., clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>May we be ready! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a great honor to address you this afternoon. I have been fasting and praying that what I say to you today will be what the Lord would have me say. I have also prayed that the Holy Ghost will bring thoughts and promptings into your heart and mind. My goal is to provide doctrine and specific strategies to help keep you safe in a world of sin. If thoughts do come, please treasure them, write them down, and try to apply them.<br /><br />While living in the preexistence, we learned that leaving our heavenly home, as well as having a veil covering our memories, would be necessary so that we could choose good or evil without being influenced by the memories of our heavenly parents. We learned that trials, sickness, disappointments, sorrow, and pain would give us experience and be for our good.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;We learned that because of our weakness we would sin and that a Savior would be provided for us.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>In Job it recounts that after hearing this plan we were so happy that we shouted for joy.<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>But there was one who rebelled against this plan. In the Doctrine and Covenants 29:36 it states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency"<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Satan, who was called Lucifer wanted to force us to do his will and take away our gift of agency. He wanted all of the honor of our salvation for himself. President Benson described it this way: "In the pre-earthly council, Lucifer placed his proposal in competition with the Father's plan as advocated by Jesus Christ. He wished to be honored above all others. In short, his prideful desire was to dethrone God."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Because Heavenly Father rejected Satan's plan and chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior, Satan became angry, rebelled, and he and his followers fought against Jesus and those who accepted our Father's plan. Due to this rebellion Satan and his followers were cast down from heaven and were denied the right to receive mortal bodies.<br /><br />In the 76<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants it states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, ... for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ&mdash;Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The war in heaven continues today. Since Satan's plan to dethrone God failed, his plan is now to dethrone and destroy you and me. Satan and his followers have not forgotten who we are and are constantly tempting and enticing us to sin.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>"</strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters there are some key principles if understood and practiced will aid us in this war between good and evil. Christ and his prophets have long taught these principles to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to speak to you of fortification and defense.<br /><br />My father served in the military at the end of the Korean War. After a precarious agreement was signed between North and South Korea to stop hostilities until a peaceful agreement could be found, a buffer zone was created crossing the 38<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;parallel. This demarcation line between North and South Korea is called a demilitarized zone, even though it is the most heavily militarized border in the world. There has been no peaceful agreement to this day and this buffer stretches 160 miles long and two and a half miles wide. One of my father's responsibilities was to help dig trenches, bunkers, and reinforcements to help fortify this line. His stories have helped me realize the importance of fortifications and a layered defense in times of war.&nbsp;<br /><br />These same principles can aid us in our war with Satan and his forces.<br /><br />President Kimball explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This is our proper pattern, if we would prevent sin rather than be faced with the much more difficult task of curing it. As I study the story of the Redeemer and his temptations, I am certain he spent his energies fortifying himself against temptation rather than battling with it to conquer it...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The secret of a good life is in protection and prevention. Those who yield to evil are usually those who have placed themselves in a vulnerable position."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Captain Moroni knew this could be applied both physically and spiritually. In the Book of Mormon during the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;year of the reign of the judges Captain Moroni introduced the idea of a "layered defense" to fortify both his warriors and the Nephite cities. Captain Moroni prepared his people with breastplates and with arm-shields, helmets and thick clothing. &nbsp;The Lamanites after seeing the Nephites armor, even though their numbers was much greater, were afraid and did not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon.</p>
<p>Likewise, Captain Moroni fortified his cities as well by erecting small forts, throwing up banks of earth around the cities with walls of stone. He built high fences and towers with security so that the stones and arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them. He also stationed more men at the weakest cities to make the weak areas become strong. The result was that many Nephite's lives were saved.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as physical armor protected the Nephite armies, spiritual armor can help protect you and me.<br /><br />President Kimball provides powerful imagery when he said the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We must be prepared to make a bold stand before Satan ... and against principalities and powers and the rulers of darkness. We need the whole armor of God that we may withstand. 'Put on the whole armour of God,' as Paul admonished. With this divine influence and protection, we may be able to discern the adversary's deceptions in whatever appealing words and rationalizations and we may be 'able to withstand the evil day, and having done all, to stand.'"<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In October's General Conference President Monson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We know, however, that the adversary is committed to our failure. He and his hosts are relentless in their efforts to thwart our righteous desires. They represent a grave and constant threat to our eternal salvation unless we are also relentless in our determination and efforts to achieve our goal."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I would like to echo our prophet President Monson and all of the prophets before him as I suggest three strategies to increase our fortifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is prayer.<br /><br />Prayer is one of our best defenses. If we liken ourselves to a castle, with Satan and his followers as the attacking enemy, the quality of our prayers would be the thickness and height of our outer walls. Some of the questions we can ask ourselves to judge the strength of our castle walls are: Do we use vain repetition in our prayers or are they sincere and from the heart? Do our minds wander while saying our prayers? Do we think about what we are going to say before we approach our Father? Do we think through what we really need help with, and what questions have been bothering us? Are we expressing earnest gratitude for our blessings? Are we listening for promptings and answers? As we improve the quality of our prayers our castle walls are strengthened and we are increasing our protection and defense from the forces of evil.<br /><br />Before my children leave for school I will hear my wonderful wife call out to our children asking them if they have put their armor on? They know this means have they knelt in prayer and asked for heaven's protection, guidance, and safety?<br /><br />Think for a moment of Helaman's two thousand stripling warriors.&nbsp;<br /><br />They were a perfect example of those with strong spiritual fortifications. They were protected both physically and spiritually through the teachings of their mothers. What do you think their mothers taught them? Could there be any doubt that their mothers taught them how to pray with power? Can you picture these mothers sending their sons off with Helaman telling them to put on their spiritual armor?<br /><br />The second strategy is studying the scriptures and heeding the words of living prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />If prayers would be likened to the thickness and height of your castle walls, studying your scriptures and following the prophets council is like heeding the watchmen on the towers overlooking the countryside to prepare and defend the castle.&nbsp;<br /><br />These watchmen are prophets and apostles from the past and those living today. Heavenly Father has called them to help defend his children. They receive revelation and guidance on the dangers we face. If we will listen, study, and apply their words we will be better prepared, protected, and fortified. &nbsp;<br /><br />Elder M. Russell Ballard in a recent CES devotional characterized the Apostles as being charged "to be watchmen on the towers to see and teach the doctrines of Christ," and he applied that to the doctrine of marriage. He stated: "Traditional marriage is under attack today, with many framing the discussion in terms of civil rights." He then quoted from a recent letter sent to local leaders by the First Presidency, which reads in part, "Changes in the civil law do not, indeed cannot, change the moral law that God has established. God expects us to uphold and keep His commandments regardless of divergent opinions or trends in society."<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>At the last general conference President Monson invited us to live the commandments, strengthen our testimonies, exercise constant vigilance in order to avoid giving in to Satan's lies and temptations, and be an example and light to others.<br /><br />The third fortification strategy is service.<br /><br />Service is a principle that is counterintuitive. It is counterintuitive because we would imagine that the more energy we give to others the less we have for ourselves, however the opposite is true. The Savior used metaphors to describe this principle "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and "But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Service could be compared to a mote surrounding your castle except the more water you take out (by giving service) the bigger the mote gets. When you give service, although you are helping others, in fact you are really helping yourself more. It is evident when seeing a missionary return. It is evident in the face of someone performing an act of kindness. It is felt after attending the temple and doing family history. Service changes our very nature; it fortifies us without even realizing it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now brothers and sisters, it is instructive to examine some of the tactics the adversary uses to try and penetrate our defenses. If we go back to our castle analogy, there were many ways castles fell or were compromised and I would like to discuss three. These are also some of the same tactics Satan uses to try and penetrate our spiritual defenses and fortifications.<br /><br />The first way a castle would fall is by a massive attack.&nbsp;<br /><br />The opposing army by sheer numbers would overwhelm the defenses of the castle. If the fortifications were weak it would not hold up to the barrage of the opposing force.&nbsp;<br /><br />Can you picture a castle under this type of attack? Maybe you have seen a movie where an invading army compromised a castle's defense. Brothers and sisters, is there any doubt that we live in a day and age where we are under a massive attack from the adversary and his forces.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Timothy, Paul described our day when he said:&nbsp;"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."&nbsp;<br /><br />We are now living in the perilous times Paul foresaw.<br /><br />In 2003 President Hinckley said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The traditional family&nbsp;is under heavy attack. I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah... We see similar conditions today. They prevail all across the world."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In the October 2014 general conference. President Monson states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We have been placed on earth in troubled times. We live in a complex world with currents of conflict everywhere to be found. Political schemes ruin the stability of nations, despots grasp for power, and segments of society seem forever downtrodden, deprived of opportunity and left with a feeling of failure. The sophistries of men ring in our ears, and sin surrounds us."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>How, you may ask, can we survive in such a world? The key to defend against the massive attack we are undergoing is to strengthen our fortifications, to thicken and heighten our outer walls of prayer, listen, heed, and apply the council of the watchmen on the towers and to help and serve our fellowman. If we do, we will have the blessing of having the companionship of the Holy Ghost to help strengthen and fortify us.</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring during a BYU-Idaho devotional address in 2005 spoke forcefully to us on what is needed to defend ourselves. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As the challenges around us increase, we must commit to do more to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Casual prayer won't be enough. Reading a few verses of the scripture won't be enough. Doing the minimum of what the Lord asks of us won't be enough. Hoping that we will have the Atonement work in our lives and that we will perhaps sometimes feel the influence of the Holy Ghost won't be enough. And one great burst of effort won't be enough..."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Eyring is a watchman on the tower and is telling us what is required to withstand the massive attack of the enemy that surrounds us.</p>
<p>The second way castles fell was by the invading force laying siege.<br /><br />When an opposing army saw that there were strong fortifications, they would sometimes decide to surround the castle, not let any food in, and study the castles defenses to find weak spots.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan and his followers are masters at this. Lucifer and his followers know our weaknesses and will try to take advantage of them. They have had a long time to figure out the best ways to try and tempt us.<br /><br />President Kimball said:</p>
<p>"Having been reared on the farm, I know that when the pigs got out, I looked first for the holes through which they had previously escaped. When the cow was out of the field looking for greener pastures elsewhere, I knew where to look first for the place of her escape. It was most likely to be the place where she had jumped the fence before, or where the fence had been broken. Likewise the devil knows where to tempt, where to put in his telling blows. He finds the vulnerable spot. Where one was weak before, he will be most easily tempted again...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It seems that evil is always about us. ... Accordingly, we must be alert constantly. We catalogue our weaknesses and move in against them to overcome them. Most of us have vulnerable spots through which disaster can overtake us unless we are properly safeguarded and immunized."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>May I echo President Kimball, and suggest that we regularly take time to reflect on our vulnerabilities and what can be done to correct them? Who knows us better than ourselves the areas we need strengthened? After we have reviewed our weaknesses it is helpful to create a plan. You might create a short and long-term plan. You might need to review this plan daily or weekly. Reflect on what went well that day or week, and what areas of weaknesses need to be strengthened. We need to make adjustments to our plans as a general would make adjustments in the midst of a battle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great example of this is in the third and fourth chapter of 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Nephi, the Gadiantian robbers sent a letter stating they were going to come down out of the mountains and destroy the Nephites and Lamanites that had united. After an unsuccessful attack, due to strong fortifications, the Gadiantian robbers decided to lay siege to the city. We read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes. ...But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Again we see the Nephites protected by following the council of their leader prophet Gidgiddoni by storing provisions and fortifying their city. Likewise, we are promised protection if we will take up spiritual provisions and fortifications.</p>
<p>The third tactic that could cause a castle to fall is a backdoor or secret entrance.<br /><br />A king might create a backdoor in a castle so that they could escape in case he needed to flee. If the enemy found this secret entrance they could bypass all of the fortifications put into place and march right into the center of the castle.<br /><br />I would now like you to think about and view in your minds eye your apartments and bedrooms. These are places you may study your scriptures and say your prayers. You might have pictures of temples on the wall and scriptures sitting on your desk. Can you see possible backdoors that Satan might use? Do you see gaming consoles, computers, televisions, and cell phones? I would like to speak for a moment on gaming and social media. When I ask my class how many know people addicted to gaming, almost all hands go up. I have seen students so addicted to gaming that they lie to their girlfriends, telling them they can't go out Friday nights when really they won't go because they need to finish a level. One student explained how a married couple divorced due to a spouse spending every free moment playing games rather than talking to each other. I had a student teaching assistant explain that when he decided to quit gaming due to his addiction, he gave all of his games away to his friend, and soon his friend was addicted. We could also visit about social media. How much time do we spend on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and news sites?<br /><br />Elder Bednar spoke at BYU-Idaho in 2009 on this subject. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I raise an apostolic voice of warning about the potentially stifling, suffocating, suppressing, and constraining impact of some kinds of cyberspace interactions and experiences upon our souls.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My heart aches when a young couple&mdash;sealed together in the house of the Lord for time and for all eternity by the power of the holy priesthood&mdash;experiences marital difficulties because of the addicting effect of excessive video gaming or online socializing. A young man or woman may waste countless hours, postpone or forfeit vocational or academic achievement, and ultimately sacrifice cherished human relationships because of mind- and spirit-numbing video and online games."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Satan is using technology to try to get us to give up our physical experience for virtual ones. Now a word on cell phones.</p>
<p>This device I hold in my hand is a tool that can be used for much good, and is the greatest weapon Satan has in his arsenal. It is with you 24 hours a day and if you do not master this device it will master you. One of the definitions of "device" in the dictionary is "a plan or scheme for effecting a purpose, or trick." You can bet Satan has a plan on how to use this device to sneak past all of your defenses. Do we have a plan on how to keep these backdoors shut? Is it written down and reviewed frequently? By one click of a button or link, Satan can bypass all of your fortifications and slip you into sinning within seconds.<br /><br />President Kimball states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the devil to enter a door that is closed. He seems to have no keys for locked doors. But if a door is slightly ajar, he gets his toe in, and soon this is followed by his foot, then by his leg and his body and his head, and finally he is in all the way."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Keeping the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost is the key to keeping these doors shut and locked. Before we click on a link or website that could possibly be suspect, the Spirit will warn us of Evil, if but only for a split second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kimball has provided a clear picture of how Satan uses back doors. He states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He will shade meanings, open doors an inch at a time, and lead from purest white through all the shades of gray to the darkest black. The arch deceiver has studied every way possible to achieve his ends, using every tool, every device possible. He takes over, distorts, and changes and camouflages everything created for the good of man, ... so he may take over their minds and pervert their bodies and claim them his. He never sleeps&mdash;he is diligent and persevering. He analyzes carefully his problem and then moves forward diligently, methodically to reach that objective. He uses all five senses and man's natural hunger and thirst to lead him away. He anticipates resistance and fortifies himself against it. He uses time and space and leisure. He is constant and persuasive and skillful.... He knows that he cannot induce good men and women to do major evils immediately, so he moves slyly, whispering half-truths until he has his intended captives following him. We must be prepared to make a bold stand before Satan."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Monson stated in the last General Conference that great courage will be required, as we remain faithful and true and that we cannot allow ourselves to believe that we can participate "just a little" in disobeying the commandments of God.<sup>22</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Although all of us have allowed Satan to slip through our defenses to some point, the Savior never did. He is not only our great Captain and General helping us know how to fortify ourselves against sin, but also our great Physician that can rebuild and cleanse us. The Atonement can wipe away the filth of sin. We can experience the peace after the storm and battle. Although repentance is difficult, our eternal salvation depends on it. For some sins, your Bishop is a necessary step and Satan will try and convince you that this is not the case. Please do not listen to these whisperings. Your mind is lying to you. Take whatever steps necessary to cleanse your castle so that someday it might become a temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord is constantly encouraging us. We can do this! We can be victorious!&nbsp;<br /><br />In D&amp;C 38:30 the Lord tells us if ye are prepared ye shall not fear. And in section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants Joseph Smith says:"Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>President Hinckley has encouraged us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Victory will be yours. There is not a person in this Church who needs to [surrender] to any of these forces. You are a child of God. You have His power within you to sustain you. You have the right to call upon God to protect you... Stand your ground ... , and you will be triumphant."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Monson is continually encouraging us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep the commandments. There will be nothing in this world that can defeat us"<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Please remember that everyone here at BYU-Idaho loves you and is praying for you. Your parents and family are praying for you and if you listen carefully you will hear the Holy Spirit encouraging you, warning you.</p>
<p>I testify that God lives, He is our Heavenly Father and that we are here because we love Him, chose His plan, and believe that He knows what is best for us. I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, our greatest teacher and our truest friend. I know that through Joseph Smith the kingdom of God is again upon the earth. I know that we have a prophet and watchman on the tower today, even Thomas S. Monson. I know that if we increase the effectiveness of our prayers, study our scriptures, follow the prophet's council, and provide meaningful service to our brothers and sisters we will be better fortified against sin and temptation. I know that if we will continually keep the covenants we have made, the adversary will be held at bay and the peace of safety will surround us. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>What a glorious site you are! I am humbled by the opportunity to be here with you and hope the Spirit will be with us in abundance.&nbsp;<br /><br />One warm June day, a friend called and explained that her family was planning a week-long float trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho's pristine wilderness territory.&nbsp; In order to go on the trip, her family had applied and been selected for a permit for a group of about 25 people.&nbsp; A family that was scheduled to go had cancelled and, with just four weeks to prepare, my friend invited me and my family to join the group.&nbsp; The invitation excited me!&nbsp; I couldn't wait to go on such an adventure.&nbsp; I imagined forging large white water rapids, the sun shining on our faces as we smiled and whooped with joy.&nbsp; In my mind I could see my husband and daughters' delight, as we shared this incredible experience together.&nbsp;<br /><br />That evening, I chatted with my husband about his day at work, making small talk as we prepared dinner.&nbsp; Just when he seemed most relaxed, I slipped in the offer to join our friend and her family in floating the Middle Fork.&nbsp; My husband looked shocked!&nbsp; He was surprised I would consider such a trip knowing I couldn't swim.&nbsp; And I wouldn't say we are a camping family.&nbsp; Our idea of camping involves indoor plumbing, air conditioning, and flattening irons.&nbsp; We had<strong>&nbsp;</strong>little time to prepare.&nbsp; My husband, always the cautious planner, wanted time to think about the trip before making a commitment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two days later I came home from work and there on our kitchen table were four new sleeping bags!&nbsp; Despite some reservations about my inability to swim and our overall lack of preparation, my husband agreed to the trip.&nbsp;<br /><br />We began preparing for this unexpected adventure. My brother Marty, an experienced white water raftsman, talked to me about rafting safety.&nbsp; He told me that sometimes people just pop out of the boat.&nbsp; He explained that if I found myself in the water, I should pull my knees up close to my chest, placing my body in a sitting position, pull my elbows in close to my body, and use my hands to navigate my direction in the water.&nbsp; This whole idea seemed a bit preposterous to me.&nbsp; Why would someone just pop out of the boat? I asked.&nbsp; My brother carefully explained how that might happen, enjoying the naivety of the question.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Our preparations continued. We purchased a tent, lanterns, clothing, and a map of the river.&nbsp; My<strong>&nbsp;</strong>family was given a large white cooler for food storage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I carefully organized our cooler, placing items that would be needed later in the week at the bottom of the cooler, with lunch and snack items that would be needed immediately on the top. The morning we were to depart, I checked the cooler one more time.&nbsp; It was perfect!&nbsp; In my mind's eye I could see my family asking for something; I would be able to find the desired item in seconds.&nbsp; My family would beam, knowing their wife and mom was the most efficient and organized woman on the trip!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My husband took the cooler to a central point to load on a trailer.&nbsp; When he returned he explained that the coolers had been reorganized.&nbsp; All our lunch food was placed in a cooler we would share with my friend and her family.&nbsp; The items that would be needed later in the week to prepare and serve dinner to the group were placed in another cooler and duct taped shut.&nbsp; Although this seemed like a logical decision to my husband, I felt my plan of perfection had been altered.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We drove to an area near Stanley, Idaho, and spent the night.&nbsp; We were surrounded by majestic mountains and forests. The beauty that surrounded me filled my soul with peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The next morning we launched our loaded boats down a long ramp.&nbsp; Once we were at the water's edge, we made final preparations to place our rafts in the water.&nbsp; My husband, youngest daughter, Ashlyn, and I were in the same boat.&nbsp; Our captain had floated the river several times, but had never oared a boat before.&nbsp; My oldest daughter, Karly, was placed in another boat with our Bishop, an experienced oarsman.&nbsp; We were finally ready!&nbsp; Everything was going just as planned.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We floated through the splendors of the forest that enveloped us, cresting large whitewater rapids and enjoying the sunshine. Suddenly, our boat hit a very large boulder.&nbsp; The pressure of the water pushed against the raft, wrapping it around the rock.&nbsp; I remember seeing my daughter and husband catapulted out of the raft into the cold, rushing whitewater.&nbsp; And then I saw my own feet entering the same frigid water.&nbsp; Suddenly the current pulled me to the middle of the river.&nbsp; I looked back to see my husband reaching for Ashlyn and breathed a sigh of relief knowing they were safe. My journey, however, was far from over.<br /><br />The current was so swift I had no control.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>At<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the mercy of the river. I was swirling around and couldn't see where I was going.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Unable to control my course, I bashed into rocks.&nbsp; Within seconds I was thrust into whitewater.&nbsp; In the middle of the rapids I realized I was being pushed down into the water and my life jacket was floating up.&nbsp; I didn't know it at the time, but in order for a lifejacket to work correctly you must cinch it tight to your body.&nbsp; I prefer loose fitting clothing and so, I did not tighten my lifejacket.&nbsp; The end result was that the lifejacket floated and I was pushed under the water. So, I did what any reasonable woman would do in the same situation.&nbsp; I screamed, "I can't breathe! I can't breathe!" inhaling large amounts of river water in the process.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>At this point I realized I needed to follow the counsel I had received from my brother.&nbsp; I pulled my knees up to my chest and pulled my lifejacket down with my hands.&nbsp; With the lifejacket close to my body, I floated to the top of the water and could breathe.&nbsp; What a relief!&nbsp; That relief, however, was only momentary as I realized that holding on to the lifejacket meant I couldn't use my hands to navigate. The current continued to move me rapidly forward, throwing me against rocks as I spun, at times floating backward, with no ability to see where I was going.<br /><br />As the current changed direction, I could see another section of large white water rapids looming ahead of me.&nbsp; I knew my only hope was to try to stop myself against one of the boulders I could see in the clear, cold water. I could see a rock ahead of me and decided to try to extend my legs in an effort to catch myself against the rock. Because the current was so strong, I was concerned I might break my leg, but knew I had to find a way to stop myself.&nbsp; I slowly stretched out my legs and caught myself against the rock. I used all my strength to push against the current that was relentlessly trying to force me off the rock.&nbsp; Exhaling with exhaustion, I examined my surroundings, noting more whitewater just downstream. I wasn't sure how long I could hold on before I would again be carried into the whitewater. I found comfort knowing my family was behind me somewhere, safe and sound.&nbsp;<br /><br />The temporary safety of my rock shelter was shattered as I heard my youngest daughter, Ashlyn, call out, "Mom! Mom!"&nbsp; I turned to see Ashlyn in the middle of the current and realized she had just traversed the same frigid water and class three rapids I had.&nbsp; I yelled at Ashlyn to swim to the shore. As Ashlyn swam, I uttered a humble and sincere prayer, asking my Father in Heaven to protect my daughters and to keep my husband safe.&nbsp;<br /><br />As soon as Ashlyn got to shore, she turned towards me and began to sob.&nbsp; She yelled, "Mom! Mom!"&nbsp; I could hear the terror in her voice and became frightened that she would try to swim to me.&nbsp; I told her to stay on the shore where she was safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>At that moment, I heard my husband's voice.&nbsp; I cannot begin to describe my joy when I saw my husband on a raft coming to my rescue.&nbsp; He was reassuring me and telling me to hang on.&nbsp; Inwardly I thought, "No problem!&nbsp; I'm not going anywhere, at least if I can help it."&nbsp; And then, he did what any great husband and father would do. He oared to the shore to check on Ashlyn, telling me that help was on the way.<br /><br />I exhaled, looking down stream, unsure if my exhausted body could hold onto the safety of my rock much longer.&nbsp; As I began to mentally prepare myself to be carried away by the current, our bishop threw a line to me and pulled me into the safety of his boat. I later learned the current had pulled Ashlyn from her father's grasp, carrying her past the boat that held my oldest daughter, Karly.<strong></strong><br /><br />Life is very much like my river trip.&nbsp; We come to earth with knowledge and experiences from the pre-existence. As we gain experience in this life, we prepare and plan, creating images of a perfect and carefree life.&nbsp; Filled with anticipation and excitement, we work and wait for our plan to come to fruition.&nbsp; Along the way we experience the wonder and joys of life.&nbsp; We also experience unexpected and often unwanted challenges that alter our plans, sometimes dramatically.&nbsp; As we anchor ourselves to the safety of the gospel, holding onto what we know to be true, we will be able to withstand the currents around us with courage and strength.<br /><br />In Mosiah 18:9 we learn courage is our conviction to "...stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life."&nbsp; Our convictions are evident in the choices we make.&nbsp; President Monson teaches us decisions are our destiny.&nbsp; Making wise choices does not require perfection.&nbsp; It requires courage.&nbsp; In fact, it is how we respond to the boulders in our path&mdash;our challenges&mdash;that will define who we are and who we will become. We are empowered with courage as we respond with conviction and action.&nbsp;<br /><br />A year-and-a-half ago, my youngest daughter, Ashlyn, found herself watching some of her friends making choices that she knew were not in keeping with the gospel and what her father and I had taught her.&nbsp; Initially, the choices seemed small and of little consequence, so she looked the other way and continued her associations.&nbsp; Soon these seemingly small and inconsequential decisions led to more significant and consequential ones, forcing<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Ashlyn to make a choice.&nbsp; Without talking to either her father or myself, she decided to distance herself, not necessarily from her friends, but from the decisions they were making&mdash;decisions that she knew were not in keeping with the Lord's plan for her.&nbsp; And so, this fifteen year old who, like others her age, had made friends her priority began to stay home, and not just on weeknights, but weekends too.&nbsp; I would wander into our family room to find Ashlyn watching TV on the couch by herself.&nbsp;<br /><br />At first this was an enjoyable change, giving us family time and an opportunity to get to know her better. But when weeks of staying home on Friday and Saturday nights turned into months, I started to worry.&nbsp; I began to ask her if she wanted to do something with her friends.&nbsp; She would casually answer, "No, I'm fine."&nbsp;&nbsp; This of course only caused me more concern.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shared my worries with her father, telling him this just wasn't normal for a fifteen year old girl!&nbsp; My heart began to fill with deep concern for this daughter.&nbsp; What I didn't know then, but would learn later, was that she was trying to distance herself from choices and activities she did not want to be a part of.<br /><br />Ashlyn realized that finding new friends would take time and so, she stayed home for a significant portion of her freshman year of high school.&nbsp; As Ashlyn relied on the Lord to help her navigate unknown and challenging waters, she was able to forge new friendships and rekindle old ones. And she was able to find her testimony.&nbsp; In the time she spent alone, Ashlyn reflected on her life and goals, thinking about the direction she was headed, what she wanted, and what she held dear.&nbsp; Through her efforts to ponder her life, Ashlyn discovered her testimony of our Savior and began to define how she would live her life, setting a goal to serve a mission and marry in the temple. And, now a junior in high school, she has been blessed with friends who honor her choices and value her as a daughter of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently, Ashlyn again confronted another challenge. Faced with disrespect and bullying, she felt she could not bear what was happening to her. With a broken heart and spirit, Ashlyn came home from school and went to her bedroom.&nbsp; Alone in the house, she knelt next to her bed and began to pour her broken heart out to her Father in Heaven, telling him she could no longer bear the burden she was facing.&nbsp; As she finished her prayer and stood up, she noticed a scripture from Doctrine and Covenants section 121, written only one week prior, on the chalkboard in her room.&nbsp; It says:<br /><br />"My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou shalt endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes."&nbsp; (D&amp;C 121: 7-8)<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>This was not the answer Ashlyn wanted to receive.&nbsp; She wanted permission to give up, to quit.&nbsp; This scripture was a reminder to her that her Father in Heaven was mindful of her and that although she was experiencing adversity, she was strong.&nbsp; It also reminded her that courage is an act of faith, and requires action on our part.&nbsp; Armed with the love of her Savior, she was able to face her challenge, alter the course of what was happening to her, and feel the comfort and assurance of the Lord in facing an overwhelmingly difficult situation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The Book of Mormon is filled with examples of those who speak with boldness and fear not the reproach of men (Isaiah 51:7).&nbsp; One of my favorite examples of standing with courage and conviction is Captain Moroni, who, despite opposition, proclaimed the gospel with boldness as recorded in Alma 60:36, which states:&nbsp; "Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain.&nbsp; I seek not for power, but to pull it down.&nbsp; I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country."&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Captain Moroni's unshakable courage in standing for his God, his family, and his freedom.&nbsp; Like Captain Moroni, there will be times we will be asked to courageously stand for what we believe and boldly unfurl our standard of liberty. C.S. Lewis observed: "Courage is ... the form of every virtue at the testing point... Pilate was merciful till it became risky." It takes courage to unapologetically live our standards, especially when it is not convenient. It is in striving to live what we know and believe, while turning to the Lord with a humble heart, that we develop our spiritual muscles.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, as we exhibit courage we become who the Lord wants us to be, holding firmly to the gospel, not just in trying and difficult times, but in seemingly ordinary circumstances; for it is in these circumstances that we can become complacent. We become who we are meant to be when we lean on the Lord and trust not on our own understanding. And yes, at times that will require us to courageously stand alone.&nbsp; And standing alone is no easy task. At times it will require us to go to the Lord with a broken heart, knowing he cannot change the situation but trusting that we will be strengthened and empowered to move forward. Thankfully, as Latter-day Saints, armed with the knowledge of the gospel and the love of our Lord, we do not have to stand alone. I learned this lesson in a profound and powerful way from my mother.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a child, we often spent our summers visiting our relatives in the Salt Lake City area.&nbsp; The summer following my third grade year of school was no exception.&nbsp; This was cherished time with cousins, something I looked forward to every summer.&nbsp; My brother and I spent the first day of our Salt Lake vacation visiting our cousins Maya and John.&nbsp; In the warmth of the June sun, my brother, Jay, and cousin, John, ventured out to the backyard to play on the equipment my uncle, a skilled welder, had built.&nbsp; The play equipment was shaped like a half moon with bars for climbing and a chain that hung down from the bars. My brother, Jay, swung on the chain as my cousin, John, climbed across the bars at the top of the toy.&nbsp; As my brother began to swing higher, the play equipment tipped, landing on top of my brother.&nbsp; A nightmarish scene followed as my cousin called for my aunt who, upon seeing my bother laying in the grass, bloody and unconscious, fell to her knees to offer a short, soulful prayer.&nbsp; Towels were fetched from the house, neighbors gathered along the chain link fence as emergency personnel carefully cared for my brother, later transporting him to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery. With the innocence of an eight-year-old child, I looked at my aunt and told her Jay was going to die.&nbsp; Understandably, my aunt pleaded with me not to say that, but my eight-year-old heart knew differently.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>My father, working in Idaho, flew to Salt Lake City as doctors labored to save my brother's life before he slipped through the veil.&nbsp; Later that day, my parents took me to a private room in my grandmother's home and told me my brother Jay had died.&nbsp; That day I lost my brother and my friend. Because I had been prompted that my brother would die, this news was not shocking.&nbsp; I had been sheltered and prepared for this tragic loss,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for which I am eternally grateful. I still remember traveling home and walking into the bedroom we shared.&nbsp; Jay's favorite bear, Benny, was still in our room waiting for the boy that would never return.&nbsp; And my bedroom, now filled with only me, was quiet. The greatest challenge, of course, was moving forward.<br /><br />Thankfully, I was blessed with a mother that had a strong testimony and eternal perspective of life.&nbsp; This knowledge gave her strength and helped her to face the loss of my brother with courage.&nbsp; My mother taught me the plan of salvation.&nbsp; Through her I came to understand that we were an eternal family and that I would see my brother again.&nbsp; I also came to know that this was part of the plan for my brother's life, which had not ended, but was continuing with our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; That knowledge was so comforting to me!&nbsp; It brought peace and understanding amidst chaos and uncertainty.<br /><br />My mother knew that a belief in the Atonement was our foundation.&nbsp; But she also knew that faith, as Joseph Smith taught in the&nbsp;<em>Lectures on Faith</em>, is a verb. Yes, faith is an action and requires us to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>My mother experienced other challenges in her life, including polio, unwanted divorce, and a debilitating stroke.&nbsp; She<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could have become bitter.&nbsp; After all, none of these challenges were what my mother had planned for her life.&nbsp; In his book&nbsp;<em>The Uses of Adversity</em>, LDS psychologist Carlfred Broderick states, "The gospel of Jesus Christ is not insurance against pain. It is a resource in the event of pain, and when that pain comes (and it will come because we came here on earth to have pain among other things), when it comes, rejoice that you have resources to deal with your pain."<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When we use the resources the Lord has given to help us navigate the boulders we confront, we are comforted, empowered and have the courage to become what our Father in Heaven sees we can be.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We cannot sit idly by and think that we will develop courage and strength.&nbsp; An athlete does not become stronger by looking at the weight room from afar. Courageously becoming who we are meant to be requires us to exercise our spiritual muscles.&nbsp; Courage is not something that some people have and others don't.&nbsp; It is not a gift that you can unwrap and suddenly own.&nbsp; Courage is gained as we trust in the Lord at all times and in all places.&nbsp; Courage is developed line upon line.&nbsp; It is earned through experience and strengthened as we turn to our Father in Heaven and hold to the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We are often told we are not here to fail.&nbsp; That is true!&nbsp; Even more importantly, we are here to succeed.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we are or need to be perfect.&nbsp; In fact, the decisions we make when we have fallen short can become defining experiences if we humbly turn to the Lord. This is an act of courage that will bring us closer to the Lord and determine our destiny.&nbsp; I have been privileged to see such courage shown by one of the young men I was honored to teach in Sunday School.&nbsp; It is with his permission that I share his story.&nbsp;<br /><br />I first met Caden during his senior year of high school.&nbsp; Caden was outgoing and charismatic with a quick sense of humor.&nbsp; Although he had consistent attendance at church, it is fair to say church wasn't his first priority.&nbsp; Caden's time away from church included hanging out with friends, too often participating in activities that were not in keeping with church standards.&nbsp; And yet, Caden still attended church, sometimes bringing one of his friends to Sunday School with him.&nbsp;<br /><br />As Caden neared the age of nineteen, he began to think about a mission.&nbsp; He knew his life was not in keeping with mission standards and made a commitment to meet with the bishop and make the changes necessary to go on a mission.&nbsp; This was not an easy process.&nbsp; It meant changing behaviors that had become comfortable habits.&nbsp; It also meant changing friends, never an easy task. Changes came slowly, sometimes with one step forward and two steps back. &nbsp;&nbsp;When his mission call came, we rejoiced in Caden's decision and hard work to become a missionary.&nbsp; On a brisk spring afternoon, Caden said good-bye to his family, squared his shoulders, and walked into the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.<br /><br />I happened to be traveling home from a work related trip the day Caden would fly out to his mission.&nbsp; As I landed in the Salt Lake City airport, I realized I would likely be able to say good-bye to him.&nbsp; I checked the flight boards, found the appropriate destination, and began walking to the gate, eager to say good-bye to Caden as he departed for the mission field.&nbsp; I arrived at the gate to see a large group of smiling missionaries in suits and dresses.&nbsp; I scanned the group, looking for Caden.&nbsp; Not seeing his face, and assuming he was calling home, I asked the missionaries if this dear elder was part of their group.&nbsp; The once smiling faces became silent and sullen.&nbsp; One elder, large in stature, stood and told me he was Caden's companion.&nbsp; I smiled, happy to meet Caden's companion.&nbsp; The now quiet group of missionaries fixed their eyes on this elder as he explained my friend had gone home a few days before.&nbsp; I wished the group well, telling them to have a great two years.<br /><br />I walked slowly away, pondering<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the sacrifices Caden had made in preparation for his mission, my heart broken, knowing how difficult this would be for Caden and his family.<br /><br />The next day, I drove to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Caden's home to let him know of my love for him.&nbsp; I chatted with his mother and learned Caden had something that did not get completely taken care of before he left for his mission.&nbsp; A zone leader in the MTC, Caden knew he could not continue without addressing the concern.&nbsp; In an act of courage, Caden met with his priesthood leader.&nbsp; Caden had a desire to return to the mission field and planned accordingly. Time passed and it soon became apparent<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a return to the mission field would require waiting a substantial amount of time.&nbsp; Caden had good family support.&nbsp; Caden and I would occasionally grab a soda and discuss his plans.&nbsp; During these visits, it became clear Caden was losing hope.&nbsp; He stopped planning to return to his mission and began planning how to move forward with his life.<br /><br />Caden secured a job and began taking classes from a local university.&nbsp; He had a girlfriend who was not a member.&nbsp; It was their desire to marry, but Caden's girlfriend wanted to join the church before their marriage, something she knew would be difficult for her parents to accept.&nbsp; Eventually they were engaged and married, and, following the marriage, Caden's wife was baptized.&nbsp; Caden and his beautiful wife settled into their new ward.&nbsp; Both of them were working and began taking courses from the same local university.&nbsp; Neither of them had an interest in attending BYU-Idaho, but as they continued to faithfully turn to the Lord, their hearts were softened and they were led to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Moving to Rexburg to attend school was another act of courage.&nbsp; Unsure of where they would live and how to pay for the expenses of being full-time students, Caden and his wife trusted in the Lord.&nbsp; I bumped into Caden and his wife a few times during their first semesters at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Caden reported he loved BYU-Idaho!&nbsp; His classes were challenging, but he was working hard and finding success in a difficult major.&nbsp; What I noticed most about my friend was the light, the pure light of Christ, in his eyes.&nbsp; Rather than forsake what he knew, in a difficult situation of his own making, he courageously and humbly turned to the Lord.&nbsp; The light that shone from his eyes was a testament the Lord will succor us when we turn to him in humility and do what we are asked to do with courage. As Caden acts in faith, he is becoming the man the Lord knows he can become; valiant, capable, and courageous. &nbsp;In a powerful postscript to this story, Caden and his wife were sealed in the temple and recently welcomed their first child, a beautiful daughter, into their family.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The Lord does not expect perfection.&nbsp; We become perfected as we exercise courage and humbly allow the Lord to help us become who<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He intends us to be.&nbsp; God doesn't require us to be perfectly qualified for what we are called upon to do.&nbsp; He calls those who are willing to courageously sacrifice to become the person He wants us to become. Brothers and Sisters, hold to this gospel. You will confront boulders in your path. You will find many of these boulders camouflaged as safety nets.&nbsp; Don't be deceived!&nbsp; Remember, courage is developed as we faithfully and humbly seek the Lord in prayer with a willingness to follow the Savior and become what He intends us to become.&nbsp; Prayer is our lifeboat that will keep us afloat and safe through the whitewater we encounter in our lives.&nbsp; As we prayerfully counsel with the Lord, seeking his direction, we will be strengthened. We will be able to get up and get going - to act rather than be acted upon.&nbsp; The road to your eternal success is under your construction. &nbsp;Developing courage will require your conviction of heart. The Lord will strengthen you beyond what you believe possible as you humbly seek Him. Stand with courage, and become what the Lord intends you to be, regardless of time or place. Your courage to become will shine as a testament to Him. You are meant for greatness!<strong></strong><br /><br />&nbsp;I say these things in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Brothers and sisters it is a privilege and honor for me to have the opportunity to address you this afternoon, this being the last devotional of the semester and of the year. Many of you have end-of-semester projects that are due with upcoming finals to prepare for so it is commendable that you're trying to keep your life balanced and your priorities aligned with gospel principles as you attend devotional today.<br /><br />Some of you have set a high goal to attend every devotional during this semester. What a noteworthy and fulfilling accomplishment. I pray that as I relate some personal experiences and speak about gospel principles, that the spirit will teach and prompt you individually in the things that you should do. When you feel those promptings of the Holy Spirit I encourage you to take note and plan to act upon them.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you an experience that I had many, many years ago. It is much like an experience that most of you will have in a few days&mdash;that is, returning home for Christmas. Now I recognize that for some of you, you may not be going home for Christmas during the upcoming break, but I hope that the message and experiences that I share with you today will be applicable in other areas and times of your life. When I was a freshman at BYU, I had just completed my first semester of college and I realized two things; one, that college was a lot harder than high school, and two, that I was really, really excited to go home.<br /><br />I grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona and the drive from Provo, Utah to Flagstaff took about seven to eight hours. I was excited to be with my family and friends. I arrived home and had dinner with my family. After dinner, I grabbed my car keys and was heading toward the door when my mother asked, "Where you going?" I responded," I'm going to go look for some of my friends." She further asked, "Well, who are you going to be with and what time are you going to be home?" I told her, "Mom, I'm 18 years old now. I'm an adult. I've been living out on my own and I can make my own decisions" and then proceeded to head out the door. Now, I would like for you to take a moment and reflect upon the response that I gave my mother. Was my response appropriate given the fact that I was legally an adult and had been living on my own? Shouldn't I be allowed to act for myself?<br /><br />In order to see if our words and actions are aligned with gospel principles, it is imperative to study the doctrines and the patterns that are taught in the scriptures. In the book of Exodus, chapter 20 we read the account of Moses receiving the 10 commandments from the Lord on Mount Sinai. In verse 12 we read: "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Now, there are two questions that I have for you:<br /><br />&nbsp;1. Does the commandment to Honor our Father and Mother only apply to those that were living under the Law of Moses?</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Does this commandment only apply to children up to the age of adulthood?</p>
<p>While teaching here at BYU-Idaho I've had the opportunity to teach a few Business Law classes. If we examine this commandment to honor our fathers and mothers from a legal perspective, we do not see any termination clauses or expiration terms stated in any of the standard works for this commandment. There is no rider or addendum that states that this commandment is only in force until you reach the legal age of adulthood. When the Savior was upon the earth he reemphasized this commandment when he stated in Matthew 19:9: "Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, Paul said to the Ephesians in Ephesians 6:1-2: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In reading these verses from the New Testament, it is evident that the commandment to honor our father and mother was not one of the old things that are done away with under<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;the Law of Moses but continued to be valid when the Savior was upon the earth. It is also important to study the scriptures to see if we can see examples or patterns of this doctrine of honoring our parents.</p>
<p>Let's examine an experience that Nephi had with his family while traveling in the wilderness. In 1 Nephi 16, we read the account of when Nephi broke his bow. In verses 18-19 it says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel; and after I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food. And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer much for the want of food.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So what did Nephi do? He didn't wait to be commanded in all things.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In 1 Nephi 16:23 we read: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>We know that Nephi was large in stature<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and we can assume that he was probably a skilled hunter. We also know that Nephi was an adult. He was married<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;and had already proven his diligence and devotion to his family and God by obtaining the Brass Plates of Laban. Did Nephi say, 'Well, I made the bow and arrow. I am going to go out and prove to my family that I'm an adult and I can do it myself.' No! At the end of verse 23 we read a simple question that portrays Nephi's attitude. It states: "And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?"<br /><br />This simple act of asking and communicating with his father, exemplified that Nephi was humble and obedient to the commandment to Honor his Father. Even though Nephi was a married adult, he recognized the importance of following the patriarchal order. He asked his father for counsel and directions. He did this even though his father was murmuring. In verse 25 we read that his Father Lehi "...was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow." Nephi did not allow his Father's imperfections and mistakes to cause him to deviate from the way in which he knew that he should act. Nephi was going to follow the commandments regardless of his circumstances or the behaviors of others around him.<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, not only is the commandment to honor thy father and thy mother applicable to adults and children alike, it is also an eternal commandment and our very salvation depends on that eternal link that must be created between parents and children.<br /><br />In Malachi 4:5-6 we read: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."<br /><br />In Doctrine and Covenants 128, the prophet Joseph Smith expounded upon this scripture, explaining one of the reasons why it is so important to perform baptisms for our dead ancestors and why this work cannot lightly be passed over as it pertains to our salvation.<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In D&amp;C 128:18 it reads: "It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other&mdash;and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect..."<br /><br />That welding link that leads back to salvation must be created between parents and children. A welding link is a strong chain made up of individual links that are hooked together and welded shut&mdash;binding individual links together. Each connected link allows for some flexibility in the chain but the welding secures the links from being broken or unhooked. Honoring our parents describes how we should treat our parents, but our salvation is dependent on us being sealed to our parents.<br /><br />That relationship will carry on into eternity. In verse 15 of that same section it states "...For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers&mdash;that they without us cannot be made perfect&mdash;neither can we without our dead be made perfect..."<br /><br />Now, some of you may have unique family circumstances which may cause you to wonder how that sealing link will take place between family members that are not living worthily for exaltation. Do not lose hope. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has stated, "Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings... But these frustrations are only temporary. The Lord has promised that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the commandments...and desire what is right."<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Many of you are taking the new religion class entitled "The Eternal Family." One of the requirements in the class is to memorize "The Family - A Proclamation to the World". My wife is currently enrolled in this class and has had the opportunity to memorize this powerful declaration supporting the family. In the Proclamation it states that "the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." If we "fail to fulfill family responsibilities [we] will one day stand accountable before God."<br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The commandment to honor our parents has strands that run through the entire fabric of the gospel. It is inherent in our relationship to God our Father. It embraces the divine destiny of the children of God. This commandment relates to the government of the family, which is patterned after the government of heaven. The commandment to honor our parents echoes the sacred spirit of family relationships in which&mdash;at their best&mdash;we have sublime expressions of heavenly love and care for one another. We sense the importance of these relationships when we realize that our greatest expressions of joy or pain in mortality come from the members of our families.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>A couple of weeks ago, I was riding in the car with one of my sons and he turned and asked me, "Dad, what do you think I need to do to be a better man?" I was humbled and was grateful that my son was asking for my advice and counsel. I was honored that he was following the pattern of Nephi in asking me, his Father, what I thought he should do. As I gave him advice and counsel, as a Father, I felt an overwhelming responsibility to follow the promptings of the spirit as we counseled together about his life.</p>
<p>Other cherished moments that we have had, as parents, is when our older children come into our room and kneel around our bed after being out at various activities. They share with us their thoughts and feelings on how their evening activity went. As parents we appreciate the respect they show when our children choose to check in with us before heading to bed. Although there are times we may be a little sleepy, this small connection allows our children to return and report to us.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No one has a greater interest in your welfare, in your happiness, in your future than do your mothers and fathers. They are of a prior generation. That is true. But they were once the age that you are now. Your problems are not substantially different from what theirs were. If they occasionally place restrictions on you, it is because they see danger down the road. Listen to them. What they ask you to do may not be to your liking. But you will be much happier if you do it.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As Christmas approaches some of you may be wondering what gift you can give to your parents. President Spencer W. Kimball stated: "If we truly honor [our parents], we will seek to emulate their best characteristics and to fulfill their highest aspirations for us. No gift purchased from a store can begin to match in value to parents some simple, sincere words of appreciation. Nothing we could give them would be more prized than righteous living for each youngster."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Now that we have studied the doctrines and patterns taught in the scriptures, I submit to you that my response to my mother was not the way I should have responded. A true disciple would not want to do his own will, but would seek for ways to keep the commandments and help strengthen his family, his brethren, and his friends.</p>
<p>I would like to leave you with three steps that we could all follow as we strive to honor our fathers and mothers:</p>
<p>First and foremost,&nbsp;<strong>pray for them</strong>. Our parents need our prayers. They carry a heavy burden. They need our faith, they need our support, and they need our prayers as they strive to lead our families.<br /><br />Second,&nbsp;<strong>forgive them</strong>. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants section 64:9-10 it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin. I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.</p>
<p>Every parent that I have talked to knows that they are not perfect and have made mistakes. In the family setting it is so easy to see the mote that is in your parent's eyes.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Some of you may rationalize the lack of honor you show your parents by saying that they are not worthy, they are not living exemplary lives, or they have committed sins or misdeeds. However, remember that repentance, the atonement and forgiveness are just as applicable in the lives of your parents as they are in your own life.</p>
<p>The third step is to&nbsp;<strong>proactively show them love and respect.</strong>&nbsp;In 2 Nephi, chapter 2, we are taught that we are to learn to act for ourselves.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, in D&amp;C 58:27-28, it states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</p>
<p>We need to help our parents fulfill their callings as father and mother and should be anxiously acting for ourselves as we seek to honor our parents, regardless of our age or marital status.</p>
<p>If you will purposefully and prayerfully, ponder and act on these three steps, I know that you will be guided on how you can act individually, whatever your circumstance may be. Each of us can honor our fathers and mothers.<br /><br />While you are at home for Christmas, I hope that you will remember one more important part of your family - your siblings. Many of you have younger brothers and sisters that look up to you, they admire you and idolize you. Even though they may bother you at times, you can have a profound impact on them as you seek to strengthen your brethren.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;In the Strength of Youth it states: "Strong families require effort. Your family will be blessed as you do your part to strengthen it. Be cheerful, helpful, and considerate of family members... Strengthen your relationships with your brothers and sisters. They can become your closest friends. Support them in their interests, and help them with challenges they may be facing."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>You have had experiences and life lessons here at BYU-Idaho that could strengthen your siblings. You will be able to connect with them in ways that your parents can't. You can be your brother's keeper<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;as you think of ways to be a mentor and an example for your brothers and sisters. While you are home, purposefully and intentionally look for ways to connect with and strengthen your siblings.<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales stated that "the key to strengthening our families is having the Spirit of the Lord come into our homes." There is no better time to have the Spirit of Christ in our homes than at Christmas time.<br /><br />Christmas is my favorite holiday. It is filled with family traditions, activities and excitement. With 11 children, our house is filled with a lot of excitement during Christmas time. As parents we have strived to keep our activities and traditions focused on the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ.<br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson has warned that, "it is easy to get caught up in the pressure of the [Christmas] season and perhaps lose the very spirit in our lives that we're trying to gain. Overdoing it is especially common this time of the year for many of us. The causes for this might include too many Christmas activities to attend, too much to eat, too much money spent, too many expectations, and too much tension. Often our efforts at Christmastime result in our feeling stressed out, wrung out, and worn out during a time we should feel the simple joys of commemorating the birth of our Savior."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Sometimes if our hearts are not in the right place, we can miss the true meaning of Christmas. I remember one of our very first Christmases that my wife and I shared. We were very much in love and we were very poor. We bought a strand of lights to decorate our meager little fichus tree. I anticipated giving gifts to my wife that we could afford and that she might appreciate and use. I love my wife's cooking and I remembered that she had mentioned that she could use a new frying pan. I was thrilled when I found a non-stick fry pan that we could afford. Also, as a new husband, I felt that it was my responsibility to help protect our home. So practically thinking and also being an accountant and an Eagle scout, I bought my wife a fire extinguisher too&mdash;just in case!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I wrapped my simple gifts for her and placed them underneath the tree. Now, to this day, I still think that those are appropriate gifts, and when she opened them, she smiled and was delighted to receive the frying pan, and even smiled and chuckled when she opened the fire extinguisher&mdash;even if she did think it was little unique. She graciously received both gifts. After Christmas I overheard one my wife's friends ask her what gifts her husband had given her for Christmas. With a grin on her face, my wife shared that I had given her a frying pan and a fire extinguisher. Her friend was appalled; demanding an explanation. I tried to explain the merits of having a first-rate fire extinguisher in our kitchen but she was not impressed, and was actually a little disgusted. I am so grateful that my wife looked beyond the material objects that were given to her, and instead she looked upon the intent of my heart. She recognized my love for her, and my desire to protect her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how humble our circumstances may be or how meager our Christmas, the first and greatest Christmas of all was the most humble. In Luke 2 we read: "And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Jud&aelig;a, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."<br /><br />As a father, I often reflect on the position that Joseph held, as the Savior was born into the world. The Joseph Smith translation states that there was no room for them in the inns&mdash;plural. I can imagine Joseph going from inn to inn, trying to secure lodging for him and Mary. I can imagine his discouragement when the only place they could find to rest was in a simple stable. Furthermore, at the purification offering which new parents make after a child's birth, usually parents would offer up a lamb, however, Joseph and Mary substituted two turtledoves for the required lamb.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;This substitution was allowed in the Law of Moses to ease the burden of those that were impoverished. Truly, "the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace" was born into one of the most humbling of circumstances. It was in this setting that many sought to travel and find the true meaning of Christmas&mdash;the Christ-child born in a manger. Here was God's son, in the most humble of circumstances being loved and cared for by His earthly family.<br /><br />Christmas is a time of coming together as families. I would like to share with you another time when I desired to return home to my family for Christmas. Our family had recently moved from Georgia to Rexburg for my new job at BYU-Idaho. My family had made the move earlier in the fall for schooling, but I, however, remained in Georgia to finalize details with my previous employment. A few days before Christmas, I packed up our remaining belongings and began the 2,000 mile trek to Idaho. The plan was for me to arrive at home on Christmas Eve. My wife had just delivered our tenth child, Rachel, two weeks prior. I could hardly wait to be with them. I had driven about 1,000 miles, when my vehicle broke down in the remote town of Abilene, Kansas. It became apparent that I was not going to be home for Christmas with my family, and would instead spend Christmas Day alone in a small hotel room. I remember on Christmas Eve, kneeling next to the bed, broken hearted. Sharing my predicament with my wife, I was overcome with emotion when she told me that the children had agreed that they wanted Dad home for Christmas to celebrate and open presents. Even though they were young and excited for some of the temporal aspects of Christmas, they were willing to wait until we could be reunited as a family to celebrate. On the evening of December 28<sup>th</sup>, I finally arrived home. I thought that they would be excited to open presents, however, we have a tradition in our family to read the nativity on Christmas Eve and act it out as a family. Before any presents were opened, my young family read Luke 2 and re-enacted the birth of our Savior.<br /><br />I will always remember that Christmas as one which touched my heart with love and joy as we reunited as a family and my children showed me that they were more focused on being together as a family and celebrating the true meaning of Christmas than just opening presents.<br /><br />One thing that we should be keenly aware of during the Christmas season, is that for some, it can be a time of loneliness, discouragement and depression. Let me give you some words of advice that my father helped me discover at a time in my life when I was feeling discouraged. He told me to fast, pray and read my scriptures for answers and guidance in my life. Yes, this may seem to be the standard answer, but he also told me that he loved me, and that he knew that the Lord would help me find a way to overcome my discouragement. So that night I began reading and searching the scriptures. I came across Mormon 8:3-4. This is the setting in which Moroni found himself to be alone; the very last of his people. He mourned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But behold, they are gone, and I fulfill the commandment of my father. And whether they will slay me, I know not. Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not.</p>
<p>When I read the words of Moroni, "it mattereth not" I could feel his discouragement, his despair, and his hopelessness as he was left alone to finish the record. I eagerly read on, to see if I could discover how Moroni overcame his hopelessness and discouragement. The key was found in Moroni 7, where Moroni includes a talk that his father Mormon had given. I can just imagine, in his sorrow, Moroni going back through old journals and records and then discovering his father's talk on faith, hope and charity. As I read that chapter, I realized that if my faith was lacking, if I was feeling hopeless, then I needed to have charity. In Moroni chapter 7:45-46 we read: "...Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail&mdash;But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, if we are feeling a little hopeless and discouraged during this Christmas season, I would encourage you to perform simple charitable acts that help you to find the hope and faith described in Mormon's comforting counsel to his son Moroni: "And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise..."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>During this Christmas season, as we celebrate and commemorate the birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ, I hope that we will remember that He is our Savior. He set an example of how we should honor our parents. During the final moments of His life, while hanging upon the cross, Christ showed great concern, love and honor for His mother. In John we read: "When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!<br /><br />Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Savior also honored his Father in Heaven by saying, "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatsoever things [the Father] doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And in His final hours, as the Atonement drew near, Jesus honored his Father in Heaven as he prayed, saying: "Father, the hour is come. ... I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Then, as the weight of our sins fell upon Him, He pled, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<sup>26</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I hope that as we return home for Christmas that we will remember to honor our parents with love and respect. Have the courage to act upon promptings that will help you to show respect, love and kindness to your parents and family members. I am grateful for my precious wife and wonderful children. I testify that the Family is eternal. I know that the infant born in humble circumstances under the star of Bethlehem was our Savior, Jesus Christ, and He came into the world, to be our Savior and redeem us from sin.</p>
<p>As Isaiah stated: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;His pure love for us endureth forever.<sup>28&nbsp;</sup>I know that as we return home for Christmas, there is no better way to bring the true Spirit of Christ into our home than by honoring our parents and celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior. I know that there is no other name or means under heaven by which salvation is given than through Jesus Christ.<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary and I are pleased to be here with Elder Clark and his wife, Sue, and President Gilbert and his wife, Christine. We join with the faculty in congratulating you graduates on this special commencement day. I commend you wonderful students and your parents for attaining this singular honor. You are graduating from an outstanding university that maintains the highest standards of integrity and spirituality. Many have sacrificed to allow you to reach your goal and obtain your diploma. Some have traveled considerable distances to share this special occasion with you. To attain a cherished goal in the presence of family and friends is a memorable experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will draw on what you have been taught here at BYU-Idaho throughout your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most commencement addresses emphasize the vast opportunities that are now available to you graduates. Many talks stress the pursuit of dreams and passions. I acknowledge these goals, but desire to have you contemplate a greater purpose in your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin I hope you will be grateful for your blessings &ndash; especially your heritage. Gratitude and humility are closely intertwined. We live in a very self-centered age. Social media, in particular, can easily be used for self-promotion. It has never been more important to be grateful and humble. Those who possess these attributes express appreciation for their blessings as they follow the Savior&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend, Harvard Professor Roger B. Porter who is a faithful member of the Church, speaking at one of the commencement proceedings at Harvard last May, noted that gratitude &ldquo;&hellip;requires that we acknowledge our debt to others &hellip;it often involves a humble response for unearned or unmerited gifts.&rdquo; He concluded, &ldquo;If you choose to embrace gratitude as a central element of your life it will serve you well. It will help you resist the temptation to succumb to pride and to fall into a sense of entitlement. It will help you to see the good and to acknowledge the positive. It will help you to put in context the bumps in the road and the adversity you will from time to time encounter. It will help you focus attention on those less fortunate than you whose lives you can bless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that we need to be especially grateful for our heritage. I know that your parents and families are very pleased with what is transpiring today. I hope you are appreciative of them. When we are blessed with goodly parents, we should be grateful. This is the debt each of us owes for our heritage. An old Chinese proverb reads: &ldquo;When you drink the water, don&rsquo;t forget the well from whence it came.&rdquo; It is clear from the scriptures that we are to honor our parents. Proverbs reads, &ldquo;My son, keep thy father&rsquo;s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother&hellip;&rdquo; Ephesians teaches us to &ldquo;honor thy father and mother;&rdquo; The great German philosopher, Goethe, put it this way, &ldquo;What from your father&rsquo;s heritage is lent, earn it anew to really possess it.&rdquo; It is clear that we need to be grateful for our parents and take positive action to acquire that which they would hope to bestow upon us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to gratitude I wish to share some practical advice that may help you to be both happy and successful in achieving a meaningful life that has euphemistically been referred to as &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent essay Lord Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, articulated the concern I have about the diminished role of faith, moral values, and meaning in modern life. He stated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one thing the great institutions of the modern world do not do, it is to provide meaning. Science, technology, the free market and the&hellip; democratic state have enabled us to reach unprecedented achievements in knowledge, freedom, life expectancy and affluence. They are among the greatest achievements of human civilization and are to be defended and cherished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they do not answer the three questions that every reflective individual will ask at some time in his or her life: Who am I? Why am I here? How then shall I live? The result is that the 21<sup>st</sup> century has left us with a maximum of choice and a minimum of meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This quote expresses in an elegant fashion the essence of my message. I am deeply concerned that &lsquo;the good life&rsquo; based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ is now very secondary to a worldly view of &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of us who are members of the Church, the gospel of Jesus Christ and His resurrection and His atonement are the foundation for all that is essential and also bring meaning to this life. The Savior has inspired beliefs and established standards of conduct as to what is moral, righteous, desirable, and results in &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo; However, the principles and basic morality the Savior taught are under serious attack in today&rsquo;s world. Christianity is under attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not new. The recipe for the good life has been debated for centuries. When the Apostle Paul was in Athens on Mars Hill, he encountered &ldquo;philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics&rdquo;. The Stoics believed the highest good was virtue and the Epicureans believed the highest good was pleasure. Many stoics had become proud and used the philosophy as a &ldquo;cloak for&hellip;.ambition and iniquity.&rdquo; Many Epicureans had become hedonists who took as their motto, &ldquo;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&rdquo; Many in the academic world have long pointed to Aristotle&rsquo;s advocacy of &lsquo;intellectual contemplation&rsquo; as a blueprint for &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo; It is interesting that many of these same worldly philosophies that conflicted with early Christianity are still present in slightly different ways today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition there are many new philosophies that are in direct conflict with the gospel of Jesus Christ. This has happened very quickly. Using Book of Mormon language &lsquo;&hellip;in the space of not many years&rsquo; much of the world now calls &lsquo;evil good, and good evil&rsquo;. In fact these two scriptural phrases reflect what is happening in our day. What is considered moral has changed. There has been an incredible movement away from moral conduct as the basis of &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo; Some diminish Christianity by accepting the myth that in Christianity happiness is not about this life, but only about heaven. I assure you that following the Savior brings happiness in this life and in heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some challenges are not just about good and evil. Some require us to make choices based on what is &lsquo;best&rsquo;, not just what is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Brooks in an op-ed in the New York Times titled &ldquo;The Moral Bucket List&rdquo; in May of 2015 developed the concept that there are &ldquo;two sets of virtues, the resume virtues and the eulogy virtues. The resume virtues are the skills you bring to the market place. The eulogy virtues are the ones that are talked about at your funeral&hellip;&rdquo; Brooks correctly concluded that the eulogy virtues are much more important. This hit home for me personally because I had an experience when I was in my mid-twenties that had a profound impact on me. It involved two funerals of two good men that took place only a few days apart. The account is true, but I have changed the names and have purposely been a little vague about a few of the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was 25 years-old, had just graduated from Stanford Law School, and started employment with a law firm. My work-day world was with highly educated people who had amassed significant material possessions. They were kind and on the whole gracious and attractive people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church members I associated with were much more diverse. Most of them had very little of material wealth. They were wonderful people and most had meaning in their lives. It was at this juncture that two older, retired men that I had known for many years passed away. Their funerals were only a few weeks apart and I traveled to attend both funerals. I have decided to call one of the men&rsquo; Rich&rsquo; and the other man &lsquo;Faithful.&rsquo; Those two funerals are cemented in my mind because they clarified the significance of the choices all people have before them, especially the young. They also demonstrate the complexity of the distinction between the resume virtues and the eulogy virtues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Rich and Faithful served missions as young men. By all accounts, they were both dedicated missionaries. After attending college their lives began to diverge. Rich married a beautiful woman who over time became less active in the Church. Faithful married an equally beautiful woman who was completely active in the Church. More than any other factor, this framed the remaining decisions of their lives. In my experience when couples remain true and faithful to the Savior and the eternal significance of the family, the eulogy virtues are almost always preserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now share more about Rich. He had wonderful people skills and cared a great deal about people. He began employment with a major U.S. corporation and ultimately became president of that company. He had a very large income and lived in a large beautiful home set on spacious grounds. That is why I have decided to call him Rich. It would be fair to say that his career choices were not just good or better, but were the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His family and Church choices were not so good. He was a very good man and did not engage in personal choices that were in and of themselves evil. However, his family choices and influence with his children were focused almost exclusively on education and employment, essentially the resume virtues that are so valued in the marketplace. His children also embarked on excellent careers. They did not, however, remain active in the Church and married young women who were not members. I am not aware of all of the facts about his sons, but in each case, these marriages ended in separation and then divorce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rich and his wife had also become less active. They were primarily involved in high profile, social, and community activities. He always considered himself LDS and was proud of his mission, but he did not attend Church. He would, from time to time, contribute to Church building projects and he assisted LDS members in their careers. Furthermore, he was an influence for honesty and integrity and good will in all the positions he held.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His funeral was held at a non-denominational chapel at the cemetery. There were many top executives and dignitaries at the funeral, including the governor of the state where he lived. Except for his children, grandchildren, and me, everyone was over the age of 50. It was, on the whole, a somber funeral and basic principles of the Plan of Happiness were not taught and little was said of Jesus Christ. His life was almost exclusively based on resume virtues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning to Faithful, his employment decisions were far less successful. His initial effort at a small independent business was thwarted when the business burned, and he lost everything. He subsequently created a small business but could barely make his required payments. He had a small, but adequate home. He enjoyed his work and his interaction with people. His career was "good" and certainly satisfactory, but not distinguished or what might be called best. It was not a resume virtues career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His family and Church choices, on the other hand, were absolutely the best. He and his wife were completely active in the Church. He served as called, often as a teacher, attended the temple frequently, and was a faithful priesthood holder. He had wonderful relationships, especially with his large family and his many grandchildren. They were all well-educated, but his main emphasis was on living a Christlike life. In his retirement, he and his wife served a mission together. Though he faced trials, including the death of a son in World War II, he achieved satisfaction and joy throughout his life because of the purpose and meaning provided by his family and the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His funeral in the ward meeting house was large and joyful. People of all ages were in attendance, including large numbers of grandchildren and young people he had served. The Plan of Happiness was taught, and the Savior was at the center of the service. It was an exemplary Latter-day Saint funeral. The talks were about his character, kindness, concern for others, and faith and love of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have indicated these two funerals came at a defining time for me. I had served a mission and loved the Church. I was just starting my career and was becoming impressed with those having material and occupational success. I realized that the choices I was making would define my happiness in this life and the legacy I would leave. I also realized the eternal significance of the choices that were before me. It was clear to me that choices have eternal significance. What was most important to me about the lives I just described is that I realized the choices that are most significant can be made by everyone regardless of their talents, abilities, opportunities, or economic circumstances. I realized that for me, my future children, and everyone I would have the opportunity to influence, putting the Savior, family, and Church first was essential. It would result in &lsquo;the good life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the worst of circumstances, when everything else crumbles, family and the gospel of Jesus Christ are the essentials. Think of Father Lehi in the Book of Mormon where it describes how he "...departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your generation has the challenge of protecting faith and family. One researcher has looked back as far as ancient India and Greece and concluded that every non-religious population in history has experienced demographic decline. Most of the media last month highlighted the declining birthrate in much of the world today. The Wall Street Journal in a front page article proclaimed &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s New Population Time Bomb: Too Few People.&rdquo; &ldquo;Next year&hellip;for the first time since 1950 combined working age population will decline&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of faith and population decline are clearly interrelated. The Father&rsquo;s eternal plan for His children is dependent upon both faith and families. I am grateful that Latter-day Saints, in survey after survey, are maintaining faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and are continuing to marry and have children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some here may not have the opportunity to marry or have children. Individuals who righteously follow the Savior and His commandments and provide selfless service to our Father&rsquo;s children &lsquo;will receive all promised blessings in the eternities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we face the difficulties and trials of life, many events occur over which we have little or no control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On matters of principle, matters of conduct, religious observance, and righteous living, we are in control. Our faith in and worship of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ is a choice that we make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell quoting from William Law, an 18th century English clergyman, stated this in a most succinct fashion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God, it will make in the end no difference what you have chosen instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand that in reciting the true account of Rich and Faithful I am not advocating for less interest in goals relating to education or occupation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, I believe you graduates, should do everything you can to advance your accomplishments in these two areas. What I am saying is that when goals relating to education and occupation are elevated to a position superior to the family and the Church and a testimony of the Savior, the unintended consequences of over emphasizing the resume virtues can be significantly adverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confident that you can attain the joy and happiness you desire and that God wants for you if you are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important meeting that each of us will have on the other side of the veil is with the Savior, &lsquo;the keeper of the gate.&rsquo; Regardless of whom our ancestors are and whether we are rich or poor, we will report on our adherence to the commandments we have been given. We should live so we can: &ldquo;Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.&rdquo; We will want to joyfully report that we have lived a truly &lsquo;good life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On this wonderful day in your lives, I want to share with you a story and four principles. I hope they will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the story. A single mother knelt by the side of her bed one evening filled with worry about her fifteen-year old son. She was worried about his friends, about his attitudes, about his school work, and about his behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night her prayer was very simple: &ldquo;Oh, Heavenly Father, please help me with my son. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Everything I try seems to make him draw further away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far away from where that mother lived, a young man and his wife sat at the table in their tiny apartment. They had a two-year-old daughter and were expecting their second child. The young woman had graduated the year before; her husband was planning to graduate in two months. They felt blessed to have job offers in two different places; now they had to decide. One offer was in a large city with a very prestigious multinational company; the salary seemed amazing to them. The other was in a smaller city with a local, mid-sized company; the salary was much less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had fasted and prayed, and both felt that they should take the job with the smaller company. It was really hard to turn down the money and the prestige, but they followed the promptings of the Spirit and took the job in the smaller city. When they moved, they found an apartment that put them in the single mother&rsquo;s ward. Within a few weeks, the young father was called into the young men&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through tears, here is how the mother of the 15-year-old boy described what happened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that young father was called into the young men&rsquo;s presidency, my son began to show more interest and started to attend young men activities. I couldn&rsquo;t believe the change that took place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That couple has a special spirit about them. There is light in their eyes. They really live the gospel, and they really love the young people in our ward. My son loves them. That young father has had so much influence on my son. He&rsquo;s helped my son see the importance of school, and he&rsquo;s such a good example of a righteous father and husband. My son now talks with me about wanting to grow up and be just like him. My son is happy and loves to go to school and to Church. I thank God for that young father and his wife. They were the answer to my prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the four principles that will be important to you as you move forward:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Principle #1: Pray for and be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost will &ldquo;testify of Christ,&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;guide you into all truth,&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;comfort you,&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;teach you all things,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;show . . . you all things [you] should do,&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and sanctify your soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companionship of the Holy Ghost is worth whatever it takes to have it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Principle #2: Do not trust in the arm of flesh</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very easy to trust in the arm of flesh, especially your own. The arm of flesh includes the honors, wealth, philosophies, and commandments of men. As Proverbs wisely counsels us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Lord with all thine&nbsp;heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not&nbsp;wise&nbsp;in thine own eyes.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pray every day that God will help you not to trust in the arm of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Principle #3: Pray that God will send His angels</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all need the help of the angels of God, whether from the other side, or from this side of the veil. The Lord has said: &ldquo;I have given . . . mine angels&nbsp;charge&nbsp;concerning you.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pray every day that God will send His angels to help you.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Principle #4: Be the answer to someone&rsquo;s prayer for help</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you live these principles, the Lord will trust you and send you on His errands. You will be the answer to the prayer of a bishop, or a mother, or someone you home or visit teach&mdash;or one of your own children. You will fulfill this remarkable charge President Monson has given all of us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only by precept did Jesus teach, but also by example. . . . He stretched forth his hand . . . to succor the weak and lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees. Each of us has the charge to be . . . a doer . . . a lifter. . . . There are those within the sphere of our own influence who, with outstretched hands, cry out: &lsquo;Is there no balm in Gilead?&rsquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pray every day to know who the Lord wants you to help that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I pray that you will trust in the Lord and have His Spirit in your hearts so that you will be the Lord&rsquo;s angels who bring the balm of Gilead, the good tidings of great joy, the healing and redeeming power of Jesus Christ to those who are lost, whose hands hang down, whose knees are weak, and whose hearts are heavy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Savior lives. This is His Church and kingdom on the earth. I bear witness that there is available to all the Father&rsquo;s children peace, happiness, and joy through the marvelous gift of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the parents.<br /><br />Thank you for entrusting your children to us.&nbsp; We love them very much. &nbsp;As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have said on their behalf. &nbsp;I think of all the home evenings and family dinners. &nbsp;I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home.&nbsp; I think of your devotion to them and your love for them.&nbsp; We have seen that love and its fruits in your children.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about your children is the Light of Christ in their eyes and His love in their hearts.&nbsp; It is surely true that they have worked hard at BYU-Idaho and have developed knowledge and skills that will be of great value to them and their families.&nbsp; Yet, what matters most is that they have become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;They love the Lord, and His light and His love are in them.<br /><br />I now speak to the graduates.<br /><br />Tonight is the last time I will address the graduates of BYU-Idaho as president. &nbsp;I want to share with you the most important counsel I can give a graduate of this very special and set apart university.<br /><br />Here is my counsel: keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Ghost in it. The world is not in your heart now; don't let it in.<br /><br />Keeping the world out of your heart is not easy. &nbsp;There is all around us now, and there will be all around us in the days ahead, diabolical "shafts in the whirlwind,"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;cunning devices,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;lying craftiness,<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;subtle deception,<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;flattery,<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;doctrines of devils, [and] commandments of men.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;These are all designed to tempt you, deceive you, turn you away from Christ, and bring you down to destruction by getting the world into your heart.<br /><br />Tonight I will give you a sure way to keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Spirit in it.&nbsp; It is a very simple way, but it is powerful because it is the Lord's way:<br /><br />And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself&nbsp;unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of&nbsp;prayer&nbsp;and offer up thy&nbsp;sacraments&nbsp;upon my&nbsp;holy day;<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Brothers and sisters, I make you this promise: if you will observe the Sabbath day to keep it a holy day and if you will partake of the sacrament in a spirit of love, remembrance, and commitment, your faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, will increase.&nbsp; You will keep the world out of your hearts, and the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you with His Spirit.<br /><br />Jesus taught the Nephites at the temple at Bountiful that when we partake of the emblems of the sacrament on His holy day:</p>
<p>. . . it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>. . . I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. &nbsp;And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my&nbsp;rock.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I hope and pray that you will build your lives "upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;by keeping the Sabbath day holy and by making with our Heavenly Father that sacramental covenant of remembrance and obedience every week. &nbsp;Then, you will keep the world out of your heart and the Holy Spirit will be in it. &nbsp;No matter where you go, no matter what happens to you, this promise of the Lord Jesus Christ will be yours:<br /><br />And whoso&nbsp;receiveth&nbsp;you, there I will be also, for I will go&nbsp;before&nbsp;your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;shall be in your hearts, and mine angels&nbsp;round about you, to bear you up.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>And so I say to you tonight, go forward unafraid with confidence and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;I know He lives.&nbsp; I bear witness of His love, mercy, and grace. &nbsp;You are important to Him. &nbsp;He suffered and died so that He could lift you and strengthen you, cleanse you from sin, comfort you in hours of need, and bless you with His love, His light, and His almighty power, now and forever. &nbsp;His promises to you are true.<br /><br />I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight may each of you recognize the investment of those who came before you and the expectations and hopes of those who will, in turn, follow you.&nbsp; In making this charge, I reflect on the heritage of our early Mormon pioneers.&nbsp; On April 5, 1847, Brigham Young led a vanguard group of pioneers west from Winter Quarters.&nbsp; While there were many non-religious groups who made the trek west during this critical era in American history, the Mormon pioneers were unique in at least two key ways.&nbsp; First, they moved as a group, largely <em>en masse</em>.&nbsp; While Brigham Young&rsquo;s vanguard company was small, nearly 70,000<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;would travel west by the end of the migration.&nbsp; By organizing into companies of hundreds, fifties, and tens, the Mormon pioneers represented a highly structured, self-governing group of travelers.&nbsp; Second, because the Mormon migration was so large, and because those early pioneers had a shared commitment to their fellow Saints, vanguard companies built camp sites along the way and planted crops for those who would come behind them on the trail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you to imagine for a moment that you are in one of those pioneer companies that was following behind the vanguard groups.&nbsp; You are tired, hungry, and perhaps a little worried whether you were on the right path.&nbsp; Then suddenly you come into a field or valley or river bank where your fellow pioneers had previously prepared.&nbsp; You see the trail sites they had left ready for your company.&nbsp; And, better yet, you rejoice as you harvest crops that someone before you had planted&ndash;vanguard pioneers you had never seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like those pioneers before you, you are harvesting crops you did not plant.&nbsp; There were others who came before you and built-up this university and this Church in ways that have blessed your lives.&nbsp; They helped lay the foundations that created this university; its faculty; our student-centered culture; the spirit of frugality that allows an affordable, yet high quality education; a teaching-focused university; and so much more of what is special about this place.&nbsp; You did not see them and you may not have known them, but you have felt their sacrifice and sensed their presence in the gifts you have received at this university.&nbsp; And, like those early pioneers who harvested the crops of those who came before them, you must now decide whether you will reseed those fields for those who will, in turn, come after you. &nbsp;For some of you that will be in your pending service across the Church as you leave this university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere there is a bishop, a parent, or fellow ward member who has no idea that a recent BYU-Idaho graduate is about to enter his or her life.&nbsp; Will you reseed the fields you harvested by serving in the Church with all of your might, mind, and strength?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere there is an employer who hired one of our graduates and will base his or her future decision to hire others from BYU-Idaho based on the leadership, commitment, and integrity you will demonstrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere there is a recent graduate of BYU-Idaho who has become a new parent.&nbsp; As a new parent, how you will invest in the life and future of your new child?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us has harvested crops we did not plant.&nbsp; Now, the question is: are we willing to reseed those same fields for those who will follow behind us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Eyring taught those of us who work and study at the university the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The university is, like the temple, a place where success can come only if we help others succeed.&nbsp;[The] places God would have us go are never for us alone."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the graduates of BYU-Idaho, may each of you pause to recognize the crops you have harvested from others people&rsquo;s labor.&nbsp; May you and each of us make the commitment to reseed those fields so that we can, in turn, bless the lives of others.&nbsp; It is my testimony that God expects us to re-invest in the lives of our fellow man and in growing and building the kingdom.&nbsp; I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
