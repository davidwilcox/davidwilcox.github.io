<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">We 
		welcome you to a new semester at BYUIdaho. To those of you who have 
		just joined the university, we offer a special word of welcome. To all 
		of you, we express our love. It is a joy to serve with you in this great 
		university.<br /><br />We stand together today because we want to talk to you about things that 
		are very sacred and intimate. We want to share with you our deepest 
		feelings about what it means to live a chaste and virtuous life. We pray 
		that the Holy Ghost will attend us today that we might speak, and you 
		might hear, through the power of the Spirit. <br /><br />The Lords command for us to live a chaste and virtuous life is rooted 
		in the fundamental doctrines of salvation. From the beginning of time 
		Heavenly Father has commanded His children to be chaste, to seek virtue, 
		and to use the sacred powers of procreation only within the bonds of 
		marriage between a man and a woman. In our day the prophets and apostles 
		have issued the proclamation on the familya great clarion call to know, 
		understand, and live these basic truths. Listen carefully to the words 
		of the proclamation:</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The 
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that 
		marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the 
		family is central to the Creators plan for the eternal destiny of His 
		children.<br /><br />All human beingsmale and femaleare created in the image of God. Each 
		is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, 
		each has a divine nature and destiny. <br /><br />In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God 
		as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children 
		could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress 
		toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an 
		heir of eternal life.¹ </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span class="dropcap"><span style="color: #000080">We are children of 
		God.&nbsp; As Paul taught the Romans, we are </span><font size="3">
<span style="color: #000080">heirs of God, and joint-heirs with 
		Christ.²&nbsp; Through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
		through obedience to His commandments, we may inherit eternal lifeto 
		know our Heavenly Father, to live with our eternal companion and our 
		eternal family in His presence, to enjoy all that He enjoys.<br /><br />Each of us, our eternal companions and our eternal families, are at the 
		very center of Heavenly Fathers plan. He loves us and desires to bless 
		us with joy in this life and to prepare us for eternal life in the world 
		to come. That is why He has given us His power to create mortal life and 
		to lay the foundation of an eternal family here on earth. We must learn 
		to use that power righteously in this fallen world. <br /><br />The testing and probing of mortal life are not easy. The world is full 
		of sickness, pain, and infirmities of all kinds. Satan is loose in the 
		earth doing everything he can to destroy us. <br /><br />But we are not alone. When Heavenly Father gives us the power to create 
		life, He also gives us a marvelous commandmentthe law of chastitythat 
		stands as a great shining light, a beacon of hope and strength, a bright 
		line of guidance and direction. If we learn to live not only the letter 
		but also the spirit of that law, it will be a source of strength and a 
		cherished blessing in our lives. <br /><br />We would like to talk with you today about four aspects of the law of 
		chastity: (1) What the law is. (2) The law of chastity as protection 
		against the forces of evil. (3) The law of chastity as preparation for 
		marriage and an eternal family. (4) The miracle of forgiveness and the 
		blessings of heaven that come to those who live a chaste and virtuous 
		life.<br /><br />THE LAW OF CHASTITY<br />We begin with what the law of chastity is. In every age and time our 
		Heavenly Father has spoken forcefully and clearly about the creation of 
		mortal life in the personal, intimate relationship between husband and 
		wife. So it is in our day. <br /><br />Here, again, are words from the proclamation:</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080"><span class="dropcap"><font size="3">The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their 
		potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that Gods 
		commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains 
		in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred 
		powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, 
		lawfully wedded as husband and wife. <br /><br />We declare the means by 
			which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the 
			sanctity of life and of its importance in Gods eternal plan.</font></span><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">3</font></span></span><span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">

<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">The power to create mortal life is sacred. It is Heavenly Fathers 
		power; and all the emotions, desires, and feelings associated with that 
		sacred power come from Him. Using that power within the bonds of 
		marriage gives expression to the love, joy, and unity of husband and 
		wife and brings children to an eternal family. The word of the Lord is 
		unmistakable: Anyone who uses those sacred powers outside of marriage 
		commits a sin so serious that the prophets have called it an 
		abomination. When his son Corianton left the ministry and went after 
		the harlot Isabel, Alma told his son: </span></font></span></p>

<span style="color: #000080"><span class="dropcap"><font size="3">Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight

<span style="color: #000080">
<span class="dropcap"><font size="3">The sin of adultery desecrates Gods own sacred powers. It is a sin 
		against God. Further, our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost. 
		Christ came to earth and died and suffered so that we could obtain these 
		bodies now and in eternity. Adultery is a sin against Christ. It is a 
		sin against all that is divine and holyagainst sacred covenants, 
		against the Redeemer and Savior, against our Father in Heaven. It is an 
		abomination in the sight of the Lord.<br /><br />Thou shalt not commit adultery</font></span></span><span class="dropcap"><font size="1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></font></span><span style="color: #000080"><span class="dropcap"><font size="3"> </font></span></span>
<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">rings out in the Ten Commandments and 
		in the words of prophet after prophet in the scriptures. But the law of 
		chastity extends the mandate for virtue and holiness to our thoughts, 
		emotions, desires, and to behavior that might lead to adultery. Listen 
		to the words of the Savior to the people of Nephi:</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit 
		adultery;<br /><br />But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after 
		her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.<br /><br />Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these 
		things to enter into your heart;<br /><br />For it is better that ye should 
			deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your cross, 
			than that ye should be cast into hell.</span></font></span><font size="1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></font><font size="3"><span class="dropcap">

<span class="dropcap"><font size="3"><span style="color: #000080">This is the law of chastity. It is a higher law. If you imagine a chain 
		that begins with immoral thoughts and images, continues to intimate 
		behavior that acts on those thoughts, leading ultimately to adultery, 
		the law of chastity applies to all of it. When the Lord says we should 
		suffer none of these things to enter into [our] heart[s], he is 
		commanding us to not let immoral images or thoughts of immoral behavior 
		take root in our hearts where they become fantasies, even plans and 
		obsessions full of lust. He further warns us against any intimate 
		relations outside of marriage that stimulate desires and emotions in 
		ourselves or others that could lead to adultery. In the law of chastity 
		the Lord commands us against that whole chain. <br /><br />Listen carefully to the words of modern prophets about such behavior.

<font color="#000080">THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW<br />
			The law of chastity is a great protection in a world of increasing 
			wickedness and immorality. Nephi saw our day and warned us of 
			Satans many tactics: stirring up some hearts unto anger; pacifying, 
			flattering, and whispering to other hearts until he leads them away 
			carefully down to hell.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">9</font></span> <br />
<br />
			Nephis prophecy is in fulfillment before our very eyes. On 
			television, in movies, in music, on the Internet, in popular media 
			of all kinds, conspiring men</font><span style="color: #000080"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">10</font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; with evil designs dress up 
			adultery, immorality, wickedness, and pornography as fun, hip, cool, 
			exciting, and attractive. Satan whispers lies all across the land.
			<br />
<br />
			Do not let yourself be deceived. Do not let those whispers break 
			down your standards. Do not listen to the voice that says: That 
			movie is okay; there is only one bad part. Or, Intimacy is okay if 
			you are in love. Or, You can repent later. Or, As long as we do 
			not go over the edge, it is okay. <br />
<br />
			With these lies Satan tries to break down your sense of the truth 
			and blind you to the reality of what you hear, see, and do. Satan 
			wants sin and wickedness to get into your heart and into your 
			actions. He knows that sustained exposure to immorality and 
			pornography can lead to addiction, and that is what he wants for 
			you. <br />
<br />
			Listen to Nephis description of Satans work in our day to lure 
			you, trap you, and bind you:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, 
			according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of 
			all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; 
			yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he 
			bindeth them with his strong cords forever.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">11</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Like the mists of darkness in Lehis dream, we are surrounded by 
			temptation. But the law of chastity, like the iron rod, will lead us 
			safely through if we will hold fast to it and live it. <br />
<br />
			Brothers and sisters, the law of chastity is the word of God about 
			moral purity. It is powerful to protect. With Mormon we say:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay 
				hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which 
				shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the 
				wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and 
				narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is 
				prepared to engulf the wicked<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">12</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">If we are to lay hold on the law of chastity and live it, we must do 
			two things: (1) learn to see things as they really are, and (2) act 
			on what we see. <br />
<br />
			To see things as they really are, we must follow Amuleks counsel 
			and be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led 
			away by the temptations of the devil.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">13</font></span> <br />
<br />
			The command to watch is powerful. It means to be discerning, aware, 
			and conscious of what is happening. Here are two simple examples: No 
			matter what the rating of a movie might be, if you see before you on 
			the screen immorality made to look attractive and exciting, please 
			see it for what it isthe snares and wiles of the devil meant to 
			dull your conscience and stimulate your appetites. If you get an 
			invitation to a costume party where everyone is dressed in Roman 
			togas or other immodest wear, see it for what it isthe temptations 
			of the devil masquerading as fun. <br />
<br />
			To be watchful means seeing temptation and sin for what they are, 
			not rationalizing, not ignoring, not being lulled into complacency 
			or neglect. It also means being careful and disciplined and 
			thoughtful about what we see, hear, and do. <br />
<br />
			Watchfulness is also connected to looking and seeing. We all carry 
			around with us a kind of social mirror that expresses the image of 
			what we are and what we want to become. Being watchful unto prayer 
			means looking into the mirror of Christ, not the mirror of the 
			world. Do not look into the mirror of the world for guidance and 
			direction. <br />
<br />
			Take to heart Elder Dallin H. Oaks counsel given to the women of 
			BYUIdaho from this pulpit in November 2006. This counsel may be 
			applied equally well to the men.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Nor should women emulate the worldly ways of womanhood. Your destiny 
			is to be a wife and a mother in Zion, not a model and a streetwalker 
			in Babylon. You should dress and act accordingly.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">14</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Satan uses the mirror of the world to make bad things appear good 
			and good things appear bad. Look with eyes that see, guided by the 
			Spirit. Look into the mirror of Christ where there is sure guidance 
			and truth. <br />
<br />
			If we have eyes to see, we must act on what we see. Living the law 
			of chastity requires that we exercise faith in the Lord Jesus 
			Christ. The Savior has seen it all. The scriptures teach us that He 
			has suffered temptations of every kind.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">15</font></span> He has experienced every 
			temptation you will face. But He gave in to none of them. He has 
			power over all of them. He himself has declared that He knoweth the 
			weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">16</font></span> This is 
			why Paul could say:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above 
			that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to 
			escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">17</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">The way to escape from temptation is through faith in the power and 
			strength of Jesus Christ. But we must exercise that faith and act. 
			Faith is a principle of action. Living the law of chastity requires 
			that we actwalk away; say no; turn it off; walk out; put it down; 
			control our thoughts and our behavior; choose righteous friends and 
			companions; fill our lives with good books, inspiring music, and 
			wholesome entertainment. Act to pray, to seek, and to ask. Act to 
			follow this great admonition of Alma:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and 
			watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that 
			which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit. Having faith 
			on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">18</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">We know that living the law of chastity is not easy. It has never 
			been easy. When the hormones bubble inside, there is much need for 
			control and discipline. <br />
<br />
			We also know and bear witness that the Lord Jesus Christ is mighty 
			to save. Trust in Him. We pray you will see the law of chastity as 
			divine protection, acting in faith that He who has all power over 
			all things will always be there to give you strength and support.<br />
<br />
			THE LAW AS PREPARATION<br />
			If you heed Almas counsel, the law of chastity will be a marvelous 
			preparation for temple marriage and for building an eternal family. 
			These blessings will come to all of you in the Lords own time if 
			you are true and faithful to your covenants.<br />
<br />
			Listen carefully to the description of the foundation of a 
			successful marriage and family in the proclamation:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">The family is ordained of God. Marriage 
				between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children 
				are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be 
				reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with 
				complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be 
				achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus 
				Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and 
				maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, 
				forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome 
				recreational activities.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">19</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Living the law of chastity is a powerful preparation for the 
			spiritual foundation so essential to the commitments and covenants 
			of marriage. A wedding is a happy and exciting time. <br />
<br />
			We remember well the excitement and happiness of being a newly 
			married couple. But we can tell you from our own experience that the 
			joy and happiness we felt on our wedding day pales in comparison to 
			the joy and happiness we feel today35 years later surrounded by a 
			growing family. What explains the difference in how we feel now? We 
			believe the most important change is the spiritual growth we have 
			experienced together over many years. <br />
<br />
			The proclamation teaches us that everything that contributes to a 
			successful marriage has spiritual roots. To live the law of chastity 
			before marriage, you must exercise faith, be watchful unto prayer, 
			and seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Living the letter and the 
			spirit of that law is a crucible for the development of character, 
			self-control, discipline, unselfishness, and spirituality. Having 
			lived the law before marriage, you bring a reservoir of spiritual 
			strength to your marriage. Living it after you are married helps you 
			replenish and increase that reservoir and sustain self-mastery and 
			spirituality. <br />
<br />
			Living the law of chastity is all about self-control. It is all 
			about putting the Lord and your eternal companion first. Living the 
			law of chastity before and after marriage will help you develop a 
			spiritual foundation on which you create bonds of trust, respect, 
			compassion, and love. When you enter the new and everlasting 
			covenant of marriage, the Lord commands: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt 
				cleave unto her and none else.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">20</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">To love with all your heart and to cleave unto your spouse and to 
			none else means that the deepest desires, strongest attachments, and 
			most powerful emotions of your hearts must be directed only to your 
			eternal companion. No intimate images or thoughts of someone else 
			should ever be in your heart. You must avoid any behavior that could 
			lead to adultery. <br />
<br />
			We bear witness that the love you feel at the beginning of your 
			marriage can grow and develop into that deep, abiding love which 
			defines an eternal marriage; but it cannot grow and deepen unless 
			you live the law of chastity in your marriage. Alma taught this 
			principle powerfully. To his son Shiblon he said: see that ye 
			bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">21</font></span> <br />
<br />
			There are some who will tell you that when you marry you get the 
			green light on intimate behavior with your spouse, but such teaching 
			is another of Satans lies. Of course, after you marry, the Lord 
			commands you to consummate your intimate, personal relationship and 
			to cleave unto each other. That physical relationship is sacred and 
			holy. It is part of becoming one, wholly and fully united in heart 
			and soul. It is part of building your eternal family. It is pleasing 
			before the Lord; butand this is a very important qualifierit must 
			be established in love and kindness, in patience and unselfishness.
			<br />
<br />
			Your intimate relationship is just thata relationship. It is 
			something you create together. Both husband and wife should 
			experience it as joyous and fulfilling. It must be established, 
			therefore, without exploitation, without abuse of any kind, and 
			without self-indulgence. Satan would have you give way to the 
			natural man in your marriagethe man of passion, of carnal desire, 
			of gratification of every impulse and appetite. But remember, the 
			natural man is an enemy to God. You simply cannot give way to the 
			natural man and ever hope to have a union that is holy, a love that 
			is eternal and pure, or a marriage that is blessed and sealed by the 
			Holy Spirit of Promise. Thus, restraint, control, and bridling your 
			passions are just as important after marriage as before. <br />
<br />
			Living the law of chastity is a powerful preparation for a rich and 
			fulfilling marriage and for the creation of an eternal family. One 
			of the glorious purposes of the intimate relationship in marriage is 
			to bring little boys and girls into the world. We can testify of the 
			joy and the miracle of the birth of a child. The proclamation on the 
			family makes it very clear, however, that these children of God have 
			a right to a home where father and mother honor marital vows with 
			complete fidelity.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">22</font></span><br />
<br />
			The law of chastity plays a powerful role in creating that kind of 
			home. We bear witness to you that children thrive when their parents 
			are united in love, hope, purpose, and are totally committed to one 
			another and to their children. We have learned over the years that 
			the most important thing we can do for our children is to love and 
			honor each other. The law of chastity is essential to that eternal 
			union between man and woman, that unity of heart and soul that is 
			the foundation of an eternal family. That union must be both 
			physical and deeply spiritual. It must be a union of two 
			soulsphysically and spiritually joined together. <br />
<br />
			Only those who use Gods creative power in the bonds of matrimony, 
			who are sealed to one another and to their children by the Holy 
			Spirit of Promise, and who live chaste and virtuous lives will forge 
			an eternal union and an eternal family. Only those who live the law 
			of chastity learn to use divine power in the only way it can be used 
			eternally. The law of chastity is there to help us become like our 
			Father. It is there to guide us and help us become one with Him. It 
			is there to prepare us with the devotion, unselfishness, love, and 
			spiritual strength that define those who receive a fullness of 
			celestial glory through the merits and mercy of Jesus Christ. In the 
			76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Prophet Joseph 
			describes the heirs of eternal life:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things 
			present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christs, 
			and Christ is Gods.<br /><br />These shall dwell in the presence of God 
				and his Christ forever and ever.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">23</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Note carefully these words: all things are theirs, whether life or 
			death. Our Heavenly Father gives to all those who are called up and 
			crowned with exaltation in the celestial kingdom the power to create 
			life in an eternal family eternally. <br />
<br />
			Our dear brothers and sisters, this is your divine destiny. This is 
			the preparation of the law of chastity. If you honor your covenants 
			and live the law of chastity, you will receive from your Heavenly 
			Father the richest blessings of the kingdom. Your marriage will have 
			a strong, spiritual foundation. You will be filled with love to 
			overflowing because of your discipline and unselfishness. And you 
			will raise up unto the Lord a righteous, eternal family. We bear 
			witness to you that these promises are true. <br />
<br />
			THE MIRACLE OF FORGIVENESS<br />
			The promises that follow obedience to the law of chastity are truly 
			glorious, but what if you make a mistake? What if you break the law 
			of chastity? What then? <br />
<br />
			Brothers and sisters, if you have broken the law and wounded 
			yourself and others, we want you to know that you can become clean 
			and pure and whole again. We bear witness to you that the Lord Jesus 
			Christ has power to cleanse you from sin, to heal you, and redeem 
			you. <br />
<br />
			Listen to the Saviors words to the people of Nephi at the time of 
			the great destruction following His death:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">O all ye that are sparedwill ye not now return unto me, and repent 
			of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you? <br /><br />Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have 
			eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and 
			whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who 
			come unto me. <br /><br />Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the 
			world, to save the world from sin. <br /><br />Therefore, whoso repenteth 
				and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of 
				such is the kingdom of God.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">24</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">The Savior promises healing, redemption, and complete forgiveness to 
			those who come to Him and repent with a broken heart and a contrite 
			spirit. <br />
<br />
			This is our first message to you about repentance: It is possible; 
			and it is very good. We do not, however, want to leave you with the 
			impression that repentance is easy. So, we also have a second 
			message about repentance: It is a long, hard road. How long and how 
			hard depends on what you have done. You probably learned about the 
			steps of repentance in Primary and Sunday School. You must recognize 
			that what you have done is wrong and confess your sins to the Lord 
			and your bishop. Your bishop will guide you in ridding your life of 
			anything that contributed to your downfall. You must keep the 
			commandments. You must change your life. You must try to restore to 
			those you have injured what you have taken from them. However, as 
			Elder Maxwell taught:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Sometimesrestitution is not possible in 
				real terms, such as when one contributed to anothers loss of 
				faith or virtue. Instead, a subsequent example of righteousness 
				provides a compensatory form of restitution.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">25</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<font color="#000080">Through all of this you will suffer pain and anguish of soul. There 
			is no true repentance without suffering. That suffering will be 
			especially acute if you have broken eternal covenants and wounded a 
			spouse and children. But the Savior has descended below all things 
			and emerged totally victorious over all things. Through His power, 
			His mercy, and His grace, you can be redeemed and healed. Those you 
			have wounded may also feel His healing power. If your heart is 
			right, your pain and sorrow will be tinged with hope. That hope of 
			forgiveness will work in you. As you walk the road of repentance, 
			the Lord will be with you. Through your faith and hope and your 
			steadfastness in Christ, the day will come when the Spirit will 
			witness to your soul that you are clean. <br />
<br />
			The Atonement is real. Jesus is the Redeemer. He is mighty to save.<br />
<br />
			Brothers and sisters, it is better to be obedient and never break 
			the law of chastity. But if there is anyone here who needs to 
			confess and repent but has not, we urge you to go and see your 
			bishop now. Do it today. Do not let another day go by in a state of 
			denial. Start on the path of repentance now. The Lord will bless 
			you.<br />
<br />
			CONCLUSION<br />
			Our wonderful brothers and sisters, we stand before you today united 
			in faith and testimony. We love the gospel. We thank our Heavenly 
			Father every day for the plan of salvation. We testify that Jesus is 
			the Christ. This is His Church, restored through the Prophet Joseph 
			Smith. What a wonderful thing it is to have a living <br />
			prophet! We have listened today to revelation on the family given to 
			us by living prophets. <br />
			We bear witness that the things we have taught today are true. The 
			law of chastity can be for you a bright, shining light in a 
			darkening world, a powerful source of protection and preparation. We 
			pray that you will see it that way and live it that way, that your 
			lives may be chaste and virtuous forever. In the name of Jesus 
			Christ, amen. </font><br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President and Sister Clark, 
		faculty, staff, students, brothers and sisters, friends, I am grateful 
		for this opportunity to be here with you today.&nbsp; I am grateful for the 
		fact that two of the most important people in the world to me are here 
		today, my mother without whom I would not be here, and my dear wife 
		without whom I will never go anywhere truly eternally significant.&nbsp; I am 
		grateful for their untiring support, and for them being vertically 
		connected with our Father in Heaven, in such away that they are the 
		charitable women they are today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray that I can proceed in such a 
		way as to not be an embarrassment to them or my children, if I can do 
		that I will feel like I have succeeded in large measure.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It has often been my 
		experience in the formal classroom or in other church setting, such as 
		Sunday School, Priesthood, P.E.C. or other meetings, to hear something 
		like this:&nbsp; What can we do to protect us from Satans influence?&nbsp; or 
		What can we do specifically that will help us avoid the fiery darts of 
		the adversary? or&nbsp; What can we do to draw us closer to our Father in 
		Heaven?&nbsp; In answer to these questions I have often heard something 
		similar to this.&nbsp; Oh, you know the Sunday School answers.&nbsp; or You 
		know, the Seminary answers. or&nbsp; I guess you would say its those 
		little things. or its those simple things.&nbsp; Then these responses 
		would be followed with something like, You know, scripture study, 
		prayer, family home evening, family prayer, church attendance.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today I would like to focus 
		on one of those simple things, that which some have called a little 
		thing but I would say it is of such magnitude and importance in our 
		lives that we can never or will never in this life gain the testimony, 
		covenants, and power necessary to return to and dwell in the presence of 
		our Father in Heaven without it, that simple principle is Prayer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Several years ago, I heard 
		the following account from this pulpit.&nbsp; A good Brother related that one 
		morning he was up early preparing to go to the office.&nbsp; He was up well 
		before the day had dawned, and was standing at the sink in his bathroom 
		preparing to shave, when he saw the door to a bedroom at the end of the 
		hall open.&nbsp; His young son stumbled toward him tiredly rubbing his eyes, 
		as he got to his father this little boy looked up and said, in a very 
		sleepy voice, Dad, what was the first color?&nbsp; This good man thought, 
		Where in the world did that come from?&nbsp; This from a little boy, who 
		thinks fathers know everything.&nbsp; The father responded, I am not sure I 
		know what the first color was.&nbsp; With that the little boy, with an 
		inquisitive look on his face said, just a minute.&nbsp; He turned and quickly 
		made his way back to his bedroom, leaving the door agar, his father saw 
		him kneel at his bed, with his head bowed in prayer; moments later the 
		young boy jumped up and hurried back down the hall and said, Pink, the 
		first color was pink and turned and hurried back to bed. The father 
		then said to us, there you have it.&nbsp; Now you know what the first color 
		was.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From my earliest childhood I 
		remember being taught to pray.&nbsp; Some of those memories are centered on a 
		prayer taught me by one of my sisters.&nbsp; It went something like:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Now I lay me down to sleep,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">And if I die before I wake,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">I pray the Lord, my soul to take.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have since wondered where 
		my sister ever learned that prayer.&nbsp; I found it interesting while 
		reading some of the writings of President George Albert Smith; I came 
		across this from a conference talk given in October of 1946:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was trained at the 
			knee of a Latter-day Saint mother.&nbsp; One of the first things I 
			remember was when she took me by the hand and led me upstairs.&nbsp; In 
			the room there were two beds, the bed in which my parents slept, and 
			a little trundle bed over on the other side.&nbsp; I can remember it as 
			if it were yesterday.&nbsp; When we got up stairs, she sat down by my 
			little trundle bed.&nbsp; She had me kneel in front of her.&nbsp; She folded 
			my hands and took them in hers, and taught me my first prayer.&nbsp; I 
			will never forget it.&nbsp; I do not want to forget it.&nbsp; It is one of the 
			loveliest memories that I have in life, an angelic mother sitting 
			down by my bedside and teaching me to pray.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was such a simple 
			prayer but I can repeat it today.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now I lay me down to 
			sleep.&nbsp; I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I 
			wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That was my first 
			prayer.&nbsp; That prayer opened for me the windows of heaven.&nbsp; That 
			prayer extended to me the hand of my Father in heaven, for she had 
			explained to me what it all meant as far as a little child could 
			understand.&nbsp; From that day until now, while I have covered 
			approximately a million miles in the world among our Fathers other 
			children, every day and every night wherever I have been, when I 
			have gone to my bed or arisen form it, I have felt I was close to my 
			Heavenly Father.&nbsp; He is not far away.</font><a name="_ednref2" title="title" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[ii]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I do not know of a doctrine 
		more emphasized in all of scripture than prayer.&nbsp; The Bible dictionary 
		states:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; text-autospace: none; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God 
		(namely, God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once 
		prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:711).&nbsp; Many 
		of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this 
		relationship.&nbsp; Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the 
		will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other.&nbsp; The 
		object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for 
		ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, 
		but that are made conditional on our asking for them.&nbsp; Blessings require 
		some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them.&nbsp; Prayer is a 
		form of work, and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all 
		blessings.</font><a name="_ednref3" title="title" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[iii]</font></span></span></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Our relationship 
			with the Father is supreme, paramount, and preeminent over all 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others. He is the God we worship. It is his gospel that

			of all &nbsp;&nbsp; the gifts of God, it will be because we become like him.
			</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Our relationship

			prayer</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">He continued:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Our prayers are

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">I remember as a new

		often very early, sometimes 4:30 a.m. to study my discussions.&nbsp; My first 
		companion was always up before me.&nbsp; As a result of his example I thought 
		all missionaries did that, I thought if you were to be successful you 
		got up then.&nbsp; When I would come out of the shower my companion would be 
		reading Mormon Doctrine, with his scriptures open, cross referencing, 
		making marginal notes.&nbsp; I thought wow, does every missionary do this?&nbsp; 
		How am I going to keep up? I get so tired.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">One night we had our 
		companionship prayer and then knelt at our individual beds to say our 
		prayers.&nbsp; I prayed what I thought was a good prayer, I tried to thank 
		Heavenly Father for the blessing I had received, I asked for the 
		blessings I needed.&nbsp; I prayed for family, for investigators, everyone my 
		tired mind could think of and then said amen.&nbsp; Not wanting to disturb my 
		companion I continued to kneel waiting for him to finish.&nbsp; Again I had 
		thoughts, I am never going to make it as a missionary, I just cant 
		pray that long.&nbsp; He is certainly going to be a District Leader, Zone 
		Leader, or Assistant to the President.&nbsp; He is one of the most spiritual

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">That has since happened

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">One can pray and

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Elder Dallin Oaks in 
		April Conference 1993, instructed us in the language of prayer:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;The Church 
			of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to use 
			special </font><span style="color: #000080; background: white">
			language</span><font color="#000080"> in addressing prayers to our 
			Father in Heaven.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">When we go to 
			worship in a temple or a church, we put aside our working clothes 
			and dress ourselves in something better. This change of clothing is 
			a mark of respect. Similarly, when we address our Heavenly Father, 
			we should put aside our working words and clothe our prayers in 
			special language of reverence and respect. In offering prayers in 
			the English language, members of our Church do not address our 
			Heavenly Father with the same words we use in speaking to a fellow 
			worker, to an employee or employer, or to a merchant in the 
			marketplace. We use special words that have been sanctified by use 
			in inspired communications, words that have been recommended to us 
			and modeled for us by those we sustain as prophets and inspired 
			teachers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The special
			</font><span style="color: #000080; background: white">language</span><font color="#000080"> 
			of </font><span style="color: #000080; background: white">prayer</span><font color="#000080"> 
			follows different forms in different languages, but the principle is 
			always the same. We should address prayers to our Heavenly Father in 
			words which speakers of that </font>
<span style="color: #000080; background: white">language</span><font color="#000080"> 
			associate with love and respect and reverence and closeness. The 
			application of this principle will, of course, vary according to the 
			nature of a particular </font>
<span style="color: #000080; background: white">language</span><font color="#000080">, 
			including the forms that were used when the scriptures were 
			translated into that </font>
<span style="color: #000080; background: white">language</span><font color="#000080">. 
			Some languages have intimate or familiar pronouns and verbs used 
			only in addressing family and very close friends. Other languages 
			have honorific forms of address that signify great respect, such as 
			words used only when speaking to a king or other person of high 
			rank. Both of these kinds of special words are appropriately used in 
			offering prayers in other languages because they communicate the 
			desired feelings of Modern English has no special verbs or pronouns 
			that are intimate, familiar, or honorific. When we address prayers 
			to our Heavenly Father in English, our only available alternatives 
			are the common words of speech like <i>you</i> and <i>your</i> or 
			the dignified but uncommon words like <i>thee, thou,</i> and <i>thy</i> 
			which were used in the King James Version of the Bible almost five 
			hundred years ago. Latter-day Saints, of course, prefer the latter. 
			In our prayers we use language that is dignified and different, even 
			archaic.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The men whom

			President Spencer W. Kimball said, In all our prayers, it is well 
			to use the pronouns <i>thee, thou, thy,</i> and <i>thine</i> instead 
			of <i>you, your,</i> and <i>yours</i> inasmuch as they have come to 
			indicate respect. (<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle,</i> Salt Lake 
			City: Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 201.) Numerous other Church leaders 
			have given the same counsel. (See Stephen L Richards, in Conference 
			Report, Oct. 1951, p. 175; Bruce R. McConkie, <i>Ensign,</i> Jan. 
			1976, p. 12; and L. Tom Perry, <i>Ensign,</i> Nov. 1983, p. 13.)</font></font><a name="_ednref13" title="title" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[xiii]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">At the beginning of a 
		class I will ask for a volunteer to offer the opening prayer, sometimes 
		there are long awkward moments as I wait for a hand to go up, I have 
		noticed this in other church settings also and wondered about the 
		hesitancy on the part of the participants.&nbsp; I understand that there is 
		some discomfort and a degree of anxiousness as we are put in different 
		social groups or settings, and believe me I certainly understand the 
		discomfort and awkwardness one feels standing before a large groupbut 
		why do we hesitate to pray.&nbsp; I am sure there are many reasons.&nbsp; One may 
		be that we do not want to be seen as the hypocrites, for they love to 
		pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that 
		they may be seen of men.&nbsp; This may be a legitimate reason.&nbsp; If it is 
		because of fearthen we need to then we need to exercise greater faith.&nbsp; 
		The Prophet Brigham Young had some interesting things to say about fear 
		and prayer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Are the people 
			going to fear? &nbsp;If fear is in the hearts of any of you, it is 
			because you do not pray often enough; or when you do pray you are 
			not sufficiently humble before the Lord.&nbsp; You do not plead with Him 
			until your will is swallowed up in His.&nbsp; If every one of the 
			Latter-day Saints lived up to their privileges, they would not fear 
			the world, and all that they can do, any more than they fear that 
			the cranes, that fly croaking three quarters of a mile above them 
			will drop their eggs upon them to dash their brains out.&nbsp; You might 
			as well fear that event, as to fear all the forces of hell, if the 
			people were sanctified before the Lord, and would do His will every 
			day.</font><a name="_ednref14" title="title" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[xiv]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Maybe you dont 
		volunteer because you just dont feel like praying, well Brother Brigham 
		had an answer for that too.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Some of the 
			brethren come to me and say, Brother Brigham, is it my duty to pray 
			when I have not one particle of the spirit of prayer in me? True, 
			at times, men are perplexed and full of care and trouble, their 
			ploughs and other implements are out of order, their animals have 
			strayed and a thousand things perplex them; yet our judgment teaches 
			us that it is our duty to pray, whether we are particularly in the 
			spirit of praying or not. My doctrine is, it is your duty to pray; 
			and when the time for prayer comes, John should say, This is the 
			place and this is the time to pray; knees bend down upon the floor, 
			and do so at once. But John said, I do not want to pray; I do not 
			feel like it. Knees get down, I say; and down bend the knees, and 
			he begins to think and reflect. Can you say anything? Can you not 
			say, God have mercy on me a sinner? Yes, he can do this, if he can 
			rise up and curse his neighbor for some ill deeds. Now, John, open 
			your mouth and say, Lord, have mercy upon me. But I do not feel the 
			spirit of prayer. That does not excuse you, for you know what your 
			duty is.</font><a name="_ednref15" title="title" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[xv]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Brigham taught:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The duty of the

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we may be

		regarding this also:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">If the Devil says 
			you cannot pray when you are angry, tell him it is none of his

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">For if ye would

			</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Brigham Young said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">It matters not

</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Speaking of the 
		sincerity of prayer and the frequency of prayer President Young also 
		taught:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Let every man and 
			every woman call upon the name of the Lord, and that, too, from a 
			pure heart, while they are at work as well as in their closet; while 
			they are in public as well as while they are in private, asking the 
			Father in the name of Jesus, to bless them, and to preserve and 
			guide in, and to teach them, the way of life and salvation and to 
			enable them so to live that they will obtain this eternal salvation 
			that we are after.</font><a name="_ednref20" title="title" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[xx]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">I know that often the 
		following questions are asked by many, Why do bad things happen to good 
		people?&nbsp; and Why does it seem that there is no listening ear? </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">I certainly do not know 
		all the answers, but I do know that by our very nature as a result of 
		the fall of man, we will experience pain and suffering; that we will 
		have to eat our bread by the sweat of our brow and that because of the 
		fall, men are carnal, sensual, and devilish and therefore greedy, 
		selfish and lustful, and as a result of that, innocent people suffer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">It does not mean that 
		God does not love us nor does it mean that our pleading petitions fall 
		on deaf ears.&nbsp; Elder Maxwell, who, himself knew something of suffering 
		said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">We may at times, if 
			we are not careful, try to pray away pain or what seems like an 
			impending tragedy, but which is, in reality, an opportunity. We must 
			do as Jesus did in that respect-also preface our prayers by saying, 
			&quot;If it be possible,&quot; let the trial pass from us-by saying, 
			&quot;Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt,&quot; and bowing in a 
			sense of serenity to our Father in Heaven's wisdom, because at times 
			God will not be able to let us pass by a trial or a challenge. If we 
			were allowed to bypass certain trials, everything that had gone on 
			up to that moment in our lives would be wiped out. It is because he 
			loves us that at times he will not intercede as we may wish him to. 
			That, too, we learn from Gethsemane and from Calvary.</font><a name="_ednref21" title="title" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">[xxi]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">He also taught:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Petitioning in 
			prayer has taught me that the vault of heaven, with all its 
			blessings, is to be opened only by a combination lock: one tumbler 
			falls when there is faith, a second when there is personal 
			righteousness, and the third and final tumbler falls only when what 
			is sought is (in God's judgment, not ours) &quot;right&quot; for us. Sometimes 
			we pound on the vault door for something we want very much, in 
			faith, in reasonable righteousness, and wonder why the door does not 
			open. We would be very spoiled children if that vault door opened 
			any more easily than it does now.&nbsp; I can tell, looking back, that 
			God truly loves me by the petitions that, in his perfect wisdom and 
			love, he has refused to grant me. Our rejected petitions tell us not 
			only much about ourselves, but also much about our flawless Father.

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">May I, in closing share 
		with you an example or two of what to me would appear as pleading 
		petitions?&nbsp; A colleague and close friend once shared the following with 
		me.&nbsp; His family had just moved into an unfinished home. During Christmas 
		vacation he planned on finishing the basement.&nbsp; A friend had lent them a 
		propane space heater, which he had heating the basement.&nbsp; He was at 
		neighbors not far from the house cutting out stair treads, when he heard 
		a very loud explosion, he thought was a sonic boom.&nbsp; His son who was 
		close to the door started shouting that the house was on fire. He could 
		hear his family screaming, as he ran to the house, once there after some 
		anxious searching and desperate action he found that the family was 
		safe.&nbsp; Older sons were filling buckets with water and throwing it on 
		the fire.&nbsp; He found a 20 3 inch diameter drain pipe; he would cover 
		one end of the pipe with his hand, fill the pipe with water and then 
		dump it on the flames.&nbsp; After several dumps of water from the pipe, his 
		fifteen year old daughter said, Dad, say a prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp; He related, I 
		was foolishly focused on the water effort and said Kim, you say the 
		prayer, and I will dump the water.&nbsp; She shouted at me and said, Dad, 
		say a prayer Right Now!&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused and prayed, Dear Father in Heaven, 
		we are so thankful that no-one in the family was hurt by this explosion 
		and fire PLEASE bless us that no one will do anything foolish and that 
		we will be protected so that we may remain un hurt, In the name of Je&nbsp; 
		Right then she interrupted my prayer.&nbsp; DAD, BLESS THE HOUSE THAT THE 
		FIRE WILL GO OUT!!!&nbsp; I paused and said And bless the house that the 
		fire will go out!&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; We filled the 
		pipe and as I again reached the basement, to my absolute amazement, the 
		fire was out!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Now there is more to the

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">QUINN'S STORY</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On November 9, 2003, an event 
		occurred in Texas that had an amazing impact on my life at that time and 
		still does.&nbsp; I was teaching a few classes at the Livestock Center for 
		the Animal Science Department when a friend and colleague, Brother Nick 
		Baldwin approached me and asked if I had heard of the accident.&nbsp; I asked 
		him, what accident?&nbsp; He said Quinn Jones, (son of Vern and Jean Jones, 
		a young man I had known for several years,) had been in a very serious 
		car accident.&nbsp; He said that it was touch and go; they didnt know from 
		one minute to the next if he was going to make it.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I hadnt been around Quinn 
		very much, but what I knew of him I really liked.&nbsp; He was a team roper 
		who had an irrepressible smile.&nbsp; He was quick witted, smart and loved 
		life.&nbsp; He loved to tease, but would be frank and bluntly honest if he 
		needed to.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When Nick told me of the 
		accident something happened inside of me, I immediately began to ache 
		for Quinns parents.&nbsp; They had already lost a sweet daughter to cancer, 
		and now this.&nbsp; I wasnt sure how much more they could handle.&nbsp; I didnt 
		know what to do or how to be of help.&nbsp; I knew that they needed prayers, 
		they needed the blessings of Heavenly Father, they needed the 
		faith.they needed a miracle.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me tell you about the 
		miracle.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The story begins with Elder 
		Jones and his companion leaving a Missionary correlation meeting with a 
		Stake President on November 9, 2003, in Abilene, Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp; They needed to 
		drive to San Angelo.&nbsp; The weather had been very hot and dry and then it 
		started to rain.&nbsp; They drove in the rain and were about twenty minutes 
		out of town, traveling on a two-lane road.&nbsp; They were driving at speeds 
		in excess of sixty-miles per hour as they approached, ironically enough, 
		Dead Mans Curve.&nbsp; The road suddenly became very slick, something like 
		black ice.&nbsp; Their car started to hydroplane as they went into the turn 
		and it began to slide sideways into the lane of the oncoming traffic.&nbsp; 
		Both lanes of traffic were traveling in excess of sixty-miles per hour 
		when the missionaries' car was broadsided on Elder Jones side.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It took rescue workers nearly 
		an hour to get Quinn out of the car.&nbsp; The emergency response personnel 
		did what was necessary to stabilize him for transportation by ambulance 
		and then started for Abilene.&nbsp; Upon arrival at the hospital, there 
		happened to be a doctor from Scott and White Hospital, Temple, Texas,&nbsp; 
		picking up some extra hours in the emergency room.&nbsp; It just happened 
		that Scott and White Hospital operated one of the finest Blunt Trauma 
		Units in the United States at the time, and this particular Doctor was 
		well prepared for what faced him. They did what they could for him there 
		and prepared him to be transported by life-flight to Temple.&nbsp; (A doctor 
		at the hospital in Abilene said that if Quinn had stayed the night there 
		he never would have made it.)&nbsp; At Temple one of the attending Doctors 
		was LDS and at the request of Quinns mother, Quinn was able to receive 
		a Priesthood blessing at 5 a.m. on the 10 of November.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn had sustained injuries 
		to every major organ in his body, except his heart.&nbsp; He had a collapsed 
		lung and the other was partially collapsed; he had a punctured kidney; 
		they had to remove his spleen; his liver was lacerated; he had a crushed 
		pelvis;, he had severed a major vessel in the pelvic area; and 
		experienced severe nerve damage to the pelvic region and his legs.&nbsp; The 
		first day at Scott and White Hospital they gave him 90 units of blood 
		and blood products.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn was in the Scott and 
		White Hospital from November 9 to December 18, and in the ICU for all 
		but one week of that time.&nbsp; For three weeks he lay with his intestines 
		exposed so they could daily take him to surgery where they could care 
		for him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For two weeks he was so 
		swollen he was unrecognizable. They kept him in a comatose state for a 
		month.&nbsp; There was such a spirit surrounding him that the nurses would 
		argue over who got to care for him; for three weeks there was a nurse at 
		his bed constantly.&nbsp; His kidneys failed and he had to undergo dialysis, 
		this raised the pressure on the brain to the point that some of the 
		attending nurses felt that it was impossible to not have some type of 
		brain damage as a result.&nbsp; At this time he was given one of many 
		Fathers Blessings.&nbsp; After further testing and examinations, results 
		came back negative for brain damage.&nbsp; He would receive a blessing nearly 
		daily from his father and as often as the missionaries would come to the 
		Hospital to visit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn was in Temple for six 
		weeks and the church arranged for a medically equipped Leer Jet to fly 
		to Texas and transport him to Salt Lake City, LDS Hospital. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The attending Doctor in Utah 
		was a former Mission President, and at one period when it appeared that 
		the abdomen was not healing properly and as expected he and others, at 
		the request of the family, gave Quinn a blessing.&nbsp; In this blessing, 
		words of encouragement were given and also that the Lord would guide 
		those were assisting Quinn in his recovery.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn was in Utah from 18 
		December 2003 to the end of February, 2004.&nbsp; During this time he had to 
		have screws placed in his back, he had skin grafts, and was still 
		suffering from head trauma.&nbsp; The head trauma left him experiencing 
		severe mood swings, most of the times he was in an emotional flat zone, 
		with never a smile, at other times almost violent.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He went from 180 pounds to 
		130 pounds.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn would undergo regular 
		therapy, physical, occupational, and speech.&nbsp; While he was in one of the 
		physical therapy sessions that was extremely painful, he became upset 
		and he snapped and started yelling at the therapist and then burst into 
		tears.&nbsp; The therapist was stretching him; it hurt and Quinn yelled, 
		cant you do harder?&nbsp; So the therapist did.&nbsp;&nbsp; He finished his therapy 
		and was in his room lying in bed, crying, when he said, Mom what 
		happened to me?&nbsp; Quinn was back.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I had been thinking of Quinn 
		quite a bit and decided to try to call his parents and find out how he 
		was doing.&nbsp; I called and got the telephone number of Quinns room at the 
		hospital, hoping I could reach his </font><span style="color: #000080">
		parents.&nbsp; I</span><font color="#000080"> made a call to the hospital 
		where I was able to speak with his mother; her voice became quite 
		emotional as she said, We got our son back today!&nbsp; Quinn was a long 
		way from where he eventually needed to be, but he was back. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sometime later, I was sitting 
		in sacrament meeting on the front row of our chapel when my wife sat 
		down beside me, leaned over and said, Quinn Jones is reporting his 
		mission today.&nbsp; I looked at her and said, &quot;I am out of here.&quot;&nbsp; She gave 
		me some directions to the chapel where the meeting was to be held.&nbsp; I 
		got up and rapidly moved to the back of the chapel and out to the 
		parking lot where I hurriedly got into my car and started for the 
		outlying community several miles away, not really sure how to get to the 
		chapel.&nbsp; I had a million thoughts running through my mind as the lights 
		started flashing in my rear view mirror.&nbsp; The last thing I needed was to 
		be pulled over.&nbsp; The officer said I was going fifty in a thirty-five; 
		how could that be?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By the time I found the 
		church, the meeting was nearly over.&nbsp; I heard Quinns unmistakable 
		voice.&nbsp; He was at the pulpit in a wheel chair.&nbsp; He was bearing his 
		testimony of missionary work, the truthfulness of the restored gospel 
		and the reality of Joseph Smiths prophetic calling.&nbsp; He testified of 
		the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; Then as if to show his 
		unquenchable faith in his loving Father in Heaven, his faith in the 
		power of the atonement, in its capacity to make one whole, he grasped 
		the pulpit, and in a struggling fashion pulled himself up, as if to say, 
		I am back, and I am not done!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, I am 
		not sure why I was so drawn to Quinns family and his needs, but this 
		experience had a tremendous impact on the way I prayed.&nbsp; I know that my 
		prayers were only a few of the many united Pleading Petitions that 
		were sent Heavenward during those long months.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I think the term Crying unto 
		the Lord would be applicable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quinn is here today; Quinn 
		would you please stand up?&nbsp; Thanks Quinn.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On one occasion I came home 
		from school and I was met at the door by my wife, who held our infant 
		son, he was lying limply in her arms.&nbsp; She looked pleadingly into my 
		eyes and said, you have got to give him a blessing.&nbsp; He had been ill 
		for a few days; we had followed the counsel and directions of the 
		Doctors but things just were not improving and this day he had suddenly 
		gotten worse.&nbsp; We felt helpless. We needed a higher power to intervene.&nbsp; 
		In those moments our prayers became poignant, pleading petitions, they 
		were not the almost casual prayers that I often seem to slip into.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
		this instance our will was his will the vault was opened the child 
		responded, and his health was restored.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am grateful for the 
		Pleading Petition of the young boy Joseph Smith, in 1820, who after 
		reading James 1:5-6, went forward, knowing that God, would give 
		liberally, if he asked in faith, with nothing wavering.&nbsp; I am grateful 
		for the fact that the Heavens are once again opened and the Priesthood 
		is again upon the earth, that we once again have living Prophets, Seers 
		and Revelators to inspire us and guide us.&nbsp; I testify of this reality, 
		that Gordon B. Hinckley, is a prophet.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify of the power and 
		efficacy of Heartfelt, prayerful petitions, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
		Amen.</font></p>

		administration, faculty, staff and students, I thank you for the 
		invitation to be here.&nbsp; I am grateful for the gracious hospitality 
		extended to Sister Orton and me today.&nbsp; What a pleasure it is to see so 
		many students whose countenances glow with the spirit of this 
		University.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am here today by assignment 
		from the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
		Saints.&nbsp; I am humbled by the challenge which this assignment presents 
		and pray earnestly that my remarks will have a positive effect on many 
		who are gathered here in person and on those who will hear them by 
		electronic media.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am well aware of the 
		international character of the student body and faculty of this 
		institution.&nbsp; Given my background and experience, I am well pleased by 
		the composition of todays audience.&nbsp; I am delighted that students here 
		strive to maintain the highest levels of honesty and integrity according 
		to the Universitys Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards; and 
		that faculty are student focused, their primary responsibilities being 
		teaching and advising.&nbsp; When Elder Henry B. Eyring returned from the 
		installation of President Clark several months ago, he described the 
		experience as exhilarating.&nbsp; He noted that the future of BYUIdaho is 
		unique in the academia of todays world and is without limitation with 
		respect to its force for good in the world.&nbsp; Does this mean that the 
		University and its students and faculty have no room to improve?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; 
		But you have most certainly charted a course which leads in the right 
		direction.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To introduce the subject of 
		my remarks, I quote a couplet from William Butler Yeats classic poem, 
		The Second Coming, written in 1920:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things fall 
		apart, the centre cannot hold;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mere anarchy 
		is loosed upon the world.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Anarchy, if such exists, in 
		the world today takes the following forms, among others:&nbsp; 1) the 
		break-up of the family as the core unit of society; 2) the evils of 
		pornography and immorality in general; 3) the loss of respect for human 
		life and flouting of the rule of law; 4) wars and rumors of war; 5) 
		governments hanging by a thread due largely to selfishness, corruption, 
		and absence of mutual trust and respect coming from within; and 6) the 
		seeming abandonment of organized religion in favor of a morality based 
		on the penchants and the whims of the individual.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Much of our current culture 
		runs counter to the influence of organized religion.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; One 
		cannot help being alarmed by the fact that Yahoo! indexes some 24 
		billion web pages and that 6% of searches return results that link to 
		pornography, amounting to hundreds of millions of pornographic web

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A 2005 poll published in <i>
		Newsweek</i> Magazine found that more Americans, especially those 
		younger than 60, described themselves as spiritual (79%) rather than 
		religious (64%). &nbsp;(Jerry Adler, <i>Newsweek</i>, 9/29/05, In Search 
		of the Spiritual)&nbsp; Many people, perhaps particularly young adults, are 
		seeking spirituality in their lives while rejecting religion, which may 
		appear to them to be both unscientific and intolerant.&nbsp; As one

		We live in a time when young people are caught in a doubleeven 
		triplebind concerning religion.&nbsp; Prominent cultural voices insist that 
		faith [i.e., spirituality] is always a private, subjective matter; that 
		apart from science, there is no such thing as objective truth.&nbsp; At the 
		same time, a strong presumption in our heterogeneous society insists 
		that tolerance is what makes the whole thing work.&nbsp; As a result, many 
		young people are hesitant to assent to a self-limiting creed, first, 
		because they dont want to compromise their integrity or their 
		authenticity by committing themselves to what is not objectively 
		verifiable; and second, because they dont want to seem dogmatic, rigid, 
		or intolerant. . . .&nbsp; </i>(Dennis M. Doyle, Young Catholics and Their

		Deseret Morning News on Sunday, December 3, 2006, in an article 
		entitled, Church Work Enhanced Job Performance, reported this 
		interesting story which I will summarize for you:&nbsp; Conventional wisdom 
		suggests that job performance would decline while one serves, for 
		example, as a bishop of the Mormon Church.&nbsp; In fact, however, the 
		reverse appears to be true.&nbsp; Although serving in a lay ecclesiastical 
		position puts added strain on a persons time, it can actually 
		strengthen ones ability as a leader in a secular position.&nbsp; One notable 
		example, among many, is Jim Quigley who, while serving as a bishop, 
		guided the Tri-State office of an international accounting firm through 
		the 9/11 crisis.&nbsp; He was subsequently elected by the board of directors 
		to be the new CEO of Deloitte and Touche USA.&nbsp; On more than one Sunday 
		afternoon, while sitting in a Church office counting tithing receipts, 
		Brother Quigley thought about other places he could be and other more 
		leisurely activities he could be doing.&nbsp; But he never regretted his 
		decision.&nbsp; Said he, </font></p>

		From a leadership standpoint, serving in a noncompensated ecclesiastical 
		role in the Mormon Church has a direct payoff in the corporate world.&nbsp; 
		In Brother Quigleys case, he went from leading a congregation of 500 
		Mormons to leading a firm with over 34,000 employees.&nbsp; In some ways you 
		can look at your congregation as a laboratory to learn management skills 
		and techniques, he said.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">To

		happiness as a law student, and later as a practicing trial lawyer, was 
		enhanced substantially by my marriage, starting a family and accepting

		If you want to get a job done, and done well, give it to a busy

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In counterpoint to the

		(John 16:33).&nbsp; And in response to the indictment against the lack of 
		conviction of the best, perhaps of us who struggle for balance between 
		the pursuit of earthly things and the approval of Him who matters most 
		in an eternal sense, the Lord made this remarkable statement and 
		promise:&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Brothers and 
		sisters, I am delighted and honored to be with you today. When President 
		Clark invited me to give this presentation, he assured me that it would 
		be another great day at BYUIdaho on which to give the presentation. I 
		asked him how he knew that, and he just assured me that it would be 
		another great day. Suzan and I are delighted to be here. I also want to 
		tell you how extraordinarily lucky you are to have President Clark as 
		your president and Sister Clark as the first lady of this great 
		university. We have had the privilege of knowing them for 30-something 
		years. They are extraordinary human beings with unshakable integrity, 
		both intellectual and spiritual  with a passion for education and 
		extraordinary experience. But most importantly, they understand the 
		centrality of service to the gospel and your lives. I think you will be 
		blessed in ways that you will not recognize until much later in your 
		life by having this extraordinary couple leading this great university. 
		So it is a pleasure to be here, and it is a particular pleasure to be 
		invited by President Clark to talk today. <br />
<br />
		The title of my talk was indicated as Now there was no law against a 
		mans belief, for it was strictly contrary to the commandments of God: 
		A Few Life Lessons from Two Decades in the Trenches of International 
		Human Rights. I do not know if you have memorized it quite yet, but 
		that is a long cumbersome title and, of course, as you know, it comes 
		from Almas great encounter with the antichrist Korihor. It has within 
		it a key element of the gospel. This element is central to the atonement 
		and to the very role that we play here on this earth.<br />
<br />
		It also is the key to understanding what comes next and what is perhaps 
		the most central injunction in all in the scriptures: choose ye this 
		day whom ye will serve. This is a ringing call to all of us  a call to 
		service, but, as I hope to explain today, a call to a particular sort of 
		service.<br />
<br />
		To understand what I mean by this and its relevance to all of our lives, 
		I would like to take you on a little journey. Not an epic journey, not a 
		Lord of the Rings journey, nor an Iliad or an Odyssey though it 
		has certain elements of those  but rather a much smaller, more personal 
		journey. But one that has meaning for me nonetheless and I hope there 
		might be some small meaning in it for you as well. <br />
<br />
		It does have some of the elements of a great journey. Like all great 
		journeys, for example, it starts with an accidental traveler. I am, 
		indeed, the epitome of the accidental traveler, as I will describe. Like 
		many important journeys, it has its moments of being dark, difficult, 
		challenging, and discouraging, causing us to wonder at times whether we 
		will prevail. And, indeed, like many journeys, if I had known how 
		difficult and discouraging it would be from time to time, I am not at 
		all sure I would have embarked upon it.<br />
<br />
		But like all great journeys, it also is one from which I have learned a 
		great deal  both about the subject of the journey, about myself and 
		especially about my relationship to the gospel. Like all great journeys, 
		it is transformative in the most important ways, all the ways that 
		really matter. Like all great journeys, when it is successfully 
		completed, it gives us a new heart, just as Saul was given a new heart 
		by the Lord when he was called by Samuel; it gives us a new heart and it 
		makes us a new man. Like all journeys, it is, in the end, filled with 
		hope.<br />
<br />
		But perhaps most importantly, like all epic journeys, it does not really 
		end. The apparent end of the journey is merely an invitation to a new 
		journey  one that I must take for what time remains for me on this 
		earth, but one I also hope some of you will be willing to take as well. 
		And my promise to you is that as we all become new men and new women 
		and as we all are given new hearts, we will be better able to take the 
		journey and better able to meet its challenges.<br />
<br />
		So, let us start the journey, exploring, in turn, each of its elements. 
		The first is the necessity of an accidental traveler, and, indeed, I am 
		the epitome of the accidental traveler. It started in 1989 when. I was 
		invited by the first President Bush (President George H.W. Bush) to 
		serve in a position in the US Department of State. I was asked to serve 
		because, as President Clark mentioned, I have some background and 
		exposure to Japan and some international experience in the area of trade 
		law. Like all good government service experiences, however, while I 
		joined with the intention of doing Japanese-related and trade-related 
		work, the very first assignment I received was to work on German 
		unification. Now, I had never been to Germany and spoke absolutely no 
		German. I knew where Germany was; I could pick it out on a map, but I 
		knew very, very little about it. So, of course, over the course of the 
		entire first year, I worked virtually full-time drafting and negotiating 
		the treaty that reunified Germany. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Based on that work, I was then asked to conduct negotiations on behalf 
		of the United States under the auspices of an international organization 
		that was then called the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
		Europe or the CSCE. The CSCE was established to allow the western 
		countries  Europe, the United States and other NATO countries  to 
		negotiate over issues of importance with the Soviet Union and those 
		countries under Soviet control (the Iron Curtain countries). It was a 
		very successful organization because it reached what is probably the 
		most important breakthrough in history in the area of human rights, the 
		Helsinki Accords. The Helsinki Accords did something no other human 
		rights treaty had ever done. Prior to the Helsinki Accords, when 
		countries were asked about their treatment of their own citizens, they 
		would say  and under prevailing international law were entitled to say: 
		That is a matter of domestic politics; it is none of your business. How 
		we treat other people in countries other than our own, what we do across 
		our borders  those can be matters of concern for the international 
		community. But what we do internally to our own citizens is none of the 
		business of other countries. <br />
<br />
		The Helsinki Accords challenged that basic, long-standing principle, 
		establishing for the first time that it is indeed the business of the 
		international community to monitor how countries treated their own 
		citizens. From this simple reversal of the basic presumption of 
		international law, the true power of the human rights movement was 
		really born. <br />
<br />
		In all events, because of my work on German reunification, I had the 
		privilege of conducting some negotiations under the umbrella of the CSCE 
		and learning for the first time of the importance of the human rights 
		movement. That is the genesis of the accidental first step on this 
		journey. <br />
<br />
		I then returned to Columbia University in 1993, where I had taught 
		before, and was immediately enlisted into the human rights movement by 
		one of my very close colleagues, Professor Louis Henkin, a wonderful man 
		who is one of the founders of the international human rights movement 
		and its discipline as an academic subject. To this day, Lou Henkins 
		casebooks are among the leading casebooks in the country. The human 
		rights programs he has started around the country remain among the best 
		and most successful. <br />
<br />
		Lou invited me to join him in starting a human rights program upon my 
		return to Columbia. He came to me and simply asked, You did human 
		rights negotiations while you were in the government, didnt you? 
		Yes, I replied. Good, he said. Come to my office, and we will 
		talk. Hence, we began a program that was designed to bring together the 
		political power of the human rights community with the conceptual power 
		of the religious liberties movement. Let me give you a little background 
		to explain why this is significant. <br />
<br />
		There exists in the United Sates a vibrant human rights community which 
		is largely based on the secular human rights documents that derived out 
		of the United Nations and the Helsinki Accords. But honestly speaking, 
		this community has historically mistrusted the notion of freedom of 
		religion a bit. There exists among many in this community, a sense that 
		those who propound the importance of freedom of religion are largely 
		people who are trying to impose their religious beliefs on others. <br />
<br />
		On the other hand, the religious liberties community  that is, those 
		who champion the cause of freedom of religion around the world  
		sometimes mistrust the more secularly-based human rights community. 
		Religious liberties advocates, often coming from a faith-based 
		perspective, fear the human rights community, really mistrusts religion 
		and is trying to make the world safe from religion, not safe for 
		religion. And so, to put it mildly, the human rights community and the 
		religious liberties community are often at odds.<br />
<br />
		Lou thought that tension was unfortunate, because each of these 
		communities had so much to contribute to each other. Consequently, he 
		proposed that we establish a program, which President Clark mentioned in 
		my introduction, in international human rights and freedom of religion. 
		Through this program, we hoped to encourage the more secularly based 
		human rights community to include freedom of religion as one of its 
		central tenets and to encourage the religious liberties community to 
		work more closely with the human rights community and harness its great 
		power and political clout to its ends. And, in the bargain, we planned 
		to bring these communities together. <br />
<br />
		In the execution of this program, we brought human rights activists  
		particularly religious liberties activists  from all over the world to 
		Columbia and spent a semester teaching them about the basic intellectual 
		and legal underpinnings of human rights, as well as how to be effective 
		human rights advocates. Our mantra was that we would take people who 
		were irritating to their governments and make them more irritating. We 
		were largely successful in that enterprise. But, frankly, in the final 
		analysis, we were not very successful in ever bringing the two 
		communities of human rights activists together.<br />
<br />
		However, the consequence of that work and my prior work in the federal 
		government  both of which were accidental  propelled me into a 
		position of prominence on the U.S. Commission on International Religious 
		Freedom. This Commission was created by statute in 1998 by Congress as a 
		federal advisory commission to advise the President, the Secretary of 
		State, National Security Advisor and the Congress on ways in which our 
		foreign policy could be structured to better encourage freedom of 
		religion around the world. I served on that Commission for about eight 
		years, variously as Chair and Vice Chair most of the time. But my 
		appointment on the Commission was directly a result of my work with Lou 
		Henkin and, in turn, my work with him  and here is the key  was not 
		only because I had done human rights negotiations, but also because I 
		was an observant, faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints. Lou was a very observant Jew, and it was important 
		for him to get someone of faith, someone who came from a faith-based 
		background, to work in this program. Lou believed that only people who 
		had both worked on human rights from the secular perspective and were 
		themselves religious could possibly begin to bridge the divide between 
		these various human rights communities. So my faith was as important as 
		my government experience. <br />
<br />
		And so my journey did not actually start in 1989 when I went to the 
		State Department. Rather, my accidental journey started many, many years 
		before in November of 1829, when John Young took two of his sons  one 
		of whom was named Joseph and the other of whom you may be familiar with, 
		who was named Brigham  to visit his third son, Lorenzo Dow Young, who 
		was my great-great-great-great grandfather. They, along with Heber C. 
		Kimball, took Lorenzo Dow Young a copy of the Book of Mormon and the 
		story of the restored gospel, and two years later Lorenzo was baptized. 
		He admitted at his baptism that since he had believed the gospel for 
		some time, and preached as a Mormon elder, I thought it was time I was 
		baptized. That characteristic of being a slow learner is also part of 
		my heritage, but it is what in the final analysis makes me the supreme 
		and ultimate accidental traveler.<br />
<br />
		I returned to Columbia University and had the opportunity to create a 
		major program on freedom of religion  not because I had been on the 
		Harvard Law Review or a clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court. But, rather, 
		because I had just happened to arrive at the State Department two weeks 
		before the Berlin Wall came down and, more importantly, because I had 
		been blessed by birth with membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints (because John Young decided to visit his son on the 
		way to Pennsylvania to meet the saints). All of this led directly to an 
		appointment and work on the Commission, from which most of the stories 
		that I will talk about today are derived. <br />
<br />
		But the point of all this, although it is a bit of a lengthy lead-up, is 
		to understand that I believe in my life, as will certainly be true in 
		your lives if you are doing the things the Lord wants and are prepared 
		and if you are faithful and take advantage of the positions in which the 
		Lord puts you and the opportunities he gives you, the Lord will put you 
		in positions to do the things that he needs done for his Church. And you 
		will have the opportunity to build the kingdom in ways that you and only 
		you can. <br />
<br />
		So, while I call myself the supreme accidental traveler, perhaps that is 
		a misnomer because, I suspect, there are very few accidents in the 
		Lords kingdom.<br />
<br />
		I was, of course, not one who started out sitting where you are sitting 
		today, saying, I think I want to advance the cause of religious freedom 
		around the world. But the Lord works in mysterious ways and guides and 
		directs us to places and positions necessary to advance His work and to 
		build His kingdom. And we must be sure and ready to respond when He 
		guides us.<br />
<br />
		At times, the journey of which I speak today was also dark, difficult 
		and discouraging. While serving on the Commission, I met people who had 
		been the subject of extraordinary religious persecution. I saw and spoke 
		with survivors of the most extraordinary kinds of atrocities that man 
		can commit against his fellow beings. I met these people, talked with 
		them and saw first hand the atrocities to which they had been subjected.
		<br />
<br />
		From that experience, I learned many important lessons. First, I learned 
		of the importance of religion in geopolitical matters. Not just the 
		importance of religion in our own lives, but also the important impact 
		religion has across the world and across time. <br />
<br />
		Some of these effects are very good. The role of the Catholic Church was 
		very powerful in bringing down the Iron Curtain, particularly if you 
		look at the Solidarity Movement in Poland and the role of the Catholic 
		Church in Hungary. But you can also see this if you look at German 
		Unification itself. The Thursday night candlelight vigils were all 
		conducted around the Lutheran Church and organized by that church. These 
		were powerful geopolitical movements. Even a cursory study of history 
		will also teach you of the pivotal role of the Black churches in our own 
		civil rights movements. If you want an interesting reading assignment 
		after todays talk, I urge you to look at Taylor Branchs Parting the 
		Waters. In this extraordinary history of the civil rights movement in 
		the United States, you will see with absolute clarity that the civil 
		rights movement simply would not have happened without the political and 
		organization power and the moral force of religious institutions. The 
		same is true in the pre-Civil War abolition movement in the Untied 
		States. In addition to the power of religion in our personal lives, one 
		cannot help but see the enormous transformative power of religion on a 
		grand geopolitical stage.<br />
<br />
		But one also sees religion for ill as well. As a student of Japan, I 
		look at the manipulation of Shinto in the run up to World War II and the 
		way in which Japanese leaders transformed Shinto from a local, family 
		and nature-oriented set of low-key worship experiences to a powerful and 
		virulent form of nationalism and ideological and political control. You 
		can look at the use of religion in the Middle East today. Afghanistan 
		under the Taliban is a graphic poster child for the very worst that 
		religion can do. You can look at religious oppression in Saudi Arabia 
		where the government has entered into an unholy alliance with the Wahabi 
		sect of Islam and allows that sect to impose itself in the most 
		repressive way in exchange for the support of the leaders of that sect 
		to the Saud Family. <br />
<br />
		Look at Nigeria and see what is happening in the five Northern provinces 
		where Sharia Law is being imposed on even those who are not Muslim. Look 
		at the conflicts on the front pages of the newspaper almost every day 
		and you will see Ethiopia and Somalia. And, of course, there is Sudan, 
		first with its long-running, though now settled war between the Islamist 
		North (with the government that controls the capital city Khartoum) and 
		the largely animist and Christian South, and now with the terrible 
		genocide in Darfur. You can see the suppression of freedom of religion 
		by many Orthodox Churches in Russia, and even Greece for that matter, 
		which, though a supposedly enlightened Western country, has a very bad 
		human rights record on freedom of religion.<br />
<br />
		So, one sees the centrality of religion on a global political scale. 
		Understanding that is crucial to understanding the world. <br />
<br />
		At the same time, however, in the middle of my journey, the most dark 
		and discouraging discoveries were those horrendous abuses committed 
		against individuals. Sometimes these were perpetrated by governments, 
		sometimes by other religious groups, but all were done in the name of, 
		or against religion. China, Vietnam and North Korea are among the very 
		worst offenders. In these countries, one can see at a very personal 
		level the worst that man can do to his fellow man.<br />
<br />
		In my capacity as Chair and Vice Chair of the Commission, I participated 
		in hearings, took trips and met both the victims and perpetrators. I met 
		a Vietnamese Pastor, an elderly man in his 80s, who has been imprisoned 
		and tortured simply because he spoke of his belief in our Lord Jesus 
		Christ. I met an 80-year-old Chinese woman who had been imprisoned and 
		beaten simply because she had secreted in her house small pieces of 
		paper inscribed with her favorite Bible verses. Those were discovered 
		and she was imprisoned and tortured. We met Muslim survivors of a 
		Hindu-led slaughter in India. In this religiously motivated rampage, 
		people had been hacked and burned to death simply because they were 
		Muslims. We met Sudanese who had left the Nuba Mountains or had left 
		their refuges to secure food and supplies being transported by train 
		under the direction of the United Nations. As these people approached 
		the trains, the government of Khartoum sent airplanes to strafe those 
		trying to get supplies. In South Korea, I interviewed a North Korean man 
		whose family had gone across the Yalu River to China for refuge. The 
		Chinese government then allowed the North Korean military to come into 
		China and take his family back into North Korea. They were then taken to 
		a camp. He escaped, but his family was not so lucky. They received, he 
		told me, the short haircut. I was very confused by this and asked, 
		What do you mean? He said, Well, my six-year-old sister had a small 
		cross that she was wearing at the time of our capture. It had been given 
		to her by a Christian priest in China, and because she was wearing this 
		small trinket, the entire family was taken and given the short 
		haircut. I thought tonsorial adjustments were an odd way to treat 
		violations of the law in North Korea, but he explained. The short 
		haircut means their heads were cut off. His entire family had been 
		beheaded because a six-year-old girl had been given a small crucifix by 
		a kindly, well-meaning Priest. <br />
<br />
		This is the world in which we live. And this is what I mean when I 
		describe my journey as dark and discouraging and dismal. <br />
<br />
		But all great journeys teach us. So what did I learn? First, I learned 
		the centrality and importance of religion on the geopolitical level. 
		Through almost all the major national and internationals events I have 
		witnessed during my lifetime, and as I study history, the centrality of 
		religion absolutely amazes me. Religion is used and abused. It is 
		sometimes a causal variable and sometimes a caused variable. It is 
		sometimes a pretext and sometimes real. But it is always, always, always 
		central. Looking as far back as early Chinese history, the great empires 
		of the Persians, the Meads, the Syrians, the Romans, the Ottomans and 
		the Byzantines, our world wars, the centrality of religion is 
		immediately and decisively evident, if one just pays attention. <br />
<br />
		But once I realized the centrality of religion in the great geopolitical 
		events of all ages, something else became glaringly obvious. If religion 
		is that important, we should not only take it seriously and make it a 
		matter of great study in our own personal lives  for our own personal 
		edification and the edification of our family  but also take it most 
		seriously as an intellectual and academic pursuit. <br />
<br />
		Today, I want to strongly urge you to think about that. To be perfectly 
		honest, the academies and the great universities of the world have to 
		some large extent failed you by largely writing religion out of the 
		curriculum. And I do not necessarily mean religion as theology, as 
		important as that is. Rather, I mean religion as it relates to 
		economics, political science, sociology and law, and on and on. We are 
		even discovering how it relates to medicine. If we do not study that, we 
		really study the world with one hand tied behind our back. It may be a 
		causal variable, it may be caused, it may be pretext, it may be real, 
		but it is always important.<br />
<br />
		So, though it has been a long wind-up to the pitch, the second 
		suggestion I give to you today is to think seriously about ways in which 
		you can make religion in the context of whatever discipline you are 
		studying an important, indeed central, intellectual pursuit. Insist that 
		your professors do it and make it an important part of your intellectual 
		journey. And I think you are well-positioned to do just that, 
		particularly at this wonderful university where religion is already a 
		central part of all you do. You are in a terrific position to make it a 
		serious part not only of your moral and personal spiritual journey, but 
		also of your intellectual journey.<br />
<br />
		But religion is important on a geopolitical level because, of course, it 
		is important to people individually. Political groups are formed and act 
		largely on the basis of the amalgamation of feelings of the individuals 
		that comprise the group. For the vast majority of the people in the 
		world  not just members of our church and not just Christians  I want 
		to testify to you that religion matters enormously, perhaps more 
		importantly than anything else. And the reason is very simple. It deals 
		with those matters that are most important and fundamental to people. 
		Who am I? How should I live my life? What is the most important thing 
		for me to be doing in my life? What is the purpose in my life? What is 
		lifes meaning? How should I raise my family? What should I teach my 
		children? What happens to me when I die? Will I ever see my loved ones 
		again? It is not just those of us who sit in our churches on Sunday and 
		think about those matters. The vast majority of the population thinks 
		about it constantly. Across time, across peoples, across cultures, 
		histories, backgrounds, the questions are the same. Let me give you just 
		one small example of what I mean.<br />
<br />
		I have spent many years in Japan and much of my career studying about 
		Japan. During those studies, I was, of course, exposed to Buddhism. You 
		would think Zen Buddhism is about as far from Christianity as you can 
		imagine, but let me read a passage from one of the most famous Zen 
		masters, Katsuda Sekida. He writes: I had naturally believed that if I 
		only got kensho [kensho is the enlightenment that you seek in Zen, which 
		makes the meaning of the universe clear], the secret of the universe, 
		the problem of death, and everything else would be solved instantly, 
		once and for all... Where I am from, whither I shall go, the true nature 
		of reality, eternal life, and everything else will be understood as 
		clearly as looking at a picture... (K. Sekida, Zen Training, page 215)<br />
<br />
		So Master Sekida embraced Zen to answer precisely the same questions 
		that we send missionaries into the world to answer. And he then goes on 
		to say something very interesting: even if my life is taken at this 
		moment, I shall not be grieved so long as I have understood the secret. 
		(Ibid) Like virtually everyone else in the world, he yearned for lifes 
		most basic questions and was willing to give his life to find the 
		answers. <br />
<br />
		We know this desire from our own faith background. Aaron, one of the 
		great missionaries among the sons of Mosiah, speaks to King Lamonis 
		father in the twenty-second chapter of Alma. The king asks, What shall 
		I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou has spoken? I 
		will, he says, give up all that I posses, yea I will forsake my 
		kingdom, that I may receive this great joy. I will give up my kingdom 
		and all that I posses. (Alma 22:15)<br />
<br />
		As we were riding up here, we stopped in Malad, Idaho. As I was standing 
		there, a fellow looked at me and said, Did you hear about the fellow 
		who just won the lottery? I said, No. He won $200 million dollars 
		and he is 84 and he will never have a chance to spend it, he responded. 
		The man then proceeded to describe at some length what he would do with 
		the $200 million dollars. And not much of it was to pay tithing, as 
		nearly as I could tell. As I was listening to him talk, I was thinking 
		what King Lamonis father, who had the equivalent of more than $200 
		million dollars, said: I would give it all away to know this.<br />
<br />
		Christ himself taught this in typical parable fashion. He says in the 
		thirteenth chapter of Matthew, Like unto a treasure hid in a field, 
		that the which when a man hath found he hideth, and for joy thereof 
		goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buy the field.<br />
<br />
		Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly 
		pearls. Who, when he hath found one pearl of great price, went and sold 
		all that he had and bought it. (Matthew 13:44-45)<br />
<br />
		So it is not surprising that religion moves us in a global sense because 
		it moves us in an individual sense. But we must take it seriously in 
		both senses and we are enormously blessed because of the truth that we 
		have. <br />
<br />
		But that blessing alone is not enough because it is both a blessing and 
		a call to service. I am often reminded, when I think of how fortunate I 
		am to be a member of the Church, of the great coach who once said that 
		many people are born on third base and think they have hit a triple. 
		(Barry Switzer, former coach of the Oklahoma Sooners and the Dallas 
		Cowboys)<br />
<br />
		I feel like that sometimes; that I was born on third base and think I 
		have hit a triple. But if you are on third base, it gives you the 
		obligation to run home. That is what the gospel gives us the privilege 
		of doing, but it gives us an obligation as well. <br />
<br />
		To put the matter slightly differently, freedom of religion, or 
		religious liberties, is very, very important. It is sometimes called the 
		first freedom. And I think it is called that not simply because it is 
		listed first in the Bill of Rights. It is called the first freedom 
		because it is fundamental in so many ways. It goes to that thing that is 
		most important to us as human beings. Religion is what defines us. 
		Religion is what helps us understand our relationship to the universe 
		and therefore it is an essential part of what it means to be human. 
		Respecting the dignity of religion and our ability to make our own 
		choices regarding religion and our belief system must be the first thing 
		that governments do. <br />
<br />
		Protecting religious freedom is a moral imperative of the most profound 
		sort, but, at the same time, it is also very practical, with very 
		significant teleological components as well. This is because protecting 
		ones freedom of religion necessarily and inescapably presupposes the 
		propriety of allegiance to something higher than that government. Any 
		government that respects freedom of religion must necessarily wrestle 
		with, and accept, its own limitations. If you believe that a government 
		must provide freedom of religion, then you must also believe  and that 
		government must also believe  that there are appropriate limits to 
		government power, that there are parts of our lives into which a 
		government cannot intrude. Such governments, when they provide that 
		protection, are more likely to earn the adherence and loyalty of their 
		own citizens and to allow those citizens to reach their full potential 
		as human beings and as members of the world community. This is the great 
		principle of John Locke and, unfortunately, one that is lost on so many 
		governments in the world. Nevertheless, it is one that is of the very 
		highest importance.<br />
<br />
		Now, precisely because it is that important and precisely because it 
		bespeaks the propriety of an allegiance to something higher than the 
		state, it also is very often the first right governments try to 
		suppress. If you see a government trying to suppress and control freedom 
		of religion, then you know trouble is on the way. It is like the canary 
		in the coal mine. It is the first signal that a government is beginning 
		to abuse all the human rights or soon will. <br />
<br />
		This has generated another of the great lessons I learned on my journey. 
		Not only is religion important to me as a personal matter and I should 
		do all I can to follow the dictates of my Heavenly Father; and not only 
		should I study religion as an academic matter to better understand the 
		role it plays in world and human affairs so I can better build the kind 
		of world our Heavenly Father wants; but the ability to believe and 
		worship freely is so important to all people that I ought to do all I 
		can to ensure its protection all over the world. <br />
<br />
		But as I learned these lessons and contemplated these experiences, I 
		began to wonder what my own religion teaches about freedom of religion. 
		As a citizen, I believe I have an obligation to protect it. But what 
		obligation and responsibility do I have as a member of our Church? As a 
		follower of Christ? So I began to study more carefully just what our own 
		religion teaches us about the importance and centrality of this concept.
		<br />
<br />
		Certainly I anticipated that as I read the scriptures, I would discover 
		that it would be a wise and prudent policy and a good idea. But the more 
		I studied, the more surprised I was to learn how central this doctrine 
		is to the core of the Church and that fighting for religious freedom and 
		guaranteeing that right not only to ourselves but to others is critical 
		not only as a matter of history, political theory and political 
		practice, but even more importantly as a matter of doctrine. <br />
<br />
		Let me speak for a few moments about precisely what I mean by that. We 
		can open up the scriptures to the thirtieth chapter of Alma in the Book 
		of Mormon. Contained in these verses is a brief comment that I used to 
		consider almost a throw-away line in a longer story and discourse, but 
		now have come to understand is much more central to the gospel than I 
		could have ever imagined. <br />
<br />
		Remember, this is a discourse where Korihor, the antichrist, came to 
		preach against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets. 
		(Alma 30:6) As the Book of Mormon makes very clear, however, his 
		dissenting opinion was not a concern of the law. It makes that point 
		abundantly, indeed excessively clear. Even before we learn how 
		pernicious Korihors teachings were, or even what they were, we learn 
		that, the law could have no hold upon him, whatever his beliefs. (Alma 
		30:12)<br />
<br />
		Now that might sound like an interesting principle of governance, a 
		sound and prudential way to structure the legal system. But what is 
		interesting is that this principle is so much more. Establishing a law 
		that regulated a mans beliefs was not just unsound as a matter of 
		governance, but it was strictly contrary to the commands of God. (Alma 
		30:7) This was not a prudential majority decision. Rather, this kind of 
		a law would have been contrary to the commands of God. Why? Because such 
		a law would have brought men onto unequal grounds. (Ibid.) <br />
<br />
		Both parts of that sentence are very interesting. First, the absence of 
		a law dictating ones beliefs was not to be left entirely to the 
		decisions of the judges or the legislators; rather, it was established 
		because that law would have been contrary to Gods law. Secondly, any 
		law like that would have brought men onto unequal ground. And why is 
		that relevant? The prophets tell us in the very next verse, For thus 
		saith the scripture, choose ye this day whom ye well serve. (Alma 30:8) 
		In other words, without the capacity or freedom to choose, we cannot 
		make the choice to serve the Lord, and that, in turn, deprives us of the 
		most important opportunity of all: the opportunity to choose to serve 
		the Lord and to choose salvation. <br />
<br />
		So it is contrary to Gods law to do anything that might inhibit the 
		capacity for our fellow human beings to choose. The laws and governments 
		must be structured to give ample scope to that capacity to choose. 
		Anything else is contrary to the commands of God.<br />
<br />
		Now, in case we miss that  we might be a little dense, as I certainly 
		was when I first skipped through these verses  the prophets restate 
		that basic principle again and again for three more verses. The judges 
		cannot and more importantly should not do anything to Korihor through 
		application of the law. So, in the end, they take him to Alma, who has 
		an interesting prophetic way of dealing with him.<br />
<br />
		Another confirmation of this most basic and profound principle is found 
		in the sixty-first chapter of Alma, and I invite you to open that up. 
		This is Pahorans remarkably restrained, noble and temperate response to 
		Moronis accusations. If you read Moronis accusations and what was 
		going on with Pahoran, you would think Pahoran would have had the right 
		to be a little upset with Moroni. Moroni, who never pulled his punches 
		either in war or in writing, excoriates Pahoran, obviously without a 
		full grasp of the facts. But Pahoran responds very temperately and in a 
		particularly interesting way. He says he understands the Lamanites are 
		knocking at the door and that Moroni desperately needs more supplies. 
		But, he continues, he cannot provide them because there is this 
		rebellion being prosecuted by some grasping Nephites who are using the 
		war as an occasion to obtain control and power. So, Pahoran invites 
		Moroni back to repress the rebellion, while urging him to continue to 
		prosecute the war against the Lamanites. And here is where his letter 
		really gets interesting. Pahoran urges Moroni to leave Lehi and Teancum 
		with adequate power and authority to prosecute the war appropriately and 
		to give them power to conduct the war according to the spirit of the 
		Lord. (Alma 61:15) Now for a religious people with a prophet in charge, 
		that is not such a surprising injunction. But then Pahoran tells Moroni 
		to instruct them  and this is the phrase that is so interesting  to 
		conduct the war according to the spirit of God, which is also the 
		spirit of freedom which is in them. (Alma 61:15)<br />
<br />
		This equation that links the spirit of God with the spirit of freedom 
		does not seem accidental or casual. And remember any time the writers 
		phrased something wrong or inelegantly in the Book of Mormon, they went 
		back and rephrased it to get it precisely right. Thus, this linkage 
		seems purposeful, pointedly making the connection between true liberty 
		and Heavenly Fathers spirit. And, again, this should leave absolutely 
		no mistake in our minds regarding the centrality of the concept of free 
		will in our Father in Heavens plan. That most fundamental principle 
		gives us the freedom to choose our own way of life. It even  and 
		perhaps especially  gives that right to Korihor, someone with whom we 
		disagree most strongly. The scriptures even enjoin us to give that right 
		to someone who would, if he could, take that very right away from us. 
		The scriptures challenge us to give that right to precisely those with 
		whom we disagree the most and who, if they had the chance, would take it 
		away from us. <br />
<br />
		So what is the lesson that I drew from all of this? It is that, at least 
		for me, there are not only practical, prudential and emotional reasons 
		to work to provide true freedom for all people, but, more important, 
		there is an essential doctrinal imperative that also forces me to 
		champion the cause of liberty for all. That task is essential to ensure 
		my freedom, as well as the freedom of my children and my family to be 
		sure, but it is also essential for me to advance that cause to ensure my 
		own eternal salvation.<br />
<br />
		So, this leads me to the end of my journey, but an ending that is truly 
		not an end but just a beginning. Religion is still greatly suppressed 
		around the world; there is much to do. And I invite you to join me. This 
		is an extraordinary journey, where people of goodwill can truly 
		transform the world in which we live, creating an environment in which 
		people can truly choose this day whom they will serve. <br />
<br />
		I am often struck by Joseph Smiths injunction that there would come a 
		time when the Constitution would hang by a thread and be saved by the 
		elders of the Church. I suspect many of us considered that and decided 
		it was going to be through the training of righteous LDS lawyers. I am 
		all for that  of course, you can never have enough lawyers. But at the 
		end of the day, I do not think that is what he meant. When Joseph was 
		talking about elders, he was almost invariably talking about people who 
		went out and preached the gospel.<br />
<br />
		What guarantees the protection and preservation of the basic principles 
		on which this great country was founded is not more laws, but more 
		righteousness. And our capacity to create an environment in which people 
		can realize their own righteousness and can choose this day whom they 
		will serve becomes absolutely essential to the mission and the quest 
		which I think is our responsibility. It is an essential principle, 
		without which our Father in Heavens plan cannot be fulfilled. To allow 
		others to be blessed by this plan, we have to make it possible for 
		everyone. We must create an environment in which all can choose, in 
		which all have this fundamental precondition of salvation available to 
		them. This really hastens not only the day of their salvation, but I 
		also believe provides the opportunity to preach and is the precursor of 
		our opportunity to teach them the gospel and the true principles. In 
		other words, it hastens the day of our own personal salvation.<br />
<br />
		Some years ago, when I was Stake President in New York, I had a 
		wonderful Area President, Elder Loren Dunn. I met with him frequently, 
		and at the end of every meeting and every discussion, he would always 
		say, President, remember you are on the Lords errand. I do not think 
		I fully appreciated what he really meant by that until some years later. 
		But the more I read the scriptures and the more I wrestle with lifes 
		challenges, both professional and ecclesiastical, I think I begin to 
		understand what he was telling me. When we are on the Lords errand  
		and what I want to convince you of today is that helping all have the 
		blessings of freedom is indeed the Lords errand  the Lord will give us 
		the strength to do it.<br />
<br />
		Remember what Elisha showed his servant when all the Syrians were 
		amassed in front of him. He opened the servants eyes and showed him the 
		angels that were standing by to protect them and to fight their battles. 
		Elisha concludes: Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they 
		that be with them. (2 Kings 6:16) As Ezekiel told the Israelites, A 
		new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: 
		and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give 
		you an heart of flesh.<br />
<br />
		And I will put my spirit within you (and here is the really 
		interesting part) and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall 
		keep my judgments and do them. (Ezekiel 36: 26-27)<br />
<br />
		The promise of the atonement is not just that we will be blessed if we 
		manage to repent and become perfect. It is the promise that the Lord 
		will give us the power to become perfect if we desire and if we rely on 
		him.<br />
<br />
		This came to me very clearly one day as I was talking to someone who has 
		now become quite a good friend  Alex Smith, who played football for us, 
		not nearly long enough I must say, but for a couple of years, and has 
		since gone on to a career in the NFL in which he is happily getting 
		better and better. I remember talking to Alex one day about the NFL 
		draft, and it occurred to me that because of his abilities, Alex would 
		likely go No. 1 in the draft. I, on the other hand, with all the work in 
		the world could not (and never would have been able to) run the 
		forty-yard dash under 4.1 seconds, throw a 70-yard pass or evade an NFL 
		defender. Alex can do that, but I never could do that.<br />
<br />
		So is the atonement like the NFL draft? Is the Lord telling me that 
		once I can run that forty-yard dash and throw that pass seventy yards, 
		I will make it to Heaven? If so, it is an entirely illusory promise 
		because I can never do that. But the atonement is not an illusory 
		promise. Ezekiel tells us that he will cause us to walk in his 
		statutes. (Ezekiel 36:27) As John told us at the very beginning of 
		Christs ministry, As many as received him, to them gave he power to 
		become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. (John 
		1:12) Isaiah promises that, He giveth power to the faint and to them 
		that have no might he increaseth in strength. (Isaiah 40:29) We know if 
		we have, as Joshua is instructed, the courage to obey, then, As I [the 
		Lord] was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor 
		forsake thee...for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou 
		goest. (Joshua 1: 5 &amp; 9)<br />
<br />
		I want to just leave you with a testimony that I do believe that we have 
		the privilege and the opportunity and the capacity to create an 
		environment in which people can truly choose this day whom they will 
		serve. I also testify that we have a moral imperative and an obligation 
		to do precisely that. But I also testify that if we work to that end, 
		then the Lord will go with us whithersoever we go. And I bear that 
		testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If youre happy and you

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If youre happy and you

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You look to me like a happy 
		group of young people not like the missionary group President Hinckley 
		spoke to one time when he said You all look like youve been sucking on 
		pickles!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Those who authored the 
		Declaration of Independence declared that everyone is entitled to Life, 
		Liberty and the <i>Pursuit of Happiness</i>.&nbsp; Isnt happiness part of 
		what <i>you</i> are looking for here at BYUIdaho?&nbsp; Thats a worthy 
		pursuit and in light of the importance of happiness in our lives Id 
		like to explore some areas that are guaranteed to provide happiness for 
		you today and on into your very bright future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>First, happiness is 
		excellence in your educational pursuits.</b>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As a student, if you want to 
		be happy with your collegiate life, the most important thing you must do 
		is commit yourself to being excellent in your academics; do your best; 
		work hard at it; give the effort required to be an excellent student.&nbsp; 
		Whenever I think of excellence I remember a story that Sister Marjorie 
		Hinckley liked to tell about a young girl who lost her parents when she 
		was very young:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She had been raised by 
			her grandmother, who for some reason or other never bothered to tell 
			her anything much about her mother.&nbsp; One day, when my friend was in 
			her teens, she was going through some papers in her grandmothers 
			house, and she ran across a report card of her mothers from grade 
			school.&nbsp; At the bottom of the card in a space labeled remarks the 
			teacher had written: Excellent in every way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This young woman clasped 
			the card to her chest and waltzed around the room saying, my mother 
			was excellent.&nbsp; My mother was excellent in every way!&nbsp; Its all she 
			ever knew about her mother, but it inspired her the rest of her 
			life.&nbsp; It does matter, my dear young friends, that you are excellent 
			in every way.&nbsp; It matters. [Glimpses Into the Life of Marjory Pay 
			Hinckley, pp. 230-31.]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to this example 
		from Sister Hinckley we have all heard our Prophet, President Hinckley 
		advice us to do your best, your very best. We would do well to follow 
		their advice to be excellent and to do you best, your very best in all 
		your classes.&nbsp; Dont shortchange yourself by just getting by, being 
		slouchy in completion of assignments or preparing for exams.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of course, each professor is 
		going to think that his is the ONLY class you are taking.&nbsp; It has always 
		been a fact of university life.&nbsp; So join the club!&nbsp; As you set aside 
		time each day for studies, consider each class you study for as the most 
		important class you have, at least for that study period.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Get acquainted with your 
		professors.&nbsp; These well educated and dedicated men and women have so 
		much to offer you.&nbsp; Fall in love with the subject he or she teaches.&nbsp; 
		They say of a person, to know him is to love him.&nbsp; Perhaps that same 
		philosophy could be said of the subjects you study.&nbsp; To know history is 
		to love history.&nbsp; To know chemistry is to love chemistry!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One sure fire formula for 
		achieving success in your academics is to do what my very smart and 
		brilliant husband did as a college student.&nbsp; Would you like me to share 
		his secrets to academic success with you? &nbsp;He made it a practice to get 
		up by 6:00 or 6:30 on Saturday mornings and begin studying . &nbsp;He could 
		put in a good 5 hours by 11:00.&nbsp; He reports that it was the best and 
		most alert 5 hours of his day.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time his roommates and other 
		college students were rolling out of bed, he had finished his studies 
		and was ready to go play with them.&nbsp; Of course it was necessary for him 
		to be home early from his date on Friday night so he could get up early 
		on Saturday, which got me home early too! &nbsp;I remember when we were 
		dating that hed just all of a sudden look at his watch and say, Well, 
		I gotta go now.&nbsp; And off hed go.&nbsp; It left me wondering about this 
		fellow and wanting to know more.&nbsp; Not a bad strategy, on both counts  
		academically and socially! </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then on Sunday he attended 
		his meetings and fulfilled his callings and decided as his own personal 
		choice that he wouldnt study on Sundays.&nbsp; And he never did. &nbsp;But on 
		Monday he got up again at 6:00 a.m. and studied hard in the early 
		morning hours until his first class.&nbsp; Each weekday he studied a normal 
		amount and hung out at the library with his friends.&nbsp; But the <i>tipping 
		point</i> for his <i>grade point</i> was the early Saturday and Monday 
		morning sessions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So that was his secret weapon 
		and it served him well.&nbsp;&nbsp; After attending BYUI he graduated from BYU.&nbsp; 
		He then received a Harvard MBA (President Clark) and then a PhD from the 
		University of California at Berkeley which meant he had finally 
		graduated from the 22<sup>nd</sup> grade.&nbsp; Now you know his secret!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to your formal 
		classes, your education can be so greatly enhanced as you participate in 
		extracurricular activities, especially here, where rich opportunities 
		are readily available and encouraged.&nbsp; They are an important facet of 
		your education.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of your fellow students 
		sent us an email outlining some of his educational and extracurricular 
		activities this year.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am staying very busy 
			with my classes and also with all of the performing groups I am 
			participating in. We will be going on a High School tour in Idaho in 
			two weeks, singing and doing workshops in western Idaho.&nbsp; Also the 
			Sacred Music Series will be performed this year.&nbsp; It will go on 
			tour to Logan, Utah and the Salt Lake area towards the end of 
			March.&nbsp; I found out today that I will have the lead role in 
			Strausss Die Fledermaus, as The Baron Eisenstein.&nbsp; I am very 
			excited to work in my first opera ever, and very excited to work 
			along side such amazing singers and faculty members as found here at 
			BYUI. The weather is cold.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But the spirit that permeates the 
			atmosphere here is addicting, and I would not want to be anywhere 
			else.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You can see that in his 
		pursuit of excellence his full schedule keeps him learning and happy! 
		And, besides enhancing his educational goals, this young man will no 
		doubt meet other students with his same interests, and Im sure they 
		will form friendships and have some memorable times together!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to 
		the opera  see him perform and be inspired to develop your own interest 
		and talents.&nbsp; Which brings me to my second point:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Happiness is learning to 
		get along socially.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever heard the song 
		that says, People who need people are the happiest people in the 
		world. This world is full of people  300 million in the United States 
		alone.&nbsp; My friend Eric from China who is here today is one of 1.3 
		billion people who live in his country.&nbsp; It is the worlds largest and 
		most populous country. Living in isolation in this world is nearly 
		impossible.&nbsp; Its probably not very psychologically healthy and its 
		certainly no fun!&nbsp; We need each other.&nbsp; No man is an island.&nbsp; You are 
		going to interact with people of all different cultures, beliefs and 
		personalities now while in college and in the years ahead, so it is 
		important to figure out how to get along with other people. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Get to know your roommates, 
		really know them.&nbsp; Learn to care about them and discover what you can do 
		to brighten their day. &nbsp;It might not be anything big, but just to pay a 
		sincere compliment to someone could go a long way in helping them have a 
		really good day.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever thought about 
		fixing your roommates favorite food for dinner one day when its your 
		turn to cook?&nbsp; You do have your meals together as roommates or dinner 
		groups, dont you?&nbsp; If not, you may want to investigate this outstanding 
		practice as a way to make friends and save money as a bonus!&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Or perhaps you could make a 
		bed, leave a note, share a smile, a wink, a handshake, a hug, say hi 
		as you pass on campus. The idea is to do something nice for someone 
		every day.&nbsp; Its great exercise for the heart!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is a young man I 
		greatly admire who has a practice of always saying What can I do for 
		you?&nbsp; And youd be surprised how often someone tells him!&nbsp; And he 
		cheerfully responds with the help!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To stay on track socially, 
		keep in mind the little rule of thumb, Always do and always say the 
		kindest thing in the kindest way.&nbsp; And then do you remember Thumper 
		from the movie Bambi?&nbsp; Remember this piece of wisdom that he said in his 
		cute way:&nbsp; If you cant say somethin nice, dont say nothin at 
		all?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh you cant find those exact words in the New Testament but 
		surely they are included in what we call the golden rule found in 
		Matthew [chapter 7 verse 12:]&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore all things whatsoever ye 
		would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, the day 
		will come when the social skills you are practicing today will serve you 
		well.&nbsp; You will be grateful you have learned to relate well with people 
		as you are interviewing for a job, or doing a business deal, or working 
		with your childs school teacher, or the PTA, or the condo association, 
		or your banker.&nbsp; Good social skills pave the way for effective working 
		relationships in your church callings.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">People like people whom they 
		can trust.&nbsp; They like people who exhibit strength of character.&nbsp; So be 
		good.&nbsp; Be nice.&nbsp; Be thankful and friendly and helpful. &nbsp;This sounds so 
		simplistic and it really is.&nbsp; Social skills are not complicated and 
		these social skills will bless your life and the lives of countless 
		others forever.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Third, Happiness is having 
		fun!</b>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That sounds a little 
		frivolous, doesnt it?!&nbsp; But this is a good time in your life to have 
		the right kind of fun as well as to work hard.&nbsp; You will make some happy 
		memories as you do so. &nbsp;You just have to remember to not let having fun 
		take over your life!&nbsp; Keep the proper balance!&nbsp; &nbsp;The Proclamation on the 
		Family suggests that we should enjoy wholesome recreational activities.&nbsp; 
		So, have fun in a clean, good way, in a way that you can feel the 
		spirit.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Abraham Lincoln once said, 
		When I do good I feel good; when I do bad I feel bad.&nbsp; Always do 
		things that make you feel good, feel worthy, feel happy and uplifted as 
		opposed to ashamed, guilty or worried.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Fun activities can have a 
		positive effect in your life.&nbsp; As an example of this I would like to 
		tell you about a wonderful mission president and his darling wife I met 
		while I was on was on a church assignment in Argentina.&nbsp; I had occasion 
		to ask him how he came to join the church.&nbsp; He told me that as a 
		teenager, one day he was with some friends looking for something to do.&nbsp; 
		They invited him to come to a church dance with them that night.&nbsp; So he 
		did.&nbsp; He said, I loved the way everyone treated me.&nbsp; I loved the music 
		they played.&nbsp; I loved the way I felt while I was there.&nbsp; So he asked 
		his friends if he could come to church with them the next day and they 
		happily agreed to take him.&nbsp; He had those same kinds of feelings when he 
		was at church.&nbsp; By the way, that teaches the principle that the spirit 
		can be felt when we are participating in good, wholesome recreation as 
		well as in the reverence of a church meeting.&nbsp; Remember the thought 
		when I do good, I feel good.&nbsp; Well, one thing led to another and he 
		was taught the gospel, joined the church and soon went on a mission.&nbsp; 
		When he returned from his mission he began going to institute and young 
		adult activities where he met the lovely young woman who became his 
		wife.&nbsp; They were married in the temple and in due time had their first 
		baby.&nbsp; With reverence in his voice he said When it was time for that 
		baby to receive a name and a blessing, I could do it because I held the 
		Priesthood.&nbsp; That day I was so thankful for the great blessing of the 
		Priesthood.&nbsp; When it was time for the child to be baptized he, of course 
		was able to baptize and confirm the child because, and he said it with 
		awe, I held the priesthood.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The years passed and he 
		continued to faithfully serve where called in the church, always 
		thankful for the blessings his membership brought.&nbsp; Then he told me, 
		When my child was ready to receive a patriarchal blessing, I was 
		serving as the Stake Patriarch and I was able to give the blessing to my 
		own child.&nbsp; Time went on and so did his service in the church and then 
		the day came when his child was ready to be married in the Temple of the 
		Lord.&nbsp; At that time he was serving as a sealer in the temple and had the 
		humbling privilege of performing the eternal marriage ordinance for his 
		own child.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He was overwhelmed with the 
		blessings that had come into his life because he had gone to a church 
		activity to have fun, where he felt the spirit of the Lord.&nbsp; But 
		behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good 
		continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do 
		good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God. [Moroni 7: 
		13]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The fourth point is: </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>True happiness is found in 
		being virtuous.</b>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of my favorite scriptures 
		comes to us as a principle with a promise and it is so powerful.&nbsp; Just 
		listen to this: &nbsp;Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly. (the 
		principle) Now the promise:&nbsp; Then shall thy confidence wax strong 
		before God. Of all the requirements for happiness weve discussed 
		today, I think virtue is the most personally powerful.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Can you imagine yourself 
		beholding a new baby fresh from heaven as you hold it in your arms?&nbsp; 
		Imagine what it would be like to look at that tiny brand new life and 
		realize that that baby is your child.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When that time comes to you, 
		what a blessing it will be to know that with the birth of this infant 
		you have entered into a partnership with God to lead and guide one of 
		beloved His spirit children.&nbsp; What a blessing it will&nbsp; then be to you, 
		to know that in this partnership with heaven you can have complete 
		confidence before God that you are a worthy, virtuous partner in whom He 
		can place His trust.&nbsp; That feeling is worth everything. Everything.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That feeling of <i>pure 
		happiness</i> is worth giving up every worldly temptation to feel.&nbsp; At 
		that moment you will know that it was worth it to turn completely away 
		from anything that looked or sounded filthy, sleazy or pornographic, or 
		anything that aroused unworthy thoughts to come to you.&nbsp; It was worth it 
		to speak in modest, refined tones and language.&nbsp; It was worth it to 
		behave in modest worthy ways in every way, never betraying the best that 
		is in you, never tossing aside the warnings of prophets, regarding your 
		personal, private comportment;&nbsp;&nbsp; but behaving always as a cherished, 
		beloved daughter or son of your Heavenly Father.&nbsp; It was worth it to set 
		a pattern for your life that is virtuous in every way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On that day when you hold 
		your newborn child close to your heart you can have confidence that you 
		will be guided by God himself, because you are worthy of that guidance.&nbsp; 
		You will know that keeping your covenants with exactness in every way 
		has brought you to the feelings of exquisite joy welling up inside your 
		heart.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On the day you become a 
		mother or a father you will be oh so grateful that you didnt 
		procrastinate the day of your repentance when that was necessary but you 
		did those things required to partake of the Saviors redeeming, 
		forgiving, cleansing power.&nbsp; It was worth all the pain and sorrow that 
		it takes to truly repent in order to be on the threshold of a new life 
		knowing that though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as 
		snow [Isaiah 1:18]&nbsp; And the additional promise that he who has 
		repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I the Lord remember them 
		no more. &nbsp;[D and C 58:42]&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is worth everything in 
		this world to be known as a man or a woman of strong character; a person 
		of complete integrity.&nbsp; Go forward from this moment on to let virtue 
		garnish your thoughts unceasingly so that your confidence will wax 
		strong before God.&nbsp; When you have confidence in standing before God, it 
		will be easy to have confidence before the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a general conference 
		address Apostle M. Russell Ballard shared with us an experience of his 
		grandfather, who was also an apostle, Elder Melvin J. Ballard.&nbsp; I would 
		like to share that experience with you today to give you a feeling of 
		what it is like to have confidence before God.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Melvin J. Ballard 
		shared this in the testimony that he bore to the First Presidency and 
		the Council of the Twelve in 1919, the day he was ordained an apostle:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He said that during the 
		course of an assignment:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">many questions arose 
			that we had to settle.&nbsp; There was no precedent for us to follow, and 
			we just had to go to the Lord and tell Him our troubles and get 
			inspiration and help from Him.&nbsp; On this occasion I had sought the 
			Lord,and that night I received a wonderful manifestation and 
			impression which has never left me.I saw myself here with you in an 
			upper room of the temple.&nbsp; I was told there was another privilege 
			that was to be mine; and I was led into a room where I was informed 
			I was to meet someone.&nbsp; As I entered the room I saw, seated on a 
			raised platform, the most glorious being I have ever conceived of, 
			and was taken forward to be introduced to Him.&nbsp; As I approached He 
			smiled, called my name, and stretched out His hands toward me.&nbsp; If I 
			live to be a mission years old I shall never forget that smile.&nbsp; He 
			put His arms around me and kissed me, as He took me into His bosom, 
			and he blessed me until my whole being was thrilled.&nbsp; As he finished 
			I fell at His feet, and there saw the marks of the nails; and as 
			kissed them, with deep joy swelling through my whole being, I felt 
			that I was in heaven indeed.&nbsp; The feeling that came to my heart then 
			was:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; if I could live worthy, so that in the end when I have 
			finished I could go into His presence and receive the feeling that I 
			had then in His presence, I would give everything that I am or ever 
			hope to be! </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Oh dear young friends, be 
		virtuous, live worthy to stand with confidence before the Lord who loves 
		you so very much. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Those who truly understand 
		the plan of our Heavenly Father for His children are the ones who can 
		enjoy the greatest happiness this life has to offer.&nbsp; So my last point 
		today is: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Happiness is understanding 
		Gods plan for you.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me ask with the poet Ora 
		Pate Stewart, Do you know who you are little child of mine so precious

		vast as Eternity?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We have a little four year 
		old granddaughter named Grace who was born with her twin sister Emma at 
		27 weeks into the pregnancy.&nbsp; She didnt weigh very much but that wasnt 
		her main problem.&nbsp; She didnt have a discernable heartbeat for the first 
		25 minutes after her birth.&nbsp; There was no sign of life.&nbsp; But the Dr. 
		didnt give up and he finally got her heart beating.&nbsp; Then the long road 
		to coming alive was ahead.&nbsp; There were brain bleeds, lung problems, 
		heart problems, liver problems and she was attached to every tube and 
		monitor you can imagine.&nbsp; It was uphill all the way for little Grace.&nbsp; 
		Her twin sister Emma had an easier time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was a week before Grace 
		could even be held, but finally the day came when the intensive care 
		nurse placed tiny Grace in her Daddys arms for the first time. As he 
		cuddled the tiny infant close to him, &nbsp;he looked down tenderly in her 
		face and began to softly sing &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a child of God and He has sent me 
		here.&nbsp; Has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear&nbsp; The 
		soft melody lingered on the air as he looked into the face of tiny 
		Grace.&nbsp; He saw her eyelids faintly flutter and then, for the first time 
		in her life, she opened her eyes!&nbsp; And she looked up at her daddy.&nbsp; It 
		was as if the words he sang stirred a sweet memory of the truths she had 
		been taught in heaven before her birth. Yes, she <i>was</i> a child of 
		God and He <i>had</i> sent her here! </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From that moment on she 
		fought to live and her story is one filled with miracles and faith.&nbsp; Her 
		name is Grace but we like to call her Amazing Grace.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Indeed, we truly <i>are</i>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This life isnt the first 
		time we were taught our Heavenly Fathers plan.&nbsp; We learned of it, even 
		chose it, in our pre mortal existence.&nbsp; Listen to this from the D and C: 
		&nbsp;Even before they were born, they with may others received their first 
		lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the 
		due time of the Lord. [D and C 138:56] &nbsp;&nbsp;President Gordon B. Hinckley 
		echoed that when he said: Never forget that you were chosen and brought

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And so we came to earth to 
		prove ourselves by meeting the experiences this life has to offer, the 
		trials, the temptations, even the sorrows.&nbsp; And we have a Savior who 
		loves us so much that He promised to come before us to the earth to have 
		the same experiences and to show us the way to liv<u>e were while here 
		to set the example. </u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He made it possible to return 
		again to live with our Father in Heaven one day through his priceless 
		and holy gift of the <u>atonement</u> whereby we could be resurrected to 
		immortality and enjoy the blessings of eternal life if we but repent and 
		let him forgive us.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When he left his mortal 
		ministry on earth he didnt leave us alone, he left us with a 
		comforter.&nbsp; He said And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you 
		another comforter, that he may abide with you forever;... [John 
		14:16-18] &nbsp;You have been baptized and confirmed and thereby blessed with 
		the gift of the Holy Ghost to be your constant companion as you worthily 
		seek that companionship.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior not only provided 
		the example, and the atonement but a promise that he would also carry 
		our sorrows and burdens when they seemed too heavy to carry alone.&nbsp; Alma 
		records And He shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and 
		temptations of every kind; <i>he will take upon him</i> <i>the pains 
		and the sickness of his people</i>. [Alma 7:11]&nbsp; What a loving generous 
		plan.&nbsp; And it is Gods gift to you.&nbsp; All the contingencies have been 
		covered by our Creator and our Savior.&nbsp; I stand all amazed at the love 
		Jesus offers me -- and you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We are most blessed to have 
		this understanding.&nbsp; And That, my friends,&nbsp; &nbsp;That is What Happiness Is!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">May the knowledge of how 
		blessed you are bring you great happiness and encouragement.&nbsp; May you be 
		happy because you excel in your studies.&nbsp; May you find great joy in your 
		social interactions.&nbsp; May your determination to live virtuously bring 
		its own sweet rewards into your life.&nbsp; And may you come to really 
		understand and embrace our Heavenly Fathers&nbsp; plan for you for it is 
		truly The Great Plan of Happiness.&nbsp; Of this I testify in the name of 
		Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>A Season of Decisions</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Youve heard Elder Bednar 
		speak of inspired questions.&nbsp; Ive entitled my remarks today what I 
		believe is an inspired question given by the prophet Nephi to his 
		brothers when he asked them, have ye inquired of the Lord? As I look 
		into this audience today, and recognize the station of life you are in, 
		theres no doubt that many of you are in a season of decisions in your 
		life.&nbsp; The decade you pass through from the time you graduate from high 
		school until you find yourselves well into family life, contains a 
		number of decisions that are life-changing and will have an eternal 
		impact upon you. Some of you are probably trying to figure out what to 
		major in and what your education will prepare you for in terms of a 
		vocation.&nbsp; Others are trying to decide when to submit papers for a 
		fulltime mission.&nbsp; Some of you, given that tomorrow is Valentines Day, 
		may be considering, hmmI wonder if he or she is really the right one? 
		Others who have already found the right one may be making the decision 
		about starting their families, or similar kinds of decisions that will 
		have a long-lasting effect on where you will end up in this life. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In pondering what to speak to 
		you about today, I thought it might be profitable to share a few 
		personal experiences that illustrate how interested the Lord is in each 
		one of us and what we do with our lives. I bear you my witness that our 
		loving Heavenly Father is literally our Father in Heaven. He knows us, 
		he knows us by name, he loves us, hes concerned about us, and he has 
		given us the gift of His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, who has taken 
		upon Him our sins and shortcomings, and who is eager to help us in times 
		of trials and uncertainty. He is anxious to give us answers to our 
		prayers, and hes anxious to help us in this decision-making period of 
		our lives that I refer to as a season of decisions. The Savior said, 
		Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you 
		rest. (Matt.11:28)&nbsp; What an invitation from a loving Savior, our elder 
		brother. He also said, Wherefore be of good cheer, and do not fear, for 
		I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you. (D&amp;C 68:6) If there ever 
		was a time in life that you need guidance from the Lord, it is now, in 
		this season of decisions in your life. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Have Ye Inquired of the 
		Lord?</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You will recall that when 
		Lehi had the wonderful dream of the Tree of Life, and he came back and 
		shared that experience with his children. &nbsp;Nephi had a burning desire to 
		have a similar experience in terms of understanding what is was that his 
		father saw.&nbsp; So in the spirit of faith and humility, Nephi inquired of 
		the Lord and received a remarkable interpretation of Lehis dream.&nbsp; The 
		Lord said: And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the 
		Son of the most high God; wherefore thou shalt behold the things which 
		thou has desired. (1 Nephi 11:6)&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Later, when Nephi was 
		explaining what he had experienced to his brothers Laman and Lemuel, 
		they replied, Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father 
		hath spoken.&nbsp; To this faithless and rather weak response, Nephi asked 
		an inspired question: Have ye inquired of the Lord? (1 Nephi 15:7-8)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you go through this season 
		of decisions in your life, I echo Nephis gentle reminder: Have ye 
		inquired of the Lord? &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Our Prayers Are Often 
		Answered through Others</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Id like to share a few 
		examples today of how the Lord answers your prayers and inquires. 
		Oftentimes, the Lord answers our prayers through other people. And he 
		does so in many different ways. &nbsp;He often uses others to accomplish his 
		will, or to answer our fervent prayers.&nbsp; I learned this very clearly as 
		a young sailor serving in the United States Navy.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During the Vietnam War, I was 
		sent overseas to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, a nuclear aircraft 
		carrier operating in the Tonkin Gulf, off the shores of North Vietnam.&nbsp; 
		I was flown over to the Philippines to catch the ship that was, at that 
		time, tied up at Layette Pier in Subic Bay in the Philippines where it 
		was undergoing supply replenishment.&nbsp; I boarded the ship on Saturday 
		afternoon, stowed my gear, and then reported to the officer on deck to 
		see what I was to do. Given that it was Saturday afternoon, he just 
		looked at me and said well, why dont you go ashore, spend the weekend, 
		and report for duty on Monday. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Early the next morning, since 
		it was Sunday, I set out to see if I could find the Church. I wanted to 
		attend my Sunday meetings.&nbsp; I walked off the ship not having an idea 
		where I should go, but knowing that I needed to find a connection with 
		the Church. And so, not knowing particularly what to do, I crawled up on 
		a pier post and thought I would sit and observe and see if I could see 
		something that might help me. I offered another silent prayer to the 
		Lord. As an Idaho farm boy who found himself halfway around the world, I 
		needed a spiritual lifeline, and I knew the best one was prayer. I 
		prayed that I could somehow find a connection with the Church. I thought 
		of my faithful parents, who I knew would be praying in my behalf. That 
		thought gave me comfort, and a peace settled over me and I knew that 
		things would be alright. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I had not been on the pier 
		post very long, when all at once I saw a couple of sailors walking down 
		the pier carrying a long plastic sack with two rows of little plastic 
		cups in it.&nbsp; You can imagine my excitement!&nbsp; And I had this thought, I 
		wonder if other religions use sacrament cups like that.&nbsp; The thought 
		quickly came into my mind to follow those men and listen to their 
		conversation.&nbsp; If they did not use profanity (which many sailors were 
		prone to use), then there was a good chance they would be members of the 
		Church. Immediately I jumped down off that post and quickly caught up 
		with the two men, and listened to what they were saying. When I was 
		satisfied they could be Church members, I approached them with this 
		greeting, at the same time extending my hand to shake theirs: Brethren, 
		where are you going with those sacrament cups? &nbsp;You should have seen 
		the look on their faces! They lit up with excitement to discover another 
		member of the Church.&nbsp; Greetings were exchanged, an invitation was 
		extended, and off to Sunday meetings we went. I have often reflected on 
		that experience. It was a miracle to me and an immediate answer to 
		prayer.&nbsp; As I inquired of the Lord, He sent two faithful elders to help 
		me that Sunday morning far away in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Answers Come Through 
		Inspired Bishops</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord also answers our 
		prayers through inspired bishops. Upon my discharge from the Navy, I 
		attended Brigham Young University-Provo.&nbsp; By now I was approaching my 
		twenty-third year and was just beginning college. &nbsp;You can imagine what 
		happens to men who are 23 plus. Theres just a little bit of pressure to 
		find someone and get married. Can you imagine that? I hope you young men 
		are listening out theretomorrow is Valentines Day you know. &nbsp;Being 
		aware of my responsibility to get married, I had another deep-down 
		desire in my heart to serve a full-time mission.&nbsp; The pressure to get 
		married increased as time went on and I secretly began to wonder if I 
		would ever have the privilege of serving a mission.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The school year finally came 
		to a conclusion and I returned to Idaho to farm with my Dad one last 
		summer before attending graduate school year-round.&nbsp; I had the wonderful 
		experience of attending my home ward.&nbsp; As I walked into the ward Bishop 
		Archibald, a wonderful bishop whom I hadnt seen in a long time, invited 
		me in for an appointment.&nbsp; We visited about my experiences in the Navy 
		and at BYU, and eventually the conversation came around to the subject 
		of a mission and he asked me this question: Have you ever thought about 
		serving a mission? I was so grateful for an inspired bishop. I said to 
		him Bishop, I have thought about serving a mission. And Ive also had a 
		lot of counsel from priesthood leaders to get married. By now Im twenty 
		three plus years old, and Ive thought about both. What do you think I 
		should do? And he, knowing of the importance of both those things, 
		thought for a minute.&nbsp; He leaned back in his chair, and as inspired 
		bishops do, he offered this counsel, Why dont we read your patriarchal 
		blessing and see what it says? The following Sunday was fast Sunday, 
		and he said Ill tell you what. Ill drive out to the farm. Why dont 
		you and I fast and pray and well decide after we read your blessing. 
		So the following Sunday came and he drove out to the farm. He and I sat 
		down in the living room and read that wonderful patriarchal blessing. As 
		we concluded reading the blessing, he simply looked at me and said, The 
		Lord wants you to serve a mission. Each of us felt the spirit of that 
		patriarchal blessing and knew what should happen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As soon as the harvest was 
		over and the plowing was finished that fall, I found myself in the Salt 
		Lake Mission Home with a call to serve in the Michigan Lansing Mission. 
		I was thrilled to be able to serve a mission. I think back on that 
		experience and have to tell you that, to this day, I have wonderful 
		feelings of gratitude for Bishop Archibald and his humility and his 
		faith. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Later, I had a powerful 
		reaffirmation of that inspired decision.&nbsp; While serving in the mission 
		field, in April 1974, in a general conference broadcast in a stake 
		center in Michigan, I heard President Spencer W. Kimball make this 
		historic declaration: Certainly every male member of the Church should 
		fill a mission.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you imagine, sitting there, hearing that from a 
		prophet of God? What a reaffirmation of the inspired direction of a good 
		bishop. And, I might add, of a wonderful patriarch who knew what the 
		Lord had in mind for me. So I bear my witness that the Lord answers 
		prayers through inspired bishops. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guidance Comes through 
		Inspired Patriarchs</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me tell you a little bit 
		more about what comes through inspired patriarchs. One of the most 
		powerful ways the Lord conveys his will to you and to me is through a 
		patriarchal blessing.&nbsp; The Lord crafts those blessings personally for 
		each one of us. Ill tell you something a little bit humorous about my 
		patriarchal blessing in that respect, given that tomorrow is Valentines 
		Day. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I took a date one time to 
		general conference in Salt Lake while I was attending BYU. In between 
		conference sessions, we ran into our stake patriarch, Brother Delbert V. 
		Groberg from Idaho Falls. &nbsp;(Incidentally, the V in his middle name 
		stands for Valentine). &nbsp;Well, I introduced my date to him and we chatted 
		for a few minutes and then went on to conference and thats the last I 
		thought of it.&nbsp; A few weeks passed and I was talking to my dad, and he 
		said I understand that you ran into Brother Groberg down at 
		conference. I said Yeah, I did. How do you know that? And he said, 
		well, I just happened to bump into him (They were in the same ward). 
		And they got to talking and I said Well, what did he say Dad?&nbsp; And my 
		dad just simply said, Shes not the one! You can imagine how I felt 
		when Dad related that experience to me!&nbsp; I recalled the portion of my 
		patriarchal blessing that spoke of marriage and family, and I began to 
		wonder if Brother Groberg had seen a vision of my future wife!&nbsp; I really 
		didnt know what he saw or felt, but I was impressed that he cared 
		enough about me to offer guidance, and I respected him enough to follow 
		it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Receiving Counsel from the 
		Lords Anointed</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another way we receive 
		direction from the Lord as we inquire of him is through the Lords 
		anointed. The Lords anointed are represented by many positions. For 
		you, the Lords anointed sits here as the president of this wonderful 
		institution. We also have the Lords anointed here in Elder Hammond and 
		these wonderful stake presidents. And you have good bishops, and you 
		have elders quorum presidents, and you have Relief Society leaders. The 
		Lords anointed Im going to speak of are the prophets and apostles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On Valentines Day, February 
		14, 1978, I was finishing up my senior year at BYU (still unmarried) and 
		was sitting in a devotional.&nbsp; President Gordon B. Hinckley (then 
		Elder Hinckley) was the devotional speaker.&nbsp; I had been dating a girl 
		and it was getting serious. I was beginning to become uncomfortable with 
		the relationship but could not pinpoint the reason. I struggled with my 
		feelings and continued to pray for guidance. (Ill have to admit that I 
		thought about taking her to Idaho Falls and introducing her to Brother 
		Groberg to quickly resolve the uncertainty!)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During that Valentines Day 
		devotional, Elder Hinckley told of his boyhood friend who met a girl and 
		fell in love with her.&nbsp; President Hinckley described him this way:&nbsp; He 
		was a boy from a country town, plain in appearance, without money or 
		apparent promise.&nbsp; He had grown up on a farm, and if he had any quality 
		that was attractive it was the capacity to work.&nbsp; At that moment 
		something powerful happened to me.&nbsp; As I listened to President Hinckley, 
		I was impressed that my future wife was not at BYU Provo, but instead 
		she was in Idaho. And in my minds eye, I could see that she would be of 
		a similar spiritual and cultural background and have farm roots like 
		me.&nbsp; As I had those thoughts, and they came quickly, a spirit of peace 
		began to settle over me and I walked out of that devotional knowing 
		eventually all would be well.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A couple of months later I 
		finished school and returned home for one more farming season before 
		going on to graduate school.&nbsp; I was busily engaged in farming when 
		unbeknownst to be, a beautiful blonde returned from serving in the 
		London South Mission. And I received a phone call from my good 
		sister-in-law Janice. And she said Guess who I saw today? Debbie Cox! 
		and I asked how she was doing and she said Well, she just returned from 
		her mission, and she is wonderful. And by the way, you have a date with 
		her tonight at 8:00. You know, some young men need a little more help 
		than others. I knew how to work but I was a little slow on the uptake on 
		some things, but I was really excited about this!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She had graduated from the 
		same high school as I (albeit 5 years behind me), graduated from Ricks 
		College, gone to Provo and worked for a season, and subsequently served 
		an honorable mission.&nbsp; It was a wonderful thing. We went on our first 
		date, and what a great thing it was to have someone who had a strong 
		testimony of the gospel, who was so articulate and free in expressing 
		her feelings about the Lord and spiritual things, who had grown up on a 
		farm just three miles from me, had everything in common, and I began to 
		be excited for the future. We began to date, and little by little the 
		excitement and hope for the future grew.&nbsp; Our courtship was enjoyable 
		and meshed into our everyday lives quite naturally.&nbsp; Changing irrigation 
		pipes or whatever is was!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Probably the clincher was one 
		day I was combining grain, and it was after evening dinner and we were 
		out in the field trying to get as much done as we could before the dew 
		set on. And as the sun was starting to go down, I saw these two little 
		headlights bouncing across the bottom of the field, and I wondered who 
		that might be. And dad was in the truck at the other end of the field, 
		and I knew it wasnt the truck, so as I approached the bottom of the 
		field, I saw this little Datsun B-210 car. And youre probably too young 
		to know what a B-210 Datsun is, but some of you older people might 
		remember those little orange Datsuns. And low and behold, as I got to 
		the end of the field, out pops this pretty little blonde with a homemade 
		milkshake. She came up sat in the cab with me in the combine and we went 
		a few rounds as I drank that milkshake. Later, I said to my dad, Man, 
		that was great for Debbie to bring me that milkshake. And Dad said, 
		Any girl that will drive out into the grain field to bring somebody a 
		milkshake, is worth paying attention to. So girls, if you need a 
		formula</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a fairly short time I came 
		to know that she was the one I had been searching for. And what a 
		blessing its been to have an eternal companion so faithful and so 
		marvelous, and so uniquely suited for me. She is absolutely the best 
		thing thats ever happened to me. And as you look at our children, all 
		the good that they represent I attribute to Debbie and her influence.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we got to the point where 
		our dating was serious, all those feelings of concern and worry that I 
		had in that earlier experience werent there. These feelings were 
		different. They were happy, and they were optimistic, and they were full 
		of hope. I had the wonderful privilege of proposing to her in front of 
		the Idaho Falls temple, and later taking her to the Idaho Falls temple 
		where we were married by none other than Brother Groberg who by then had 
		been called as the temple president.&nbsp; Can you imagine how I felt to take 
		her up and let her be interviewed by President Groberg?&nbsp; She passed with 
		flying colors, by the way! It was nice to have him look me in the eye, 
		and with that beautiful, humble, sweet spirit that he had just smile and 
		say this is wonderful. And I just moved forward with confidence knowing 
		that I loved her, the Lord loved her, and President Groberg would love 
		her!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why do I share this story?&nbsp; 
		Because we have such a privilege of having the Lords anointed speak to 
		us. We have prophets and apostles who walk the earth and who are able to 
		reach us with their messages of truth and inspiration.&nbsp; Elder Hinckleys 
		inspired instruction during that BYU devotional had a profound effect on 
		my life in every single way that I can think of thats meaningful. The 
		Lords anointed speak the mind and the will of the Lord.&nbsp; The Lord has 
		said: What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not 
		myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall 
		not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or 
		the voice of my servants it is the same. (D&amp;C 1:38)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>We Must Be Worthy to 
		Receive Revelation</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, if we want to receive 
		revelation we need to be worthy of it. If we want to receive inspiration 
		from the Lord we must exercise faith in Jesus Christ and strive for 
		personal purity in our lives.&nbsp; Laman and Lemuel could not receive the 
		same vision as Nephi because their hearts were hardened.&nbsp; They had 
		received visitations from angels, but still were hardened in their 
		hearts.&nbsp; Nephi counseled them: Do ye not remember the things which the 
		Lord hath said?if ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, 
		believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping the 
		commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you. (1 
		Nephi 15:11)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How do you know if you 
		measure up to the standards of personal worthiness?&nbsp; I hope you are 
		paying your tithes and offerings, living the Word of Wisdom, and keeping 
		yourself morally clean.&nbsp; One of the greatest ways of measuring ourselves 
		is by the standards of admission into the temples of the Lord.&nbsp; These 
		standards are clear.&nbsp; With the keeping of the covenants associated with 
		the temple, we qualify to receive guidance and personal revelation from 
		the Lord.&nbsp; And for those who have been endowed and are able to attend 
		the temple, the Lord has promised: I will manifest myself to my people 
		in mercy in this house. (D&amp;C 110:7) And as this beautiful temple on the 
		hill is completed in the forthcoming months, I hope each of you will 
		prepare to enter it. Whether you go for baptisms for the dead, for 
		endowments, or hopefully for marriage for time and eternity it will be a 
		wonderful blessing in your life.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>We Receive Truth by 
		Studying and Pondering the Scriptures</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">We can 
		also receive revelation from the Lord as we inquire through studying and 
		pondering the scriptures. I hope you are studying your scriptures every 
		day and inquiring of the Lord so you might understand the words He has 
		for you in them. The Lord has promised that if you study, ponder and 
		pray, you will receive guidance.&nbsp; Moroni counseled us to <i>ponder</i> 
		over what we read. (Moroni 10:3) &nbsp;He said if we do, we will have the 
		gift of the Holy Ghost to bless us. If each of us will make an effort to 
		study the scriptures every day, and build that practice in our lives, we 
		will be building spiritual strength and purity. We will be more 
		receptive to truth and it will carry over into secular studies here at 
		the University.&nbsp; The Spirit bears witness of truth.&nbsp; The Lord has 
		promised: And by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of 
		all things. (Moroni 10:5)&nbsp; And I think all things has to do with 
		all things past, present, and the future; secular or spiritual. If 
		youll get the Spirit, whether truth comes from the scriptures, Church 
		leaders, or your college classes, the Holy Ghost will help you recognize 
		and understand it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
		President Hinckley has counseled us to establish a time for study and 
		prayer each day. I heard him tell of a man in the Orient in a busy city 
		who used to go each morning into a little park adjacent to his home.&nbsp; He 
		would walk down to and along a little stream until he reached a foot 
		bridge.&nbsp; There he would find a secluded spot under the bridge, read his 
		scriptures, and have his private prayer.&nbsp; If viewed by others while he 
		was praying, it merely looked as though he was casting his eyes into the 
		stream in a spirit of contemplation.&nbsp; There in the quiet peace of those 
		surroundings, he came close to God.&nbsp; We would each do well to find our 
		own place of meditation and prayer where we can listen for inspiration 
		and receive spiritual guidance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A great example of pondering 
		upon the scriptures comes from President Joseph F. Smith.&nbsp; He received a 
		powerful revelation concerning the redemption of the dead.&nbsp; He said: On 
		the third of October in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in 
		my room pondering over the scriptures; As I pondered over these things 
		which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the 
		Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both 
		small&nbsp; and great. (D&amp;C 138:1, 2, and 11) The Lord then proceeded to 
		show the Prophet Joseph F. Smith how gloriously the redemptive work was 
		rolling forward on the other side of the veil. And what a great blessing 
		it was for those spirits who had departed from this earth.&nbsp; President 
		Smith received this vision during October general conference and the 
		following day, October 4<sup>th</sup>, he shared his vision in his 
		opening remarks of conference.&nbsp; This enlightening doctrine is now 
		available to us in section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me share a more recent 
		example of the value of pondering.&nbsp; President Hinckley was in the 
		Mexican colonies visiting the Saints. While riding back from those 
		colonies, he was pondering how far away the temples were from the 
		people.&nbsp; He thought how wonderful it would be for the Saints if we could 
		take the temples to them, rather than having them traveling so far to 
		get to a temple.&nbsp; Into his mind came the idea of a small temple design 
		that was less costly and simpler than traditional temples.&nbsp; President 
		Hinckley took out a small piece of paper, and sketched out what he saw 
		in his minds eye; what we now refer to as the small temple design.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He returned home to Salt Lake 
		City and subsequently challenged the Presiding Bishopric to set about 
		aggressively building more temples following this small design.&nbsp; In one 
		meeting he quipped: I would like to see 100 temples operating before I 
		die.&nbsp; Well, that meant the Presiding Bishopric had to build a lot of 
		temples, because we only had about half that many at the time. The 
		Presiding Bishopric responded by vigorously ramping up the work and, in 
		a relatively few short years, they hired more professionals, divided the 
		department, went vigorously to work building these temples.&nbsp; They met 
		and actually exceeded the prophets challenge.&nbsp; President Hinckleys 
		goal of 100 operating temples before the year 2000 was surpassed.&nbsp; 
		Today, the work continues under the direction of an inspired 
		temple-building prophet of the Lord.&nbsp; We now have 124 operating temples 
		in the world.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Have the Courage to Go to

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me just share one other 
		story and well conclude. Sometimes you need to go to the edge of the 
		light. The Lord will test your faith. The Lord gives us knowledge and 
		inspiration line upon line. We must <i>hearken</i>, or <u>act upon </u>
		what He says to demonstrate our faith.&nbsp; He said, I will give unto the 
		children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and 
		there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and 
		lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom: for unto him

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the marvelous things 
		about President Hinckley and the General Authorities Im acquainted with 
		is their great courage to step forward into unchartered paths. &nbsp;Theyre 
		courageous leaders because they know how to move forward in faith. They 
		can see to a point, and then they must move forward. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President David O. McKay told 
		a story about a train engineer. He said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The engineer pulled his 
			train into a station one dark night.&nbsp; A timid passenger inquired of 
			the engineer if he was frightened to pull his train out in the dark 
			with 400 or 500 passengers lives at stake. The engineer said, 
			pointing up to the bright headlight, I want to tell you one thing: 
			when I pull out of this station I wont be running in darkness one 
			foot of the way. You see that light a thousand yards ahead? I run my 
			engine just to the edge of the light, and when I get there it will 
			still be on a thousand yards ahead. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Having said that, 
			President McKay added: I want to tell you something. Through all 
			this dark night of uncertainty, I want to tell you that this Welfare 
			Program will not be running in the dark one foot of the way. You 
			remember it. We can only see the next October as the first circle of 
			light. We have told you what to do six months from now. By the time 
			we get there the light will be on ahead of us, but every step of the 
			way that light will be there.&nbsp; . . .  (Preparation for Tomorrow, 
			Bishop Victor L. Brown, <i>Ensign </i>November 1982) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My brothers and sisters, each 
		of us needs to demonstrate to the Lord that were willing to move to the 
		edge of the light. We need to exercise our faith and our courage to 
		listen to what the Lord says and move forward. Again, I ask you this 
		inspired question, have ye inquired of the Lord? In all of your 
		comings and goings in this season of your life, I pray that you will 
		remind yourself frequently to inquire of the Lord that he might bless 
		you in every way: in your studies, in your social life, in you Church 
		calling, in your personal growth and development, and in the deepening 
		of your spiritual roots that you might have a great love and commitment 
		to follow the Savior, to listen to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My counsel to you would be to 
		keep your eye on the Lords anointed, read your patriarchal blessing, 
		have your personal prayer, study your scriptures, and associate 
		yourselves with wonderful people who will build you and strengthen you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I pray the Lord to bless you. 
		I bear you my witness this is the Lords church. It is absolutely His 
		church. He leads it through living prophets and apostles. They are the 
		Lords anointed. The Book of Mormon is true. In it, you will receive a 
		second witness of the Savior in addition to that which is written in the 
		Bible. The prophet Joseph is a true prophet, and the fruits of the 
		restoration of the gospel are all around us today, including the 
		beautiful house upon the hill, the Lords house. I pray the Lord to 
		bless each of you. It is wonderful to be with you. And I pray that you

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am thankful for the support 
		of all those who are in attendance today. I pray that the Holy Spirit 
		may attend us; that we may partake of his gifts. I pray that this 
		devotional may allow us some time out of our busy day to be still and to 
		know the Lord is our God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Jeffrey R. Holland 
		of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke at a graduation convocation 
		that I was ushering at this past December. A comment he made has stuck 
		with me. He said that when people bear testimony that he is most 
		impressed when they can say, I know the Lord loves. Not lives but 
		loves. I pondered, Why would this impress an apostle of the Lord?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I thought of the scripture, 
		They draw near to me with their lips but their hearts are far from me 
		(Joseph Smith  History 1:19) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With my lips I can say God 
		loves. That is easy, of course He does. However, what is the condition 
		of my heart? With my heart can I feel Gods love? Do I know His love is 
		there for me, personally?<br />
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We were blessed to hear from 
		an apostle of the Lord at devotional last week. Through our weekly 
		devotionals we have the privilege of hearing from many righteous men and 
		women who are working to do good in the world. You can imagine the 
		thoughts that raced through my mind when <i>I</i> was asked to speak. My 
		life is far from perfect and I was hoping to comb through it and find 
		that one principle, that one tiny part of the gospel, that I am living 
		well and to share those lessons with you. That way I could stand before 
		you with authority and experience. Instead, with a broken heart and a 
		contrite spirit, I was lead to speak about a subject somewhat lacking in 
		my life, a gift I havent fully embraced yet. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sister Bonnie Parkin, the 
		Relief Society General President, in her inaugural address said, If I 
		could have one thing happen for every woman in this Church, it would be 
		that they would feel the love of the Lord in their lives daily. For 
		todays conversation I would extend this to the men in the church as 
		well. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why does Sister Parkin wish 
		this for us? What would it bring to our lives if we did feel the Lords 
		love daily? As we explore the topic of Gods love today I would ask that 
		you keep this question in your mind: <i>Am I feeling the love of 
		Godthat He loves me, personally?</i> Again, <i>Am I feeling the love of 
		Godthat He loves me, personally?</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Love is a big word. Love is a 
		common word. It is so big and so common that sometimes it can almost 
		mean nothing in everyday conversation. For todays conversation though 
		when I say love I am specifically speaking about our Saviors love and 
		that is a love which means everything. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By the end of devotional 
		today we will have discussed:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What Gods love is</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why we want it in our 
			lives</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The blessings that come 
			from His love</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How to receive Gods love</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some immediate 
			applications </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And what our life will 
			include when we receive this great gift </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But first, before we begin, 
		we need to check the condition of our hearts. My dear mother-in-law is 
		undergoing heart tests today in Billings, MT. She is preparing for heart 
		surgery later this week. My thoughts and prayers are with her. But this 
		is a check-up we dont need a medical test or surgery for. Instead, we 
		can place our hand on our heart and make our own diagnosis. Sister 
		Virginia A. Pearce in her book, <i>A Heart Like His</i>, helps us to 
		place our heart in one of two categories:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Okay, ready? Place your hand 
		over your heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, Do you feel your heart 
		close to the surface of your chest wall? Does it feel warm, soft, open, 
		and enlarged?&nbsp; If so, you can diagnose yourself with having the 
		condition of an open heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now check again. Does your 
		heart feel like it is tucked away, deep inside a protective wall? Does 
		it feel cold, hard, and possibly a bit small? If so, you can diagnose 
		yourself with having the condition of a closed heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We probably all ebb and flow 
		between these two conditions. You may have guessed that for our 
		conversation to have real meaning for us today that we all need open 
		hearts. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So regardless if we diagnosed 
		ourselves with an open heart or a closed heart. Lets all work to open 
		them a bit more during this time we are together. Lets all visualize 
		our heart coming closer to the surface of our chests. Lets picture, it 
		warm and soft, receptive and open. Lets offer a silent prayer, and pray 
		with all the energy of our heart, as instructed in Moroni, that we may 
		be filled with His love. Also, lets take courage in the Lords words 
		found in Ezekial:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why do we want this type of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; Because it is a

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font color="#000080">Faith in the Lord Jesus

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">We read in Deuteronomy

		Think about what we do, how we behave when we know someone loves us. We 
		rise up. We act better, do better, and feel better in their presence. I 
		like being around people who like me. I like who I am when I am with 
		them. On the otherhand, I dont like being around people who dont like 
		me. It is a drain. I feel depressed. I withdraw. One of the reasons I 
		havent been able to fully accept Gods love in my life is because 
		somehow I believe a lie. A twist on Gods law. The lie is, Of course 
		God loves. But how could he love you. When I listen to this line of 
		thinking I believe Im not worthy. My heart becomes hidden, cold, small. 
		I withdraw. That is why Satans lie is so powerful. When we withdraw we 
		cannot participate and love is a participation doctrine.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley has said

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font color="#000080">In contrast to the 
			institutions of the world, which teach us to know something, the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; Because we cannot

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">D&amp;C 12:8 we read that - No 
		one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is our participation

		to be open to His love? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And in Ether 12:34 - Except

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Dr. Stephen R. Covey

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, we are taught in

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Third, sanctification. 
		Ultimately, sanctification is received . . .through the grace of our

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">How do we claim these

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Gods love for us is 
		unconditional. His love for us is constant. It is the same yesterday, 
		today, and forever. However, our ability to feel His love is conditional 
		on us. It is our ability to do what is necessary to feel His love that 
		can be inconsistent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Jesus, King Benjamin,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">First from the Savior,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The Saviors life was

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Third Alma and Moroni

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Alma 13:28 Pray 
		continually that ye may . . .[be] full of love</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Moroni 7:48 Pray with 
		all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Moroni also explained 
		that the comforter filleth with . . .perfect love, which love endureth 
		by diligence unto prayer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">To often my prayers 
		are full of the immediate physical and temporal needs of the day. I seek 
		answers and guidance to tasks at hand. What I have learned from studying 
		Gods love is that I need to expand my vision. My thoughts are summed up 
		well by Oswald Chambers, a prominent Christian minister in the 20<sup>th</sup> 
		Century:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #000080">Prayers change us 
		and then we can change things.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Of course it is good 
		and right to pray to the Lord in all things and now I know that all 
		things should include the condition of my heart and feeling His love 
		daily.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And fourth Alma 
		mentioned yet another requirement to qualify for this precious character 
		trait; we must be virtuous:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">We are taught in Alma-<i> 
		Bridle all your passions that ye may be filled with love. (</i> Alma 
		38:12)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">There is a great quote 
		from the play Camelot where King Arthur says to Guinevere, We must not 
		let our passions destroy our dreams. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Last spring I dreamt 
		of running the Teton Dam half-marathon. I dreamed of achieving this goal 
		and thought it would be a nice gift to give my 30-year-old self. 
		Unfortunately, I am passionate about sleeping-in and really good meals 
		with really big messy desserts. If I would have given in to these 
		passions my early morning runs would not have happened and by body would 
		have been sluggish. Instead, I bridled my passions and kept my eye on my 
		dream and completed the half-marathon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Our Father offers us 
		unimaginable gifts, sanctification, and eternal life. These things are 
		obviously much bigger then my little run. But using that example, what 
		passions in our own lives would prevent us from the dream gifts that our 
		Father has in store?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Even doing all of 
		these things love is not something we can work on, checking off each 
		qualification on our checklist and then we get it because we earned it; 
		it is a gift. And like Moroni explained it is a gift given by the Holy 
		Ghost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">So how can we use this 
		knowledge of the Saviors love immediately in our lives today?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Lets take a look fear 
		and suffering, making major life decisions, and recognizing His love in 
		our lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Do we live our lives 
		in fear? Do we make decisions based on our fears? Some examples of this 
		may be: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">I really love art but 
		am afraid that Ill never make any money. I should probably do something 
		else. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Im prompted to share 
		my testimony but Im afraid I will be judged. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Id love a temple 
		marriage but my parents divorced. Im afraid marriage wont work out for 
		me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Think of your own 
		examples. When we fear we withdraw. Love is participation doctrine. What 
		love are we cutting out of our lives due to our fears?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">In 1 John 4:18 we read
		<i>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear</i>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">I always feel 
		encouraged when I hear our prophet speak. Here are his thoughts on this 
		topic:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">He begins by quoting 
		Paul in Timothy<i>: God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of 
		power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou ashamed of the 
		testimony of our Lord (2 Timothy 1:7-8). </i>He continues: <i>I would 
		that every member of this Church would put those words where you might 
		see them every morning as you begin your day. They will give you courage 
		to speak up, they will give you the faith to try, they will strengthen 
		your conviction of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;There are many 
		entries in the scriptures where the Savior keeps telling us; do not 
		worry; do not be trouble; do not be afraid. We learn from these 
		scriptures that by trusting him, we are supported and delivered out of 
		all our troubles and fears. Alma gives the account of Helaman being 
		taught this lesson in his youth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">(As we read this next 
		scripture lets liken it unto ourselves and replace Helamans name with 
		our own.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">In Alma 36:3</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font color="#000080">And now, O my son/daughter

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">When we understand who 
		God is, who we are, how He loves us, and what His plan is for us, fear 
		evaporates.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Then what of pain and 
		suffering? How does Gods love aid us with these? Truman Madsen teaches 
		that love cannot obliterate pain. However, it can give it meaning and 
		redeeming power.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Let us think on the 
		Savior. Christs love for God and Gods love for his Son did not 
		obliterate the pain of the Gesemane, the crown of thorns, the scourages, 
		or the torments of the cross. But oh the meaning and redeeming power 
		that came!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Let us think on Joseph

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Lastly, let us think 
		on Victor Frankel who endured the horrors of a Natzi concentration camp. 
		He did not let his pain and suffering defeat him rather he found meaning 
		and redemption in it. He said:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>He knows the &quot;why&quot; for his

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">What way can feeling 
		the Saviors love help us with making major life decisions? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Sister Clark was my 
		teacher on this principle. She taught me the principle as I listened to 
		her talk at devotional in September.&nbsp; She said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>As you dig into this

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: navy">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She then gave us many

		day-to-day lives. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A large part of my day as an 
		advisor is devoted to working with students who are trying to decide 
		what major and career would be best. We have online classes, traditional 
		classes, assessment tests, and libraries full of information to help in 
		this decision process. I teach my students to really focus on who they 
		are; to discover what their interests, skills, abilities, dreams. Then, 
		we work on relating these findings to appropriate majors and careers. 
		When describing the career exploration class I have told my students, 
		It is a 1.0 class all about you. Then I heard Sister Clarks talk. 
		There was something I was missing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Part of the class covers 
		decision making. We look at an <i>Ensign</i> article by Brother James E. 
		Faust entitled Choices. Lets look at an excerpt from his talk now:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>How do we make correct 
		choices? A choice involves making a conscious decision. To make an 
		intelligent decision we need to evaluate all available facts on both 
		sides of an issue. But that isnt enough. Making correct decisions 
		involves prayer and inspiration. The 9<sup>th</sup> section of the 
		Doctrine and Covenants gives us the grand key. The Lord said to Oliver 
		Cowdery</i>:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Behold, you have not 
		understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you 
		took no thought save it was to ask me.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But, behold, I say unto you, 
		that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be 
		right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within 
		you; therefore you shall fee that it is right.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But if it be not right you 
		shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that 
		shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The missing part was to find 
		our life by losing it. To take the emphasis off I want and to put it 
		on Thy Will.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For example, what major would 
		allow us to carry out His work in the best way? In what career would we 
		have the greatest capacity for good in loving and serving Gods 
		children? It is another inspired question we can bring to a loving 
		father in heaven.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How can we learn to recognize 
		the love of the Lord in our lives? What about those of us who have 
		experienced flawed or imperfect love? How will we know what true love 
		really is? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again, from Sister Virginia 
		A. Pearce, in her book, <i>A Heart Like His</i>, describes this feeling 
		so well she says:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>When I experience His love 
		I feel:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Acknowledged, accepted</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Validated, noticed</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Cared for, supported</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Encouraged, uplifted</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Motivated, inspired</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Comforted, healed</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Nourished, nurtured</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Changed, more 
			confident, more able</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This description of true love 
		helps me in two ways. First, it gives me a model for my behavior. This 
		is the way I want people to feel when they leave my presence. This is 
		the way I want to approach my service to others. Second, it helps me to 
		know when I am in the presence of true love.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Lets go back to the question 
		we were asking ourselves at the beginning of this talk, <i>Am I feeling 
		the love of Godthat He loves me, personally?</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior gave us the 
		invitation to continue in His love. How will we know if we are? What 
		influences will his love have on our life? May I suggest 10 indicators 
		that the Lords love has touched our lives:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; We are praying 
			fervently everyday</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp; We are studying 
			and treasuring up scriptures</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; We are losing 
			ourselves in the service of others</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; We keep his 
			commandments</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; We are obedient</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">6.&nbsp; We are happy</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">7.&nbsp; We are constant 
			firm and steadfast</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">8.&nbsp; We can be 
			trusted</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">9.&nbsp; We do things for 
			the right reasons</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">10.&nbsp; We are becoming 
			more and more like the Father and like his beloved Son</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please do not let this list 
		overwhelm you. But let it be a mark that we are striving for. Accepting 
		the love of the Lord in our lives daily to me means that we are 
		accepting the great gift of the atonement. The atonement is not a gift 
		for the perfect. Rather a gift for all men to be perfected through 
		Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Earlier we heard the 
		beautiful melody to the hymn, <i>Our Saviors Love,</i> as played by 
		Marvin Goldstein. In closing lets visit the text of the hymn: </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our Saviors love</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Shines like the sun with 
			perfect light,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As from above</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It breaks thru clouds of 
			strife.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Lighting our way, It 
			leads us back into his sight,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Where we may stay </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To share eternal life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Spirit, voice</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of goodness, whispers to 
			our hearts</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A better choice</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Than evils anguished 
			cries.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Loud may the sound</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of hope ring till all 
			doubt departs,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And we are bound</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To him by loving ties.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our Father, God</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of all creation, hear us 
			pray</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In reverence, awed</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By thy Sons sacrifice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Praises we sing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We love they law; we will 
			obey</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our heavenly King,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In thee our hearts 
			rejoice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify that not only does 
		our Savior live but that He loves. His is a perfect love that is there 
		for us constantly. May we have the courage and wisdom to do what is 
		necessary to feel His love in our lives daily. May we continue in His 
		love I pray.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, it is a 
		sacred trust and tremendous honor to stand before you today.&nbsp; I remember 
		years ago, sitting where youre sitting, I remember thinking what youre 
		thinking, and I remember well, the dreams youre dreaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives me 
		great joy to share with you today an Eternal Perspective, one that I 
		hope will broaden your mind, enhance your vision, and deepen your

		we call life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me begin by telling you 
		how much I love BYUIdaho.&nbsp; It has been a part of our family and our 
		life for many years.&nbsp; My wife Sharol and I both attended here, as well 
		as all 4 of our daughters and 3 of our sons-in-law.&nbsp; Many things have 
		changed over the years.&nbsp; How blessed you are to be at this University 
		now. After our return from the California Arcadia Mission, I was called 
		to serve as a Bishop here on campus.&nbsp; That was 8 or 9 years ago.&nbsp; This 
		was still a Junior College known as Ricks College. In the four years I 
		served as Bishop and now as a Stake President of the 7<sup>th</sup> 
		Stake let me tell you what I have seen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord promised Abraham in 
		the Abrahamic covenant, that his children, the children of Israel, which 
		includes every one of us here today, either by our literal descendency 
		or by adoption, that they would, and I quote Be blessed above 
		measure.&nbsp; That phrase, Above Measure has fascinated me.&nbsp; I believe it 
		means that it is beyond or above our ability as humans or mortals, or by 
		earthly standards to measure, therefore, Above Measure.&nbsp; Isnt that 
		the same definition that we apply to a miracle? I believe thats what 
		the Lord meant to Abraham, and now to us, that he would bless us with 
		Miracles.&nbsp; I testify that we are watching a miracle take place here at 
		BYUIdaho.&nbsp; I am often asked about whats going on at BYUIdaho. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am anxious to tell people 
		the story. Elder Bednar described it as building a ship and turning it 
		on a new course.&nbsp; He referred to it as Rethinking Education.&nbsp; Now we 
		have a new Captain at the helm in President Clark.&nbsp; I always like to 
		add that President Clark has taken hold of the controls of this ship and 
		pushed them Full-speed ahead. Now we are moving at a speed that I 
		believe if you jumped overboard, you could probably water ski behind 
		this ship.&nbsp; I would like to take a personal privilege to pay tribute to 
		the Faculty, Staff and Administration of this University for the 
		transformation that has taken place.&nbsp; I commend each of you for your <u>
		faith</u> and your <u>faithfulness</u>. &nbsp;I thank you on behalf of each 
		of the young people in this audience, and on behalf of our children and 
		our grandchildren who will be eternally blessed because of you good 
		people who are the life-blood of this University.</font></p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was asked to speak, I 
		prayed and pondered wondering what I could say that would make a 
		difference to you today. I am well-aware of who sits before me in this 
		audience as the future Leaders of this Church and the world. And more 
		importantly, as the future parents of the children of the Church.&nbsp; After 
		much struggling, I finally asked myself this question, Knowing what I 
		know now, what would I liked to have known <u>when I was your age</u> 
		that would have helped me on this journey through life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He placed us in this lone 
		and dreary world to teach us what we need to know so that we may 
		become like Him.&nbsp; The Lord, in preparing this environment we call 
		earth and at the time of the Fall of Adam, instructed us that we would 
		need to learn about Opposition:&nbsp; good and evil, health and sickness, 
		virtue and vice, light and darkness, pleasure and pain.&nbsp; At this point, 
		He also introduced death accompanied by this profound, but very 
		misunderstood statement: We find it in </font><i><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The challenge for you will be

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There was once a wise Chinese 
		man who had <u>one son</u>, <u>one horse</u>, and <u>one acre of ground</u> 
		on which he made his living.&nbsp; One day his son went out to feed the horse 
		and left the gate open and the horse ran away.&nbsp; All of the mans friends 
		and neighbors came to him and said, Oh thats too bad.&nbsp; Youve lost 
		your only horse.&nbsp; How will you make your living?&nbsp; The wise Chinese man 
		just said I dont know if thats bad or thats good. But they insisted 
		it was bad.&nbsp; A few days later, the horse got thirsty and came back to 
		the corral bringing 9 other wild horses with him.&nbsp; Now all his friends 
		came over and said Oh, isnt that good. Youve got 10 horses.&nbsp; The 
		wise Chinese man said I dont know if thats bad or good.&nbsp; And they 
		insisted it was good. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A few days later, the wise 
		Chinese mans son went out to break one of the wild horses.&nbsp; In the 
		process, the horsed reared up and came down, severely breaking the sons 
		leg.&nbsp; This time all the neighbors came over and said Oh, thats too 
		bad.&nbsp; Thats your only son. What will you do?&nbsp; And again the wise 
		Chinese man said I dont know if thats bad or good.&nbsp; And they

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A short time later, war broke

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In some of lifes challenges 
		the Lord wants to see if we will just hang in there <b>with Him</b>if 
		we will just endure.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the greatest studies 
		in keeping an eternal perspective is the story of Prophet Joseph Smith 
		in Liberty Jail.&nbsp; The prophet and others were thrown in jail in November 
		of 1839.&nbsp; This is nine years after the Church was organized.&nbsp; Lets 
		quickly remember what had happened to him in the way of testimony 
		building events:&nbsp;&nbsp; He had seen God the Father and Jesus Christ in the 
		First Vision, he had numerous instructive visits from Moroni, he had 
		translated the Book of Mormon, the priesthood had been restored to the 
		earth through him by way of direct ordination from heavenly messengers.&nbsp; 
		Lets just say he had a miraculous foundation.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While in the Liberty Jail, 
		the prophet received three revelations, Doctrine and Covenants 121,122 
		and 123 &nbsp;all in the month of March, four months after they were all put 
		in jail. &nbsp;Id like to read you the first verses of Section 121 and the 
		last verses of Section 123</font><i><span style="COLOR: #000080">. 
		Section 121, verse 1: Oh God, where art thou? &nbsp;&nbsp;And where is the 
		pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? <b><u>Maybe in your prayers 
		youve said the same thing.</u></b></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="COLOR: #000080">And now in Section 
		123 verse 17: Therefore dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do 
		all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still with the 
		utmost assurance to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be 
		revealed.</span></i><font color="#000080"> The heavens had been quiet 
		for four cold months and then comes some of the most profound and 
		powerful sections in the entire Doctrine and Covenants. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So heres the prophet in this 
		environment not even fit for animals, for a long period of time, in the 
		cold winter months and the brutal daily reality of this situation had 
		begun to wear him down to the point he cries out Oh God, where art 
		thou? Even the prophets Eternal perspective had become a little 
		dimmed. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I want you to know that if it 
		can happen to him, it <u>will </u>happen to you. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But what happened in those 
		most desperate circumstances that by the end of Section 123 in verse 17 
		he says Wherefore brethren, let us go on cheerfully</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From the first verse in 121 
		to the last verse of 123, what happened to help him regain his eternal 
		perspective.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">See what the Lord says to 
		change his perspective because what He said to Joseph he says to you in
		</font><i><span style="COLOR: #000080">Section 121, verse 7. My son, 
		peace be unto thy soul; </span></i><font color="#000080">&nbsp;The Lord 
		reminds him of who he is thou art my son.&nbsp; He continues in </font><i>
<span style="COLOR: #000080">verse 7 thine adversity and thine 
		afflictions shall be but a small moment. <b><u>(It wont last forever</u></b>)</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then, </font><i>
<font color="#000080">in </font><span style="COLOR: #000080">verse 10, 
		He says Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against 
		thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.</span></i><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		Here He gently tells Joseph that it could be worse. He goes on to also 
		remind him of other tough times experienced by other great people who 
		the Lord sanctified to His purposes. Joseph who was sold into Egypt, 
		Paul in the Arabian desert. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then the last statement in
		</font><i><span style="COLOR: #000080">section 122 He says My son all 
		these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good.&nbsp;
		</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What Joseph and his friends 
		thought was bad, the Lord said way good.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph cried out to the Lord 
		and the Lord helped him regain his eternal perspective.&nbsp; Now Joseph 
		could see that this was for his good. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Three things I want you to be

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now dont be mistaken, we 
		want you to successful, we want you to be competitive, we want you to be 
		rewarded for your efforts.&nbsp; But please make sure that you dont equate 
		your self-worth with your net-worth.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here are some examples of 
		what the world would have you believe:&nbsp; <br />
		Life is all about fame and fortune.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">- You are expected to make a 
		lot of money and make it fast. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But just last month in our 
		Stake Conference, Elder Wickman taught us Brethren, its fools gold, 
		not the <u>real gold</u>.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This I know Money cant buy 
		happiness, it only makes you wealthy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It doesnt make you a good 
		person, or better-looking, or smarter, or more successful.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The only people who believe 
		money can buy happiness are those who havent had money yet.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ive learned that people can 
		generally handle poverty better than they can handle wealth. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Scott visited the 
		BYUIdaho 4<sup>th</sup> Stake a couple of years ago.&nbsp; He was visiting 
		with the young married students.&nbsp; These are students who are trying to 
		stretch budgets that wont stretch and make ends meet that just wont 
		come together.&nbsp; And he made this statement, Ive learned in my life 
		that less is better.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Additionally, the world says</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">- You must quickly climb the 
		corporate ladder to the top.&nbsp; Theyll try to convince you that its only 
		from up there that you can see more clearly. And that Happiness awaits 
		those at the top. Too many people have feverishly scaled the ladder in 
		hopes of gaining that better view but sadly look back and realize that 
		their children have fallen off the ladder while they were busy climbing.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember the counsel from 
		President David O. McKay that no success can compensate for failure in 
		the home.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you climb your mountains 
		in life all of you are going to experience both Success and 
		Failure.&nbsp; Dont be too anxious for the applause for the success, or 
		the pity for the failure.&nbsp; The common denominator in Success and Failure 
		is that Neither of these conditions is permanent. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember the Wise Chinese Man

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Id like to share a personal 
		experience</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">15 miles southeast of Rexburg 
		is a town called Ririe. On this day, March 6<sup>th </sup>1990, 17 years 
		ago, the Ririe High School boys basketball team won the A-3 State 
		title.&nbsp; This little town of about 550 people was on top of the world.&nbsp; 
		When the team came home from the tournament, hundreds of people met the 
		bus to cheer them as they rolled into town. They were heroes.&nbsp; They 
		really were a Cinderella Story.they were so unknown at the tournament 
		that the announcers kept talking about the team from Rearie instead of 
		Ririe.&nbsp; This small group of boys had worked together with dogged 
		determination through their whole season and had captured the first 
		State title in the schools history.&nbsp; The whole community was a-buzz 
		with joy and pride.&nbsp; Four days later, on March 10<sup>th</sup>, one of 
		the teams star players, Cory Radford and his teammate and close friend 
		Bruce Hill had gone fishing near Salmon, Idaho.&nbsp; They fished all day and 
		then decided to stay up and fish all night because there was a full 
		moon.&nbsp; They left the next morning with very little sleep.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On the drive home, both boys 
		fell asleep and their car veered head-on into a motor-home RV, killing 
		them both instantly.&nbsp; The news of the accident stunned the whole Snake 
		River Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the community that had been celebrating their 
		highest of highs only days before, was now grieving and hurting in their 
		lowest of lows.&nbsp; All the people were asking in disbelief How could this 
		happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would the Lord allow this to happen?&nbsp; These were good 
		boys.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I might add that I was the 
		President of the Ririe Stake at the time and I can tell you this tragedy 
		nearly shattered the faith of a whole community.&nbsp; In counseling and 
		talking with people, and frankly on the days that I tried to make sense 
		of it myself, I wondered Why hadnt the Lord nudged them awake?&nbsp; Or 
		miraculously guided the car out of harms way?&nbsp; These were good boys 
		from good families.&nbsp; Future missionaries. Surely they qualified for such 
		divine intervention.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">After much prayer and fasting 
		to know how to counsel people, this truth was confirmed to me.&nbsp; I came 
		to know that the Lord knew of this situation, that He did indeed have 
		the power to stop it, but He didnt.&nbsp; Therefore it was His will.and it 
		would be ok.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I tell you this story to pay 
		tribute to Cory, but I tell it today to also pay tribute to his parents, 
		Lynn and Cindy Radford. They are here today seated on the stand next to 
		my wife Sharol. &nbsp;&nbsp;All their friends and neighbors came to them and said 
		This is so sad.&nbsp; So unfair.&nbsp; This is your oldest son  what will you 
		ever do?&nbsp; I pay tribute to them because they, at that moment of deep 
		tragedy, helped us all understand an important lesson.&nbsp; Their strength 
		in the face of a desperately painful situation showed all of us that 
		they didnt determine that it was bad or good, but they knew it was the 
		Lords will and that eventually everything would be alright. Their trust 
		in the Lord helped sustain everyone elses trust in the Lords plan.&nbsp; --</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have learned much from a 
		book entitled Why Did This Happen to Me by Ray Pritchard.&nbsp; Mr. 
		Pritchard says <i>Sometimes we will face things for which there is no 
		earthly explanation</i>.&nbsp; In those moments we need to erect a sign that 
		reads, Quiet: God at Work.&nbsp; Meanwhile, hold on, keep believing. Dont 
		quit. Dont give up.&nbsp; Let God do His work in you.&nbsp; The greatest tragedy 
		is to miss what God wants to teach us through our troubles.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How to accomplish this-----It 
		is hard, very hard, everyday!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Youll find that some days in 
		your profession you simply</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">say, All these ornery 
		people, where did they all come from?And sometimes youll feel picked 
		on or belittled.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Just remember this African 
		proverb, It not what they call you, its what you answer to that 
		matters.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And sometimes, its just a 
		matter of choosing our attitude to those everyday challenges. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For instance.many of you 
		will experience not getting a call-back for a second interview for that 
		job that you thought was a sure thing, a slam-dunk.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Heres what I want you to say 
		to yourselves</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Thats nothing. Thank 
		goodness theres a job market, not just one job out there.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Or maybe youve just been 
		dumped by that boy or girl who you really felt was the one..just say 
		to yourselves Thats nothing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is better to know this 
		now, than later.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why say Thats nothing? 
		&nbsp;Because if you keep telling yourself its nothing, it will be nothing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you let it simmer and keep 
		telling yourself its something, then eventually it will become 
		something.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another great deterrent to 
		discouragement is to remember that were all in the same boat.&nbsp; I 
		mean, arent we?&nbsp; Arent we pressing along this path together? I testify 
		that we are and it was meant to be so.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ray Pritchard in his book 
		mentioned previously, describes a scene in the movie <i>Black Hawk Down</i> 
		that makes this point. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A vehicle filled with wounded 
		American soldiers has come to a stop in the middle of a street where 
		Somali bullets are flying in every direction.&nbsp; The officer in charge 
		tells a soldier to get in and start driving.&nbsp; I cant the soldier 
		says, Im shot.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Were all shot, the officer 
		replies.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Get in and drive.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That little scene resonates 
		because its so true.&nbsp; Were all wounded in one way or another. <i>But 
		its not what happens to us that matters.&nbsp; Its how we respond that 
		makes all the difference.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The apostle Paul is a good 
		example.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Paul tells us that he was 
		given a thorn in the flesh.&nbsp; A temptation from Satan that he struggled 
		with. Historians have tried to determine what Paul was tempted with.&nbsp; My 
		personal opinion is that the specific temptation is not spelled out here 
		because the story relates to every one of us.&nbsp; For we all have thorns 
		in the flesh.&nbsp; And like Paul, we can pray to the Lord to have them 
		removed, but sometimes he wont remove them because theyre for our 
		benefit and its just a matter of what we do with them from then on that 
		is important. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">You know there was a premortal existence in the

		were on probation. You were being schooled and tested and examined. You 
		learned of the laws which would allow you to progress and advance. You 
		followed those laws, and thus you were entitled to come to earth, 
		placing you on a course leading to exaltation, dominion, and godhood.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">The majority of your young adult peers, and the 
		world in general, know little of these realities! They live in a box, 
		defined by two events, birth and death. They make decisions and 
		engage in behaviors, circumscribed by such a limited perspective. 
		Essentially, they live for the moment, namely, the length of time 
		between their births and their deaths, which is a mere nanosecond in the 
		scheme of eternity. They know nothing of their premortal existence, 
		nothing of eternity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">But you are familiar with the writings of Abraham 
		found in the Pearl of Great Price: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">Now the Lord had 
		shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the 
		world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great 
		ones (Abraham 3:22).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">The nature of our beings, before we received a 
		spirit body, born of celestial parents, was simply described as 
		intelligences, many of which were noble and great, destined for 
		responsibilities upon this earth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">We read further in verse 23:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">And God saw these 
		souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he 
		said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were 
		spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, 
		thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Thus we know that, by foreordination, Abraham 
		would become a great prophet in mortality. Abraham did not live for the 
		moment; rather, he sought and ultimately obtained the blessings of 
		eternity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">In Doctrine and Covenants 132:29 we read of his 
		current postmortal status: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">Abraham received 
		all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my 
		word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth 
		upon his throne.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">In other words, Abraham has already become a god 
		in eternity! There are numerous other noble and great ones who were 
		foreordained or foredesignated for mortal responsibilities. This 
		principle extends to both male and female spirit beings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Jeremiah did hear the voice of the Lord, saying in

		thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the

		nations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">We may safely assume that the prophets and 
		apostles of this dispensation, beginning with Joseph Smith, were also 
		foreordained. So also were Eve and Esther in the Old Testament, Mary in 
		the New Testament, and Emma in our time; each of these remarkable women 
		were foredesignated to be noble and great in their mortal existences 
		and responsibilities. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">

		with vociferous opposition by Satan. Elders Heber C. Kimball and Orson 
		Hyde (both members of the Quorum of the Twelve), along with Elders

		described the event as follows:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">While thus 
		engaged, I was struck with great force by some invisible power, and fell 
		senseless to the floor.  Elder Hyde and Richards then assisted me to 
		get on the bed.  I  sat up on the bed, when a vision was opened to our 
		minds, and we could distinctly see the evil spirits, who foamed and 
		gnashed their teeth at us. We gazed upon them about an hour and a half. 
		 we saw the devils coming in legions, with their leaders, who came 
		within a few feet of us.  They appeared to be men of full stature, 
		possessing every form and feature of men in the flesh, who were angry 
		and desperate; and I shall never forget the vindictive malignity 
		depicted on their countenances as they looked me in the eye.  I cannot 
		even look back on the scene without feelings of horror; yet by it I 
		learned of the power of the adversary, his enmity against the servants 
		of God, and got some understanding of the invisible world. We distinctly 
		heard those spirits talk and express their wrath and hellish designs 
		against us. However, the Lord delivered us from them, and blessed us 
		exceedingly that day (<i>The Life of Heber C. Kimball,</i> Orson F. 
		Whitney, Deseret Book [2001], 13031). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Despite the opposition of Satan, the nine baptisms 
		did occur as planned on that Sunday morning some 170 years ago. When 
		Heber C. Kimball returned to America, he narrated the experience with 
		Satans legions to the Prophet Joseph. Heber asked what it meant and 
		whether there was something wrong with Heber that he should have such a 
		manifestation. Josephs reply was:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">No, Brother Heber, 
		at that time you were nigh unto the Lord; there was only a veil between 
		you and [Christ], but you could not see Him. When I heard of it, it gave 
		me great joy, for I then knew that the work of God had taken root in 
		that land. It was this that caused the devil to make a struggle to kill 
		you (<i>The Life of Heber C. Kimball,</i> 131).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">In our time, the supporters of Satan are rarely as

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Satans numerous supporters are those who belittle

<font color="#000080">But Jesus Christ also has His legions! And they

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">We have knowledge of Lucifer, his past, and his

<font color="#000080">You wonderful young adults, you future leaders in

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">For he who is not

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">It is on earth that we learn how to abide the law 
		of the celestial kingdom. We must be willing to <i>abide</i> those laws 
		in order to be able to <i>keep</i> those laws. We learn as we resist 
		temptations. Our challenge is to overcome temptations. That is the 
		challenge which even the Savior had to confront during his mortal 
		experience. In Alma 7:11 we read of Christ:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">And he shall go

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">He suffered 
		temptations but gave no heed unto them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Christ resisted Satan successfully. He

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">How can you approach that level of absolute 
		obedience in your personal behavior? The gospel, the power of God unto 
		salvation, provides the perfect plan for you. I therefore share with you 
		the following counsel:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; Love Heavenly Father. Value His judgment above that of all other 
		mortal influences.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">2.&nbsp; Develop increasing faith in Jesus Christ. This is accomplished by 
		deepening your personal understanding and your constant application of 
		the Saviors teachings, thereby strengthening your testimony and your 
		capacity to resist evil.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; Deepen your sensitivity to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and 
		act upon them, for He will guide you and give you discernment between 
		good and evil and the power to choose good <i>over</i> evil.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; Watch and pray continually so as not to be overcome by 
		temptation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; Do not reprocess the same temptation, again and again. Decide 
		once to obey and then follow that commandment forever. Repentance does 
		not need to take forever.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">6.&nbsp; Engage in meaningful fasting opportunities to receive divine

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">7.&nbsp; Participate in temple service as often as possible. There you

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Consider the experience of King Benjamins people, 
		following his great address found at Mosiah, chapters 14. After his 
		remarks, he asked the people if they believed his words. They responded 
		in Mosiah 5:2 as follows:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">And they all cried 
		with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast 
		spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of 
		the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in 
		us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but 
		to do good continually.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">And they reinforced their commitment in verse 5:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080" size="3">And we are willing 
		to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Each of us has already entered into a covenant 
		with our Heavenly Father, namely to always remember His Son and to keep 
		His commandments. This covenant, which we renew at each sacrament 
		meeting, is not limited in scope or in length of time. Ponder and 
		recommit each time you partake.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Is it really possible to have no more disposition 
		to do evil, but to do good continually? Yes! You are already doing it 
		in your life with respect to certain of the commandments. You did not 
		wake up this morning, wondering whether today you would be able to keep 
		the Word of Wisdom or whether you would be able to resist robbing a bank 
		or cheating upon an exam. Those temptations are gone for you! They are 
		no longer an issue for you. Yet, others may yet be struggling with those 
		very same commandments today. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font color="#000080">Having demonstrated your strict obedience in

		the kingdom. &nbsp;If your bishop calls you to be the nursery leader, or the 
		Scoutmaster, or the Laurel advisor, or anything else, accept and 
		magnify.&nbsp; You will find the Savior there. &nbsp;When opportunities come to 
		volunteer for service, be the first person with your hand in the air, 
		the first person with your name on the sign-up sheet. &nbsp;When the call 
		goes out to shovel the sidewalks or visit someone less active or take a 
		meal to a ward member, be the first one to stand up and say, Here am I,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For the graduates, 
				faculty and family and friends, to be at the convocation in the 
				college at which you are graduating is quite an honor. I have 
				sat here thinking of a number of experiences in my life that 
				might help.&nbsp; Years ago when I was in graduate school, I was in a 
				graduate program where about one- third of those who had 
				graduated - who were exceptional students- failed and were 
				released from the graduate program. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><br />
				As I watched them going from the left and right of me and 
				knowing that I was not as bright as they were, I was called in 
				by a district president to be an elders quorum president. I 
				went home to my wife and I said, I have been asked to be the 
				elders quorum president. It was one of the few times in my 
				life, I didnt say yes on the spot. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And I said to her, I 
				probably will fail in school if I take this calling.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;And then she said, 
				we will, do both of them.&nbsp; And then she proceeded to kneel in 
				prayer with me and I was taught a great lesson that I want to 
				leave with you. In taking that assignment I understood that you 
				can do the things of the world and the things of the Lord and 
				get them done. That was the most difficult time. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Years later when I 
				was president of Paper Mate and I was asked to be a bishop, it 
				was easy. I had made that decision. Ten years later as a group 
				vice president of a large corporation and they wanted me in 1975 
				to come and to be an assistant to the Twelve, it was an easy 
				decision. I had made that decision when I was younger. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So I would like to 
				ask you to remember that when those moments come in your life 
				and you are asked to choose between the Lords ways and the 
				worlds ways, just remind yourself you can do them both. You do 
				choose the Lords ways, and you do what you have to do. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><br />
				What I have learned in my lifetime, is another lesson. Never at 
				any time during my career did the fact that I was a member of 
				the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stand in the way 
				of my progress. And what I found from my sweetheart was that she 
				always encouraged me.&nbsp; She had a simple phrase, Thee lift me 
				and Ill lift thee and we will ascend together. &nbsp;Thee lift me 
				and Ill lift thee and we will ascend together.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You have been in a 
				greenhouse - almost an incubator.&nbsp; We just had a few years ago, 
				our youngest grandchild was six weeks in intensive care in an 
				incubator and the lungs were developing so he could come into 
				the world. He is now five and doing very well. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You are now in the 
				same situation. You have been in an educational incubator. You 
				have done some work possibly, but now you are going to go and 
				find out whether with all the care that you have had, with the 
				marvelous faculty and training, with the work you have done in 
				your service.. .( I have a grandson, Andrew, graduating who is 
				in the bishopric. So he has had to learn while he has been here 
				how to do both) . . .but you will have to learn about change, 
				and meeting challenges.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And I leave you with 
				one last thought.&nbsp; Years ago we were traveling with the family 
				and we took them to Sequoia National Forest.&nbsp; We saw these giant 
				trees almost as big around as the center of this auditorium, but 
				there was a sign that was very interesting. Do not tread near 
				the giant Sequoia for the roots are very shallow and youll 
				compact the ground. Sure enough, years later that famous tree 
				which we stood and saw when my boys were young fell over because 
				the tourists trod it down and the roots were very shallow. <br />
<br />
				May I give you one more thing to remember: drive that spiritual 
				tap root deep and strong so that when the winds of adversity, 
				trials and tribulations, when they blow and tear at the roots of 
				your foundation, you will have dug spiritual roots so deep that 
				like the mighty oak tree - different than the Sequoia or Palm 
				tree, that goes over in the wind or the caves because of the 
				shallow roots - that your tap root will be deep enough, that you 
				will hold true and fast and that you will accomplish all that is 
				expected of you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Where much is given, 
				much is expected. &nbsp;And much has been given to you.&nbsp; May the 
				Lords choicest blessings be with you that you might understand 
				the gifts and talents which you have, that you might honor them 
				and as stated in the 46<sup>th</sup> section that your gifts and 
				talents will benefit all who are around you and with you in your 
				home as you were taught today, in the businesses where you 
				serve, and in your communities, but most of all in the 
				brotherhood and sisterhood which you share, that you will indeed 
				lift and strengthen others.&nbsp; I ask the Lords choicest blessings 
				to be with you and leave you once again with my testimony of who 
				you are. You are a son and daughter of God. You have been sent 
				to get an education, to go to higher ground so you might lift 
				and strengthen others, and to be able to be there when others 
				need you, to use your creativity to help mankind further itself.
				</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><br />
				I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. If we will 
				stay close to our Heavenly Father, and if we will follow His Son 
				Jesus Christ, and then lead and follow those who come in contact 
				with us, that you will let your light so shine that others will 
				see that light and have the pathway lit for them that they can 
				stay on that straight and narrow path and get to the tree of 
				life, eternal life. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

		graduating today in Science and Computer Training.&nbsp; But Id like to give 
		you my testimony.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080"><br />
		We have heard from President Clark. We will hear from Elder Eyring. 
		These are men who functioned at the highest level of academe: Harvard, 
		Stanford, MIT. And they followed a prophets voice when they were called 
		and asked to serve and to change their lives. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">That is what each one 
		of us must understand. That when we think of the Spirit, when we think 
		of little Samuel, when he was laying in his bed, awakened three times 
		and went to Eli the high priest, and finally Eli said to him, Go back 
		to your bed. And the next time the voice comes to you, dont come and 
		wake me up.&nbsp; You listen and say, speak Lord for thy servant heareth.&nbsp; 
		And I will add, And will do what thou commandest. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">You are not here by 
		accident. You are here and have gained the knowledge which youve gained 
		to go forward into the world; to follow the charge of the governor to 
		better your homes, to better your states, and to better your nation; to 
		follow the counsel the president has given you and what Elder 
		Eyring will give. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080"><br />
		And that is you are responsible to have the Spirit to be with you, to 
		strengthen yourselves, and to lift others up.&nbsp; I give you my testimony 
		that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. And that because of that 
		testimony which we have, we can withstand the fiery darts of the 
		adversary. Stay true and faithful, stay on that straight and narrow path 
		that leads to the tree of eternal life that we may return to our 
		Heavenly Father with our families, to be able to have the eternal 
		blessing to be with them forever.&nbsp; That we may do so, I so pray in the

		Brothers and sisters, 
		thank you for being in devotional today.&nbsp; You will be blessed for being 
		here.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>
		In gatherings such as this where we come to be instructed and edified, our hungering spirits 
		are blessed and magnified by what we feel here. As the Lord told the 
		Prophet Joseph, ..where two or three are gathered together in my name, 
		behold, there will I be in the midst of them  even so am I in the midst 
		of you (D&amp;C 6:32). What a marvelous and wonderful blessing.
		</p>
<p>
		Did you know that the speakers for devotional arent assigned a topic?&nbsp; When they receive an 		invitation to come, they are asked to prayerfully select by inspiration the topic that the Lord wants them to bring. I am grateful that we have 
		the opportunity each Tuesday to gather with the Lord in our midst and receive the inspired messages our speakers have prepared in this way.</p>
<p>
		Lehi, in the Book of Mormon describes how this process worked for his family in the wilderness. He tells his sons that they would have all perished without 
		their brother, Nephis obedience to the commandments of God in bringing them the sharpness of the power of the word of God (2 Nephi 1:26).</p>
<p>
		Nephi obediently brought to his family messages that the Lord gave to him for them.&nbsp; 
		These messages were not only timely but were critical to their survival 
		and to the success of their journey to the Promised Land.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
		In First Nephi chapters 17 and 18, we read of the Lords command to Nephi to build a 
		ship. When he brought that message to his family, they must have thought 
		he was crazy.&nbsp; Why did they need a ship? After all they were enjoying, 
		after eight long years of trial in the wilderness their beautiful home 
		by the sea which they called Bountiful, because of its much fruit and 
		also wild honey (1 Nephi 17:5). They probably didnt want to go 
		anywhere by land or sea. Nephi says, quote: &nbsp;my brethren did complain 
		against me, for they did not believe that I could build a ship.&nbsp; Neither 
		would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord (1 Nephi 17:18).</p>
<p>
		But the Lord continued to inspire Nephi, so that with much patience he was able to 
		persuade them to, quote:&nbsp; worship the Lord, and  go forth with me; and 
		we did work timbers of curious workmanship and did build the ship after 
		the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after 
		the manner of men (1 Nephi 18:1-2).</p>
<p>
		Nephi prepared for the role he played in his family as the message bearer for the Lord.&nbsp; We 
		read of his preparation In First Nephi chapter 2, verse 16: </p>
<p>
			And it came to pass that I Nephi, being exceedingly young,  having great desires 
			to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord 
			and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 
			believe all the words which had been spoken by my father wherefore, 
			I did not rebel against him like  my brothers. </p>
<p>
		We must prepare like Nephi, with softened hearts to be message bearers for the Lord:&nbsp; as 
		missionaries, as leaders and teachers in our wards and stakes, as home 
		and visiting teachers, and someday, as Moms and Dads, and perhaps even 
		as devotional speakers who bring forth the sharpness of the power of 
		the word of God (1 Nephi 1:26).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
		I love the Lord for sending his messages to us through his servants whose hearts, like 
		Nephis are softened to believe all the words of the Prophets and who 
		are inspired to bring messages from God that make us aware of our needs, 
		and instruct us on how to proceed. </p>
<p>
		President Clark has prepared a message for us today with that kind of inspired preparation. 
		Months ago even before we had delivered our devotional address at the 
		start of Fall Semester, he had begun to receive direction from the Lord 
		about what he should say to you today. We know that what he has prepared 
		is a message directly from Heaven.</p>
<p>
		It is my prayer that we will listen with and be instructed by the Spirit as we receive His 
		message. I pray that we will each understand the messages specific 
		application to our personal needs, and that along with instruction on 
		how to proceed, we will receive inspiration and courage to act on those 
		instructions. </p>
<p>
		We gather under direction from the Lord.&nbsp; As it says in Doctrine and Covenants, section 
		29: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
			And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect, for mine elect 
			hear my voice and harden not their hearts. Wherefore the decree hath 
			gone forth from the Father that they shall be gathered in unto one 
			place upon the face of this land to prepare their hearts and be 
			prepared in all things.&nbsp; (D&amp;C 29:7-8)</p>
<p>
		I know that our Savior Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; How oft will 
		I gather you, He says, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
		wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart 
		(3 Nephi 10:6).</p>
<p>
		It is my prayer that we will all gather here at every devotional for the softening of our 
		hearts, in preparation for all that He has prepared for us. In the name 
		of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">One day not long ago, Michael said good-bye

		that some things that had been buried within him began to surface.
		</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Beginning on that first day and continuing

<span style="color: #000080"><font size="3">MTC</font></span></span><span style="color: #000080">,

<span style="color: #000080">In the moment Michael took those steps

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">O my son  let the justice of God, and

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Look carefully at the phrase full sway in

<span style="color: #000080">Following the Last Supper, Jesus went with 
		the eleven apostles to a garden on the Mount of Olives called 
		Gethsemane. Leaving the other eight at the entrance, He took Peter, 
		James, and John a little further and then left them as well. In those 
		first moments in the garden, He began to feel the great weight of the 
		burden He was called to bear. He began to be sorrowful and very heavy<span class="Superscript"><font size="1">4</font></span>

<span style="color: #000080">As the sorrow and suffering, the grief and

<span style="color: #000080">As the agony grew even more intense, an

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Deep within the drama of the Garden of 
		Gethsemane and the agony of Calvary lies a covenant, a promise that 
		Jesus made to his Father. In the great Council in Heaven, God the Father 
		asked, Whom shall I send? Whom shall I send to be the Savior, to atone 
		for the sins of the world, to overcome all things, and to bring to pass 
		the great plan of happiness? Jesus answered, Here am, I send me.<span class="Superscript"><font size="1">36</font></span> 
		Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.<span class="Superscript"><font size="1">37</font></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Throughout the Saviors life this promise 
		guided Him, inspired Him, informed everything He did. He taught His 
		disciples, and any who would listen, I seek not mine own will, but the 
		will of the Father,<span class="Superscript"><font size="1">38</font></span> 
		and He did exactly that to the very end of His life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">He was tempted and tried like no other 
		could be. Despite untold sacrifice and suffering, Jesus kept His promise 
		and did the will of His Father. Because of that supernal act of 
		submission and obedience, all of Gods promises in the plan of salvation 
		will come to pass. This is why Jacob could exclaim:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080; letter-spacing: .05pt">O the greatness

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Because of the Atonement, justice will 
		prevail: sin will be punished, but true repentance will be effective, 
		righteousness will be blessed, and salvation in Christ will be secure. 
		Elder Richard G. Scott taught this principle in these words:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Justice is that part of Father in 
			Heavens plan of happiness that maintains order. It is like gravity 
			to a rock climber, ever present. It is a friend if eternal laws are 
			observed. It responds to your detriment if they are ignored. Justice 
			guarantees that you will receive the blessings you earn for obeying 
			the laws of God.<span class="Superscript"><font size="1">40</font></span>

<span style="color: #000080; letter-spacing: -.05pt">Because Jesus was

		guaranteed. The promises are true. Though Satan may promote disorder and

		the scriptures speak. He needed to deepen his faith and his 
		understanding of the gospel. He needed to be fully worthy to return to 
		the House of the Lord; and he needed to be fully prepared to return to 
		the mission field, there to serve the Lord with all his heart. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">And so Michael set up a new life for 
		himself. He got a job working at a local hospital. He set up regular 
		visits with his bishop. He read and studied the scriptures. He prayed 
		often seeking the Lords blessing. He sought to be of service and to be 
		active in his ward. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">The path was not easy. For example, Michael 
		went to church with us the Sunday after he came home. He had just given 
		a talk in sacrament meeting before he left on his mission, and now he 
		had to explain to people why he was back so soon. But he faced his 
		situation head-on with courage and candor. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">During those months Michael met often with 
		the bishop of our ward, Mark Ott. Bishop Ott was a great blessing to 
		Michael. He counseled with him, encouraged him, and loved him. One day 
		he asked Michael to give Sister Naomi Cranney a ride to and from church. 
		Sister Cranney was ninety-seven years old. Every week when she was able 
		to come, Michael would arrive at her home, help her down the steps into 
		the car, drive her to church, help her get to the chapel, and sit with 
		her during sacrament meeting. He would then take her home at the end of 
		church. Sister Cranney had a wonderful spirit about her, and she grew to 
		love Michael dearly. Over many weeks Michael was blessed to come to know 
		and serve a great Latter-day Saint. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">During this time Michael lived at home. He 
		would often come into our bedroom at night and talk to us about his 
		efforts. These months were Michaels Gethsemane. He suffered, and he got 
		discouraged. When discouragement set in, he would come into our room and 
		ask for a blessing. I gave Michael many blessings during those months; 
		and I knew through the Spirit that Michael was changing, that the 
		Atonement was working in his life. Though the path was hard, the Savior 
		was by his side. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">And so it went, day after day, night after 
		night for a long time. The dark night was long, but the morning light 
		soon came. Sue and I were eyewitnesses to the miracle of the Atonement 
		of Jesus Christ in the life of our precious son. The Savior reached out 
		and took hold of that young man and changed him from the inside out. I 
		will never forget the day Michael came home from his General Authority 
		interview. He had gone to Pittsburgh to meet with Elder Spencer Condie. 
		I picked him up at the airport. As he came off that airplane, he was 
		radiant! The Spirit of the Lord shone brightly in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle">
<span style="color: #000080">Michael returned to the temple and to the 
		mission field. His mission was not easy, but he served faithfully and 
		well. He became a mighty elder in Israel. His knowledge of the gospel 
		deepened, and his understanding of the Atonement increased. What began 
		that week in January of 2001 continued through his time in British 
		Columbia. And it continues today. He has come to know the Savior in a 
		deep and powerful way through his own experience. I know the Atonement 
		of Jesus Christ has full sway in his heart. And because he has followed 
		the Son, with full purpose of heart, he has helped many others to feel 
		the power of the Atonement in their lives.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000080">My dear brothers and sisters, I bear you my

		His Atonement is real. I know He is my Savior. He is Michaels Savior. 
		And He is your Savior. He stands with open arms bidding all to come unto 
		Him and receive the blessings of redemption and salvation now and

<span style="color: #000080">I bear witness that the power and authority

		Zion, holy temples, and the guiding hand of the Savior himself. The 
		powers of heaven are on the earth, and we have everything we need to 
		follow the patterns the Savior established in His Atonement. We can 
		enter into and keep sacred covenants. We can serve each other in love 
		and righteousness in the kingdom of God. And through the matchless, 
		divine power of the Atonement, we can walk in the newness of life.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">We apply 
		principles in our lives everyday.&nbsp; Many times we are not even aware that 
		we are applying principles.&nbsp; They are just part of what we do.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Before I talk 
		about eternal, gospel principles I want to describe a principle of 
		physical science and make a comparison between to two. I will describe 
		the principle of the Inclined Plane or a ramp.&nbsp; I apologize to my 
		friends in the Physics Department for my simplistic explanation of this 
		principle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">There are 
		laws of physics that govern how much energy is required to lift an 
		object to a specific height.&nbsp; If we want to get a barrel of punch up on 
		a table for the ward party, it is going to take a certain amount of 
		energy.&nbsp; There is no way to change that amount of energy.&nbsp; However, 
		there are laws of energy that can help us make the effort easier.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Energy has 
		two aspects: one is the force we put into the effort and the other is 
		the distance over which we exert that force.&nbsp; By applying the principle 
		of the inclined plane or using a ramp we do not change the amount of 
		energy required to get the barrel up on the table.&nbsp; We produce the same 
		amount of energy but exert a smaller force over a longer distance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Therefore we 
		can either try to lift the barrel straight up, applying all of the 
		energy at one time and at one place or we can apply the principle of 
		the&nbsp; inclined plane by rolling the barrel up a ramp, spreading the force 
		over a greater distance and making the effort easier.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">By the way,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">We apply this 
		principle when we take the gradual path up the mountain instead of 
		scaling the face.&nbsp; Scaling the face is the shorter distance but takes 
		more force.&nbsp; Taking the path is easier, scaling the face is harder.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">This is a 
		simple explanation of the relationship between a principle, the laws and 
		the application. The principle of the inclined plane is based upon laws

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Yes, the

		That principle, along with all other principle of the gospel is based 
		upon laws and doctrines such as: Jesus Christ is the only begotten of 
		the Father.&nbsp; He is our Savior and Redeemer. He atoned for our sins, 
		mistakes, and weaknesses.&nbsp; He has all knowledge and power.&nbsp; By His

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">There is a 
		difference between applying principles of physical science, like the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">The 
		difference is that in order to receive the exalting, saving blessings of

		some idea that He is a being in whom we can exercise that faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Most people

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">To receive 
		the miraculous power of the principles of faith, prayer, repentance,

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">The falseness

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Based on the

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">This

		principles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">The first is 
		that as we commit to live correct principles we receive the Lords 
		grace, His enabling power, to live the principle.&nbsp; I dont believe that 
		Bishop Williams had the ability on his own to forgive the driver of the 
		other car.&nbsp; The only way he could do that is through the grace and mercy 
		of the Savior.&nbsp; In the 12th chapter of Either the Lord told Moroni:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;my grace 
		is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they 
		humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak 
		things become strong unto them. (Ether 12:27)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">I bear 
		testimony that as we live correct principles we will experience the hand 
		of God in our lives.&nbsp; He will help us do the right thing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">The other 
		principle about living principles is that of It Mattereth Not.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">By 
		immediately forgiving the other driver Bishop Williams was saying, It 
		mattereth not what anyone else has done.&nbsp; It doesnt matter how I feel 
		or what I think.&nbsp; It doesnt matter how absolutely devastated I am 
		because of my loss.&nbsp; What matters is that I live the principle of 
		forgiveness right here, right now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">The phrase 
		it mattereth not is found throughout the scriptures and is an 
		expression of faith.&nbsp; I would like to read a scripture that helps us see 
		how this principle applies to relationships.&nbsp; The topic of this 
		scripture is conflict resolution.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Before we 
		read the scripture I would like to say something about our fallen 
		nature.&nbsp; As I have counseled with families over the years there is one 
		characteristic that seems to be consistent with many of them.&nbsp; This is 
		not too profound, its not a secret we all know that most people want to 
		have their own way.&nbsp; They dont know what to do if thing dont go their 
		way.&nbsp; They dont know how to handle disappointment.&nbsp; They complain, 
		argue, fight, criticize, whine, cry, and even kick and scream.&nbsp; Some 
		withdraw and leave the relationship.&nbsp; They are so prideful and selfish 
		that they wont consider changing themselves to resolve conflict.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Now would you 
		please turn to the 61st chapter of Alma.&nbsp; You are familiar with this 
		account.&nbsp; The king-men had caused contention and war among the Nephites 
		in Zarahemla while the armies of Moroni were away fighting the Laminites.&nbsp; 
		Moroni had written to the chief judge, Pahoran, asking for more soldiers 
		and supplies.&nbsp; When he didnt receive the support he had asked for 
		Moroni became angry and wrote to Pahoran again.&nbsp; This time he chastised 
		Pahoran, blamed him of neglect and even treason.&nbsp; He said Pahoran was 
		sitting upon his throne in a state of thoughtless stupor.&nbsp; He blamed 
		him for the deaths of the soldiers.&nbsp; He threatened to come to Zarahimla 
		and kill anyone who would not help defend the freedom of their country.&nbsp; 
		Moroni got very personal and nasty with Pahoran.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Pahorans 
		response to Moroni was in the same spirit of faithful obedience as was 
		Bishop Williams.&nbsp; In the 61st chapter of Alma look at verse 2.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;I, Pahoran,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Now for the 
		verse that impresses me the most in this whole account verse 9:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">And now, in 
		your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry,

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Brothers and 
		sisters, if there was ever anyone who had a right to be offended, angry, 
		and defensive it would be Pahoran at this time.&nbsp; Moroni had made some 
		serious accusations and threats toward him.&nbsp; I would think that Pahoran 
		would be justified in saying, Moroni, you are such a jerk. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">You dont 
		know what youre talking about.&nbsp; You are a judgmental, pious bully.&nbsp; Im 
		doing everything I can to hold the government together so you can have 
		any support at all and all you can do is carp, complain, and criticize.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">But that was 
		not his response.&nbsp; This great saint knew, as Bishop Williams knew, that 
		he must continue to live the principles of the gospel, especially at 
		this crucial time, no matter what.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">I also find 
		it interesting that Pahoran did not ignore Moronis verbal attack but 
		recognized Moronis frustration and complemented him for his greatness 
		of heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080">Remember 
		Elder Jeffrey R. Hollands wonderful counsel at the last general

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear Brothers and Sisters, 
		it is wonderful to be with you today.&nbsp; Im grateful for the preparations 
		that each of you has made to attend this devotional, and for the Spirit 
		you bring to a setting such as this.&nbsp; It is such a great blessing and 
		honor for my wife, Margaret and me, to be serving here at this special 
		time.&nbsp; We love the BYUIdaho community, and the students, faculty and 
		staff that make this such a special place.&nbsp; Thank you for your goodness 
		and righteousness.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I also want to express my 
		thanks for the opening prayer, scripture reading, and music, all of 
		which have helped to invite the Spirit to be here with us today.&nbsp; I&nbsp; 
		Pray that throughout this meeting the Holy Ghost will confirm for each 
		of us the truths we will discuss, and that you will be inspired and 
		motivated to act on what you feel and learn.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Building on the wonderful 
		devotional given by President Clark two weeks ago, I would like to focus 
		my remarks on the promised blessings of the Saviors Atonement, and more 
		particularly, on how we can receive those blessings each day.&nbsp; Whether 
		we are a student or an employee, single or married, a lifetime member of 
		the Church or a recent convert  the blessings of the Atonement can be 
		ours.&nbsp; It is my hope and prayer that by the time we leave this 
		devotional, each of us will have a greater understanding, conviction and 
		desire to obtain those blessings on a daily basis.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Importance of the 
		Atonement</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Prophet Joseph Smith 
		said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080"><i>
		The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the 
		Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried 
		and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven;&nbsp; and all other 
		things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i>&nbsp; (<u>Teachings 
		of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938, page 121.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">To 
		this Elder Bruce R. McConkie has added, [the atonement] is the 
		foundation upon which all truth rests, and all things grow out of it and 
		come because of it.&nbsp; Indeed, the atonement is the Gospel. (Mormon 
		Doctrine, page 60, Bruce R. McConkie.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Knowing that the atonement is 
		the essence of the gospel, and that the gospel is the good news, it 
		follows that the blessings of the atonement must be grand indeed.&nbsp; And 
		that they are.&nbsp; We often think of the blessings associated with the 
		atonement as falling into one of two categories - those that are 
		unconditional and those that are conditional.&nbsp; Those that are in the 
		first category  that are unconditional  require no action on our part 
		to be received.&nbsp; They are independent of how we act.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has 
		summarized these unconditional blessings as consisting of three types.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">
		First, the Saviors atonement paid for Adams original transgression so 
		that none of us is held responsible for that sin.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">
		Second, as a result of the atonement, every son or daughter of God who 
		lives on this earth will be resurrected. And</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">
		Third, the atonement ensures the salvation of little children, the 
		mentally impaired, [and] those who lived without ever hearing the gospel 
		of Jesus Christthese are redeemed by the universal power of the 
		atonement  and will have the opportunity to receive the fullness of the 
		gospel in the spirit world.&nbsp; (The Atonement of Jesus Christ, by 
		Jeffrey R. Holland, included in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Conditional Blessings 
		of the Atonement</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:.25in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As grand and wonderful as 
		these unconditional blessings are, the Saviors Atonement also offers a 
		host of conditional blessings that are equally grand and glorious.&nbsp; &nbsp;Id 
		like to focus the remainder of my time on some of these conditional 
		blessings that depend on our actions; on what we do to avail ourselves 
		of them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">However, before doing so, a 
		simple example might illustrate more fully the distinction between 
		unconditional and conditional. Im sure you can all recall times 
		when a teacher or parent gave you an unconditional answer to a 
		question.&nbsp; For example, you asked what is 2+2? and the response was 
		4.&nbsp; Or you asked, how far is it to grandmas house? and the answer 
		was 35 miles.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But at other times you might 
		have asked what you thought was also a simple question, like how long 
		will it take us to get to grandmas house? and the answer you received 
		was that depends.&nbsp; If you were like me, you much preferred the 
		unconditional answers to the conditional ones.&nbsp; You wanted a simple 
		unambiguous answer.&nbsp; You didnt want to have to work, to think, to 
		reason, and to deal with uncertainty.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Unfortunately, the 
		conditional blessings of the atonement have this same character.&nbsp; We all 
		tend to have clear in our minds the blessings of the atonement that are 
		unconditional and may find it relatively easy to espouse faith in them.&nbsp; 
		But the blessings of the atonement that are conditional, that depend on 
		our actions, we often find challenging to understand and we sometimes 
		fail to put forth the work and effort required to obtain them, or even 
		understand them. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I hope that this afternoon, 
		we can better understand these conditional blessings  and that this 
		understanding will motivate and inspire us to actively work for and seek 
		after these blessings on a daily basis.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I think about the 
		conditional blessings of the atonement, I think of the invitations that 
		the Savior repeatedly extends to us through His prophets and the 
		scriptures.&nbsp; His is an invitation to act!&nbsp; And with that action comes a 
		promised blessing.&nbsp; Let me review a few of the many scriptures where the 
		Saviors invitation is extended:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give 
		you rest. (Matthew 11:28)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. (James 4:8) &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;Come unto me and your souls shall live.&nbsp; (D&amp;C 45:46) &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree. (Alma 
		5:34)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:.25in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;Come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you. (3 
		Nephi 12:24)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior extends the 
		invitation, and if we will act, the promised blessings will be ours  
		the blessings of peace, of His companionship, of Eternal life, of 
		receiving the love of God, and of being received by the Savior.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord Himself summarizes 
		these blessings of the atonement as peace in this world and Eternal 
		Life in the world to come. (D&amp;C 59:23.)&nbsp; That is, when we accept and 
		act on the Saviors invitation, He promises blessings now  in this life 
		 and blessing later  in the eternities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While we often focus on the 
		blessings of Eternal Life in the world to come  Id like to focus on 
		the nearer term promise  the promise of peace in this world.&nbsp; Let me 
		illustrate the desire, the need, and the challenge of that peace with 
		two simple examples.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first comes from our 
		experience in Boston where our family lived for 25 years.&nbsp; For almost a 
		decade of that time there was a construction project going on in 
		downtown Boston fondly referred to as the big dig.&nbsp; It entailed 
		putting all of the main traffic arteries underground, while keeping the 
		city running.&nbsp; Now those of you who know Boston will recall two 
		important facts about its roadways.&nbsp; One is that none of the streets are 
		at right angles  they basically follow the foot-paths laid out over 200 
		years ago.&nbsp; The other is that the airport is located on a site in Boston 
		Harbor so that all travel to and from the airport requires passing 
		through downtown Boston. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During the time of the big 
		dig I would often find myself going to or from the airport and asking, 
		I wonder what set of roads will get me there today.&nbsp; And of course the 
		answer was, it depends.&nbsp; One of the things I quickly learned was to 
		pay very close attention to the road signs and to those directing 
		traffic.&nbsp; When I didnt do so, Id invariably get lost and would have to 
		backtrack to get on the correct course again.&nbsp; I learned that 
		conscientiously following the invitation to turn left here or turn right 
		there had a great impact on my ability to get where I wanted to go 
		without getting sidetracked. &nbsp;As well see, obtaining the conditional 
		blessings of peace that the atonement offers likewise requires great 
		diligence and conscientiously responding to the promptings and guidance 
		given if we are to stay on course and take full advantage of the 
		blessings being offered.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second example Id like 
		to mention occurred when our daughter Mindys son was eight years old.&nbsp; 
		He posed one of those unique and insightful questions that those his age 
		often come up with.&nbsp; On the way to church one day, he asked his parents, 
		If doctors could invent a pill to do anything in the world, what do you 
		think the best pill would be?&nbsp; After a moments thought, Mindy 
		answered, How about a pill to make everyone be kind?&nbsp; To which her 
		husband Doug responded, Good plan, Satan.&nbsp; While they all laughed, it 
		highlighted the importance and challenge of this earthly experience and 
		the overarching significance of the Atonement in the Plan of our Loving 
		Father and His Son.<span style="font-size:14.0pt"> &nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In these next few minutes I 
		want to explore how coming to Christ and accepting His invitation to 
		act diligently and according to the guidance of His Spirit, brings the 
		promised blessings of Peace in this life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am grateful for the 
		Saviors love for me and my family, and the many times His peace has 
		blessed our lives.&nbsp; In reflecting on these numerous occasions Ive been 
		struck by four quite different conditions where by accepting His 
		invitation, pain and sadness have been replaced with peace and joy. 
		Please consider with me each of these four conditions in turn and the 
		atonements promised path to peace for each of them.<u> </u></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Atonements Blessings 
		of Peace</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>The first source of 
		sadness or roadblock to peace is that of our own sins and their 
		consequences.&nbsp; </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The scriptures make it clear 
		that sin leads to misery and pain, not joy and peace. (Alma 42:1; 2 
		Nephi 2:27.) &nbsp;Alma recounts the intensity of his personal suffering for 
		sin, by describing how he was racked with torment by the memory of 
		[his] many sins.&nbsp; But then as he accepted the Saviors invitation and 
		cried out to Him, that pain and even the memory of his sins was replaced 
		by the peace and joy promised by the Savior.&nbsp; Alma concludes with this 
		wonderful verse:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:117.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">And 
		oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was 
		filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain! &nbsp;(Alma 36:20.) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Such peace is one of the 
		great and wonderful blessings of the atonement.&nbsp; As we avail ourselves 
		of the Saviors invitation and fully repent of our own sins, pain and 
		guilt are replaced by joy and peace.&nbsp; If you are uncertain as to how to 
		begin, I would encourage you to reread President Clarks devotional of 
		two weeks ago and then visit with your Bishop.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of course one of the best 
		ways to sustain this type of promised peace is to strive to avoid sin 
		and to adopt standards for ourselves that will guide us to activities 
		that are uplifting and enriching and will help us avoid activities that 
		are demeaning and debasing.&nbsp; Even in Rexburg you will face such 
		challenges. &nbsp;When John Wesley went off to School in England in the early 
		1700s, he found himself suddenly beset by all sorts of temptations.&nbsp; He 
		wrote to his mother and asked her for advice.&nbsp; This loving, concerned 
		mother wrote back as follows:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:99.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Would you judge the lawfulness of pleasure, take this rule.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Whatever weakens your reason,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Whatever obscures your sense of God,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">THAT 
		IS SIN TO YOU, no matter how innocent it may seem in itself.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please dont let your life be 
		filled with sadness and pain as a consequence of sin.&nbsp; Accept the 
		Saviors invitation by exercising faith in Him unto repentance. &nbsp;By 
		doing this on a daily basis we can obtain the promised peace that comes 
		from knowing that our life conforms to His will and that we are 
		acceptable before Him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>A second source of sadness 
		or roadblock to peace is the consequence of the sins and shortcomings of 
		others.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The sins of others invariably 
		affect those around them.&nbsp; We often feel wronged, slighted or offended  
		because of the sins of others.&nbsp; Sometimes it may be something quite 
		insignificant  our roommate failed to clean up the kitchen, another 
		driver failed to signal when turning, or someone forgot our birthday  
		but other times the offense and its consequences can be very significant 
		 such as a child who suffers years of abuse, a young mother who 
		suddenly finds herself a single parent because of the choices of an 
		unfaithful husband, or those who lose loved ones in a tragedy like that 
		which occurred recently on the campus of Virginia Tech.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But the Atonement offers a 
		solution that can bring true peace in all such situations.&nbsp; The 
		Atonements solution is Forgiveness  leaving judgment and punishment to 
		the Lord  and in exchange receiving His peace.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord Himself declared 
		through the prophet Joseph Smith, Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye 
		ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his 
		trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in 
		him the greater sin.&nbsp; I the Lord will forgive whom I will forgive, but 
		of you it is required to forgive all men. &nbsp;(D&amp;C 64:9-10.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we follow this counsel, 
		we can have a great burden lifted from us, and in its place we can have 
		the peace promised by the Savior.&nbsp; Life is too short to not avail 
		ourselves of this blessing on a daily basis.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Such forgiveness not only 
		brings the promised blessings of peace, but it strengthens our faith in 
		the Savior.&nbsp; And as we feel His healing power in our own lives, we 
		naturally draw closer to Him.&nbsp; In my own case, I have had the blessings 
		of forgiveness again brought into sharp focus as I was preparing for 
		this devotional.&nbsp; For several years I had a business partner, in what I 
		thought was a successful business with a fixed limit on the financial 
		risk involved.&nbsp; Unbeknown to me, the business was not succeeding and my 
		partner was hiding the losses by inappropriately circumventing the loan 
		limits set by the bank.&nbsp; This all came to light after we returned from 
		our mission, and we found ourselves suddenly having a loan called by the 
		bank that was five times what we had thought possible.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You can imagine the lack of 
		peace my wife and I suddenly felt!&nbsp; For a few weeks, we were extremely 
		distraught.&nbsp; It was hard to think about anything else.&nbsp; But through a 
		series of invitations from the Lord, that experience became a wonderful 
		blessing as sadness and frustration were replaced by faith and peace.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At the time, I was not 
		thinking of forgiveness.&nbsp; I was thinking of survival.&nbsp; But Im grateful 
		that the Lord knew and loved us and was willing to guide us.&nbsp; First He 
		inspired faithful friends to offer special Priesthood blessings.&nbsp; 
		Second, He helped me find a lawyer, an accountant, and an operating 
		manager who could represent us until we could sell the business.&nbsp; Third, 
		He made it possible for us to quickly sell a long term investment and 
		pay the partnership debt without losing our home or retirement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fourth 
		and finally, at the meeting where we settled our debt to the bank, the 
		Lord revealed to me what would happen to my partner and his family if I 
		did not take full responsibility for the debt and allow my former 
		partner to continue fulfilling his duties as a husband and father.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With so many blessings from 
		the Lord, I felt my heart softening and could see myself offering to 
		fully forgive my former partner without delay, and experience even 
		greater peace.&nbsp; That all happened three years ago.&nbsp; Since then we have 
		periodically heard from the wonderful wife of this former partner, and 
		each time have felt that special peace of knowing we have done what the 
		Savior would have us do.&nbsp; In a recent letter from this dear mother, 
		devoted wife, and daughter of God, we were again reminded of how 
		grateful we were for the promptings of the Lord in that situation and 
		that we acted on those.&nbsp; And it was indeed acting on them that brought 
		such a sense of peace.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In this life each of us will 
		inevitably find ourselves offended or injured, often repeatedly, because 
		of the shortcomings or sins of others. The atonements answer is freely 
		forgiving and in turn receiving the promised blessings of peace and the 
		quiet assurance that we have done as the Lord would have us do.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>A third source of sadness 
		or roadblock to peace is that of circumstance which so often accompanies 
		this mortal existence.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Such circumstances of 
		mortality include those afflictions common to man[kind] (1 Corinthians 
		10:13) such as challenges of health, finances, loneliness, and all the 
		other vicissitudes that attend life on this earth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Atonement gives us a 
		solution.&nbsp; That solution is agency  we are free to act or be acted 
		upon.&nbsp; (2 Nephi 2:13.)&nbsp; We can decide how we will respond to 
		circumstance and the Savior will assist us in enduring and overcoming 
		whatever that circumstance may be. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The daily choices we make  
		as to how we will act or react to our circumstances  have a profound 
		impact on our whole outlook on life.&nbsp; President Hinckley has summarized 
		the impact of such choices in this way:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">The 
		longer I live, the more I realize the impact of <i>attitude </i>on 
		life.&nbsp; Attitude, to me, is more important than the past, than education, 
		than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what 
		other people think or say or do.&nbsp; It is more than appearance, 
		giftedness, or skill.&nbsp; It will make or break a companya churcha home.&nbsp; 
		The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the 
		attitude we will embrace for that day.&nbsp; We cannot change the pastwe 
		cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way.&nbsp; We cannot 
		change the inevitable.&nbsp; The only thing we can do is play on the one 
		string we have, and that is our attitude<i>I am convinced that life is 
		10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it.&nbsp; And so it is with 
		youwe are in charge of our attitudes</i>.&nbsp; (Attitude, by 
		Charles R. Swindoll.)&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:117.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to having a good 
		attitude, we also need to trust the Lord and His purposes.&nbsp; Sometimes 
		the circumstances we each encounter may be to show forth the power of 
		God and His Priesthood.&nbsp; At other times the circumstances may be for our 
		individual tutoring and growth.&nbsp; Or perhaps such circumstance may be to 
		help us be more humble and to build our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
		Whatever the purpose, as Alma and his people learned, often the Lord 
		gives us the strength to bear our burdens rather than lifting them from 
		us. (Mosiah 24:14.) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:99.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we recognize the Lords 
		hand in our circumstances, we better understand the nature of the peace 
		the Savior promises.&nbsp; As he told His disciples during His earthly 
		ministry, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the 
		world giveth, give I unto you.&nbsp; Let not your heart be troubled, neither 
		let it be afraid. (John 14:27.) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During this past December I 
		again observed the magnitude of the Saviors peace in such a 
		circumstance, in connection with the passing of my wifes father, John 
		Steele.&nbsp; Although he was 96 and had lived a wonderful life, for his wife 
		and his close knit family it would have been a time of significant 
		sadness and pain without the atonement.&nbsp; But through the blessings of 
		the atonement, the family was able to experience the promised peace, in 
		spite of the inevitable feelings of loneliness and loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Whatever our circumstances in 
		this life  be they sickness, financial misfortune, or any of the other 
		challenges that accompany mortality  through the exercise of our 
		agency, the atonements promised blessings of peace can be ours. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>The fourth source of 
		sadness or roadblock to peace is, the myth of mortal perfection.&nbsp; </i>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The world tells us, you can 
		do anything you put your mind to, you can have it all.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is simply 
		not true!&nbsp; You cannot do everything.&nbsp; That is not why the Lord sent us 
		to this earth.&nbsp; This myth of perfectionism results in part from the 
		prideful notion of self-sufficiency.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:99.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Atonements answer to 
		this hindrance to peace is Grace  the Grace of Christ.&nbsp; In the 
		scriptures, grace refers primarily to the enabling power and spiritual 
		healing offered through the mercy and love of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The Lord 
		promises us that if we humble ourselves before Him and have faith in 
		Him, His grace will help us overcome all of our personal weaknesses. 
		(Ether 12:27.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Stephen L. Richards 
		(of the First Presidency) counseled that coming to Christ requires 
		coming out of the world to a higher place.&nbsp; To do so, he said we must 
		forsake the philosophy of self-sufficiency, which is the philosophy of 
		the world, and adopt the philosophy of faith, which is the philosophy of 
		Christ.&nbsp; [We] must substitute Faith [in Christ] for self-sufficiency. (<i>Improvement 
		Era</i>, April, 1935) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Nephi warned us of the 
		consequences of such self-sufficiency when he said, Cursed is he that 
		putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto 
		the precepts of men (2 Nephi 28:31)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We dont need to be perfect 
		before the Savior steps in, we just need to be striving and Hell make 
		up the difference  however great that might be.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has 
		taught that neither the unconditional nor the conditional blessings of 
		the atonement would be available to mankind except through the grace and 
		goodness of Christ.&nbsp; Obviously the unconditional blessings of the 
		atonement are unearned, but the conditional ones are also not fully 
		merited.&nbsp; They are always and ever a product of Gods grace. &nbsp;(The 
		Atonement of Jesus Christ, by Jeffrey R. Holland, and included in the 
		Encyclopedia of Mormonism.) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we put our trust in the 
		Lord and rely on Him, we turn from the worlds presumption of self 
		sufficiency and mortal perfection, and receive the blessings of Grace  
		the blessing of knowing that when we do our best and follow Him, He will 
		make up the inevitable shortfalls.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Conversion is Coming to 
		the Savior<br />
&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Gospel there is a word 
		for accepting the Saviors invitation to come unto Him, no matter what 
		the circumstance - that word is conversion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The atonement is not only the 
		events in the Garden of Gethsemane and on Calvary; it is a way of 
		viewing the world and everything in it.&nbsp; And coming to see and embrace 
		our life on earth in this way is what we call <i>conversion</i>. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ive learned much about 
		conversion from an assignment I received from Elder Richard G. Scott.&nbsp; 
		During a visit to London while we were serving there, he did not have 
		time to cover with our missionaries all that he had hoped.&nbsp;&nbsp; So before 
		departing, he gave me a copy of his notes on the topic of conversion and 
		asked that I make it the focus of our next zone conference, which of 
		course I did.&nbsp; In Elder Scotts notes was included the following: 
		&nbsp;Converted means to turn from one belief or course of action to 
		another.&nbsp; Conversion is a spiritual and moral change.&nbsp; Converted implies 
		not merely mental acceptance of Jesus and His teachings but also a 
		motivating faith in Him and His gospel  a faith which works a 
		transformation, and an actual change in ones understanding of lifes 
		meaning and in his allegiance to God in interest, in thought, and in 
		conduct.&nbsp; (Elder Richard G. Scott, England London Mission Conference, 
		2003.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we accept the Saviors 
		invitation and align ourselves with Him in interest, in thought and in 
		conduct we become converted.&nbsp; And with that comes the promised blessing 
		of Jehovah, Whoso hearkeneth unto me, shall dwell safely, and shall be 
		quiet from fear of evil. (Proverbs 1:33.) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would invite each of us to 
		evaluate our own lives and ask, do we view the potential roadblocks and 
		hindrances to peace as the world views them?&nbsp; Or do we approach those 
		situations through the power of the atonement?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, do we daily feel and 
		recognize,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">The

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Second, do we daily

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">The

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Third, do we daily feel and

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">The 
		peace that comes from turning to the Lord as we face challenges and 
		burdens related to circumstances beyond our control</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And, fourth, do we daily 
		experience,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">The 
		peace that comes from knowing we dont have to be perfect.&nbsp; That through 
		the Grace of Christ, He will make up the inevitable shortfall.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is indeed the good 
		news of the Gospel. &nbsp;This is the perfect brightness of hope the 
		Savior promises to those who accept His invitation to come. (2 Nephi 
		31:20)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me close with my 
		testimony of the power of the atonement and the truthfulness of His 
		promises.&nbsp; I know that the Savior died so that we might live, and have 
		life more abundantly.&nbsp; I know that the atonement has all power  to 
		sanctify us, to lift our burdens and to replace sadness and despair with 
		joy and peace.&nbsp; It has done so repeatedly for me and for my family.&nbsp; I 
		cannot imagine life without these daily blessings.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I also know that our Father 
		in Heaven and His Son are pleased when we more fully accept and avail 
		ourselves of the infinite and priceless blessings of the atonement.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And because the Lord Himself 
		has promised it, I know with complete assurance that these are only the 
		beginning of the blessings that He has in store for each of us  for you 
		and me  and for all of His children who accept His invitation.&nbsp; It is 
		my hope and prayer that on a daily basis we will all diligently seek to 
		obtain the blessings of the atonement  the promised blessings of 
		peace.&nbsp; And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; </font></p>

<font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">What 
					can we learn about handling temptation from the scriptures? 
					A good place to start is in the beginning with Adam and Eve. 
					We read about their temptations in the third chapter of 
					Genesis. Notice that Satan beguiled Eve by telling her: &quot;Ye 
					shall not surely die&quot; (Genesis 3:3) by partaking of the 
					forbidden fruit. He continued by describing the fruit as 
					good and pleasant to the eyes, and that it would make her 
					wise. She ate of the fruit and subsequently Adam also gave 
					in to temptation by partaking of the fruit. </span></font>

						thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto 
						thee&quot; (Moses 3: 17). Fortunately, Satan &quot;knew not the 
						mind of God&quot; (Moses 4:6) thinking he was destroying the 
						world. Rather, he played into God's hands. The results 
						were that &quot;Eve ... was glad, saying: Were it not for our

					Adam and Eve did not discuss their dilemma with the Lord, we 
					can only speculate as to what His counsel would have been.

<font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The 
					next major temptation was to Cain. Again, he listened to 
					Satan, not to God. The scriptures tell us he &quot;loved Satan 
					more than God&quot; (Moses 5: 18). He exclaimed: &quot;Who is the Lord 
					that I should know him?&quot; (Moses 5:16) It was Satan that 
					commanded him to make an offering to the Lord, so he made an 
					offering that seemed acceptable on its face, but he did it 
					for entirely wrong reasons. T. S. Eliot observed: &quot;the 
					greatest treason&quot; is &quot;To do the right deed for the wrong 
					reason&quot; (&quot;Murder in the Cathedral [1935], pt. I) and that is 
					what Cain did. Then he was angy because God had respect to 
					Abel and his offering, but not to his offering. Why? Cain's 
					offering was not just insincere, it was an attempt to 
					deceive and delude God. His offering mocked God. The lesson 
					we learn is to do the right thing for the right reason and 
					to respect our Heavenly Father in all we do. </span></font>

					next take a look at the temptation that befell Joseph, the 
					son of Jacob. We remember how his brothers sold him into 
					slavery in Egypt where his character and ability led to his 
					appointment as captain of the guard for Potiphar, his 
					master. Things went well for him at first as he gained trust 
					and favor. Eventually he was entrusted with virtually 
					everything for his master. Then came the temptation. 
					Potiphar's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and came to him

					that his master entrusted him with everything, except his 
					wife. &quot;Can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&quot; 
					(Genesis 39:5) was his reply. Day by day she continued her 
					temptation, but he wouldn't listen to her or lie with her. 
					He refused to even be with her. Then she caught him by the 
					garment as he fled from her and held his garment in her 
					hands. Thus spurned, she took revenge against him using his 
					garment as evidence that he had forced her into intimacy. He 
					ended up in prison. We remember that the story had a happy 
					ending, beyond his wildest comprehension. </span></font></p>

					to go forth to battle with their troops. Thus he tarried in 
					Jerusalem instead of doing his kingly duty. While he was 
					walking on the roof of his palace, having everything of a

					against every law and commandment God had given to Israel. 
					Things then turned from bad to worse. She conceived and sent 
					word to him: &quot;I am with child&quot; (2 Samuel 11 :5). He tried to 
					cover his grievous sins and committed worse ones. He sent 
					for Uriah to come home so he could say the child was Uriah's, 
					but Uriah was so loyal and virtuous that he refused to even 
					be with his wife and slept at the door of the king. David's 
					next and even greater sin was to send Uriah to the front 
					with the command to send him into the hottest battle. 
					Predictably Uriah was killed. Now to the sins of lust, 
					adultery, and deceit was added the sin of murder. It all 
					started with a temptation he didn't handle, then with

<p align="center">&nbsp; ____________________________________________________</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it's a pleasure to spend a few moments with you. This is a remarkable time to be part of Brigham Young University-Idaho, and I would like to share some thoughts about the university and its divinely appointed purpose.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prophetic vision guides BYU-Idaho in the fulfillment of its institutional mission, which is to prepare young people for the marvelous work the Lord has in store for them. I believe two companion principles define our mission: discipleship and leadership. These principles will help prepare BYU-Idaho students for their roles in the Lord's kingdom and in the world.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The development of "disciple-leaders" is the focus of every aspect of BYU-Idaho. It is crucial that we all remember we are pursuing this mission in the 21st Century. At BYU-Idaho, we are developing generations of disciple-leaders for the world, and for the Church in the dispensation of the fullness of times.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>
</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I'd like to begin our discussion by looking at a framework that pulls together the key dimensions of the foundation and character of BYU-Idaho. At a time when so much is changing, it is critical we understand those things that must not be changed. This framework defines the enduring aspects of the university that will allow us to always realize the prophetic vision and the mission of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The framework is defined by a circle representing the great whole of the university. The image of a circle reinforces the university's connected nature. It underscores the fact that each of the elements is designed to work with the others in an integrated way.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>
</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">At the very center of the framework is Student Honor. Student Honor is a preparatory process at the heart of the university and the BYU-Idaho experience.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide1.png" border="1" alt="slide 1 student honor" width="285" height="214" /></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Student Honor encompasses our standards and guidelines, processes for education, and the university's system of discipline. Taken together, the whole experience teaches our students true principles, prepares them for the higher law and eternal covenants they will make, and protects them and the university.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide2.png" border="1" alt="slide 2 Key elements" width="285" height="214" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The first key element of Student Honor is the Code of Honor: the standards and principles common to all CES institutions. These include living a chaste and virtuous life, obeying the Word of Wisdom, being honest in our dealings with our fellow men, attending church, and living a Christ-like life. Other elements of Student Honor include the dress and grooming standards and housing guidelines. These help define the atmosphere where students live and study, and where employees work.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The purpose of Student Honor is both to prepare our students to be disciples of the Savior and to protect them and the university from evil. These standards are crucial to the BYU-Idaho experience. They apply to all of us. Exemplary, temple-worthy employees are also absolutely crucial to Student Honor. It is vital that the university, through the example of its employees, be a living model of the highest gospel standards. All employees should represent the Church, the university, and its divine mission to the students who look to them for guidance and direction.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide3.png" border="1" alt="slide 3 the Spirit of Ricks" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The core of Student Honor makes possible the very special spirit felt on this campus. That spirit which we call the Spirit of Ricks is on this campus because of the obedience and faithfulness of all who study and work here. I believe the Spirit of Ricks is the defining characteristic of this university.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide4.png" border="1" alt="slide 4 Spirit of Ricks details" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Elder David A. Bednar taught that the Spirit of Ricks is the ministry of the Holy Ghost and its attendant spiritual gifts. As a member of the Godhead, the mission of the Holy Ghost is to testify, to reveal, to comfort, to sanctify, and to strengthen. The ministry of the Holy Ghost brings wonderful feelings and tremendous blessings to the campus. It brings the gifts described in the scriptures to students and employees. These gifts include</p>
<p align="left">discernment, love and faith, kindness, charity. They include the capacity to teach with power and authority, the capacity to learn, love and serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide5.png" border="1" alt="slide 5 disciple preparation" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Spirit and honor are at the core of BYU-Idaho. They support and motivate the realization of our divine mission through disciple preparation, leadership development, and inspired learning and teaching. Let's look first at BYU-Idaho as a disciple preparation center.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In describing the university as a disciple preparation center, Elder Bednar gave inspired emphasis to BYU-Idaho's mission to prepare disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are many dimensions of the university that help our students become disciples of Christ. Let me review with you some of the most important:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide6.png" border="1" alt="slide disciple preparation details" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Obedience to the commandments of the Lord and to the standards and guidelines that define the framework of Student Honor is fundamental to discipleship. An environment of obedience is crucial to the development of disciples.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Disciples must come to know the Spirit. BYU-Idaho faculty members teach by the Spirit and thus help students learn not only the specific content of their courses, but also how to learn. Students learn to listen to the spirit of the Lord. They come to see and feel the Holy Ghost in their lives, teaching them and guiding them.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Of course, students have many opportunities to be instructed by the Spirit outside of class. We have wonderful wards and stakes of Zion on the campus. Weekly devotionals allow the university to gather and be instructed by the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is significant that we live and work near a temple. There students may enter into the presence of the Lord, obtain deeper understanding of the plan of salvation, and strengthen their commitment to eternal covenants. We are blessed by the presence of the temple in Idaho Falls, and soon we will have a temple right next to our campus. When the Rexburg Temple is complete and dedicated, we need to be prepared to fill that temple day and night.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In this context of obedience, the ministry of the Holy Ghost, and temple worship we work hard to help our students learn true principles that will help them establish Zion wherever they go. We prepare our students for discipleship in Zion by teaching and practicing the principles of sacrifice, unity, and love.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide7.png" border="1" alt="slide 8 leadership Development" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is our great privilege and our mission to prepare the wonderful students of BYU-Idaho to be disciples of the Savior and leaders in their homes, in the Church, and the world around them. Leadership development therefore is a critical partner to disciple preparation in the lives of our students. The leadership I have in mind is leadership with a small "L"; leadership in the home, the ward, the community, and the workplace. [Please</p>
<p align="left">note we have written discipleship and leadership in lowercase letters.]</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This effort follows the pattern of leadership the Savior taught to James and John in Matthew 20:25:</p>
<p align="left">"He called them unto Him and said, ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great, exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you. But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister and whosoever be chief among you let him be your servant. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered on to but to minister and give His life for ransom for many."</p>
<p align="left">The Savior is the great exemplar of small "L" leadership-leadership that serves and ministers, loves and supports, and blesses other people. This is the type of leadership we seek to develop in our students.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Our approach to leadership development centers on the student leadership model. In this approach we engage our students in active leadership with meaningful responsibility across the university. They are required to lead, direct, and move things forward in managing many of our programs and activities.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide8.png" border="1" alt="slide 8 examples of leadership development" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">There are many examples: let me mention just two. The best and largest example is the Student Activities Program, which offers a wide range of activities that are student led, student organized, and student run. The program includes activities in six areas: Social, Service, Talent, Outdoor, Fitness, and Sports. Thousands of students participate. Another example is the Heber J. Grant Program, which provides leadership opportunities and financial support to worthy young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and who have overcome those disadvantages to attend BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This student-led program involves mentoring and teaching and supporting the Heber J. Grant scholars in their work at BYU-Idaho. Approximately 1,000 students participate in the Heber J. Grant Program. But thanks to the great leadership capability of students who direct, organize, and teach, the program is overseen by a professional staff of only one administrator. Students who participate in this program have a tremendous experience.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">If we add to the Student Leadership Model the tremendous number of students involved in student employment and ward and stake callings, we begin to see the power of leadership development. In effect, BYU-Idaho is becoming a great leadership development process-thousands of students every year receive leadership training and leadership experience.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide9.png" border="1" alt="slide 9 inspired learning and teaching" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Learning by faith and teaching by the Spirit complete and perfect the circle of discipleship and leadership. At BYU-Idaho, students prepare for work and for life by engaging in an educational process defined by experiential and active learning where inspired faculty teach by the Spirit.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">We have placed inspired learning and teaching at the top of the diagram, completing the circle and giving it its integrity. Inspired learning and teaching is the symbolic keystone to the overall campus experience. It brings discipleship preparation and leadership development together into one great whole.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/images/070510EmployeeMtg/slide10.png" border="1" alt="slide 3 inspired learning and teaching explained" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Several elements of teaching and learning give BYU-Idaho its distinctive character. BYU-Idaho is a teaching-focused, student-centered university. This is a very unusual combination. Most universities are research-focused and faculty-centered. BYU-Idaho is not.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Small classes play a significant role in the feeling of intimacy our students experience, but I believe the most important element in creating that sense of belonging and connection is consecrated employees. Consecrated faculty, consecrated staff, and consecrated administrators-these are the people who love students and are committed to do the Lord's will and His work.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">At BYU-Idaho, we believe every employee is a teacher. This is not just rhetoric; it's a true statement. Students have a very intimate and powerful relationship with the faculty in their classes, but they also learn from and are influenced by our professional staff and administrators. We want everyone in this university to teach by example and by precept. Many students have their most important and powerful educational experiences through interaction with the employees of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The university's focus has a distinctive influence. Our approach to education is focused on preparing young people for work and for life. Many BYU-Idaho students go on to graduate school, which is a great blessing in their lives. But the university's primary focus is <em>not </em>preparing young people for graduate school; it is to prepare them for their future roles in the home, the Church, and the community.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Our experience has shown that if BYU-Idaho prepares students well for work and life by teaching them how to take responsibility, learn effectively, get things done, be appropriately confident in the Lord and humble about their own capability, they will be successful wherever they go-including those who choose to attend graduate school.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">We pursue this focus on work and life through a variety of active and experiential initiatives, including the internship program, practicums, and an emerging program within the university called Student Peer Instruction. BYU-Idaho is engaging students in a very powerful way in teaching one another. Over time, it will become apparent that the most powerful way for students to learn is for them to teach-they will teach to learn. In all these ways we pursue inspired learning and teaching that integrates disciple preparation and leadership development.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>
</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This framework captures the enduring, fundamental characteristics of BYU-Idaho: Student Honor and the Spirit of Ricks at the center - the spiritual heart of the university -&nbsp;with disciple preparation and leadership development fitting together through inspired learning and teaching.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I believe that as BYU-Idaho looks to the future, we must preserve and strengthen these&nbsp;elements. The university is in a time of great change. The Lord is preparing these young people for a very challenging world. Our students must be educated, developed, and prepared in a far more effective way than ever has been done before.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Now, I'd like to close by sharing with you an e-mail we received from the parents of a student. This family had a very profound experience with BYU-Idaho that I believe captures the essence of what this university is about. Here is their story:</p>
<p align="left">"We've felt the spirit of BYU-Idaho in many ways. When our oldest daughter came, we watched as she went from a social butterfly with little thought of grades to a serious student that loved BYU-Idaho. Thanks to wonderful teachers, she became inspired to pursue her degree in English and minor in Secondary Education. She not only accomplished her goal but managed to graduate in just three years - quite a transformation from a girl who didn't like to open a book.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"Our son then came to BYU-Idaho. He had struggled with his testimony for many years and was for the most part quite difficult. He had difficulty following rules and lacked direction. While on campus one time when both of our children were there, I noticed how so many of the professors would greet my daughter by name. Very impressive, but not shocking. She was an easy one to like. I then observed that just as many professors were greeting my son and even hugging him. That was amazing. The professors at BYU-Idaho truly love their students.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"My son still continued to struggle into his second year and subsequent summer at home. After much prayer and fasting, he made the decision to go back to BYU-Idaho. His main reason was his love of his bishop. His bishop stood by him, and he made it back to BYU-Idaho in the winter of 2006. Our son loved basketball, and the intramural teams were what he lived for. To be able to finish class and then play ball was the best. His school work improved. His outlook improved, and his spirit soared. He was anxiously working on sending in his papers for his mission in December.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"Our next experience with BYU-Idaho is very tender and sweet to us. In the summer of 2006 while attending Summer Semester, our son went tubing and drowned. In our sorrow and grief, BYU-Idaho was extraordinary. They helped us meet with the boys that were with him so we might all find comfort together. They cared for our needs as we cleaned his apartment and took care of his affairs. Above this, they sent the word out to the student body. We were overwhelmed with the support and love from these students. Students that had known him in his first year came to visit us. It was truly beautiful to know that your child was so loved by his peers.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"The administration and the public affairs department went above and beyond. They compiled a book of all the students' memories and thoughts, found us his jersey, signed a basketball with his current team, and much more. We were so touched by their tenderness and their care. We flew out a week later for a memorial on campus that the university arranged, and we marveled that we could have been so blessed to have had him attend this campus.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"You will never know what peace it has brought to our hearts to know just how much our son was loved by those at BYU-Idaho. From his peers to his professors, his bishop, even his landlord, all helped us to feel the spirit of BYU-Idaho. We are grateful to have the opportunity to feel the great spirit that exists here on this campus. And look forward to enjoying this experience again with others of our children."</p>
<p align="left">Brothers and sisters, this <em>is </em>BYU-Idaho. This is what we do. I believe the experience of that young man and his family is a microcosm of what this university is about. It's an expression of very deep and powerful principles taught by the Savior in 3 Nephi, Chapter 18. In verses 24 and 25, Christ teaches:</p>
<p align="left">Brothers and sisters, please notice these key words: "come," "feel," and "see." The Savior commands us to let our light and His light shine, so that others may come unto Him, feel Him, and see Him among us. This is what disciples do. This is what we want our students to learn to be.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">As we look forward to the great work that lies ahead for BYU-Idaho, I pray we may see these verses of 3 Nephi as a great mandate, both individually and collectively. I believe what the Savior taught there applies to this university-His university. I believe He wants BYU-Idaho to be a light unto the world; a place that exemplifies Him in its work, in its spirit and everything it does.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I believe He wants BYU-Idaho to be a great temple of learning through disciple preparation, the development of leaders, and inspired learning and teaching. We must invite all who come here to come unto Him, so they might feel His love, His mercy, and His grace, and become true disciples. We must live our lives so that all who come here might comprehend the light, and receive the blessings of knowledge, wisdom, power, and</p>
<p align="left">salvation He desires to give them. I know this is what the Lord desires for them and for us. And I pray that all of us - no matter what we do or what our assignment is - will take this great charge to heart.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I bear witness to you with all the energy of my soul that He lives. Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ. He is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. He is the living Son of the living God. This is His church and His kingdom, and this is His university. I bear witness to you of my own experience that the heavens are open and that the Lord Jesus Christ is in charge. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		These amazing students volunteered eight hours of hard work every day

		During World Ward II my husband was a young 18-year-old sailor in the 
		U.S. Navy. He was stationed as a signalman on an attack troop transport 
		ship in the South Pacific. His post was 75 feet above the water line. As 
		a signalman during war time he learned a lot about the value of a strong 
		ship, about the importance of manning your post, knowing the signals, 
		having constant communication with command headquarters, and certainly 
		the power of prayer. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		He tells of a very dark, stormy night when security and safety for 
		everyone on board was of major concern. There could be no light outside 
		the shipnot even the light of a matchthat could attract the enemy, and 
		give away their location. That night, horrendous waves were pounding 
		against the side of the ship, causing it to list at a 45-degree angle, 
		almost enough to capsize the ship. In the turbulence of this storm, 
		Heber, on the top deck, lost his footing and went sliding on his back 
		toward the outer edge of the ship. Holding both arms high in the air and 
		with a fervent prayer in his heart, he hoped to save himself by catching 
		the two iron chains surrounding the deck before being swept overboard. 
		At that moment the ship reversed its pitch and he started sliding in the 
		other direction and fortunately, was able to regain his footing. </font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		When I first heard Heber relate this breath-taking experience, I was 
		taken back in my mind to the message given at my high school graduation 
		by Elder Oscar A. Kirkham, one of the Presidents of the Seventy of the 
		Church at that time. I recall just three statements he made that seem 
		even more relevant today. I can hear his voice clearly in my mind as he 
		said: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Build a 
			seaworthy ship; <br />
			Be a loyal shipmate; and <br />
			Sail a true course.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">My young 
		friendsas you knowwe are living in the last gospel dispensation. Satan 
		has marshaled all of his forces for his final pre-millennial struggle in 
		an attempt to win us to his ranks, whatever the cost. It is not hard to 
		see that the conflict is escalating. We see evidence of evil power 
		everywhere trying to popularize dishonesty and immorality by promoting 
		the belief that not only do we have freedom to choose, but there will be 
		no accountability for the consequences of our choices. The good news is 
		that you were reserved, and held back to come forth at this time. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		You must have earned a high level of trust when you consider that this 
		time has been referred to as the winding up scenes before the Second 
		Coming of our Savior. Prophets have said, God has reserved spirits for 
		this dispensation who have the courage and determination to face all the 
		powers of the evil one, visible and invisible (Cannon, George Q., 
		Gospel Truth, Vol. 1, p. 21). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		In the October 2003 General Conference, President Hinckley, speaking to 
		the youth, repeated what we have heard before, You are the best 
		generation we have ever had (November 2003, Ensign, p. 84). You have a 
		foreordained station to man and a battle to win.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Today, I say to 
		each one of you with an assurance that I feel deep within that: </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">You have it 
			within you to build a seaworthy ship; <br />
			You have it within you to be a loyal shipmate; <br />
			You have it within you to sail a true course. <br />
			First of all, build a seaworthy ship. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">You will 
		remember from the Book of Mormon that young Nephi was commanded to build 
		a ship. He had never built one before, and the support from his brothers 
		was not exactly encouraging. They began murmuring against him, Our 
		brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he 
		also thinketh that he can cross these great waters (I Nephi 17:17). You 
		remember Nephi was born in Jerusalem. What would he know about building 
		a ship? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		But Nephi was attuned to the voice of the Lord. The Lord said, Thou 
		shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, (I 
		Nephi 17:8) and . . . I will prepare the way before you, if it so be 
		that ye shall keep my commandments . . .  (I Nephi 17:13). In 
		partnership with the Lord, Nephi built a ship and crossed the great 
		waters with his family. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Noah was commanded to build an ark of gopher wood. We read, Thus did 
		Noah: according to all that God commanded him, so did he (Genesis 
		6:22). Noah heard the voice of the Lord, and his people were 
		protectedsafe in the ark until the waters subsided. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Now let us learn from the brother of Jared. The Lord came to him in a 
		cloud and spoke to him for three hours chastening him because he had not 
		remembered to pray and call upon the Lord for guidance. And the Lord 
		said, Go to work and build the barges according to the instructions of 
		the Lord (see Ether 2:16). He was obedient and followed the Lords 
		directions. Now, wouldnt you expect smooth sailing without a storm? 
		Lets see what happens. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		We read that a ferocious wind began to blow; they were many times buried 
		in the depth of the sea; great and terrible were the tempests caused by 
		the fierceness of the wind. But no monster of the sea could break them, 
		neither whale that could mare them; they did have light continually 
		whether it was above the water or underneath; the wind continued to blow 
		until they finally set their feet on the shores of the promised land 
		(see Ether 6:710). Then we read, and they did shed tears of joy before 
		the Lord because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them . . . 
		(see Ether 6:12). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		The fierceness of those winds were among the mercies. Afflictions shall 
		be for thy gain. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Nephi, Noah, and the brother of Jared each heard the voice of the Lord 
		in their time and circumstance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		This is your time. Your circumstance is different from the ancient 
		prophets, and will be different from the person sitting next to you, but 
		what is the same is that you too, can hear the voice of the Lord. Yea, 
		behold the Lord says, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, 
		by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in 
		your heart (D&amp;C 8:2). <br />
		I have two suggestions for your consideration in building a seaworthy 
		ship. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		First, look inside yourself. In the novel, The Chosen by Chaim Potok, 
		the Jewish father cries out to the master of the universe in behalf of 
		his son who has a brilliant mind. The father says, A mind like that I 
		need for a son? A heart I need for my son. A soul I need for a son. 
		Compassion I want for my son. Righteousness, mercy, strength to suffer 
		and carry pain. That is what I want for my son. Not a mind without a 
		soul. The son speaking of his father says, He taught me to look inside 
		myself in company with my soul. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		He was probably saying, Son, it is within you? Walk around inside 
		yourself. Avoid the popular trend of compromising principles, justifying 
		behavior, rationalizing and giving way to pressures and at the same time 
		giving away all that you hold dear. That is not who you are! </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		On Wednesday, May 22nd, 1974, the Salt Lake Tribune carried an article 
		about a Mr. Jeb Magruder, who had been sentenced to serve in a federal 
		prison for his part in the Watergate scandal in Washington, D.C. 
		Appearing before the judge, Magruder was quoted as saying, By now I 
		know what I have done and Your Honor knows what I have done. Then he 
		gave this very sobering confession, My ambition obscured my judgment 
		and I lost my ethical compass. When the pressure is on and opportunity 
		seems to be knocking, rationalization can become an enemy that can sink 
		a ship. Looking inside ourselves with a sense of who we are as sons and 
		daughters of God, and remembering the covenants we have made that binds 
		both us to the Lord and He to us, makes for a safe tripeven in enemy 
		territory. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		The second suggestion in building a seaworthy ship is best learned from 
		President N. Eldon Tanner who served as a counselor to four Presidents 
		of the church, and was honored as a Giant in our City, by the Salt 
		Lake Chamber of Commerce. He was known far and wide internationally as a 
		man of integrity. One time, speaking in general conference he told of a 
		lesson he learned from his father. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		You know when I was a young man my father pointed his finger at me and 
		said, Young man, I want you to realize that this world is divided into 
		two great groups. You and the rest of the world. And he was serious 
		about it and he made me feel serious about it before we were finished 
		talking. His father continued, Regardless of what the world does it 
		cannot save you, and regardless of what the world does, it cannot 
		destroy you. It is what YOU do yourself that determines whats going to 
		happen (1986 Semi-annual Conference). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I say that same thing to each of you today. While our intentions may be 
		positive, it ultimately is our actions that measure the safety and 
		reliability of our ship. Integrity is learning to make our actions 
		consistent with our knowledge of right and wrong. Let us say with Job,  
		. . . till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me (Job 27:5). 
		Like Job, you have it within you to build a seaworthy ship. <br />
		Now lets talk about BEING A LOYAL SHIPMATE. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		A loyal shipmate will stay the course, resist the temptations of Satan 
		and, when needed, make course corrections as prompted by the Holy Ghost. 
		President Hinckley reminds us, There is no greater blessing that can 
		come into our lives than the companionship of the Holy Ghost (Teachings 
		of Gordon B. Hinckley, SLC DB 1997, p. 259). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		While many today are being swept overboard by the storms of evil for the 
		want of an ethical compass, you are called to be a dependable, 
		trustworthy, alert signalmen to stay your post, regain your footing 
		quickly (if ever you lose it), and help point the way for others who 
		will follow. Hopefully you already know that what often appears as 
		freedom to do whatever you want, is a camouflage for enslavement. And if 
		the storms are not enough, you know to beware of pirates! Forces with 
		malicious intent will attempt to board your ship and, if possible, rob 
		you of your treasures, your peace of mind, your clear conscience, your 
		freedom, your integrity, your morality, even your eternal destiny, and 
		leave you shipwrecked, washed up. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I cannot overemphasize the guidance and strength that comes from 
		pondering, meditating, and going to the mountain often as Nephi did. We 
		read that he sat pondering. How often do we turn off the television, 
		put aside our cell phones, palm pilots, computers, and turn off the 
		noise of the world to just ponder? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		On occasion when we conduct a privateand sometimes soberinginterview 
		with ourselves, we recognize the disordering of our priorities and the 
		over-programming of our lives. To be loyal to ourselves, and to the 
		Lord, we must seriously ponder our priorities and how we use our time. I 
		believe the adversary would, if possible, try to keep us busily engaged 
		in a multitude of thingseven good thingsif it would distract us from 
		the few things that make all the difference. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		We read that when Nephi sat pondering, an angel of the Lord came to him 
		and asked, What desirest thou? Would you be prepared to respond to 
		that question if an angel asked of you, what desirest thou? We are 
		mortal, we have many desires, but when we take the time to ponder the 
		course of our life, meditate and ask thoughtful, heartfelt questions, 
		the spirit will speak to us. There will come into your heart and soul 
		promptings that help clarify your highest priorities. You will find 
		yourself seeking direction, then planning with a purpose, praying with 
		purpose, and then taking time to listen to the whisperings of the still 
		small voice. Alma tells his son Helaman to Counsel with the Lord in ALL 
		thy doings and he will direct thee for good . . . (Alma 37:37). I have 
		found this to be so true. Please make time to ponder. <br />
		A loyal shipmate is very familiar with the power of prayer. We begin our 
		prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. He invites us to ask, ask. 
		We read in the Bible Dictionary that God is already willing to grant 
		blessings for ourselves and others, but these blessings are conditional 
		upon our asking for them (see Bible Dictionary, p. 753). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		President Hinckley knows the blessings that come from prayer. He tells 
		us, Get on your knees every morning and night talking to your Father in 
		Heaven concerning your feelings in your heart and the desires of your 
		minds in righteousness. When all is said and done there is no power on 
		earth like the power of prayer. Prayer keeps the channel of 
		communication open. We can talk AND we can listen. <br />
		My husband and I learned an important lesson while we were in the 
		mission field about the blessing of being able to hear and the concern 
		when you cant hear. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Because Hebers station in the Navy was right next to two huge artillery 
		guns that were fired frequentlyand not having ear protection in those 
		dayshis hearing began to deteriorate. This deterioration has 
		accelerated over the years. Todaywithout the benefit of hearing aids 
		with a large amplifier over each earhe is almost totally deaf. My niece 
		asked me how I whisper sweet things to him at the end of the day when he 
		has removed his hearing aids. I tell her I shout, I love you, and he 
		can read my lips. I believe there are many times our Father in Heaven 
		might be shouting to us along our journey as well, saying I love you, 
		but because of all the road noise, the loud music and the distractions 
		to our mind, the message cant get through. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		During our mission we had an unusual experience while on our way to a 
		zone conference. While traveling in an unfamiliar heavily-wooded area, 
		both of the batteries in Hebers hearing aids died at the same time. 
		That had never happened before. I could speak to him but he could not 
		hear me. He could speak to me but there was no two-way conversation. Can 
		you imagine what an anxious feeling of isolation that was? What if we 
		could never talk to each other or hear each other and be in 
		communication with each other again. Tears filled my eyes as I prayed. 
		Fortunately, as we drove in silence through the wooded area, we spotted 
		a small convenience store. There we were able to get new batteries, and 
		open up our line of communication again. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		A loyal shipmate will keep the batteries charged by renewing sacred 
		covenants each week during sacrament meeting, as well as attending the 
		temple regularly. What a wonderful blessing you will have when this 
		beautiful Rexburg temple is completed and ready for you to visit often 
		to remember the covenants you have made and increase your understanding 
		of the blessings that can be found nowhere else. <br />
		And now last but not least, YOU HAVE IT WITHIN YOU TO SAIL A TRUE 
		COURSE. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I believe many of the so-called storms in our lives are customized for 
		our individual growth. We can expect tests at the point where we are 
		most vulnerable. It may relate to pride, or envy, need for approval at 
		all cost, or addictions which creep in like tiny termites, never noticed 
		until the destruction is done. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Sailing a true course is dependent on at least two very critical 
		principles while in this turbulent sea we are on. It was King Benjamin 
		in one of his last addresses who gave this final warning, And finally, 
		I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there 
		are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them. But 
		this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your 
		thoughts . . . even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish . . . (Mosiah 
		4:2930). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I believe we perish when we lose the spirit. It should not be surprising 
		that in our day of advancing technology, the most deadly and destructive 
		tools of the adversary, the enemy, has to do with pornography and drugs, 
		and all the related evils that would actually change our course, our 
		direction, and our destination. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		In the book, As a Man Thinketh. we read, In the armory of thought, man 
		forges the weapons by which he destroys himself (Putman, James Allen, 
		As a Man Thinketh, p. 5 ). That is sobering. But if our hearts and minds 
		become filled with love, or . . . full of love . . . (Mosiah 3:19), we 
		will set our sail for our final destination without detours. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		The Savior, before leaving his earthly ministry and finalizing his 
		teachings that would provide the signs and signals to stay the course, 
		spoke of love. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one 
		another as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this 
		shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to 
		another (John 13:3435). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		As we strive to sail a true course and make course correctionsas 
		directed by the spiritwe learn as we go, sometimes in remarkable, 
		unexpected ways. It may even take a crisis to help us change our 
		thinking. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Let me explain a hard lesson I learned during the third year of our 
		mission. Very unexpectedly, Heber was rushed to the local hospital in 
		Richmond, British Columbia with what the doctors diagnosed as a 
		life-threatening condition. A virus was attacking the valves of his 
		heart. As he was wheeled into a hospital room on a gurney, I followed 
		close behind praying every step of the way. There in the room was a very 
		sick man sitting on the edge of the other bed. He looked emaciated. His 
		eyes appeared to be crossed, his mouth was drooping, and his gown was 
		off his shoulder revealing dark tattoos down both arms. I immediately 
		turned my back. I didnt like the feeling I had. He looked to me like a 
		man who had made a lot of wrong choices. My thoughts told me I didnt 
		want to be in that room with him. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		As soon as Heber was settled with medication that relieved the pain and 
		put him to sleep, I took a seat in a folding chair and began pouring out 
		my heart pleading with the Lord for my husbands complete recovery. In 
		my anguish I thought I heard the words, You reach out to others and 
		Ill take care of you. I immediately reflected on our total commitment 
		to the missionaries, the members, the nonmembers, the investigators, and 
		asked myself, what more can I do? Again the whisperings of the spirit, 
		you reach out to others and Ill take care of you. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I found myself turning to look again at the old man with the tattoos. 
		Could he possibly be one of the others I wondered? I was prompted to 
		get him a drink in a little paper cup. He thanked me and seemed 
		appreciative. Later I took him a second drink. This time I had the Book 
		of Mormon in my hand. He asked me about the book. When I told him it was 
		the Book of Mormon he stumbled over his words admitting that he used to 
		be a Mormon and asked if he could borrow it when I was through. When I 
		handed the book to the patient he reached for it like a hungry man would 
		reach for food, maybe remembering that it contained the bread of life.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I went back to my chair and found myself praying for the old man. When 
		the night nurse came in he said to her in his muffled voice, get the 
		big chair at the end of the hall. The nurse explained, Oh Mr. Kapp is 
		much too sick. He will not be getting up tonight. The man insisted. 
		Get the big chair. The nurse wheeled in the big chair and he said 
		pointing to me, its for her. Can you believe that in his hour of 
		struggle he was thinking of my comfort? I went once more to get him a 
		drink of water, the only thing I could think to do in appreciation for 
		his kindness. This time when I returned to the big chair he had arranged 
		for my comfort, things were different. Not with the brother in the bed 
		close by, but within me. He looked different than before. His eyes 
		looked very tired but not crossed, and his speech was slow, but not 
		slurred. And in an amazing way I realized that the tattoos, which had 
		been so offensive to me, were not the ones on his arms but the ones in 
		my heart. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		During the long night I continued praying for Heber and also my new 
		friend. In the process, I experienced a healing. Not physical, but 
		spiritual. In the morning the curtain that had been drawn around the 
		patients bed was opened and the bed was empty. He had passed away 
		during the night. I realized in soberness that one of his last acts was 
		for my comfort. Into my mind came the words of Elder Maxwell, Empathy 
		at a time of agony is part of divinity. I realized then that this 
		brothers concern for me, was more Christ like than my first judgment of 
		him. I asked myself, why did I just loan him the book, why didnt I 
		offer to read to him? But that opportunity was gone. I felt a love for 
		this man, my brother, who had concern for my comfort when he was in need 
		himself. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I related this experience to a group of sisters in the northern part of 
		the province. When the closing prayer was given by someone who had been 
		labeled, less active, she closed in a tone of deep emotion with these 
		words, Oh God, help us to love one another and look past each others 
		tattoos. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		When we put off the natural man and become a saint through the 
		atonement of Christ, we will have love in our hearts. Not only in our 
		hearts but we will be full of love. With that love we will be filled 
		with the spirit. And by the spirit we will know when we are on course 
		and even more importantly, we will be prompted when we are not, and by 
		the spirit we will be guided to make course corrections along the way.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		As storms of evil continue to increase during these perilous times of 
		which the Apostle Paul spoke, I hear in my mind the words to a hymn:
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Jesus Savior 
			pilot me <br />
			Over lifes tempestuous sea. <br />
			Chart and compass come from thee <br />
			Jesus Savior pilot me <br />
			When at last I near the shore <br />
			And the fearful breakers roar <br />
			May I hear thee say to me <br />
			Fear not I will pilot thee. (Hymns, 104 ) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">I testify that 
		He will pilot us! </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		It may help to remember that the storms of life are not meant to destroy 
		us, but to keep the wind blowing so we do not become casual and in fact, 
		become stronger. It is the turbulence of the sea and the power of the 
		wind that keeps us turning to the Master. He who calmed the tempest on 
		the Sea of Galilee, will still the storms in our lives. And in a case 
		where a terrible storm might cause one to slip and fallwith the threat 
		of losing their footing and being swept overboardthere is a sure source 
		of rescue for everyone. It is through the  infinite and intimate 
		atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The atonement makes it possible for 
		each of us to reach the highest degree in the Celestial Kingdomour 
		ultimate destinationand rejoice in all the promised blessings even to 
		become joint heirs with Jesus Christ. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		I pray that each day of your lives you will be anxiously engaged in 
		building a seaworthy ship, prepared to endure the storms that are a 
		necessary part of this mortal life , becoming a loyal shipmate what ever 
		it takes , and sailing a true course. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><br />
		In President Hinckleys conference address in 1995 the first year as 
		President of the church the title of his address was Stay The Course and 
		Keep the Faith. Let us follow the prophet. I know that God is our Father 
		and Jesus Christ is our Savior. He marked the path and led the way. To 
		this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a dank, dark dungeon 
		during one of Joseph Smiths bleakest hours, the Prophet pleaded with 
		the Lord to make Himself known and to remember His suffering saints.&nbsp; 
		Listen to Josephs pleadings: O God, where art thou? . . .&nbsp; How long 
		shall thy hand be stayed, . . . behold from the eternal heavens the 
		wrongs of thy people? . . . Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer 
		these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, . . . O Lord God Almighty, . . . 
		stretch forth thy hand; . . . Remember thy suffering saints. (D&amp;C 
		121:1-6.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In response to Josephs 
		prayer came one of the most remarkable revelations of this dispensation, 
		the 121<sup>st</sup> Section of the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; First, 
		Joseph was told that his adversity and afflictions would be but a small 
		moment (D&amp;C 121:7).&nbsp; He was assured that those who wreaked vengeance on 
		the saints would receive their just dues.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And then the Lord told Joseph 
		that great knowledge was about to be revealed to the earth through the 
		power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The scripture states: God shall give unto you 
		knowledge by his Holy Spirit . . . that has not been revealed since the 
		world was until now (D&amp;C 121:26).&nbsp; The Lord went on to say that it 
		would be A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, . . . 
		All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed 
		. . . And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or 
		to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or starsAll the times of their 
		revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, . . . and all 
		their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the 
		dispensation of the fulness of times (D&amp;C 121:28-31).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord makes clear that in 
		the last days, the dispensation of the fulness of times, all things will 
		be revealed.&nbsp; (See D&amp;C 101:23-34.)&nbsp; All knowledge includes the laws that 
		govern the earth as well as those which are spiritual in nature.&nbsp; The 
		Apostle Paul prophesied 1800 years earlier That in the dispensation of 
		the fulness of times the Lord will gather together in one all things 
		in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth (Ephesians 
		1:10).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One might interpret all 
		things in Christ to refer only to spiritual laws, but it is more since 
		the great Jehovah made all things (John 1:3).&nbsp; The Apostle Peter also 
		spoke of a period of refreshing coincident with a restitution of all 
		things which would precede the Second Coming of the Lord (Acts 3:19, 
		21).&nbsp; It is true that we understand these apostolic prophecies to refer 
		to the Restoration of the gospel in the last days.&nbsp; But the Lords 
		statement to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail indicates that more than 
		spiritual truths will be revealed.&nbsp; He states that knowledge pertaining 
		not only to the heavens, but also to the seas, the earth, thrones, 
		dominions, etc. will be made known.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On an earlier occasion, the 
		Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph that all things . . . are 
		spiritual (D&amp;C 29:34).&nbsp; All laws and knowledge have a spiritual 
		purpose.&nbsp; For this reason the Lord has instructed us to become educated 
		in temporal as well as spiritual things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and Covenants 
		section 88 states that we should be instructed more perfectly in 
		theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all 
		things . . . that are expedient for [us] to understand;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of things both in heaven and

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From this section one 
		understands that secular knowledge is also important to us and the Lord 
		tells us why:&nbsp; That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Church educational 
		institutions have a dual purpose: to provide both a temporal and a 
		spiritual education.&nbsp; Temporally, BYU-Idaho prepares you to provide for 
		yourself and your family.&nbsp; It prepares you to make a contribution to the 
		communities in which you live.&nbsp; Spiritually, it educates you in the laws 
		of the Kingdom so that you can contribute to the establishment of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><u>
<span style="text-decoration: none">&nbsp;</span></u></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Latter-day Saints, we 
		understand the pattern by which a new dispensation is initiated and 
		spiritual truths are revealed.&nbsp; It begins with the Lord calling a 
		prophet, angels are then sent to instruct him (see Moroni 7:29-32).&nbsp; 
		Others are called to assist.&nbsp; The priesthood is transmitted to them with 
		its keys and powers.&nbsp; Through the priesthood, the Gift of the Holy Ghost 
		is given as a personal guide and to establish the Church.&nbsp; A book is 
		often provided which contains the fulness of the gospel and serves as a 
		witness of the Lord and His work (see Exodus 24:12, Ezekiel 2:9-10, 1 
		Nephi 1:11).&nbsp; The calling of Joseph Smith was not the first to follow 
		this pattern.&nbsp; The callings of Moses, Ezekiel, Lehi, and, undoubtedly 
		other prophets followed these steps.&nbsp; Even John the Revelators 
		commission to write the history of the earth and its dispensations 
		included an appearance from the Lord, an angel to guide him, and a book 
		(see Revelations 1, 5:1-2).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, what about temporal 
		knowledge?&nbsp; How is it revealed and to whom?&nbsp; It is clear that secular 
		inventions and innovations generally do not come through prophets.&nbsp; 
		Their mission is special as they focus on spiritual things.&nbsp; However, 
		secular knowledge has the same source as does spiritual truths.&nbsp; God is 
		omniscient and the source of all truth.&nbsp; The Savior said, I am the way, 
		the truth, and the light (John 14:6).&nbsp; The Light of Christ is given to 
		every man and woman and anyone who responds to the Light may be a 
		conduit for secular knowledge.&nbsp; I enjoy Elder Neal A. Maxwells 
		description of Gods omniscience:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Below the scripture that declares that God knows all things there is 
		no footnote reading <i>except</i> that God is a little weak in 
		geophysics! &nbsp;We do not worship a God who simply forecasts a generally 
		greater frequency of earthquakes in the last days before the second 
		coming of His Son; He knows precisely when and where all these will 
		occur.&nbsp; God has even prophesied that the Mount of Olives will cleave in 
		twain at a precise latter-day time as Israel is besieged. (Zechariah 
		14:4.)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is apparent that secular 
		knowledge has flowered since the time of Joseph Smith, that the Lord has 
		been flooding the earth with temporal knowledge as well as spiritual.&nbsp; 
		Let me illustrate the explosion of temporal knowledge with two 
		statements, the first from Stephen E. Ambroses book, <i>Undaunted 
		Courage</i>, and the second William J. Bernsteins <i>The Birth of 
		Plenty</i>.&nbsp; Speaking of the early 1800s, Ambrose wrote:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">A 
		critical fact in the world of 1801 was that nothing moved faster than 
		the speed of a horse.&nbsp; No human being, no manufactured item, no bushel 
		of wheat, no side of beef, no letter, no information, no idea, order or 
		instruction of any kind moved faster.&nbsp; Nothing had moved faster, and, as 
		far as Jeffersons contemporaries were able to tell, nothing ever would.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The horse had been the 
		mainstay of land transportation since the dawn of history.&nbsp; As far as 
		anyone knew in the early 1800s, it would remain that way.&nbsp; It took 
		Thomas Jefferson ten days to travel from Monticello to Philadelphia.&nbsp; In 
		less than 50 years, with the advent of the steam locomotive, the trip 
		was cut to one day.&nbsp; The invention of the telegraph in 1837 brought 
		instantaneous communication across the globe that abruptly altered the 
		political, social and economic affairs of nations.&nbsp; And these inventions 
		were just the beginning.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In describing the dramatic 
		changes that occurred in the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, 
		William Bernstein writes:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080"><b>
		&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		When we look at the [facts], it becomes crystal clear that <i>something 
		happened</i>  in the early nineteenth century.&nbsp; Before then, the rate 
		of improvement in the lot of mankind was small and stuttering, and 
		after, substantial and steady  Until approximately 1820, per capita 
		world economic growth  the single best way of measuring human material 
		progress  registered near zero  Then, not long after 1820, prosperity 
		began flowing in an ever-increasing torrent; with each successive 
		generation, the life of the son became observably more comfortable, 
		informed, and predictable than that of the father.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">4</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The pattern of world economic 
		wellbeing described by Bernstein is illustrated in a graph developed by 
		a Scottish economist, Angus Maddison.&nbsp; Maddison graduated from Cambridge 
		University in 1948 and, for the next 30 years, served as an economist 
		for one of the worlds largest international aid organizations.&nbsp; During 
		this time he became fascinated with the problems of the developing world 
		and the differences in wealth between rich and poor nations.&nbsp; In 1978 he 
		accepted a professorship at a Dutch university and for the next 20 years 
		developed a model of world economic growth for the last 2000 years.&nbsp; The 
		results were both stunning and unexpected.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As the graph illustrates, the 
		economic wellbeing of the average individual, measured as real per 
		capita output or income, did not change at all during the first 
		millennium after the birth of Christ.&nbsp; Over the next 800 years, between 
		A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1800, things did not get much better.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">5</font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		There were few innovations and the improvement prior to 1800 was 
		marginal.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The real progress begins in 
		1820 when the graph suddenly turns upward and begins a long steady climb 
		to unprecedented heights.&nbsp; Maddison indicates that the exact timing of 
		the turn is somewhat arbitrary.&nbsp; American data suggests that it may have 
		been a few years before 1820 while British data suggests a date as late 
		as 1830.&nbsp; Regardless, it is clear that sometime during the first half of 
		the nineteenth century, world economic growth took off and continued 
		upward despite wars, famines, and social strife.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">6</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Bernstein describes 
		Maddisons findings with the following words:&nbsp; Beginning around 1820, 
		the pace of economic advance picked up noticeably, making the world a 
		better place to live in.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; An explosion in technological 
		innovation the likes of which had never before been seen.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">7</font></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What caused the sudden change 
		in economic wellbeing?&nbsp; It was an explosion in technological innovation 
		unlike anything the world had seen.&nbsp; It was an explosion of ideas and 
		knowledge in an environment that allowed the innovations to take hold.&nbsp; 
		During the period of the enlightenment, and even before, the Lord 
		prepared the earth not only for the return of the gospel, but the 
		reception and dispersion of secular knowledge that had never before been 
		revealed (see D&amp;C 121:26, 28-29).&nbsp; Four environmental foundations 
		necessary for the use of the technological innovations were put in place 
		during the centuries prior to 1820.&nbsp; They included laws that secured 
		property rights, safe havens for scientific rationalism, efficient 
		capital markets, and the bases for improved transportation and 
		communications.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Prior to the 1700s there were 
		very few technological discoveries.&nbsp; The major innovations were the 
		three-crop rotational system, the horseshoe and horse collar, the water 
		mill, the windmill, the four-wheeled cart and the printing press.&nbsp; The 
		first economically viable steam engine came into existence in the late 
		1700s.&nbsp; The steam engine was important because it provided the 
		foundation for the nineteenth century to escape from the limitations of 
		animal muscle, wind, and water.&nbsp; It provided the power that led to 
		modern manufacturing and the steamship and railroad.&nbsp; The barriers to 
		the use of electricity for communication were finally overcome in the 
		early part of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Thus the foundations were laid 
		for the explosion of knowledge that began with the openings of the 
		heavens in 1820.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One could make a long list of 
		the scientific discoveries that followed 1820.&nbsp; These discoveries 
		brought more change in the lives of people between 1825 and 1875 than at 
		any other time in history.&nbsp; Railroads and steamships brought swift and 
		reliable travel for the first time.&nbsp; Roads were macadamized which tied 
		nations and continents together.&nbsp; Factories were mechanized into highly 
		productive units.&nbsp; The telegraph brought instantaneous global 
		communications.&nbsp; The instantaneous flow of information eliminated great 
		inefficiencies in world markets and increased productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars, 
		telephones, airplanes and computers followed.&nbsp; Advances in medicine 
		improved health and extended life.&nbsp; Eventually, rockets became a

		Those transistors powered 2 billion cell phones, 1.5 billion 
		televisions, 820 million personal computers, 190 million Game Boys, 70 
		million iPods, 50 million PDAs and 3.2 million BlackBerrys. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Given Geoffrey Moores law 
		that the power of semiconductor chips will double roughly every 18 to 24 
		months, electronic devices will become even smaller, less expensive and 
		more capable.&nbsp; Access to information will become more personal, 
		available anytime, and anywhere.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Not only are electronic 
		devices proliferating, but there is also a convergence.&nbsp; Last year, 
		mobile phone manufacturers shipped 850 million phones to global 
		customers.&nbsp; The current cost for a regular unit is about $30.&nbsp; The 
		industry goal is to reduce that cost to $20 in the near future.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first mobile phone 
		produced by Motorola, nicknamed The Brick weighed 2 pounds and cost 
		$3,995.&nbsp; It was nothing more than a wireless phone.&nbsp; The new Apple 
		iPhone weighs 4.8 ounces and offers voice, multimedia, and Internet on a 
		touch screen.&nbsp; It will cost between $400 and $600 depending on storage 
		capacity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Moores law fuels the 
		technology convergence that is taking place.&nbsp; As the picture 
		illustrates, devices conveying video, voice, data, and multi-media are 
		converging to a personal, portable, affordable handheld device that 
		almost everyone, everywhere will own or be able to access.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Can you think of Church uses 
		for such a device?&nbsp; It will be useful for missionary work, family 
		history searches, communications, education, and many other needs.&nbsp; I 
		also know that Satanwho has already found many uses for the various 
		deviceswill continue to tempt people with material that he places on 
		the new ones.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, may we return to the 
		beginning.&nbsp; In a dank, dark dungeon called Liberty Jail, the Lord 
		revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that He would unleash knowledge by 
		[the] holy spirit . . . that has not been revealed since the world was 
		even until now&nbsp; (D&amp;C 121:25). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Moreover, the knowledge would 
		not only pertain to the spiritual realm but also include knowledge 
		pertaining to the earth (see D&amp;C 121:25, 29-31).&nbsp; From the time of 
		Christ until 1820, Angus Maddisons data supports the notion that the 
		heavens were almost sealed during the dark ages.&nbsp; Finally, a small 
		stream of light began to emerge between 1500 and 1800.&nbsp; And then 
		Maddison says something happened.&nbsp; The switch was turned on and a flood 
		of knowledge pierced mens minds beginning about 1820.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, you are 
		living the miracle, the promise made by the Lord to His prophet 170 
		years ago.&nbsp; It is interesting that the world is just beginning to 
		understand what has happened, but still does not perceive the Source.&nbsp; 
		The technological inventions and discoveries of the last 170 years are a 
		clear witness that our Father in Heaven and His Son deliver on Their 
		promises.&nbsp; They control the universe.&nbsp; They know the pace and the extent 
		of the discoveries needed for the gospel to reach every nation, kindred, 
		tongue and people.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify to you that the 
		gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
		that President Gordon B. Hinckley has all of the priesthood keys 
		necessary to save and exalt you and me.&nbsp; I testify that the Savior 
		performed the Atonement so that our shortcomings will not limit us if we 
		exercise faith in Him, repent, and partake of the ordinances and 
		covenants associated with His work.&nbsp; Finally, the Lord is the Source of 
		all truth including the marvelous scientific discoveries and inventions 
		that have improved mankinds lot during the last 200 years.&nbsp; May our 
		testimonies of Him deepen and may we enjoy the power of His Holy Spirit 
		in our lives is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Good afternoon. It is 
		wonderful to be here with you today. You are an amazing sight. I am 
		grateful for the invitation from President Clark. I appreciate having 
		Elder Hammond and Sister Hammond here. In my job in church education, I 
		have had the chance to interact a little bit with Elder Hammond. He has 
		taught me a great deal and is a blessing in my life. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am so very thankful to be 
		here with Andrea, my wife; and our oldest child Zachary. He is a junior 
		in high school down in Pocatello. He was glad to skip school and join us 
		today. When you look at Andrea and you look at me, you may have the same 
		feeling a lot of people have when they see us together. They wonder, 
		How did a guy who looks like that get a woman who looks like that? 
		Brethren I will tell you if you are ready, you ought to write this down: 
		I am very, very wealthy.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Imagine yourself in the 
		post-mortal realm, and the announcement is made that it is time to give 
		a report on the great measure of your discipleship. I know on this 
		campus under President Clarks direction you have talked a great deal 
		about discipleship. The question might occur to you, Well, what is the 
		great measure of my discipleship? If you are taking notes, will you 
		write this sentence: The great measure of my discipleship <i>is</i> 
		Then take twenty seconds to consider how you would fill in that blank.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I think there are a lot of 
		answers, correct answers, possible for that question. You may have 
		written something like, living by the Spirit, obedience to the 
		commandments, keeping covenants. I believe all of those are correct. 
		They are truly great measures of our discipleship. For our purposes 
		today, I would like to suggest the following: the great measure of our 
		discipleship is how we <i>view</i> others. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That may come as a bit of a 
		surprise; I would guess that few, if any of you, chose that phrase. Some 
		of you might very well have chosen the phrase, The great measure of our 
		discipleship is how we treat others. I would agree with that; That also 
		is a correct answer. What I would invite you to think about today is how 
		we treat others is determined by how we view others. We need to pay 
		particular attention to how we view others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me say it this precisely, 
		our judgments about, our conclusions concerning, and our actions toward 
		others all grow out of how we view them. If this is the case, then the 
		question becomes, do we see others as a spirit son or daughter of God, 
		as a person, as a human being, as a soul of infinite worth? Or do we 
		see them as something less? Or do we fail to see them at all?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some bad things come of our 
		failure to see others for who they really are. Some of the worlds 
		greatest evils can be traced to this failure. Genocide, ethnic 
		cleansing, racism, misogyny, and a whole list of other ills all flow 
		from it. But of course none of us are guilty of those kinds of things, 
		and we are not here today to talk about them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What I will propose is that 
		(1) the failure to see others properly is widespread. You and I do it 
		all the time. (2) Most of us are not even aware that we do it. And (3) 
		finally, and most importantly, failing to see others for what they truly 
		are makes us less like the Savior.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How does that work? When we 
		see others in the proper way, we cannot help but love and lift them, 
		just as the Savior would. When we fail to see them in the proper way, we 
		almost always devalue and dismiss them, like Christ never would. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now what do I mean when I 
		say, We see others as something less then what they are? I will give 
		you five examples and try to explain myself. This is not an exhaustive 
		list of course. I have to warn you some of these may be a little bit 
		painful because they might hit just a little bit too close to home. You 
		are going to think that I sound like an expert. Sadly that is because I 
		am an expert.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now for each of these I am 
		going to hold up an object. I do that on purpose because when we see 
		others as less than who they really are we see them as objects.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first object is a check 
		listone that you can put on your refrigerator with magnets or that sits 
		on the corner of your desk. Sometimes, <i>instead of seeing another as a 
		person to be served, we see them as a task to be accomplished.</i> That 
		is very easy to do in the work place, and unfortunately I think that it 
		happens often in our church callings. Have you ever approached home 
		teaching, or visiting teaching, or member missionary work, or some other 
		aspect of your church calling in that way? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You may remember this story 
		from Elder Dallin H. Oaks. He shared this in the October 2001 General 
		Conference: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		was assigned to visit a less-active member. A successful professional 
		many years older than I. Looking back on my actions, I realize that I 
		had very little loving concern for the man I visited. I acted out of 
		duty with the desire to report 100 percent on my home teaching. One 
		evening, close to the end of the month, I phoned to ask if my companion 
		and I could come right over and visit him. His chastening reply taught 
		me an unforgettable lesson, No I dont believe I want you to come over 
		this evening, he said, Im tired, Ive already dressed for bed, I am 
		reading, and I am just not willing to be interrupted so that you can 
		report 100 percent on your home teaching this month. That reply still 
		stings because I know he had sensed my selfish motivation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever viewed someone 
		as a task to be accomplished? Have you ever felt like someone was 
		viewing you in that way? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next object is a bunch of 
		grapes. <i>Sometimes we see others not as an individual, but only as a 
		member of some group.</i> We are unable to distinguish them as an 
		individual person. This is very easy to do when someone has a different 
		skin color than we do, and we succumb to racial stereotypes and 
		prejudices. This also happens frequently when that other person 
		subscribes to a different ideology or worldview than we do. We cannot 
		separate them from the group they belong to, or the ideas they subscribe 
		to. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The third object is a can of 
		mosquito spray. <i>Sometimes we see others not as a person but as a pest 
		or a nuisance, an annoyance to be dealt with, postponed, simply endured, 
		or avoided altogether.</i> Now you are probably thinking to yourself, 
		Brother Southwick I dont ever do that. Have you ever looked at the 
		caller ID and saw who was calling and thought, Oh I dont want to talk 
		to them right now. Have you ever been walking on campus by yourself or 
		with friends and changed your route because you saw someone up ahead 
		that you did not want to talk to? I told you some of these were painful. 
		That is viewing someone like a pest or a nuisance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next one is a TV remote. 
		I had a hard time coming up with the label for this particular category. 
		But I will tell you the experience that caused me to think of this. Not 
		too long ago, I had come home from work after a rather strenuous day. I 
		had taken my shoes off and loosened my tie and was lying on my bed 
		watching the evening news. My ten-year-old son came into the bedroom 
		with his basketball under his arm and said, Hey, Dad, you want to shoot 
		some hoops? I am ashamed to say that <i>sometimesand I was guilty of 
		it on this occasionwe view others as an interruption.</i> So I paused 
		the news I was watching long enough to go out and play basketball with 
		my son. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This last one really hurts. 
		The last object is a mirror. <i>Sometimes we see others as a mirror.</i> 
		When we do this, what we are most interested in is what is reflected 
		back about us. We treat that person a certain way not because they 
		deserve to be treated that way, but because we want to be known as a 
		person who treats people that way. We are more interested in the other 
		persons opinion of us than we are the other person. Now this one is 
		particularly hazardous because generally we are doing well, our conduct 
		toward them is right and proper, but our motives are all wrong. In 
		addition, there can become a certain hollowness about our actions that 
		often times can be sensed by that other person. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well there are five 
		possibilities. I wish we were in a classroom and there were only twenty 
		or thirty of you. I would now ask you to share some other ways that we 
		have of viewing others, and we would come up with some objects together. 
		This list, even a partial list, is kind of disheartening. But at the 
		same time, it presents us with an opportunity to learn, to change, to 
		grow, and to become more like the Savior.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It also helps in keeping the 
		commandments. I am going to read to you a list of commandments that deal 
		with interpersonal relationships. Dont bother looking these up. I will 
		give you the reference, and you look them up and ponder them later. 
		Listen to these commandments and imagine how your ability to live these 
		commandments would be impacted if you consistently sought to view others 
		in the appropriate way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first is John 13:34: A 
		new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have 
		loved you, that ye also love one another.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">JST Matthew 7:2: Judge not 
		unrighteously, that ye be not judged. But judge righteous judgment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">3 Nephi 12:44: But behold I 
		say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to 
		them that hate you, and pray for them who spitefully use you and 
		persecute you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and Covenants 64:10, 
		I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is 
		required to forgive all men.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and Covenants 63:16: 
		And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a 
		woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in their 
		hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and 
		shall fear.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and Covenants 20:54: 
		And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with 
		each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And finally, Mosiah 4:16, 
		And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your 
		succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in 
		need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to 
		you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again brothers and sisters, 
		ponder how our ability to keep those commandments at the level the 
		Savior desires us to keep them would be enhanced if we seek always to 
		view others in the right way. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Once we have identified this 
		particular flaw, this failure to see others appropriately all the time, 
		what do we do? How do we change? Well I wish I knew the answer to that. 
		I am a much greater expert on the behaviors themselves than on how to 
		correct the behaviors. But here are some ideas.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One, just simply being aware 
		that we do it helps a lot. Any physician will tell you that the first 
		step in treatment is a correct diagnosis of the illness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A second thing is to pay 
		attention to when we are most likely to see others for less than what 
		they are. For me, I have identified three times when I do it the most: 
		One is when I am in a real hurry and I am pushing against some deadline 
		or another. Another is when I am frustrated or angry. And a third is 
		when I am distracted or when I have something on my mind.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The third thing we can do to 
		take corrective action is to adapt the counsel found in Moroni 7:45 
		Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that He will help us 
		see others as we should.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The final thing I think we 
		can do once we have seen this in ourselves and are attempting to change 
		is to study closely the mortal ministry of the Savior. I have been very 
		impressed this year in Sunday School to re-read and study the Saviors 
		life. It has been amazing to me to see how He never does this and how 
		the people around him, even His disciples did on occasion, fail to see 
		others as they should. Lets dig into the scriptures together and look 
		at a few of these examples.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Go first with me to Mark 
		chapter 10. We will look at a couple of verses that were not on your 
		list. Mark chapter 10 in verse 13: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And they brought young 
		children to him, that he should touch (or bless them): and his disciples 
		rebuked those that brought them. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now why would a disciple of 
		Christ rebuke someone who is bringing a child to be blessed by the 
		Savior? Could it be that they viewed this child as an interruption, or 
		his parents as a nuisance or a bother? Now note the reaction of the 
		Savior: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But when Jesus saw it, he 
		was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to 
		come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is a very small example 
		of where the Savior saw people differently than his disciples did. And 
		because he saw them differently, His response and His reaction to them 
		was different.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now go with me to John 
		chapter 4. I believe this one was on your list: a famous and wonderful 
		story in the New Testament about the woman at the well. Jesus is 
		traveling from Judea to Galilee, and He is passing through Samaria, 
		which, if I understand it correctly, He did not have to do; there were 
		other routes. So Hes there on purpose. Now picking up the story in 
		verse 6: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now Jacobs Well was there. 
		Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: 
		and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw 
		water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And then this very curious 
		statement in parenthesis in verse 8: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For his disciples were gone 
		away unto the city to buy meat. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why is that statement there?
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well we get a clue if we go 
		to the end of the story at verse 27. When the disciples are coming back, 
		Jesus is talking with this woman and has been for several minutes now.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And upon this came His 
		disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, 
		What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here again his disciples 
		would not have talked to her. In fact they probably would have run 
		interference, so to speak, so that He did not have to talk to her. It is 
		quite possible that Jesus sends His disciples ahead into the city to buy 
		meat in order to create an opportunity to speak with the woman without 
		them around. Now go back to verse 9: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then saith the woman of 
		Samaria unto Him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, asketh drink of me, 
		which am a woman of Samaria? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Isnt it amazing? This woman 
		has started to see herself not as a woman, not as an individual with 
		great worth, not as a daughter of God, but as a Samaritan. That is one 
		of the hazards that comes when we fail to see others properly. Sometimes 
		they even start to buy into it. She herself sees herself as a Samaritan. 
		Well then begins this exchange. You have seen this before I am sure. But 
		what is also interesting about this passage is the way she sees the 
		Savior changes because of the way He speaks to her and treats her. 
		Notice in verse 11 she addresses Him as, sir. Then again in verse 15 
		the same thing. Then again in verse 19, same thing sir, but notice, I 
		perceive that thou art a prophet.&nbsp; Then finally, after she has left Him 
		to go back to the city and He has identified Himself to her in verse 29, 
		she sees Him as the Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are lots of very subtle 
		but powerful lessons in this story. One in the context of what we are 
		talking about is this: when you see others properly (as Jesus saw the 
		woman at the well) and you treat them accordingly, how they feel about 
		you and about the Savior will change, because you are, after all, His 
		disciple.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Turn with me now to Luke 
		chapter 7, another great story, starting in verse 36. This time the 
		Savior has been invited to dinner at Simon the Pharisees house. They 
		come in, they sit down and the meal commences. You know this well also. 
		Pick up the story with me in verse 37. Luke 7 verse 37: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And, behold, a woman in the 
		city, [now notice this, even the gospel writer sees her in a certain 
		way] a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus 
		sat at meat in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of 
		ointment, And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash 
		his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and 
		kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the 
		Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, 
		This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of 
		woman this is that toucheth him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now notice again the label. 
		Simon does not see her as a woman, as a person, as a human being, as a 
		daughter of God, as a soul of infinite worth. For she is a sinner.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It seems that everyone that 
		knew her saw her in that way. Jesus then goes on to give the wonderful 
		parable about the two debtors and who would love more. Turn with me to 
		the tail end of the story. In verse 44 He begins to talk to Simon about 
		the woman and builds her up. Then He says in verse 47, and this phrase 
		is key in my mind: Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, 
		are forgiven; for she loved much. Now, brothers and sisters, Christ 
		acknowledges that this woman has committed many sins. But here is the 
		powerful thing about this exchange: He did not define her by her sins. 
		Everybody else did. The gospel writer, Simon, and probably everybody in 
		the city who knew of her defined her by her sins. She was a sinner. But 
		Christ did not. He lifts her, and builds her. Can you imagine what she 
		must have felt at the conclusion of this when He says, thy sins, which 
		are many, remember, are forgiven.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Go with me back to Mark 
		chapter 10, for just a minute. Go to the end of the chapter this time. 
		Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem. Just so that you know what is on His 
		mind, look at verses 32, 33, and 34. This is just prior to the 
		crucifixion, and He knows what He is headed for. He tells His disciples 
		in verse 33: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We go up to Jerusalem; 
			and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and 
			unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, they shall 
			mock him, and scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill 
			him. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So that is what is on His 
		mind. Now jump to verse 46. They are walking along, He and a great 
		number of His followers. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And they came to Jericho: and 
		as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of 
		people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side 
		begging. And when he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry 
		out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And many 
		charged him that he should hold his peace.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why? They saw him as an 
		annoyance, as an interruption. This is remarkable to me. Picture this 
		scene: the Savior with all sorts of people following after Him, with 
		what is going to happen within a matter of a few days on His mind. And 
		look at verse 49: And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be 
		called. In the midst of all of that, Jesus has the awareness to not 
		only physically see this man but to spiritually see him in the way we 
		are talking about today. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He calls blind Bartimaeus and 
		brings him over. That seems a little odd doesnt it? Dont you think 
		under most circumstances you would walk to the blind man? Why do you 
		suppose He calls Bartimaeus to Him? Could it be that He is sending a 
		message to both blind </font><span style="color: #000080">Bartimaeus</span><font color="#000080"> 
		and everybody watching? Christ is bringing him in and making him the 
		center of everyones attention.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And then in verse 51: And 
		Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto 
		thee? Ponder the significance of that question. Certainly it is clear 
		what Bartimaeus wants. Why does Jesus ask the question? Brothers and 
		sisters, I have to wonder how many times--if ever--someone had asked 
		Bartimaeus, What can I do for you? What it must have done for this 
		man, who was a beggar on the fringes of society, to have the Savior, the 
		Son of God ask that question. What it must have done for Bartimaeusnot 
		only to be healed physically, but to be seen by the Savior in this way. 
		He saw in Bartimaeus a son of God, a soul of infinite worth, and a human 
		being with needs.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now in conclusion, I want to 
		tell you a very quick story. One year in my seminary class I had a young 
		sophomore girl who was struggling in about every way a sophomore girl in 
		high school can struggle. She was not comfortable with her appearance. 
		She was having problems in school as well as problems at home. Her mom 
		and dad were going through a nasty divorce. She was battling clinical 
		depression and was taking medication for that. Everything in life that 
		can go wrong for a fifteen-year-old girl was going wrong. She confided 
		all of these things in me one day. I did what I could to help her and to 
		reach out to her and lift her. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One day we had this 
		experience in my classroom. It was a big afternoon class; and when 
		everybody was there, every desk was filled. On this day there were two 
		desks empty, one at the front of the room and one at the back of the 
		room. Class had started, we were about ten minutes in, and the door to 
		the classroom opens. Everybody turns around to look and it is this young 
		lady. I will call her Lisa. Lisa walks in. She is looking for a seat. At 
		the back of the room there is a young man whose best friend is also in 
		that class but not there that day. So this young man, when he turns 
		around and sees Lisa walk in the door, he grabs his scriptures which are 
		on his desk. He leans across to the empty desk right next to him, and 
		drops his scriptures on the empty desk. What has he done? A very simple 
		thingjust saving a desk for his buddy; Lisa sees that and comes up to 
		the desk in the front of the classroom. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">An amazingly simple thing 
		that happened probably seven or eight years ago that has always stuck 
		with me. Why? This young man had no idea what was going on in Lisas 
		life, none whatsoever. He was a good young man and a decent person. &nbsp;But 
		what had happened was he did not see her for what she was on that day. I 
		watched it and I knew just one more thing in her life had ground her 
		down. It was painful to watch. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I wondered then and I wonder 
		now: How often do you and I do things like that to one another? When 
		either we do not see each other at all or we see each other as something 
		less than what we should.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me share one last verse 
		of scripture, section 76 in the Doctrine and Covenants. There are a lot 
		of powerful verses in section 76. I am quite certain I do not fully 
		understand many of them. Look at verse 94. I have puzzled about this 
		phrase. Speaking of those who are in the celestial kingdom, worthy of 
		celestial glory, They who dwell in his presence are the church of the 
		Firstborn, and then this great phrase, and they see as they are seen, 
		and know as they are known. What might that mean? Could it be that 
		celestial beings see others as they are seen by God; and they know 
		others as they are known by God? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, I 
		testify that one of the great measures of our discipleship is and will 
		be how we view others. May we always see them as a spirit son or 
		daughter of God, as a soul of infinite worth, as a human being, as an 
		individual person. And may we treat them accordingly. For to do so is to 
		be a true disciple of Christ and to do as He does. I testify of a loving 
		Heavenly Father who sees us and knows us as individuals and of His son 
		Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In the name of Jesus 
		Christ, amen. </font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.&nbsp; 
		It is a privilege, although somewhat intimidating, to speak from this 
		pulpit.&nbsp; I am quite a fan of these BYUIdaho devotional broadcasts which 
		are shown as reruns on BYU Television on a daily basis.&nbsp; My wife and I 
		were observing recently that if one were to follow the counsel which has 
		been given in this setting over the years we might be nigh on to being 
		translated, hoping to be translated correctly of course. Four of our 
		children, two of their spouses, and several grandchildren, nieces and 
		nephews have been students at this wonderful university for which we are 
		most grateful.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">As Latter-day Saints, we have become so 
		used to the anti-Mormon biases that we have been exposed to throughout 
		our lives, that we hardly take notice of the gross injustice and 
		unfairness of it all.&nbsp; At most of the institutions of higher learning 
		we attend, we tolerate the cheap shots from some otherwise esteemed 
		educators.&nbsp; Of course this does not occur here at BYU</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Idaho.&nbsp; 
		In politics, we see blatant biases expressed even from those who, 
		otherwise, would have blasted such uniformed and silly statements.&nbsp; In 
		newspapers, we read time and time again, the most superficial, cursory 
		treatments of our supposed religious beliefs.&nbsp; Often, when Mormonism 
		is the subject, even and especially among those who should know better, 
		all rules are off.&nbsp; Prejudicial, unfounded, and ill-informed diatribes 
		are satisfying enough to handle the Mormon problem.&nbsp; </span></font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I acknowledge, up front, that 
		considerable progress has been made in bringing the Church out of 
		obscurity.&nbsp; The Church and its beliefs are much better understood and

		still honestly disagree with them.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I recently had this very discussion 
			with a good friend of mine.&nbsp; My contention was that we need to be 
			involved to ensure our principles are defended. . . . His point of 
			view is that, Im going to stay home and do the best I can with my 
			family, job, and Church, because everything else is going to fall 
			apart anyway.&nbsp; </span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Steves conclusion was,</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I just believe if we dont have a 
			seat at the table, we have no say in the process.&nbsp; It becomes that 
			self-fulfilling prophecy, look, they did it to us again!&nbsp; Instead, 
			we might have effected a change had we been there.</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Who will, by default, step into the 
			offices of such influence over our lives?&nbsp; The Lord has given us 
			this important counsel that, . . . when the wicked rule the people 
			mourn.&nbsp; The First Presidency has counseled, </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><i>Therefore, as in 
			the past, we urge members of the Church to be full participants in 
			political, governmental, and community affairs. &nbsp;Members of the 
			Church are under special obligations to seek out and then uphold 
			those leaders who are wise, good, and honest.&nbsp; (Doct<span class="scripture1">rine 
			and Covenants 98:10)</span></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><i>Thus, we strongly 
			urge men and women to be willing to serve on school boards, city and 
			county councils and commissions, state legislatures, and other high 
			offices of either election or appointment, including involvement in 
			the political party of their choice. (First Presidency letter, 15 
			Jan. 1998).</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">People approach me and 
		say, </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><i>Ed, how can you stand 
		to be involved in politics? There are only dishonest people there.&nbsp; You 
		cannot be honest and still be in politics! </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">That is a poor 
		commentary if that is true in our country, and I do not think that it is 
		true.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Some of the finest 
		experiences and lessons of life have come with my service in the world 
		of politics.&nbsp; I have learned that we live in a very diverse world, that 
		we must listen and learn from others who have varying points of view, 
		that learning how to get along with those who have viewpoints contrary 
		to our own is vital and that political involvement can be a most noble 
		service. Most people who serve us in government give their best to what 
		they are doing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I so admire many who 
		give of their means, time and energy as state and local governmental 
		employees, as well as in elected offices, and at the same time take so 
		much bitter criticism.&nbsp; For many of them, the desire to try to serve 
		their communities overrides the often unfair and angry accusations which 
		target them.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">So, if you feel an inclination to become 
		involved in your school government, city councils, planning and zoning 
		commissions, state legislatures, etc., do not hesitate.&nbsp; Follow those 
		inclinations and you will be a blessing.&nbsp; However, remember the 
		guidelines above, and do not fall victim to pride, unhealthy aspiration, 
		a desire to win at all costs, or become vicious and sharp-tongued in 
		attacking your opponent.&nbsp; Become informed and deal with the issues at 
		hand.&nbsp; Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-46 provide wonderful principles for 
		working with and serving others in the public sector.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Let us, blessed with

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">I testify of 
				something you already know:&nbsp; that we lived before we came to 
				planet earth.&nbsp; In the premortal stage of our journey we 
				excitedly anticipated coming here to receive a mortal body and 
				prove ourselves worthy of much more than what we find here, even 
				an eternal, celestial existence.&nbsp; This type of existence is not 
				some abstract concept regarding an uncertain future opportunity, 
				but an exalted existence and lifestyle, the pursuit of which we 
				commenced long before coming to earth.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">To remind ourselves 
				of the eternal nature of time and space, let us consider a 
				powerful scripture found in the Book of Moses, chapter 1, verses 
				33 and 35:&nbsp; And worlds without number have I created; and I 
				also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created 
				them, which is mine Only Begotten.</span></font></p>

				For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, in Moses, 
				chapter 7, verse 30, we read:&nbsp; And were it possible that man

				like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">With these scriptures 
				in mind, let us take an elementary look at space and distance by 
				traveling away from the earth for one light year, which would be 
				the distance light travels in a vacuum in one years time at 
				about 186,000 miles per second.&nbsp; At the speed of light one would 
				cover the distance from here to the sun in about 8 minutes and 
				20 seconds, so we can just imagine the distance covered in a one 
				years journey.&nbsp; Now that we have traveled one light year, let 
				us travel that distance to the thousandth power, and then that 
				distance to the millionth power and that to the billionth power, 
				and that to the trillionth power and then continue to mentally 
				repeat and traverse those incomprehensible distances for the 
				rest of our days.&nbsp; Very early in this journey we would have 
				traveled beyond the farthest reaches of the Hubble telescope and 
				some might say, But there has to be an end.&nbsp; One might answer, 
				and then what, a wall?&nbsp; Or a bold sign saying, the end of 
				space?&nbsp; No, in terms of time and space, there is no end; time 
				and space are truly infinite.&nbsp; That knowledge should help us 
				understand that mortal life here on earth, comparatively is 
				very, very short, even for those who live to an advanced age.&nbsp; 
				President Kimball once said that (quote) today is just a grain 
				of sand in the Sahara of eternity.&nbsp; (unquote)&nbsp; Yet, my brothers 
				and sisters, I know that how we live that mortal life will have 
				a tremendous impact on our future, eternal destiny.&nbsp; President 
				Kimball continues:&nbsp; We have also a hope in Christ for the 
				eternity that lies ahead; otherwise, as Paul said, we would be 
				of all men most miserable (1 Cor. 15:19).</span></font></p>

				opportunity in mortality as you and I did a few short years

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This means we would

				world around us.&nbsp; You see, when people do not know who they are, 
				including their eternal destiny and the Plan of Happiness, the 
				keeping of commandments to help them become more like God means 
				very little to them.&nbsp; If living by a certain pattern with 
				elevated standards is to be meaningful to people, they need to 
				know they are sons and daughters of God and have a vision of 
				their eternal potential and destiny.&nbsp; Alma illustrated in Alma, 
				chapter 12, verse 32, an important sequence in teaching others 
				when he said, Therefore God gave unto them commandments after

				children, understand the plan of salvation so they know who they 
				are, how they fit in, who the Savior is and what He has done.&nbsp; 
				Then, with that understanding, the commandments can be taught, 
				understood, and greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, we 
				know who we are as children of the covenant with an eternal 
				destiny.&nbsp; I pray that we will absolutely refuse to pattern our 
				lives after those who do not know these things.&nbsp; Our observation 
				of the world around us demonstrates that those who do not know 
				who they are set very dangerous, unrighteous standards and 
				patterns for todays lifestyle.&nbsp; I believe if we get this

				it will help tremendously in our pursuit of happiness and in

				so many things, but rather His work and His glory result in our 
				physical and spiritual progress.&nbsp; He defines this progress in 
				Moses 1:39, as our becoming immortal beings and being capable of 
				returning to His presence.&nbsp; It is almost incomprehensible to 
				realize what He wants for us.&nbsp; Understanding these things should 
				cause us to repent, change our habits, long for, plan for, and

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In spite of the 
				danger, the Lord has allowed us to choose for ourselves and make 
				our own personal decisions.&nbsp; Our use of moral agency is one of 
				Gods greatest gifts while on our celestial journey.&nbsp; The 
				adversary would force us, if he could, but he cannot; he has 
				been given no such power.&nbsp; God could force us if he chose to, 
				but He never will.&nbsp; There is great comfort in knowing that we 
				are truly free to decide and to act for ourselves, yet we must 
				know that we are responsible for those choices and they, 
				combined with repentance and endurance, help determine what we 
				will become.&nbsp; I believe that optimum development of the great 
				gift of agency requires our following the promptings of the 
				Spirit, keeping commitments and constantly adhering to 
				principles of righteousness.&nbsp; Our proper and wise use of agency

				would come to leave this life, and continue the journey 
				elsewhere.&nbsp; As such, one always needs to be prepared.&nbsp; This 
				personal experience, over forty years ago, caused me, at about 
				your age, to begin to think more about what I could take with me

				verse 8, that asks why it is that men covet that which is but 
				the drop, and neglect the more weighty matters? &nbsp;This scripture 
				on priorities helps us recognize that the things the Lord knows 
				to be best for us are not generally those things that mankind 
				pursues, especially in todays world.&nbsp; Rewording the question a 
				little, we might ask:&nbsp; Why is it that men tend to covet and 
				pursue that which is temporary, trivial or unimportant, while 
				neglecting weighty, important and eternal things?&nbsp; A good axiom 
				for us might be the following that has been expressed in various

				packing, then, we will want to make sure that our faith in the 
				Savior and our testimonies of Him are absolute and that we are

			sisters, I am humbled to have the opportunity to spend time with you 
			today in the Hart gymnasium and also with those of you who are 
			meeting in the Taylor Chapel and listening via the radio.&nbsp; Several 
			years ago, I played basketball for the Ricks College Vikings and I 
			have many fond memories of this gymnasium.&nbsp; It was on this campus 
			that I met my wife Valerie.&nbsp; Following my sophomore year, I served 
			as a missionary for two years in the Ontario Canada Mission.&nbsp; I am 
			one of those rare survivors of the &quot;dear John&quot; phenomenon and 
			because of that Sister Bowen and I were married in the Idaho Falls 
			Temple in August of 1974.&nbsp; I feel blessed that she is here with me 
			today.&nbsp; She has been my source of strength and inspiration over the 
			years, and she has often referred to me as a model husband.&nbsp; I have 
			reveled in such a compliment until recently I looked the word model 
			up in the dictionary and found that it means, &quot;a cheap imitation!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From November of 2000 
			through March of 2006, I was blessed with the opportunity to serve 
			in the stake presidencies of the BYUIdaho 5<sup>th</sup> and 
			BYU-Idaho 2<sup>nd</sup> Stakes.&nbsp; During that wonderful time I once 
			again grew to love this campus and the students who attend here.&nbsp; 
			Through the many hours of interviews and personal conversations with 
			students, my awareness has increased of the challenges, the 
			obstacles, and the fears that many of you face; and consequently, a 
			flood of memories have poured through my mind as I have prayed and 
			contemplated what the Spirit would have me say to you this day.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The subject that I have 
			chosen to speak about addresses a principle taught by the Savior to 
			His apostles.&nbsp; Following the miracle of the five thousand, the 
			Savior told his disciples &quot;to get into a ship, and to go before him 
			unto the other side,&quot; while He went up into a mountain to pray.&nbsp; 
			Matthew states:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;And in the 
				fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the 
				sea. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And when the 
				disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, 
				saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">But 
				straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it 
				is I; be not afraid.&quot;&nbsp; (Matthew 14: 25-27)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color: #000080">The Dual 
			Effects of Fear&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The apostles 
			learned from this experience that as long as the Savior was with 
			them they had nothing to fear.&nbsp; This powerful principle applies to 
			each of us today.&nbsp; To be afraid is a condition that each of us face 
			throughout our lives.&nbsp; Experience has taught me that fear can have a 
			dual or an opposite effect upon us; and the effect which fear 
			produces upon us is directly related to what our relationship is 
			with our Savior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate one of these effects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">When Adam was in 
			the Garden of Eden, he chose to disobey Father in Heaven and partook 
			of the forbidden fruit.&nbsp; The effect of that transgression caused 
			Adam to be afraid and &quot;he hid himself.&quot; (Genesis 3:10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fear 
			developed as a direct consequence of disobedience to a commandment 
			of God.&nbsp; When a difficult trial comes into the life of one who has 
			chosen to disobey God, the Spirit of the Lord is offended and if 
			that individual will not turn again to the Lord, he is left to his 
			own strength and without hope.&nbsp; Such are those who Moroni spoke of 
			when he said, &quot;And if ye have no hope ye <span class="searchword">
			must</span> <span class="searchword">needs</span>
<span class="searchword">be</span> <span class="searchword">in</span> 
			despair and <span class="searchword">despair</span> cometh because 
			of iniquity.&quot;&nbsp; (Moroni 10:22)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">When Lehi arrived 
			in the new world, he received the following promise from the Lord in 
			regards to his posterity as recorded in 2 Nephi, chapter 1, verse 9:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;Wherefore, I, 
				Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom
				<span class="searchword">the</span> Lord God shall bring out of
				<span class="searchword">the</span> <span class="searchword">
				land</span> of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall 
				prosper upon <span class="searchword">the</span> face of this
				<span class="searchword">land</span>; and they shall be kept 
				from all other nations, that they may possess this
				<span class="searchword">land</span> unto themselves.&nbsp; And if it 
				so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be 
				blessed upon <span class="searchword">the</span> face of this
				<span class="searchword">land</span>, and there shall be none to 
				molest them, nor to take away <span class="searchword">the</span>
<span class="searchword">land</span> of their inheritance; and 
				they shall dwell safely forever.&quot; (2 Nephi 1:9)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">From the record of 
			Mormon, we learn that the posterity of this great prophet Lehi 
			failed to qualify for the blessing of this promise from the Lord and 
			eventually succumbed to transgression.&nbsp; Mormon explained how this 
			disobedience to the commandments caused his people to ripen in sin 
			and iniquity.&nbsp; He described the Nephites as a people who &quot;were led 
			about by Satan even as a chaff driven by the wind like a vessel 
			tossed upon the waters, no sail, no anchor, without anything to 
			steer.&quot; (Mormon 5:18)&nbsp; As the last great battle between the 
			Lamanites and the Nephites commenced, Mormon described the hopeless 
			condition of the Nephite army when he stated that &quot;every soul was 
			filled with terror.&quot; (Mormon 6:8)&nbsp; Because the Nephite people had 
			turned away from the Lord, they had no source for courage. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The book of 
			Proverbs confirms this effect of despair with a passage that states 
			that the wicked are they who &quot;flee when no man pursueth,&quot; (Proverbs 
			28:1) and again in Psalms we read that the wicked &quot;go mourning all 
			the day long.&quot; (Psalms 38:6)&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the state of those who are 
			afraid and will not turn to the Lord.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">In contrast, an 
			opposite effect produced by fear is one that creates a reverence for 
			and a dependence upon the Savior.&nbsp; Because of this relationship, 
			there is an increase of confidence, a greater faith, an increased 
			hope, and ultimately greater courage that comes to those who humble 
			themselves before the Lord.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The scriptures are 
			replete with examples of those who have been afraid, yet have found 
			the courage and the strength in the Lord to face difficult 
			circumstances.&nbsp; For example, when Joshua was commanded by the Lord 
			to lead the children of Israel into the land of promise without 
			Moses, he was overwhelmed and afraid.&nbsp; The great prophet Moses had 
			led and guided Israel for over forty years and now Joshua was the 
			one who would take over that responsibility.&nbsp; Listen to what the 
			Lord commanded Joshua to do:&nbsp; &quot;Have not I commanded thee? Be strong 
			and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for 
			the Lord thy God <i>is</i> with thee whithersoever thou goest.&quot; 
			(Joshua 1:9) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Joshua loved the 
			Lord.&nbsp; Therefore he was obedient to Jehovah's counsel and because of 
			his faith in the Son of God he was given the strength to replace 
			fear with courage.&nbsp; Because of the reverence that he had for the 
			Lord, Joshua was enabled to become a great Israelite leader.&nbsp; In his 
			epistle to the Philippians, Paul described this reverence when he 
			proclaimed, &quot;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth 
			me.&quot; (Philippians 4:13)&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The following

			principle. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">In October of 
			1838, three days after the extermination order was issued, some 200 
			men mounted a surprise attack against the small community of saints 
			at Haun's Mill on Shoal Creek, Caldwell County.&nbsp; The assailants, in 
			an act of treachery, persuaded innocent latter-day saint men and 
			boys of that community, who wished to save themselves, to go into 
			the local blacksmith shop.&nbsp; These wicked men then took up positions 
			around the building and fired into it until they thought all inside 
			were dead.&nbsp; Others were shot as they tried to make their escape.&nbsp; In 
			all, seventeen men and boys were killed and fifteen were wounded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">After the 
			massacre, Amanda Smith went to the blacksmith shop, where she found 
			her husband, Warren, and a son, Sardius, dead.&nbsp; Among the carnage 
			she was overjoyed to find another son, little Alma, still alive 
			though severely wounded.&nbsp; His hip had been severely damaged by a 
			musket blast.&nbsp; With most of the men dead or wounded, Amanda knelt 
			down and pleaded with the Lord for help:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;Oh my Heavenly 
			Father, I cried, what shall I do?&nbsp; Thou seest my poor wounded boy 
			and knowest my inexperience. Oh Heavenly Father direct me what to 
			do!'&nbsp; She said that she 'was directed as by a voice,' instructing 
			her to make a lye from the ashes and cleanse the wound. She then 
			prepared a slippery elm poultice and filled the wound with it.&nbsp; The 
			next day she poured the contents of a bottle of balsam into the 
			wound.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Amanda said to her 
			son, 'Alma, my child, do you believe that the Lord made your hip?' 
			'Yes, mother,' he replied.&nbsp; Amanda continued, 'Well, the Lord can 
			make something there in the place of your hip, don't you believe he 
			can, Alma?'&nbsp; 'Do you think that the Lord can, mother?' inquired the 
			child, in his simplicity.&nbsp; 'Yes, my son,' I replied, 'he has shown 
			it all to me in a vision.'&nbsp; Then I laid him comfortably on his face, 
			and said:&nbsp; 'Now you lay like that, and don't move, and the Lord will 
			make you another hip.'&nbsp; So Alma laid on his face for five weeks, 
			until he was entirely recovered; a flexible gristle having grown in 
			place of the missing joint and socket.&quot;&nbsp; (Amanda Barnes Smith, 
			quoted in Edward W. Tullidge, <em>Women of Mormondom</em> [1877],

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">As I thought about 
			this story, I wondered, where and how did this little mother find 
			the courage to do what she did?&nbsp; She was alone with her world turned

			destroyed.&nbsp; Her little boy lay helpless and severely injured before 
			her.&nbsp; What fear, what hopelessness, what discouragement must have 
			come upon her; yet when she turned to the Lord, the fear that she 
			felt was replaced with courage and the strength to save her son's 
			life.&nbsp; This afternoon I would like to speak about a pattern for 
			courage that is found in the scriptures.&nbsp; This pattern will serve as 
			a guide to each of us as we face circumstances that &quot;fill our hearts

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

			Courage&nbsp; </span></b><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">An example of this 
			pattern is revealed in the fifty seventh chapter of Alma.&nbsp; In this 
			account we read about a group of young men who would be about the 
			same age as many of you here today. They were the young sons of the 
			Lamanite people who were converted by Ammon and his brethren.&nbsp; These 
			Lamanite boys came from righteous families where they had been 
			taught the gospel and where they had learned to trust in the Lord.&nbsp; 
			The account records that their mothers had taught them that &quot;if they 
			did not doubt, God would deliver them.&quot; (Alma 56:47).&nbsp; The record 
			speaks of heroic battles fought by these young men against 
			insurmountable odds.&nbsp; We read that they were courageous and obedient 
			in that &quot;they did obey and observe to perform every word of command 
			with exactness.&quot; (Alma 57:21)&nbsp; As the story progresses, we find 
			these brave young men, along with Helaman their leader, in a 
			desperate and difficult situation.&nbsp; In Alma chapter 58, we read how 
			they went to &quot;assist (their) brethren in preserving the city&quot; of 
			Cumeni where they &quot;did wait in these difficult circumstances for the 
			space of many months, even until (they) were about to perish for the 
			want of food.&quot; (Alma 58:7)&nbsp; Due to a rebellion in the Nephite 
			government, minimal support had been provided to this small army.&nbsp; 
			The record reads: &quot;this is all the assistance which we did receive, 
			to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of 
			our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.&quot; 
			(Alma 58:8)&nbsp; In verse nine we read &quot;therefore we were grieved and 
			also filled with fear;&quot; and then </span><b>
<span style="color: #000080">a</span></b><span style="color: #000080"> 
			certain pattern begins to unfold.&nbsp; Please pay attention to the order 
			of events that took place:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;Therefore we 
				did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would 
				strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, 
				yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, 
				and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our 
				people. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Yea, and it 
				came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances 
				that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace 
				to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause 
				us that we should hope for our deliverance in him. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And we did 
				take courage with our small force which we had received, and 
				were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to 
				maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our 
				children, and the cause of our liberty.&quot; (Alma 58:10-12)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Ponder these words 
			for a moment.&nbsp; We were grieved and also filled with fear.&nbsp; We did 
			pour out our souls in prayer to God, that He would strengthen us; 
			the Lord God did visit us with assurances; He did speak peace to our 
			souls; (He) did grant unto us great faith, which did cause us that 
			we should have hope for our deliverance in Him; and we did take 
			courage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">An additional 
			example of this pattern is found in the first chapter of Moses.&nbsp; 
			Moses had been in the presence of God, and then he was left alone.&nbsp; 
			It was at that time when Satan came &quot;tempting&quot; him.&nbsp; The account 
			reads:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;And now, when 
				Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, and 
				ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only 
				Begotten, worship me. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And it came to 
				pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to 
				fear, he saw the bitterness of hell<b>.</b>&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
				calling upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, 
				saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I 
				worship, which is the God of glory. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And now Satan 
				began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received 
				strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only 
				Begotten, depart hence, Satan. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And it came to 
				pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and 
				wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence.&quot;&nbsp; (Moses 
				1: 19-22)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">When Moses 
			observed the power and anger of Satan, he became frightened.&nbsp; As he 
			became frightened, another circumstance came into play; Moses saw 
			&quot;the bitterness of hell&quot;.&nbsp; However, as he followed the counsel that 
			he was given, to call upon God, he received strength and found 
			courage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;As fear enters 
			into our lives, doubt can set in.&nbsp; At times we can literally be 
			exposed to &quot;the bitterness of hell&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the experience with 
			Moses as he began to &quot;fear exceedingly&quot;.&nbsp; Yet, Moses was obedient to 
			what Heavenly Father had asked him to do and he called upon God; 
			therefore his faith increased and &quot;he received strength&quot;.&nbsp; As that 
			faith and that strength was granted to him, he began to have hope, 
			which in turn gave him &quot;great&quot; courage and once more he commanded 
			Satan to leave.&nbsp; The scripture reads: &quot;Satan cried with a loud 
			voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he 
			departed hence.&quot; (Moses 1:22)&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">As a final 
			example, I turn to the twenty third chapter of Mosiah.&nbsp; A Lamanite 
			army that had been lost in the wilderness, suddenly came into the 
			borders of the land of Helam.&nbsp; When Alma's people discovered that 
			the army was upon them, they &quot;were much frightened.&quot; (Mosiah 
			23:26)&nbsp;&nbsp; The scripture states that Alma stood among his people and 
			admonished them &quot;that they should not be frightened.&quot; (Mosiah 
			23:27)&nbsp; Then Alma went to the Lord and prayed that the hearts of the 
			Lamanites would be softened and the account reads: &quot;therefore they 
			hushed their fears.&quot; (Mosiah 23:28)&nbsp; In chapter twenty four we 
			discover&nbsp; that Amulon, a former acquaintance and fellow priest with 
			Alma when they both served with King Noah, had been given power by 
			the Lamanite leader to govern over the land of Helam.&nbsp; At the time 
			of this appointment, he immediately began to exercise authority over 
			Alma and his people.&nbsp; Once again, a pattern for courage begins to 
			emerge as we read the account:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><b>
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;And Alma and 
				his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but 
				did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts 
				of their hearts. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And it came to 
				pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their 
				afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, 
				for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I 
				will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.
				</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And I will 
				also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that 
				even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in 
				bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for 
				me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord 
				God, do visit my people in their afflictions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And now it 
				came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his 
				brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strenghten them that 
				they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit 
				cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And it came to 
				pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the 
				voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good 
				comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.&nbsp;
				</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And Alma and 
				his people departed into the wilderness.&quot;&nbsp; (Alma 24: 12- 16; 20)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The Lord is 
			willing to assist and strengthen those who put their trust in Him.&nbsp; 
			We read how Alma's people were afraid.&nbsp; They did pour out their 
			hearts to God.&nbsp; He did know the thoughts of their hearts.&nbsp; The Lord 
			knew of the covenant that Alma and his people had made to Him.&nbsp; He 
			covenanted to deliver them.&nbsp; He eased the burdens upon their 
			shoulders.&nbsp; He told them to be of good comfort; I will deliver you.&nbsp; 
			They took courage and departed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">On a personal

			master's degree in physical therapy.&nbsp; As with any degree, it was a 
			grueling and difficult trial.&nbsp; The time came for him to pass the 
			boards for the degree and in the first attempt, he failed.&nbsp; He was 
			so distraught. His mother and I remember the exact time that he got 
			the phone call about the test scores.&nbsp; We felt of his fear and of 
			his anguish.&nbsp; Just the very thought that his whole career depended

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">To prepare for the

			During that time we pled with the Lord for help, we fasted, and we 
			attended the temple.&nbsp; The time came once more for him to take the 
			exam.&nbsp; We were all anxious and continued to supplicate the Lord in 
			his behalf.&nbsp; When he finished the test, he once again felt somewhat 
			overwhelmed, and had commented to his younger sister how he was 
			concerned about his performance.&nbsp; With great courage, he said that 
			he would begin once more to prepare himself for three more months of

			that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come

			have felt of my inability and helplessness as I have watched a young

			have watched as my sons and my daughter have struggled through

			when He said, &quot;Peace <span class="searchword">I</span> leave with

			hesitation.&nbsp; When I have interviewed students as a stake president 
			and as I have listened to testimonies and talks during church 
			meetings on campus, I have noticed a common theme which stands out 
			and is unique to many of you.&nbsp; It is that A &quot;this is the most 
			difficult experience I have ever faced in my life!&quot;&nbsp; Many of you 
			have cried out like Amanda Smith did at the Haun's Mill massacre, 
			&quot;Oh Father in Heaven, what shall I do?&nbsp; Thou knowest my 
			inexperience, Oh Heavenly Father direct me what to do!&quot;&nbsp; As a parent 
			and as a stake president, I know how devastating certain events can 
			be in your lives.&nbsp; These experiences are real, they can be 
			paralyzing, and they may be all that you can bear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Perhaps you have 
			not fully understood this pattern for courage in your own lives; but 
			I would suggest that as you contemplate the trials that you have 
			experienced, as you have cried in your hearts, &quot;Oh Heavenly Father 
			what shall I do?&quot; that this is precisely what has happened to you.&nbsp; 
			Think of how you have prayed with all of your hearts.&nbsp; Try to 
			remember the feelings of peace and assurance that have come to you 
			as you have prayed.&nbsp; Consider the increase of faith that you have 
			felt as you have trusted in your Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Remember the hope 
			that was renewed in your soul as the peaceful whisperings have come 
			to you.&nbsp; And then focus on the renewal of courage that became yours 
			as you determined to move forward.&nbsp; It is my testimony, that as you 
			put your trust in the Savior, He will turn your fear into courage.&nbsp; 
			I also testify that this power is available to you every day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">As the Savior 
			approached the end of his ministry, He faced the greatest of all 
			trials.&nbsp; The Atonement that He was foreordained to perform was at 
			the door step.&nbsp; He was alone, He was afraid, and He would that He 
			could walk away from the challenge.&nbsp; Listen as I read the account in 
			Matthew:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&quot;And he took 
				with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be 
				sorrowful and very heavy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Then saith he 
				unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: 
				tarry ye here, and watch with me. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And he went a 
				little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my 
				Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: 
				nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And he cometh unto 
			the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, 
			could ye not watch with me one hour? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Watch and pray, 
			that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> 
			willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">He went away again 
			the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may 
			not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And he came and 
			found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And he left them, 
			and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same 
			words. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Then cometh he to 
			his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> 
			rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed 
			into the hands of sinners. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Rise, let us be 
			going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.&quot; (Matthew 26: 
			37-46)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The same pattern for 
		courage that we have discussed this afternoon was also followed by the 
		Savior when He went into the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we read in 
		Matthew, He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.&nbsp; He looked to his 
		apostles for help and said to them, &quot;</span><font color="#000080">My 
		soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch 
		with me.</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot;&nbsp; As He walked back to in 
		the garden, the record reads that He fell on His face and pled with 
		Father in Heaven, &quot;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass 
		from me.&quot;&nbsp; The scriptures go on to read that &quot;</span><font color="#000080">He 
		went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if 
		this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be 
		done.&quot;</font><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp; He was alone; all of the 
		apostles were asleep.&nbsp; And in His loneliness, as He faced the demands of 
		the Atonement, He cried, </span><font color="#000080">&quot;the spirit indeed
		<i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot; 
		He fell to His knees and He </span><font color="#000080">&quot;prayed the 
		third time, saying the same words.&quot;</font><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp; 
		Then a peace came over Him and He spoke to His apostles and said, </span>
<font color="#000080">&quot;Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, 
		the hour is at hand.</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot;&nbsp; His courage 
		was manifest when He said to the apostles, &quot;</span><font color="#000080">Rise 
		up, let us be going.</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">In the Garden of 
		Gethsemane, He saw you and me.&nbsp; There He heard our pleas and our cries.&nbsp; 
		He felt of our pain, of our despair, and of our fear.&nbsp; He atoned for our 
		sins so that we can approach Him for help.&nbsp; This is why this pattern 
		works; it is because we engage Him, the Great Enabler, into our lives.&nbsp; 
		We never need to fear or be alone as long as we understand and know that 
		He is in the very details of our lives if we will but turn to Him each 
		day.&nbsp; It is He that says, &quot;</span><font color="#000080">Be of good 
		cheer; It is I; Be not afraid.&quot;</font><span style="color: #000080"> 
		(Matthew 14:27)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">It is through the 
		miracle of the Atonement, that the Savior understands all of our 
		weaknesses, fears, and short comings.&nbsp; And more importantly, He 
		understands how to succor and help us.&nbsp; His invitation to each of us is 
		the same as it was to the Nephites of old when He asked, &quot;</span><font color="#000080">will 
		ye not return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted,
		<span class="searchword">that</span> <span class="searchword">I</span>
<span class="searchword">may</span> heal <span class="searchword">you</span>?</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot; 
		(3 Nephi 9:&nbsp;13)&nbsp; Through the infinite Atonement, He can enable each of 
		us to find the courage to elevate ourselves far above the events of the 
		day.&nbsp; If we will but follow our Savior's example as He experienced the 
		pains of the Atonement and if we will always say in our hearts the same 
		words that He said to Heavenly Father &quot;</span><font color="#000080">nevertheless 
		not as I will, but as thou wilt,&quot;</font><span style="color: #000080"> He 
		will be with us.&nbsp; Therefore, we too can find the courage as did Amanda 
		Smith, as did Moses, and as did Alma to face all trials that come our 
		way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Remember this 
		pattern:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">We were afraid, we did 
		pour our souls to God, He did visit us with assurances, He did grant 
		unto us great faith, which did cause us to have hope, and we did go 
		forward with courage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">As the Savior said to 
		His apostles, &quot;</span><font color="#000080">Rise up, let us be going.&quot;</font><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp; 
		So He says to each of us, </span><font color="#000080">&quot;Rise up, let us 
		be going.</font><span style="color: #000080">&quot;&nbsp; I testify in the name of 
		the Lord, that the Atonement is real and that it is operative in each of 
		our lives.&nbsp; I testify that the young boy Joseph saw the Father and the 
		Son in the grove that clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred 
		and twenty.&nbsp; I testify that the priesthood with all the rights, keys, 
		and powers are upon the earth.&nbsp; I testify that we have a living prophet, 
		even Gordon B. Hinckley and that we have&nbsp; living apostles and prophets 
		chosen of the Lord to guide this church in these last days.&nbsp; The gospel 
		is true and as long as we engage the Savior into our lives, we will 
		never have to be afraid.&nbsp; I testify of that reality in the name of Jesus 
		Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At the onset I must make it 
		clear that although I am an emeritus General Authority I do not speak 
		for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in my remarks 
		today.&nbsp; No one has asked me to speak on the topic I have chosen, nor 
		told me what to say.&nbsp; My views are my own, and I bear full and total 
		responsibility for them.&nbsp; Some are taken from my recent book, <i>Turning 
		From Truth:&nbsp; A New Look at the Great Apostasy</i> (Deseret Book, 2005).&nbsp; 
		That said, however, my wish is to represent, as best I can, my views on 
		what I consider to be an important topic.&nbsp; The title of my presentation 
		is:&nbsp; Are Mormons Christians?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In discussing this issue, I 
		do not wish to disparage, criticize or belittle the sincerely-held 
		beliefs of others, preferring to let each make his or her own decision 
		about theological truths.&nbsp; I recognize that in the realm of religion 
		faith trumps all else.&nbsp; But where we disagree it is my plea that we do 
		so with respect, civility and forbearance, avoiding the name-calling and 
		invective which too often take the place of reasoned dialogue.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Although The Church of Jesus 
		Christ of Latter-day Saints has been organized for more than 175 years, 
		and continues to gain members rapidly around the world, most Americans 
		know little about it.&nbsp; To the extent they take any view at all, their 
		understanding often is both myopic and wildly off the mark.&nbsp; Though 
		there are many who acknowledge that most Latter-day Saints are good, 
		honest, and family-oriented people, few know much about our doctrine, 
		which drives our lifestyle.&nbsp; And much of what some think they know is 
		quite frankly wrong.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For example, many other 
		Christians do not believe Mormons, so called, are Christians, relegating 
		us to the status of a non-Christian cult.&nbsp; (As an aside, may I say that 
		by any reasonable definition of a cult, New Testament Christianity 
		also qualifies for that status.)&nbsp; Many Latter-day Saints are both 
		puzzled and frustrated by this rejection.&nbsp; After all, we say, the name 
		of the Church alone should indicate <u>who</u> we are, and whose we 
		are.&nbsp; The Church bears the name of Him whom we proclaim to be its 
		leader.&nbsp; One of our sacred books of scripture, the Book of Mormon, 
		recounts in some detail the visit of the resurrected, glorified Savior, 
		Jesus Christ, to faithful men, women and children in America, and 
		proclaims Jesus own words about His church:&nbsp; And how be it my church 
		save it be called in my name?&nbsp; For if a church be called in Moses name 
		then it be Moses church; or if it be called in the name of a man then 
		it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my 
		church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel (3 Ne. 27:8).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Jesus is the central figure 
		in Latter-day Saint theology and practice.&nbsp; We take upon ourselves in 
		solemn covenant His holy name.&nbsp; We worship Him and His Father, the Great 
		Elohim.&nbsp; As Nephi of old stated:&nbsp; And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in 
		Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write 
		according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source 
		they may look for a remission of their sins (2 Ne. 25:26).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But the risen Christ whom we 
		acknowledge as the Only Begotten Son of the Father, and laud as King of 
		Kings and Lord of Lords, the Savior and Redeemer of the world, is not 
		the Christ of the church creeds and councils.&nbsp; We reject the councils, 
		which convened over the ages, and the creeds they developed.&nbsp; As 
		President Gordon B. Hinckley has noted:&nbsp; We do not accept the Nicene 
		Creed, nor any other creed based on tradition and the conclusions of 
		men (<i>Ensign</i>, Nov. 1998, pp. 70-72).&nbsp; We proclaim that the 
		theology and practices the more than 20 councils produced over the 
		centuries, starting with the Council of Nicea in the fourth century AD, 
		were drastically different from those of the New Testament period, when 
		the infant church was under apostolic direction.&nbsp; Those creeds, we 
		believe, exhibit profound differences in both language and concepts from 
		the gospel principles found in the Scriptures.&nbsp; Their adoption, after 
		much politicking and bad faith, resulted in a body of theology that was 
		acceptable to the gentile world, but departed in significant ways from 
		the simple gospel message of Jesus and His apostles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The influence of Greek 
		philosophy on Christian theology, including concerns about the nature of 
		God, which so preoccupied the participants in the Council of Nicea, can 
		hardly be overemphasized.&nbsp; Edwin Hatchs prescient observations of over 
		a century ago still hold true:&nbsp; A large part of what are sometimes 
		called Christian doctrines, and many usages which have prevailed and 
		continue to prevail in the Christian church, are in reality Greek 
		theories and Greek usages changed in form and color by the influence of 
		primitive Christianity, but in their essence Greek still (<i>The 
		Influence of Greek Ideas and Usage Upon the Christian Church</i>, 350).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is important to keep in 
		mind the chronology involved in the events which transformed the early 
		Christian church into an organization which lacked the divine 
		approbation and authority needed to qualify as Christs church on 
		earth.&nbsp; Greek philosophy did not cause the Great Apostasy which 
		Latter-day Saints proclaim occurred as the early church drifted away 
		from its apostolic roots and foundation.&nbsp; By the time Greek thought 
		became an important factor in Christian theology, the apostasy had 
		already occurred.&nbsp; Many Latter-day Saints do not understand this fact:&nbsp; 
		Greek philosophy was integrated into Christian theology, but it occurred 
		after the apostasy had already taken place, primarily in response to the 
		dangerous teachings of schismatic groups in the third century AD.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The God of the Greek 
		philosophers, the God of the creeds and councils, was immaterial, 
		without body, parts or passions.&nbsp; The idea that God has a body of flesh 
		and bones was to them utterly incomprehensible and logically 
		unacceptable.&nbsp; The body is intrinsically wicked, corrupt and evil, or so 
		they thought.&nbsp; For example, the neoplatonist thinker Plotinus, who lived 
		in the third century of the Christian era, was reputed to be ashamed 
		that his soul had a body and could not endure to discuss his lineage, 
		nor his parents, nor his fatherland (Romer, <i>Testament</i>, p. 209).&nbsp; 
		Belief in an embodied God was, however, common among early Christians.&nbsp; 
		As Christian apologists attempted to reconcile Greek philosophy with 
		Christian beliefs, it was not long before the corporeal nature of God 
		came under attack.&nbsp; By Augustines time in the fifth century, most 
		Christian theologies had embraced the apostate neoplatonic view that God 
		is immaterial.&nbsp; As Professor David L. Paulsen of BYU-Provo has noted:&nbsp; 
		The confluence of Christian and Greek thought in the first five 
		centuries of the church would devastate the theological landscape for 
		many more centuries to come. &nbsp;Some truths would be altered, others, like 
		divine embodiment, would be completely flipped on their head.&nbsp; There had 
		occurred a turning away from the truthan apostasy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the most egregious 
		errors of the Council at Nicea was the notion that the Son is 
		consubstantial&nbsp; (of one substance) with the Father.&nbsp; The term, 
		reportedly proposed by the Emperor Constantine himself, apparently was 
		introduced into Christian theology in an attempt to reconcile different 
		views on the nature of the Godhead.&nbsp; The idea of consubstantiality does 
		not appear in the scriptures and prior to Nicea had not been used in 
		Christian tradition either.&nbsp; But Constantines attempts to enforce unity 
		on the matter, while superficially successful in the short run, just 
		didnt work for long.&nbsp; Doctrinal differences between the Eastern (Greek) 
		and Western (Roman or Latin) churches continued to plague Christianity 
		for centuries.&nbsp; Western bishops objected strongly to the contention that 
		the Holy Spirit proceedeth from the Father.&nbsp; They insisted on adding 
		the words and the Son, so that the Holy Ghost was described as He who 
		proceedeth from the Father and the Son.&nbsp; This additional clause, known 
		as the <i>Filioque</i>, was recited as part of the Catholic Mass in 
		Western churches by the ninth century AD and played a significant role 
		in the growing separation between Western and Eastern orthodoxy.&nbsp; The 
		increasing separation and open hostility between East and West 
		culminated in June of 1054 AD when Pope Leo IXs representatives in 
		Constantinople excommunicated the Greek patriarch. He and other Eastern 
		patriarchs could play the same game:&nbsp; they promptly excommunicated their 
		Roman Catholic counterparts.&nbsp; Christendom was split asunder, left 
		drifting without the apostolic moorings enjoyed by the primitive 
		church.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Great Schism, as it came 
		to be known, remains extant today, though most of our Christian brethren 
		dont talk about it very much, and most Christians, I warrant, dont 
		even know of its continued existence.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Latter-day Saint views on the 
		nature of God rest upon the power of the glorious theophany at&nbsp; 
		Palmyra&#9472;those events on a spring day in 1820 when the boy Joseph Smith 
		saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, 
		standing above [him] in the air (<i>JS-H</i> 17).&nbsp; That appearance, by 
		two separate, distinct Divine individuals, brought more truth and light 
		to mortal understanding of the nature of God than all of the learned 
		councils ever convened, and all of the creeds ever produced.&nbsp; In an 
		instant, the errors of nearly two millennia were swept away, and the 
		true natures of the Father and Son were again revealed to mankind.&nbsp; The 
		curtain was parted on a new dispensation of the gospel&#9472;the dispensation 
		of the fullness of times.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph Smiths understanding 
		of the nature of God, acquired through both study and personal 
		experience, differs from that of some other Christians.&nbsp; In perhaps his 
		most famous public address, the King Follett discourse delivered on 
		April 7, 1844, Joseph proclaimed the great secret that God himself 
		was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in 
		yonder heavensIf the veil were rent today, and the great God who holds 
		this world in its orbit, and who upholds all worlds and all things by 
		His power, was to make himself visible,&#9472;I say, if you were to see him 
		today, you would see him like a man in form&#9472;like yourselves in all the 
		person, image, and very form as a man(<i>HC</i> 6:305).&nbsp; So we testify 
		to all the world that the three members of the Godhead, though perfectly 
		united in thought and purpose, are separate and distinct individuals.&nbsp; 
		God the Father and His resurrected Holy Son, Jesus Christ, are glorified 
		persons with tangible bodies of flesh and bones.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost, the 
		other member of the Godhead, is a personage of spirit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder James E. Talmage 
		explained the Latter-day Saint concept of the unity of God, which though 
		asserting that the Godhead consists of three separate Beings, speaks 
		also to their perfect and complete unity of thought, purpose, and 
		operation.&nbsp; He said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;This unity is a type of 
		completeness; the mind of any one member of the Trinity is the mind of 
		the others; seeing as each of them does with the eye of perfection, they 
		see and understand alike.&nbsp; Under any given conditions each would act in 
		the same way, guided by the same principles of unerring justice and 
		equity.&nbsp; The one-ness of the Godhead, to which the scriptures so 
		abundantly testify, implies no mystical union of substance, nor any 
		unnatural and therefore impossible blending of personality.&nbsp; Father, 
		Son, and Holy Ghost are as distinct in their persons and individualities 
		as are any three personages in mortality.&nbsp; Yet their unity of purpose 
		and operation is such as to make their edicts one, and their will the 
		will of God (<i>A Study of the Articles of Faith</i>, p. 37).&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some Christians believe that 
		Latter-day Saint rejection of the concept of the Trinity as understood 
		by many simply puts us beyond the pale, and renders us ineligible for 
		inclusion in the Christian community.&nbsp; But I reiterate:&nbsp; nowhere in the 
		New Testament do we find any explicit Trinitarian doctrine, nor even any 
		mention of the word Trinity.&nbsp; Neither Peter nor Paul, nor Jesus Himself, 
		preached it.&nbsp; <i>Harpers Bible Dictionary</i> notes this fact:&nbsp; the 
		formal doctrine of the Trinity as it was defined by the great church 
		councils of the fourth and fifth centuries is not to be found in the New 
		Testament.&nbsp; Two verses in the King James version of the Bible have been 
		used in vain attempts to strengthen the view that the concept of the 
		Trinity, as it is understood by many Christians, is scriptural in 
		origin.&nbsp; But those two verses, in 1 John 5:7-8, in fact represent not an 
		example of Biblical inerrancy, but rather changes in the Biblical record 
		which have occurred over time.&nbsp; Professor Bart Ehrman at the University 
		of North Carolina, one of the leading New Testament scholars of our 
		time, and a man who by his own admission has no religious faith, tells 
		the checkered story of the two verses concerned.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 1515 the Dutch humanist 
		Erasmus produced the first printed (as compared to hand copied) edition 
		of the Greek New Testament.&nbsp; In doing so, he relied heavily on 
		manuscripts which had been produced well over a thousand years after the 
		originals.&nbsp; He did not include an account given in 1 John 5:7-8, because 
		it is not found in any Greek manuscripts prior to the sixteenth century 
		AD, though it is found in the manuscripts of earlier versions of the 
		Latin Vulgate.&nbsp; (The Vulgate was translated by Jerome at the command of 
		Pope Damasus in the late fourth and early fifth centuries.&nbsp; It was the 
		Bible of the Western church for a thousand years.)&nbsp; In the Vulgate, 1 
		John 5:7-8 reads:&nbsp; For there are three that bear record in heaven, the 
		father, the word and the spirit; and these three are one; and there are 
		three that bear witness on earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood, 
		and these three are one.&nbsp; Almost exactly the same wording is found in 
		the King James Bible.&nbsp; This is the only passage in the Bible used by 
		many Christians which alludes to the concept that there are three 
		personages in the Godhead but they constitute one God, and are of one 
		substance.&nbsp; As such, it was an obvious candidate for inclusion in a 
		version corrected by an unknown scribe who wished to make certain 
		readers would have the truth as he saw it.&nbsp; The earliest evidence of a 
		change in the original wording of 1 John apparently comes from a 
		manuscript of heretical origin, coming from North Africa or Spain in the 
		fourth or fifth century AD.&nbsp; But Erasmus did not find this wording in 
		his Greek manuscripts, which read as follows:&nbsp; There are three that 
		bear witness:&nbsp; the spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are 
		one.&nbsp; There is no reference in the Greek manuscripts to the father, 
		the word, and the spirit.&nbsp; Erasmus, of course, did not include the 
		father, the word, and the spirit in his Greek text.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Bart Ehrman recounts the 
		story in his book, <i>Misquoting Jesus</i> (Harper, 2005), a fury broke 
		out among theologians.&nbsp; Erasmus was denounced, accused of tampering with 
		the doctrine of the Trinity.&nbsp; He replied that if the text found in the 
		Vulgate could be found in any Greek New Testament, he would include it 
		in his next revision.&nbsp; Evidently, so Ehrman proclaims, someone 
		manufactured such a text by copying out the Greek text and substituting 
		the Latin text found in the Vulgate for the passage in question, 
		translating it into Greek, of course.&nbsp; This was presented to Erasmus, 
		who dutifully included the revised wording in his subsequent editions.&nbsp; 
		Interestingly enough, these Greek texts provided the form of the text 
		used in producing the King James Bible so familiar to us today, even 
		though the words in what scholars call the Johannine Comma are <i>not</i> 
		found in what Ehrman considers to be the oldest and best manuscripts 
		of the Greek New Testament.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It seems possible, even 
		perhaps probable, that an unknown scribe, attempting to provide proof 
		for the false doctrine of the oneness in substance of the Trinity, 
		altered 1 John 5:7-8 to support the apostate notion that the Father, 
		Son, and Holy Ghost are one in substance, not separate beings.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Latter-day Saints also 
		believe&#9472;as Joseph Smith and his prophet-successors have taught&#9472;that 
		human beings have the potential to become gods, over the eons of time 
		encompassed by our eternal existence.&nbsp; We take at face-value Christs 
		admonition:&nbsp; Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in 
		heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48).&nbsp; We know very little about how this may 
		be done, though it clearly will not, and indeed cannot, be accomplished 
		in mortality.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith understood that 
		deification is the task of the eternities.&nbsp; Said he:&nbsp; When you climb up 
		a ladder, you must begin at the bottom and ascend step by step, until 
		you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the 
		gospelBut it will be a good while after you have passed through the 
		veil before you will have learned them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not all to be 
		comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our 
		salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave (<i>HC</i> 6:306-307).&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Further, we do not believe 
		that our understanding of deification will ever lead us to become the 
		equals of God or independent of Him.&nbsp; We ever will be His sons and 
		daughters, with all that implies in terms of filial obligations, 
		position, and responsibilities.&nbsp; Though we may become joint-heirs with 
		Christ (Romans 8:17), we believe this is received only through the 
		Saviors Atonement.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some other Christians reject 
		Mormon belief in the potential for deification of mankind as blasphemous 
		pagan doctrine which demeans the majesty of God.&nbsp; But Professor Stephen 
		Robinson of BYU-Provo, in his instructive book, <i>Are Mormons 
		Christians</i>? points out that many orthodox Christian Saints, from 
		Saint Irenaeus in the second century, and including Saint Clement of 
		Alexandria, Saint Justin Martyr, Saint Athanasius, Saint Augustine, 
		Saint Symeon the New Theologian and numerous others, all believed and 
		taught that the Word was made flesh in order that we might be enabled 
		to be made gods. (to quote Athanasius felicitous phrase).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Furthermore, C. S. Lewis, an 
		individual whose genuine Christianity is virtually undisputed, taught 
		the same doctrine.&nbsp; Wrote he:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;The command <i>Be ye 
		perfect</i> is not idealistic gas.&nbsp; Nor is it a command to do the 
		impossible.&nbsp; He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that 
		command.&nbsp; He said (in the Bible) that we were gods and He is going to 
		make good His words.&nbsp; If we let Him&#9472;for we can prevent Him, if we 
		choose&#9472;He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or 
		goddess, dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through 
		with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a 
		bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of 
		course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and 
		goodness.&nbsp; The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that 
		is what we are in for.&nbsp; Nothing less.&nbsp; He meant what He said (<i>Mere 
		Christianity</i>, pp. 174-175).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Time permits only a 
		superficial glance at another doctrinal element which separates 
		Latter-day Saints from many other Christians, who labor under the 
		misguided misapprehension that men will be punished for Adams 
		transgression&#9472;that all humankind is born with an inherited fatal moral 
		defect coming from Adam, and that the only way to gain salvation is to 
		repent of Adams sin and be baptized, infants included.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Latter-day Saints reject this 
		view, categorically and unequivocally.&nbsp; We believe it runs counter to 
		the whole concept of the Fall and the Atonement.&nbsp; It removes from 
		humanity the wondrous gift of agency.&nbsp; Furthermore, the heretical view 
		that infants require baptism to be saved flies in the face of the divine 
		condemnation of such an abominable practice.&nbsp; The scriptures attest that 
		infant baptism is a solemn mockery before God.&nbsp; Little children are 
		not capable of committing sin, and the curse of Adam is taken from them 
		in [Christ] (see Moroni 8).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We state boldly that all who 
		reach the age of accountability are responsible for their own sins, not 
		those of Adam.&nbsp; That is what the Plan of Salvation is all about:&nbsp; all 
		who are considered morally accountable will be judged according to their 
		own works, subject of course to the need for individual repentance and 
		overarched by Christs Atonement.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Earlier in this presentation 
		I pled that although we disagree with other Christians on numerous 
		significant doctrinal issues, we should take special care to avoid the 
		name-calling and invective which too commonly takes the place of 
		respectful and reasoned dialogue between Latter-day Saints and those not 
		of our faith.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Gordon B. Hinckley 
		has reminded us often of how we should behave towards others not of our 
		faith:&nbsp; [We] can all be a little kinder, a little more generous, a 
		little more thoughtful of one another.&nbsp; We can be a little more tolerant 
		and friendly to those not of our faith, going out of our way to show our 
		respect for them.&nbsp; We cannot afford to be arrogant or self-righteous.&nbsp; 
		It is our obligation to reach out in helpfulness, not only to our own, 
		but to all others as well (<i>Ensign</i>, May, 1999, p. 88).&nbsp; Our 
		beloved prophets views on respecting the rights of others not of our 
		faith echo those of Joseph Smith, spoken in July of 1843:&nbsp; If it has 
		been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a Mormon, I am 
		bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in 
		defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any 
		other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the 
		rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the 
		Roman Catholics, or of any other denomination who may be unpopular and 
		too weak to defend themselves (<i>HC</i> 5:498).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In remarks Elder M. Russell 
		Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave at General Conference 
		in November 2001, he stated:&nbsp; If we are truly disciples of the Lord 
		Jesus Christ, we will reach out with love and understanding to all our 
		neighbors at all times, particularly in times of need.&nbsp; There are some 
		of our [LDS] members who may fail to reach out with friendly smiles, 
		warm handshakes, and loving service to all of their neighbors.&nbsp; At the 
		same time, there may be those who move into our neighborhoods who are 
		not of our faith who come with negative preconceptions about the Church 
		and its members.&nbsp; Surely good neighbors should put forth every effort to 
		understand each other and to be kind to one another regardless of 
		religion, nationality, race or culture (<i>Ensign</i>, Nov. 2001, p. 
		36).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This&#59450;the doctrine of 
		inclusion&#59450;remains the standard which must govern our actions towards 
		others not of our faith.&nbsp; It is what I have been taught from my earliest 
		years, and what I try to teach others, both by precept and example.&nbsp; And 
		it is what the living prophets and apostles teach over and over again.&nbsp; 
		Never in all of my life have I ever heard members of this Church urged 
		by our leaders to be anything other than loving, kind, respectful and 
		benevolent to our friends and neighbors who are not of our faith.&nbsp; As we 
		grow to respect and understand others, we soon learn that the Latter-day 
		Saints have no monopoly on goodness.&nbsp; We quickly find, as we reach out 
		to others in love and respect, that those not of our faith are, in the 
		main, good and honorable people, as we should be.&nbsp; They love their 
		families, as we do.&nbsp; They are kind, loving, generous and faithful, as we 
		strive to be.&nbsp; With us, they long for peace&#59450;that lovely child of 
		heaven&#59450;for a laying aside of the ancient tribal hatreds, the wicked 
		beliefs in racial or ethnic superiority, the bigotry and ignorance which 
		continue to bedevil the human race.&nbsp; I urge all to accept and live this 
		simple truth:&nbsp; there is much more which unites us than divides us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, of course, as Ive 
		already noted, there are differences&#59450;significant differences&#59450;in the 
		theology, doctrine and ordinances of the Latter-day Saints and other 
		Christian communities.&nbsp; We must never bend on matters of principle, if 
		we are to be true to the heavy responsibility God has placed upon the 
		Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; We must always uphold the truth, as God has given it 
		to us, regardless of what others may say.&nbsp; We must be bold&#59450;but not 
		overbearing (see Alma 38:12)&#59450;in proclaiming to all the world that the 
		everlasting gospel of Christ has been restored to the earth for the last 
		time, for the blessing of all humankind.&nbsp; But we can do so without being 
		disrespectful of others.&nbsp; We can&#59450;if the situation requires it&#59450;disagree 
		politely and quietly, without being disagreeable.&nbsp; We need not belittle 
		others to sustain our own position.&nbsp; We can speak of principles, rather 
		than harping on personalities.&nbsp; And we can acknowledge the sincerity and 
		good will of others who dont believe as we do.&nbsp; We can, as one of our 
		Articles of Faith indicates, allow all men the privilege [of worshipping 
		Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience] let 
		them worship how, when, or what they may (<i>Articles of Faith</i> 
		1:11).&nbsp; We all must look for the best, not the worst, in others, 
		recognizing there is much each can learn from the rich diversity of 
		viewpoints in our communities, wherever they are.&nbsp; In that diversity 
		there is great vitality, strength and renewal.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe that in our 
		relationships with others we must go beyond tolerance, to a higher 
		plane, which President Hinckley has called affirmative gratitude (BYU 
		1990-91 <i>Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>, Oct. 16, 1990, p. 30).&nbsp; 
		Tolerance too often implies a mean-spirited, begrudging 
		putting-up-with others, just because we cant demand or require them to 
		change.&nbsp; Too often, I tolerate your behavior, even though I dont like 
		it, only because I lack the power to change it, forcibly if necessary.&nbsp; 
		Affirmative gratitude, on the other hand, connotes the positive values 
		of respect, understanding, and appreciation, all of which we need 
		to embrace, nurture and employ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I assert again that there is 
		much more which unites us than divides us from others.&nbsp; What are the 
		hoops of steel which bind us to others, including those we might 
		foolishly consider as strangers and foreigners?&nbsp; Perhaps of greatest 
		importance is the reality that we are all the children of God and thus, 
		in the most profound sense, brothers and sisters.&nbsp; We are all part of a 
		great family, with God as our Father.&nbsp; Truly, as the Apostle Paul 
		proclaimed in Athens two millennia ago, And [God] hath made of one 
		blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth 
		(Acts 17:26).&nbsp; As we look beyond the differences of skin color, 
		ethnicity, culture&#59450;even religious faith&#59450;we come to understand that all 
		of us are partakers of shared humanity, and are thereby bound together 
		as members of the human family.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We are bound to others&#59450;and 
		they to us&#59450;by the indissoluble bonds of sibling responsibilities and 
		affection.&nbsp; And thus, we carry in our hearts&#59450;as should all men 
		everywhere&#59450;a desire to succor the poor and needy, to help the widow and 
		orphan in their distress, to lift the burdens from the backs of the 
		suffering, and to bring a healing balm of Gilead to all who seek solace 
		from alienation, discrimination, bigotry, poverty and hopelessness.&nbsp; 
		Joseph Smith, the mighty Prophet of the Restoration, revealed a great 
		truth when he said:&nbsp; a man filled with the love of God, is not content 
		with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, 
		anxious to bless the whole human race (<i>HC</i> 4:227).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All good people everywhere 
		are unwilling to condone violent lawlessness as an acceptable way to 
		deal with their differences.&nbsp; They recognize the need for all of us to 
		work harder to build mutual respect and understanding, regardless of the 
		doctrines and philosophies any individual or group may espouse.&nbsp; They 
		understand the importance of civility and courtesy towards others, and 
		practice those attributes of good character daily.&nbsp; And they teach their 
		children to do likewise.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All of us would agree, I 
		think, that our children must rank high on any list of the ties which 
		bind us to everyone else in our community.&nbsp; Our children, in a very real 
		way, are the community of the future.&nbsp; They are our tomorrow, for better 
		or worse.&nbsp; They need love, protection, education and encouragement.&nbsp; 
		They thrive on sunshine and light, and are weakened and blighted by the 
		darkness and sin of the world.&nbsp; On a global basis, they bear far more 
		than their share of suffering and sacrifice.&nbsp; About 120 million 
		children, worldwide, do not go even to primary school, but labor often 
		for long hours at home, in the fields, on the streets, or in crowded, 
		dingy, and unsafe sweatshops.&nbsp; Infectious diseases take the lives of 
		millions in developing countries each year.&nbsp; Abuse and neglect of 
		children are prevalent evils in every nation.&nbsp; We cannot be true 
		disciples of the Master unless we care about them, and for them, with 
		the same tender love He espoused (see 3 Nephi 17:21-25).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My plea, then, is that we 
		reject the too-common tendency to fixate on our differences and avoid 
		obsessing on so-called divides.&nbsp; Too often, such become not only 
		self-indulgent carping and complaining, but ultimately evolve into a 
		destructive, self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; Rather, let us work together 
		with others of good will and good hearts, building the bridges which 
		unite us and further the common good.&nbsp; As we respect the rights of 
		others to believe as they wish, we join together in respecting, 
		understanding and appreciating our differences, and each other.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I end where I began:&nbsp; Are 
		Mormons Christians?&nbsp; The answer, to me, is simple.&nbsp; Yes, indeed we are 
		Christians, though our views on many important doctrines differ from 
		numerous of our brethren, whose Christianity we in turn do not dispute.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Testimony.&nbsp; In the name of 
		Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am deeply humbled by this 
		opportunity and have sought after the strength and wisdom of the Holy 
		Ghost to know what I should share with you today.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The best way I knew how to 
		approach preparing this talk was to look carefully at my own testimony, 
		why this gospel means so much to me, and how it has blessed my life.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was baptized into the 
		Church, which was nearly ten years ago now, I remember feeling such 
		great joy, freedom, and happiness and wishing that I could tell the 
		whole world what I was feeling.&nbsp; I wanted to share this joy and the 
		message that had been shared with me.&nbsp; The message that Jesus Christ 
		lives and that there is hope and freedom through our Savior and that 
		there is a way to find the truth; the truth to the questions:&nbsp; Who am 
		I?&nbsp; Why am I here? And what will happen to me after this life?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and Covenants 
		section 128 verse 23 describes what I was feeling at this time.&nbsp; It 
		reads: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye 
			valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of 
			your Eternal King!&nbsp; And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down 
			with gladness.&nbsp; Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise 
			the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy!&nbsp; And let the sun, moon, 
			and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God 
			shout for joy!&nbsp; And let the eternal creations declare his name 
			forever and ever!&nbsp; And again I say, how glorious is the voice we 
			hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and 
			honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, 
			and powers!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many people in this world 
		spend a great deal of time wondering if it is possible to be happy and 
		have peace in this life.&nbsp; And if it is possible to be happy, they wonder 
		how.&nbsp; Many struggle to find strength and guidance that they feel they 
		can rely on.&nbsp; I had all of these same questions, thoughts, and struggles 
		before I learned about the gospel.&nbsp; But I have learned since then, that 
		even with our knowledge of the gospel in this life, it takes daily 
		devotion and commitment to retain a remembrance and assurance of all 
		that we believe to be true.&nbsp; We cannot afford to settle into an attitude 
		of complacency or allow ourselves to be overcome with despair or 
		discouragement.&nbsp; We must seek out the light of Christ to light our path 
		and lift our hearts.&nbsp; This gospel is a gospel of covenants in which we 
		bind ourselves to the Lord and to one another in goodness and love.&nbsp; In 
		order to make this possible, repentance needs to be a means of 
		overcoming our weaknesses and struggles, and allowing the Holy Ghost to 
		help us in searching out the hope and promise of eternal life.&nbsp; Most 
		important of all, we need to do all we can to proclaim the gospel and 
		share the light of Christ with others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In Matthew 5:14-16 we are

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Being touched by and seeking

		to tell me about this message of hope and good news and that there was 
		greater meaning and fulfillment to be learned and enjoyed while in this 
		mortal life.&nbsp; I could see and feel this light of Christ reflected 
		through these special people.&nbsp; Their light touched my being and I knew 
		that something very important was happening within me.&nbsp; I didnt feel as 
		uncertain, alone, or weary of the future anymore.&nbsp; Instead I felt a 
		protective power embracing me and I felt the greatest sense of hope I

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first of these angels

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The other sweet angels who

		their home.&nbsp; They were beautiful.&nbsp; Their light radiated and filled their

			Spirit of Christ.&nbsp; This is the light that quickens our

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Seeking after and discerning

<font color="#000080">I fear that some members of the Lords Church

			block out the influence of the Holy Ghost, preventing them from 
			recognizing spiritual promptings.&nbsp; This is a noisy and busy world 
			that we live in.&nbsp; Remember that being busy is not necessarily being

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The evening before I was

		force was able to find a way to eat at me in an attempt to weaken my 
		heart and confuse my understanding about being baptized.&nbsp; Up to that 
		point throughout my study with the missionaries, I had had an unwavering 
		conviction that this gospel was more true than anything I had known and 
		that being baptized was the one thing in my life I hadnt any 
		uncertainty about.&nbsp; Now all of a sudden these feelings of light, love, 
		and joy seemed under attack.&nbsp; This was my first experience in seeing how 
		clever, how deceptive, and how powerful the work of the adversary can 
		be, especially when he realizes he is about to lose as great an 
		influence over another of Heavenly Fathers children.&nbsp; I had such 
		comfort and peace knowing that I was making a good decision and yet I 
		was blind sighted by this distressing force of darkness.&nbsp; This was a 
		great lesson to me that the work of Satan is very real and can be very 
		powerful, and in a cunning manner.&nbsp; He knows how to get at the deepest 
		and most tender parts of our heart to hurt us if we let him.&nbsp; This is 
		why it is so important to be truly faithful in our discipleship and to 
		continually strive to draw closer to the love of God.</font></p>

		living a life that will allow her to reach the potential the Lord gave

		or she is like a sun in a community.&nbsp; We should ask ourselves, Have I 
		really experienced the joy of loving?&nbsp; True love is love that causes us 
		pain, that hurts, and yet brings us joy.&nbsp; That is why we must pray and 
		ask for the courage to love.</font></p>

		humbled by this sacred responsibility to speak to you today. This campus 
		holds a very special place in my heartnot because I attended here as a 
		student, but because I spent two months of my mission here. I attended 
		the Language Training Mission that was established at Ricks College for 
		the Scandinavian and Dutch languages.&nbsp; It was here that I learned some 
		of the formative lessons of my mission and of life, so when I set foot 
		on this campus, fond memories flowed.&nbsp; My wife, Mona, graduated from

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>A Worldwide Church</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 1833 Joseph Smith 
		prophesied, It shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall 
		hear the fullness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own 
		language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the 
		administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for the revelation 
		of Jesus Christ (D&amp;C 90:11).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify to you that this 
		prophecy is now being fulfilled. I witness its fulfillment every day in 
		my work in the Translation Division of the Church.&nbsp; Through the use of 
		amazing latter-day technology, we can broadcast the words of the 
		apostles and prophets to members of the Church in 90 languages. &nbsp;The 
		Book of Mormon has been translated into 106 languages, providing this 
		testament of Jesus Christ to over 99 percent of Church members. The Book 
		of Mormon is indeed flooding the earth.&nbsp; When the people can read the 
		scriptures in the language of their heart, they rejoice and the work of 
		the Lord begins to flourish. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The temple ordinances have 
		been translated into over 80 languages, and curriculum materials have 
		been translated into more than 100 languages.&nbsp; On any given day, the 
		Translation Division is working on over 1,800 projects. With our 
		translation offices and teams spread throughout the world, I can 
		honestly say that the sun never sets on translation. This truly is a 
		worldwide Church. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To those of you whom the Lord 
		has blessed with a second language, I would say, keep your language 
		capabilities sharp. You have been given a gift: the spiritual gift of 
		tongues. Please consider that sacred. As you strive to maintain and 
		develop this gift, the Lord will bless you with opportunities for 
		service in His Church. Your children will be blessed with a greater 
		knowledge of other peoples and cultures, and they will likely have a 
		desire to learn a second language toothen they will go on to bless 
		others. You will never know how many people will be blessed because of 
		your efforts. This spiritual gift has blessed my life and has enabled me 
		to work in a profession that is so fulfilling and rewarding. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Sun Valley Experience</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, as I have pondered and 
		prayed about what I might say to you, my thoughts have taken me to an 
		experience I had in Sun Valley, Idaho, when I was your age. Being a 
		Logan boy, I chose to go to school at Utah State University, and, 
		following in my fathers and friends footsteps, I joined a fraternity. 
		That fraternity had a tradition of holding what they called the Spring 
		Formal, a dance held on a long weekend that was always held off campus. 
		It was an exciting time, a chance to get away, and for me that year it 
		was also a chance to spend some time with Mona, whom I had fallen in 
		love with. We had a great time on Friday and Saturday exploring the 
		sights and surroundings, and the weekend culminated with a dance at the 
		Sun Valley resort on Saturday night. Of course, we were up late. After 
		we dropped off our dates and returned to the condominium some of us 
		returned missionaries were staying at, someone asked about going to 
		priesthood meeting early the next morning. Well, I said I was going to 
		go. There were no other takers. In fact, there were a lot of excuses 
		about it being so late and needing to sleep in, and there were a few 
		pokes about my being self-righteous. Nonetheless, I determined I was 
		going to go. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Priesthood meeting started at 
		7:00 a.m. That made for a pretty short night. I got up early, quietly 
		got ready, and left the extremely dark and quiet condo alone. I drove to 
		the meetinghouse, and as I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed there 
		were no cars there. I thought, Well, I must be early, and everyone is 
		running on Mormon standard time. As I approached the door, I saw a 
		piece of paper taped to the glass with a hand written message that read, 
		No meetings today. Stake conference in Ketchum.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I got in the car and started 
		to drive back to the condo. I thought, Boy, am I going to take a 
		ribbing for getting up so early to go to church only to find that there 
		were no meetings to go to. Ill be laughed at, and my friends will feel 
		justified in their decision to sleep in. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Even now I find it difficult 
		to describe what happened next. An overwhelming feeling of love came 
		over me, and a voice seemed to whisper to me that my effort, my 
		willingness to be obedient, and my sacrifice were recognized by the 
		Lord. He knew what was in my heart, and He accounted it unto me for 
		righteousness. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well, I did take a ribbing. 
		My friends laughed at me, and they felt justified in their decision to 
		sleep in. But I knew the Lord knew what was in my heart and He had 
		confirmed this to me in a very personal, special, and sacred way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have since pondered that 
		experience and cherished the memory of the feelings that I had at that 
		time. I call it my Sun Valley experience. As I have studied the 
		scriptures, I have found a pattern and examples that explain what I felt 
		that day. Let me share with you just four of the many examples in the 
		scriptures that help illustrate what I want you to understand. </font>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">To See What Is in Your 
		Heart</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first scripture takes us 
		to our premortal existence at the time the world was created. I have 
		been told that you have your scriptures and are ready to learn, so lets 
		turn to Abraham 3:24-25 to see if we can understand why we have come to 
		earthwhat our purpose in life is. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There stood one among 
			them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with 
			him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of 
			these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;
			</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And we will prove them 
			herewith, <i>to see if they will do all things</i> whatsoever the 
			Lord their God shall command them (italics added).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">God has sent us to this earth 
		so that He may prove or test us to see whether we are willing to do all 
		that He commands us to do. Through a series of proving events, we show 
		the Lord what is in our hearts and whether we will keep the commandments 
		or not.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second example comes from 
		the book of Deuteronomy. Here we read that the children of Israel had 
		wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Surely it should not take them 
		40 years to get from Egypt to the waters of Jordan and Jericho. Why were 
		they out there so long? Lets read what the Lord says in chapter 8, 
		verse 2:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Thou shalt remember all 
			the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the 
			wilderness, <i>to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was 
			in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no</i> 
			(italics added)<i>.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So what was the purpose? It 
		was to humble the children of Israel, to prove them, to show what was in 
		their heartswhether they would keep the commandments or not. Our 
		Heavenly Father is carefully observing our thoughts, actions, deeds, and 
		desires to see if we will obeyto know our hearts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The third example I would 
		like to share is the story of Abraham and his son, Isaac. Lets turn to 
		Genesis 22:114.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first verse says that 
		God did tempt Abraham or, if we translate the Hebrew differently, God 
		did test or prove Abraham. God asks Abraham to take now thy son, thine 
		only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; 
		and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which 
		I will tell thee of (v. 2).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Can you imagine the struggle 
		that must have been going on in Abrahams mind? But Abraham made the 
		preparations and obediently went unto the place of which God had told 
		him (v. 3). As they approached this place, Abraham told the two young 
		men who had traveled with them to wait. Abraham and Isaac took the wood, 
		the fire, and a knife and traveled further. Isaac sensed that something 
		was missing: the lamb. Abraham assured him that God would provide the 
		lamb.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As they came to the place God 
		had designated, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in 
		order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
		And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his 
		son (vv. 910). Now beginning in verse 11:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And the angel of the 
			Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and 
			he said, Here am I. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And Abraham lifted up 
			his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a 
			thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered 
			him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son (vv. 1113).
			</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Abraham proved his obedience 
		and his love of God in his willingness to sacrifice his son, a 
		similitude of the sacrifice of the Son of God. God came to know 
		Abrahams heart, and even more importantly, Abraham came to know his own 
		heart. The experience fortified and strengthened his faith and his 
		ability and desire to keep the commandments.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is a key scripture in 
		Doctrine and Covenants 132:36 that summarizes Abrahams experience so 
		well: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Abraham was </font>
<a title="Gen. 22: 2 (2-12)." style="color: #40639D; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/132/36a">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For the fourth example, let 
		us turn to Doctrine and Covenants 117:1213. These verses refer to 
		Oliver Granger. You are probably not very familiar with that name, but 
		the Lord said that Oliver Grangers name: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">shall be had in sacred 
			remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever (D&amp;C 
			117:12).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Oliver Granger was a faithful 
		member of the Church who was driven with the rest of the Saints from 
		Ohio to Missouri and then to Illinois. &nbsp;But each time he got settled, 
		the Prophet Joseph Smith called him to return to Kirtland, Ohio, to 
		settle the financial affairs of the Church and free the Kirtland Temple 
		of encumbrances.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Oliver Granger performed his 
		work with such integrity and fairness that he earned from the Churchs 
		creditors the highest esteem and respect.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With that background, listen

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let him contend

			saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, </font><i>

		shall be more sacred unto me than his increase.<i> </i>Is not the Lord 
		saying that Oliver Grangers efforts, the desires of his heart, and his

		your premortal life and experience with your Heavenly Father. You have 
		come to this earth for a special purposeto be proven, to be tried and 
		tested to see if you love your Heavenly Father and are willing to keep 
		His commandments. You may not be successful in all ways, but the Lord 
		will come to know your heart. He will come to know of your love for Him 
		and to know how you will use your agency. Most importantly, you will

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The Final Judgment

			for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, 
			ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits 
			required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus 
			Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly

<p class="citation"><font face="Times New Roman">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">The tests of life wont 
		be like those you are taking here at the university, where you know

		tests come to you as life unfolds, and they will be tailored to you and 
		your own development and growth, giving you an opportunity to apply the 
		things that you have learnedto apply the teachings of our Heavenly 
		Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, in the situations of life. Some of 
		them we bring upon ourselves because of poor decisions or wrong choices. 
		Oh, and dont look across the street at your neighbor and wonder when he 
		or she will get the same test you are experiencing. &nbsp;Not everyones 
		tests are the same. Life isnt like Disneyland, where we all go on the 
		same rides and have the same experiences, thrills, challenges. No, our 
		tests are customized, fit to our faith, our capacity to withstand, our 
		ability to endure, our need to develop in one aspect or another. </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But, all tests have the same 
		purpose: to reveal what is in our heart, to show whether we love God 
		with all our heart, mind, and strength, and to show whether we will keep 
		His commandments. These experiences can help us build and strengthen our 
		faith and develop our capabilities, skills, talents, and gifts. </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever pondered the 
		phrase we hear quite commonly in the Church, the trial of your faith? 
		In the past, I have taken it to mean simply a time of adversity, 
		trouble, or affliction that we somehow need to endure well. But there is 
		another meaning of the word trial that can help us understand the true 
		purpose of the adversities of life. A trial is a formal examination, in 
		which evidence is presented and a judgment is made. In this life your 
		faith is on trial. This trial happens through experiences in life, 
		situations you are placed in that require you to make a decision, and 
		special tests that your Heavenly Father creates for you to show whether 
		you love Him with all your heart and whether you will keep His 
		commandments or not.</font></p>
<p class="citation"><font face="Times New Roman">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">Through the experiences 
		of life, the things that happen to you everyday, your interaction with 
		others, and your reaction to situations you are placed in, your Heavenly 
		Father comes to know what is in your heart. My Sun Valley experience

		see one who obeys the commandments of God? Do they see one who is 
		willing to testify of truth and defend the faith? Do they see an example 
		of humility and meekness? Do they recognize that there is something

		Church, how you treat others, your anonymous acts of service, your 
		payment of tithes and offerings, your attitudes and outlooks, your 
		honesty, the music you listen to, the TV shows and movies you watch, the

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">Your Plan of Salvation</span></b></font></p>
<p class="citation"><font face="Times New Roman">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">If I were to ask, How 
		many plans of salvation are there? the correct answer would be that 
		there is one plan of salvation. It is the great plan of happiness 
		(Alma 42:8) that our Heavenly Father has prepared for us. It is the plan 
		He is using to carry out His work and glory, to bring to pass the 
		immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39). It includes 
		commandments that everyone must obey and ordinances that everyone must 
		receive. But this wonderful plan of salvation also includes many 
		elements that are personalized, customized, tailor-made, with 
		opportunities, experiences, trials and tribulations, and blessings that 
		are uniquely yours. Your Heavenly Father wants to prepare you personally 
		to worthily return home and live with Him in eternal glory. I believe 
		that because of our experience with our Heavenly Father in our 
		pre-mortal existence, and because He loves each one of us so much and 
		knows each one of us so well, He has a very personal interest in the 
		experiences we have here in mortality. He has prepared a way for each 
		one of us, and He will give us the experiences that, if we are faithful 
		and obedient, will allow us to return home to live with Him. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, in your mind convert

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I sincerely pray that you

		I am grateful every day for the pattern the Lord has taught and 
		demonstrated for us to find ultimate joy and peace which is in my mind 
		returning His Holy presence.&nbsp; Isaiah counseled us to&nbsp; <i>Seek ye the 
		LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:</i>&nbsp; 
		(Isaiah 55:6)&nbsp; Then said he when we have sought and found the Lord <i>
		ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:</i> (Isaiah 
		55:12) In a few words, Isaiah is describing the ultimate feelings and 
		expression of Heaven which to me is embodied in the Lords commandment 
		to LOVE one another as He loved us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Saviors feelings of LOVE

		stop loving us.&nbsp; However, it is possible for us to offend Him through 
		our disobedience, and it is therefore incumbent upon us to reconcile 
		those offences so that the consequences of our behavior dont keep us 
		from His out stretched arms of mercy and love.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have often pondered the 
		experience of Father Lehi as he stood at the foot of the Tree of Life 
		having just partaken of the fruit of the tree.&nbsp; The scriptures record:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>12&nbsp; And as I partook of the fruit thereof 
			it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>13&nbsp; And as I cast my eyes round about, that 
			perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a river

			partaking the fruit.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>14&nbsp; And I looked to behold from whence it

			and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>15&nbsp; And it came to pass that I beckoned

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>16&nbsp; And it came to pass that they did come

<font color="#000080"><i>17&nbsp; And it came to pass that I was desirous

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>18&nbsp; And it came to pass that I saw them,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So it is with each of us, 
		brothers and sisters, we must of our own choice accept the Lords call 
		to come to the tree and partake of the fruit.&nbsp; But that is a subject for 
		another occasion.&nbsp; Today, I would like to focus on Lehis feelings &nbsp;as 
		he partook of the fruit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Recall to mind the words

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

		Love is the ultimate pattern and expression of God.&nbsp; It is through this

		Love can not be purchased or sold but it can be given and received.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to this insight from President Hinckley 
		as he recalled this experience from his childhood. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I was a little boy, we children traded 
		paper hearts at school on Valentine's Day. At night we dropped them at 
		the doors of our friends, stamping on the porch and then running in the 
		dark to hide.&nbsp; Almost without exception those valentines had printed on 
		their face, &quot;I <span class="hit">love</span> you.&quot; I have since come to 
		know that <span class="hit">love</span> is more than a paper heart.
		<span class="hit">Love</span> is of the very essence of life. It is the 
		pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Yet it is more than the end of 
		the rainbow. <span class="hit">Love</span> is at the beginning also, and 
		from it springs the beauty that arches across the sky on a stormy day.
		<span class="hit">Love</span> is the security for which children weep, 
		the yearning of youth, the adhesive that binds marriage, and the 
		lubricant that prevents devastating friction in the home; it is the 
		peace of old age, the sunlight of hope shining through death.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I repeat, Love can not be purchased or sold.&nbsp; 
		It is given freely and when genuine it is given without a condition of 
		anything in return.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">
		A few days ago I returned home after a long day in the office.&nbsp; As I 
		walked in the door I was met by our three year old granddaughter, Anna.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">
		With total love she reached her little hands out and said, Grandpa, you 
		home.&nbsp; Then she ran to me and wrapped her arms around my legs and put 
		her head on my knees.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you know what I felt?&nbsp; Love in its purest 
		form.&nbsp; But that was only the warm up.&nbsp; As we sat down to dinner, she 
		came back in the room and came over to where I was seated.&nbsp; She took 
		hold of my two fingers and squeezed them as tightly as her little hand 
		could squeeze.&nbsp; Then looking into my eyes and with a twinkle in hers she 
		said, I love you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;But even that was not the real magic of that 
		moment.&nbsp; The magic or power in her expression was that she had no 
		ulterior motive.&nbsp; She simply wanted to say what she felt within her 
		little heart and soul.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Such is the love spoken of by the Savior as 
		reflected in this favorite Hymn, </font></p>
<p class="bverse" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">As I 
		have loved you,<br />

		By this shall men know<br />
		Ye are my disciples,<br />
		If ye have love<br />
		One to another.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Through out His ministry, the 
		Savior demonstrated and expressed about the importance of showing and 
		being filled with LOVE. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Gospel of Mark records that the Savior was 
		asked, </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Which is the first commandment of all?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">29. Jesus answered: Thou shalt love the

			thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">30. And the second is like, namely this, 
			Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">31. There is none other commandment greater 
			than these </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Matthew records a similar

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What is the Law and the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These two statements of none

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span class="topic">President

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Looking at this rendering

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While traveling with Elder

		teaching had just been diagnosed with a serious disease and wondered if 
		it would be possible to receive a priesthood blessing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There were many alternative

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we arrived at the home 
		the womans husband and three year old daughter met us at the door.&nbsp; We 
		were ushered to a room where the mother was resting and waiting.&nbsp; In a 
		most gracious and loving way Elder Scott spoke to the family and taught 
		them of the Saviors Love.&nbsp; He then asked the woman if she would like a 
		blessing.&nbsp; Through her grateful tears and being full of faith she 
		responded, Yes. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I will long have in my

		Celestial Room.&nbsp; In a few minutes Mother walked into the Celestial Room

		Eastern Europe.&nbsp; As temples continue to grow we will see this magnet of 
		spiritual strength and LOVE spread out across the earth.&nbsp; President

		little to do with his reaching this level of love in life.&nbsp; He genuinely 
		loved his fellow man and tried with all his heart to serve them.&nbsp; Being 
		a member of the Church had no bearing on how he served them.&nbsp; Today 11 
		years after his death I still meet people who want to tell me of the 
		experiences they had with him where they felt the love of heaven.&nbsp; In 
		his later years he experienced a serious health challenge leaving him 
		unable to serve others as desired so gave his entire effort to loving 
		and blessing his children and grandchildren.&nbsp; In my mind he embodied the 
		message of&nbsp; this scripture.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>5 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Bible Dictionary we 
		read:&nbsp; A temple is literally a house of the Lord, a holy sanctuary in 
		which sacred ceremonies and ordinances of the gospel are performed by 
		and for the living and also in behalf of the dead.&nbsp; A place where the 
		Lord may come, it is the most holy of any place of worship on the 
		earth.&nbsp; Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I feel it is a wonderful 
		blessing to be living here in Rexburg during the construction and 
		opening of a new temple. &nbsp;I love the temple.&nbsp; I love the Idaho Falls 
		Temple.&nbsp; I love all of our temples. &nbsp;How did I come to love the temple?&nbsp; 
		Let me share a little bit about my experience with you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My mother taught me as a 
		child the importance of my parents temple marriage that sealed our 
		family together for eternity, and she taught me the importance of living 
		right and finding the right guy so that I, too, could be married in the 
		temple when I grew up.&nbsp; &nbsp;One day when I was about five years old, I said 
		to my mother, If a man ever asks me to marry him, I will first ask him 
		if he is a Mormon. &nbsp;She laughed and explained that it probably wouldnt 
		be a stranger who would ask me to marry him, although it turned out 
		almost to be true.&nbsp; When that proposal came, I did know that he was a 
		Mormon because I had found him in my ward at BYU; but he was pretty 
		nearly still a stranger when one week after meeting we first started 
		talking about marriage!&nbsp; We were married nine months later in the Salt 
		Lake Temple.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 1969 Marsha, my younger 
		sister, died at the age of 19.&nbsp; At the time of her death my older 
		sister, Marlene, was on a mission in Norway.&nbsp; It was hard to imagine how 
		Marlene would respond to getting the news of Marshas death, and it was 
		hard to mourn as a family without Marlene with us.&nbsp; But my parents were 
		able to get the sad news to her in a timely way, and shortly we received 
		a letter from her describing a dream that she had.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Marlene dreamed she was 
		sitting in the temple.&nbsp; Through the windows on one side of the temple 
		she could see people working.&nbsp; She recognized the husband of one of our 
		cousins there.&nbsp; (He had just finished building his young family a new 
		house when he died in a tragic accident.)&nbsp; In her dream Marlene could 
		see him working on a building.&nbsp; She didnt recognize others working 
		there, but she believed that many of them were ancestors.&nbsp; As she 
		attempted to move closer to the windows for a better view, she heard a 
		tapping noise coming from the other side of the temple.&nbsp; She turned and 
		looked outside the window on that side where she saw Marsha, the sister 
		who had just passed away. &nbsp;Once Marsha had Marlenes attention, she 
		pointed through the temple to the people working outside the other side 
		of the temple.&nbsp; Marlene recounted that she awoke then with the distinct 
		impression that Marsha had just asked her to do her temple work so that 
		she could join those relatives who had already been through the temple 
		in the work they were doing.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Hearing of this dream was 
		very comforting to me.&nbsp; The idea that life after death involves activity 
		and work projects was new to me, and it made me happy to think of Marsha 
		joining other deceased family members in their work.&nbsp; She had always 
		been one to eagerly participate in work projects of every kind on the 
		farm, and I knew she was going to be happy.&nbsp; The temple was her gateway 
		to that happiness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A few years ago another dream 
		of family in the spirit world involved a temple.&nbsp; Within weeks of my 
		fathers death, a friend of his from our home town also passed away.&nbsp; 
		This friends son, Mike, had leased my fathers hay fields and was 
		keeping an eye on the property my parents had vacated five years 
		previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike, while grieving his fathers death, had a dream.&nbsp; In 
		the dream he went to my fathers farm to check on things.&nbsp; As he looked 
		across the fields, he saw an old red pickup out in one of the pastures.&nbsp; 
		Thinking strangers had broken through onto the property, he started 
		walking across the field and into the pasture toward the pickup to see 
		what was going on.&nbsp; The pickup started up as he approached, and the men 
		inside motioned for him to follow them.&nbsp; He then recognized the pickup 
		as one my Dad had used on the farm.&nbsp; The men inside, dressed in white, 
		were my dad and Mikes dad.&nbsp; They drove toward the house, parked, and 
		got out of the pickup.&nbsp; As Mike watched them walk up to the house he 
		realized that it was not a house they were entering, but a temple.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I think an important message 
		for me from Mikes dream has been to recognize that the home where I 
		grew up, like a temple, was a sacred and holy place.&nbsp; I had not thought 
		so living in the midst of the nitty-gritty of life on the farm; but 
		truly the work done there, in spite of its worldly setting, was sacred 
		and holythe work of building an eternal family.&nbsp; Like the definition in 
		the Bible Dictionary says, Only the home can compare with the temple in 
		sacredness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have wondered whether there 
		is more to understand from the two dreams.&nbsp; Could there be temple 
		building taking place on the other side of the veil?&nbsp; We know that 
		temple work has to be done here for those who have died, but could they 
		be building for the Millennium?&nbsp; My sister needed her temple work done 
		to be engaged in the building taking place there.&nbsp; And my dad and his 
		friend entered a temple there.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me read to you two 
		scriptures that have helped me with my thoughts about the work taking 
		place in the spirit world.&nbsp; The first is from Ether, chapter 
		13:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Truly in these two scriptures

		Millennium.&nbsp; My ancestors are engaged in the work.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The coming together of our

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Hope to be there gives me a

		there is not for a family member, I believe the act of joining them in

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I leave you with my testimony

		The starting point for my message this morning is a passage from 
		Ezekiel. &nbsp;In powerful words of prophecy, found in chapter 37, Ezekiel 
		describes three processes that define the work of the Lord in the latter 
		days: the gathering of Israel, the establishment of Zion, and 
		preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I love this passage 
		for the way it connects these marvelous processes to the temples of the 
		Lord. </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">1. &nbsp; He will gather

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">
		These three processes  to gather Israel, to establish Zion, and to 
		prepare for the Savior to come again  are the work of the Lord in the 
		kingdom of God on the earth today. &nbsp;But these three processes also 
		represent a pattern for the Lords work in the individual heart and 
		soul. &nbsp;Here, too, we gather, we establish Zion, and we prepare for the 
		Savior to come. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">I 
		would like to speak this morning about these three processes in the

		that He would make a new covenant with Israel, an everlasting covenant 
		of peace. This, of course, is the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to 
		the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. &nbsp;Thus, the restoration of 
		priesthood keys, sacred covenants, and the ordinances of the holy temple

		The blessings of gathering are all around us. &nbsp;We see the Church growing 
		all over the earth, including in this very valley.&nbsp; But the work of 
		gathering goes on in our individual lives and hearts as well. &nbsp;Here is a 
		very immediate example: When we go to the temple, we gather. &nbsp;In fact, 
		we gather as covenant people of the Lord to do His holy and sacred work. 
		&nbsp;The work we do there supports the gathering of Israel beyond the veil. 
		&nbsp;The temple is in fact and in symbol a place of gathering, and it is we 
		that gather. &nbsp;All those marvelous blessings of gathering  a place of 
		refuge, a sanctuary, a place of power and preparation, a place of peace 
		and safety and revelation  all of these are available to us personally 
		in the holy temple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">
		But if we are to gather and to enjoy these wonderful blessings, we must 
		go  we must actually go to the temple. &nbsp;It will not do just to talk 
		about it, or to read about it, or to drive by. &nbsp;We must go.&nbsp; What 
		blessings await us! &nbsp;Let me offer a personal and local example. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">

		From the time I turned twelve years old until today, I have been 
		eligible, upon conditions of worthiness, to enter the temple either to 
		do baptisms or to participate in other sacred ordinances.&nbsp; When I was 
		twelve I lived in Spokane, Washington.&nbsp; The nearest temple was in 
		Cardston, Alberta  about 350 miles away.&nbsp; Since that day I have lived 
		various distances from temples. &nbsp;On average from 1961 when I turned 
		twelve until the year 2000, I lived 569 miles from a temple.&nbsp; To say the 
		least, I did not attend the temple every week in those years. &nbsp;In fact, 
		for most of that time I was doing well if I got to the temple twice a 
		year. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">
		However, in 2000 everything changed. &nbsp;In that year the Boston temple was 
		dedicated. Our home was exactly one mile from the temple. &nbsp;So, I went 
		from hundreds of miles away to walking distance away almost overnight. 
		&nbsp;That had a profound impact upon me and on Sue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">We 
		made a decision that we would go to the temple every week. &nbsp;We have kept 
		that commitment to this day. &nbsp;It has changed our lives. &nbsp;Being in the 
		temple every week has given us the opportunity to become very familiar 
		with the ordinances and covenants of the Lords House. There is no other 
		place on earth where we may feel the presence and power of the Lord like 
		the temple. &nbsp;We have tried to take those feelings and that Spirit with 
		us into our home. &nbsp;The temple has become a place of revelation, a place 
		of service, a place of learning, a place of eternal connections and 
		family relationships, a place of comfort and peace. &nbsp;We love to go to 
		the temple. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">We 
		also became ordinance workers in the temple in Boston. &nbsp;What a marvelous 
		experience.&nbsp; As an ordinance worker, you get to experience the 
		ordinances and covenants from the other side  from the Lords side. 
		&nbsp;You come to know and experience the language of the temple in a very 
		different way. &nbsp;It is a powerful, spiritual experience to officiate in 
		the sacred ordinances of the House of the Lord.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times; color: #000080">I

<span style="font-family: Times">In this making of Zion in our own

		our home anything that would offend the Spirit. &nbsp;We have learned the 
		power of good music to invite the Spirit. &nbsp;Our home is a place for

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">We decided to look for a new house and

		project, however, we began to feel uneasy. &nbsp;We began to worry about our 
		motives and our desires.&nbsp; The house was going to be a large house, and 
		it was going to sit on a hill in a beautiful wooded area. &nbsp;Was this 
		conspicuous consumption?&nbsp; Was it right to spend so much on ourselves?
		</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">We prayed about that house. &nbsp;For many 
		days we got no answer. &nbsp;Then one night the answer came. &nbsp;I remember that 
		moment as if it were yesterday. &nbsp;The impression came very clearly: &nbsp;It 
		is all right to build the house if you share it with other people.&nbsp; Sue 
		and I got up off our knees and sat on the bed and talked. &nbsp;We realized

		opened it up. &nbsp;I believe that what we did with that house reflects in 
		large part the character of my wife. &nbsp;It was her home, and<b> </b>
		opening it to others was an expression of her innate goodness and 
		kindness and concern for other people. &nbsp;We took in foster children. &nbsp;We 
		hosted early morning seminary for a number of years. &nbsp;Our home became 
		the location for open houses and firesides. &nbsp;The bishop knew that if 
		someone needed a place to stay, our home was always available. &nbsp;Over the 
		years we had the missionaries in our home to teach and share the gospel 
		many, many times.&nbsp; And for a few years we housed missionaries waiting

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is a season of

				course the Lord has set.&nbsp; In this time of change it is very 
				important we hold onto those things that must not change.&nbsp; We 
				need to understand the enduring principles and applications that 
				define the foundation and character of BYUIdaho.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please look closely 
				at this framework defined by a circle that represents the great 
				whole of the university.&nbsp; Within that circle are the enduring 
				characteristics of BYUIdaho: Student Honor, the Spirit of 
				Ricks, disciple preparation, leadership development, and 
				inspired learning and teaching.&nbsp; I have chosen to focus my talk 
				today on the Spirit of Ricks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One day not long ago, 
				I stood on the bank of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River near 
				Mesa Falls.&nbsp; As I stood and watched that beautiful river, an 
				impression came to me: this river is a metaphor for BYUIdaho 
				and the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Whenever I go to the 
				river, it looks and feels the same.&nbsp; I know the molecules of 
				water flowing by me are different, but there is a character and 
				spirit about the river that is always the same.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The water is 
				amazing.&nbsp; It is clean and clear; it is vibrant and alive with 
				energy.&nbsp; The water is guided by the strength of the riverbed, 
				the gorge cut out of the great and powerful mountains, and the 
				banks that channel and direct the flow.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are challenges 
				and obstacles, but the water works its way around and over and 
				through them as though guided by an unseen hand moving forward 
				on its journey.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Taken together, the 
				vibrant water, the riverbed, the gorge, and the mountains make 
				Henrys Fork of the Snake River glorious.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You are like the 
				water, full of life, on your journey.&nbsp; You are on your way, 
				preparing to be disciples of Christ and leaders in your 
				families, in His Kingdom, and in the world.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The university, with 
				its consecrated employees, its Code of Honor, its standards, and 
				its curriculum, is like the riverbed, the banks, and the gorge 
				guiding you, giving you experience and direction.&nbsp; The prophets 
				who support us and watch over us are like the mountains that 
				stand as sentinels, as watchmen on the tower.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The spirit we feel at 
				that glorious river is like the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; It is a spirit 
				of the whole created by the ensemble.&nbsp; Every element plays an 
				important role in creating what we feel.&nbsp; That Spirit has a 
				grand and glorious purposeto prepare you for discipleship and 
				leadership and to help all of us pursue inspired learning and 
				teaching in this very special place.&nbsp; You and I need to learn 
				about and understand that Spirit so we might preserve it and 
				enhance it.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Spirit of Ricks

				like to reiterate the definitions I came to understand during my

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The Spirit of 
				Ricks is the defining characteristic of BYUIdaho.&nbsp; </span>
<font color="#000080">It is something we share as a university

				W</span><font color="#000080">e experience the Spirit of Ricks 
				because individual students and individual employees receive 
				spiritual light and use spiritual gifts.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">An illustration from 
				the realm of physics may help to sharpen our understanding of 
				the way the spirit and the light in each individual combine to 
				create the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The basic 
				constituents of matterparticles like electrons and quarkshave 
				many wonderful properties.&nbsp; One of them is that two such 
				particles in an atom cannot be in exactly the same state at 
				exactly the same time.&nbsp; This is a wonderful thing.&nbsp; It means 
				that atoms, which are made up of these particles, have 
				structure; and that means that matter has form and substance.&nbsp; 
				It means you dont sink into the floor when you get up in the 
				morning.&nbsp; It is a very useful property.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But light is very 
				different.&nbsp; Photons, the particles that make up a beam of light, 
				can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&nbsp; If you shine 
				a beam of laser light on the wall and then take another beam and 
				shine it in exactly the same place, what happens?&nbsp; The light on 
				the wall becomes brighter.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe the Spirit 
				and the gifts of the Spirit behave like light.&nbsp; When individuals 
				who act with the Spirit or use the gifts of the Spirit gather 
				together and work together, the effects of the Spirit are 
				magnified.&nbsp; The scriptures teach us that intelligence cleaveth 
				unto intelligence . . . [and] light cleaveth unto light.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
				&nbsp;Like beams of laser light shining in the same place, spiritual 
				light shining in the same place builds and magnifies.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please turn to 
				Doctrine and Covenants, chapter 50, verses 21 and 22, where the 
				Lord applies this principle to the preaching of the word of 
				God.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

				preached by the Spirit of truth?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">Wherefore, he that 
				preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and 
				both are edified and rejoice together.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">4</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Here, two 
				people who act with the Spirit are edified . . . together.&nbsp; 
				They are built up and strengthened because of the interaction of 
				the spiritual light which each possesses.&nbsp; If the receiver had 
				not received by the Spirit, the preacher would not have been 
				edified in the same way, even though the preacher might have 
				preached by the Spirit.&nbsp; There is power in the interaction of 
				spiritual light.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This principle 
				applies with particular force in a community of people like the 
				people of BYUIdaho who love, serve, and teach one another with 
				and by the Spirit.&nbsp; I believe this is one of the reasons the 
				Lord has commanded his disciples to gather together, and stand 
				in holy places.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">5</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
				&nbsp;In gathering together in holy places with the guidance and 
				power of the Spirit, we strengthen and support each other.&nbsp; This 
				is the first principle that connects our individual spirituality 
				to the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">A second 
				principle is closely related.&nbsp; When we use our spiritual gifts 
				to serve each other, the effects of those gifts are multiplied 
				in a great community network of love, concern, and service.&nbsp; For 
				example, lets suppose you see a need in one of your family home 
				evening sisters through the gift of discernment and so you do 
				something to help her.&nbsp; She, in turn, not only feels blessed, 
				but the Spirit guides her and helps her to share the kindness 
				she experienced with someone else.&nbsp; Those she touches likewise 
				bless others.&nbsp; Thus, your act of kindness grows in a powerful 
				way through the community network.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first two 
				principles are closely connected to a third: edif[ying] and 
				rejoic[ing] together</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">6</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
				helps build the spiritual unity essential to disciple 
				preparation and to the establishment of Zion.&nbsp; As we act with 
				and through the Holy Ghost, we develop a common base of 
				spiritual experience, sensitivity, and perspective.&nbsp; This is 
				precisely how Paul defined perfecting . . . the Saints,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">Till we all come 
				in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of 
				God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the 
				fullness of Christ.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">7</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Nurturing that 
				spiritual unity of heart and mind helps us establish Zion and 
				qualifies us as a community for blessings from heavendivine 
				protection, power, and peace.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To summarize, the 
				Spirit of Ricks comes: 1) from the gathering of faithful and 
				obedient Latter-day Saints who have the gift of the Holy Ghost 
				and who spiritually edify and strengthen one another; 2) from 
				the application of spiritual gifts that comes through the Holy 
				Ghost and is magnified through a network of love and service; 
				and 3) from spiritual unity of heart and mind that comes through 
				the ministry and power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; That spirit is 
				absolutely critical to BYUIdaho as a center of disciple 
				preparation and leadership development and as a place of 
				inspired learning and teaching.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">8</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">

				depend on the power of the Holy Ghost in your life and the way 
				you use the spiritual gifts the Lord gives you.&nbsp; The question 
				for you and for me is: &nbsp;what must we do to strengthen the power

				the powers of heaven to those who qualify for the gifts of God.&nbsp; 
				These gifts come from Jesus Christ through the power of His

				All of us need the gifts of the Spirit.&nbsp; And there are many, 
				many such gifts.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Holy Ghost can

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Holy Ghost can 
				bring us gifts of capacity and talentthe capacity to heal, 
				teach, discern, forgive, prophesy, and learn.&nbsp; Gifts of faith, 
				charity, empathy, kindness, and much, much more can come to us 
				as instruments in the Lords hands.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All of these gifts 
				come through the ministry of the Holy Ghost and are governed by 
				divine laws and conditions.&nbsp; They may not come all at once, 
				complete and finished.&nbsp; They may come a little at a time, line 
				upon line.&nbsp; They come as we follow the pattern the Lord Himself

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe there are

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Qualify</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, we must 
				qualify.&nbsp; Once we have entered into the covenant of baptism, we 
				must remain worthy of the companionship of the Spirit.&nbsp; We must 
				exercise our faith, repent of our sins, keep the commandments of 
				the Lord, and be true and faithful to our covenants.&nbsp; We must do 
				nothing that would offend the Spirit.&nbsp; Remember, as the prophets 
				have taught, your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is 
				in you</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">12</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">

</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At BYUIdaho this is 
				one of the great blessings of the Code of Honor:&nbsp; through 
				obedience we qualify for the blessings of the Spirit.&nbsp; Obedience 
				is the great foundation of the gifts we seek.&nbsp; Each of you has 
				made covenants with the Lord to be obedient to His 
				commandments.&nbsp; Each of you has made a commitment that you will 
				live by the Code of Honor.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Seek</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Second, we must 
				diligently seek spiritual gifts.&nbsp; It may seem paradoxical that a 
				gift, especially a heavenly gift, should be sought after.&nbsp; But 
				that is exactly what the Lord commanded when he said, Seek ye

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Cannon 
				counsels us to pray diligently for the gifts we needneeds that 
				come because of our imperfections and the challenges and 
				opportunities we face.&nbsp; But we must not seek with a sense of 
				entitlement, nor should we seek for signs, nor for the honors of 
				men.&nbsp; We must prayerfully seek in the Lords way according to 
				His will and purpose, trusting in Him, guided by the Spirit, in 
				humility, and in faith.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Righteous seeking 
				requires diligent prayer, but it also requires that we get up 
				off our knees and act in faith.&nbsp; Enochs call to be a prophet 
				illustrates this principle.&nbsp; Please turn to Moses 6:31-32:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Notice the Lords

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Receive</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Third, we must

				the Lord intends.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This means that there

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When it comes to 
				spiritual gifts, the Lord wants righteous action.&nbsp; He wants you 
				to use the gifts He gives you to help others, but He also wants 
				you to take that action with an uplifting attitude.&nbsp; In fact, He 
				commands us to receive His spiritual gifts and use them not 
				grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">23</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Nor has God

				or any of those other poor attitudes that lead to sin and 
				unhappiness.&nbsp; If we stir up the gift that is in us, if we 
				invite the Holy Ghost to work in us, we can act in faith to 
				bless others.&nbsp; We can choose not to be angry, or cynical, or 
				arrogant, or lazy, or take on any other attitude that would dim 
				the light, offend the Spirit, and send us down the wrong path.&nbsp; 
				Rather, we may choose Christ always and in every situation.&nbsp; 
				Even in the face of trials or adversity, even when things dont 
				go quite like we had hoped, we may choose to qualify for, seek,

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The ministry 
				of the Holy Ghost and the manifestations of the Spirit at BYUIdaho 
				are particularly focused on disciple preparation, leadership 
				development, and inspired learning and teaching.&nbsp; </span>
<font color="#000080">I believe that by looking closely at the 
				gifts of the Spiritwhich give the Spirit of Ricks its 
				distinctive characterwe might gain some deeper insight into 
				what the Lord wants each of us to do to preserve and enhance 
				it.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have organized 
				these gifts and their manifestation into four clusters: Love, 
				Humility, Obedience, and Learning by Faith.&nbsp; As I review them 
				with you, I pray that the Spirit will teach you where you need 
				to focus your efforts to qualify for, seek, and receive 
				spiritual gifts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Cluster 1Love</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first cluster is 
				Love.&nbsp; This cluster is manifested in a willingness to sacrifice 
				self-interest in order to serve and help others.&nbsp; It shows up in 
				everyday life as a spirit of personal interest in and concern 
				for others.&nbsp; It includes friendliness, kindness, service, 
				openness and warmth, happy greetings, ready smiles, and a sense 
				of being among good friends.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The gifts associated 
				with this cluster are many and include: charity, discernment, a 
				desire to serve, empathy, kindness, cheerfulness, seeing the 
				best in people, an interest in other people, and remembering 
				names.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I think about 
				these gifts, I see a young sister experiencing a very difficult 
				time.&nbsp; She is spiritually wounded, discouraged, and feeling 
				alone.&nbsp; As she walks across campus, one of our teachers sees 
				her, greets her by name, and asks her how she is doing.&nbsp; Those 
				simple words of kindness and concern are the beginning of 
				healing and redemption.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This example 
				illustrates the friendliness, concern for others, and service 
				that have been hallmarks of this campus for decades.&nbsp; These 
				simple acts of love and kindness help to forge bonds of charity 
				essential to inspired learning.&nbsp; They help us to feel the 
				Saviors love, to see His loving hand in our lives, and to learn 
				to lead as He would lead.&nbsp; These precious gifts help us to know 
				Him and to be more like Him.&nbsp; This is the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Cluster 2Humility</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Cluster number two is 
				Humility.&nbsp; This cluster includes the spirit of meekness, 
				forgiveness, modesty, and frugality.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The gifts of the 
				Spirit that are part of this cluster include: humility, 
				meekness, modesty, living within our means, a forgiving spirit, 
				not caring who gets the credit, listening to the enticings of 
				the Spirit, not feeling entitled, and seeing ourselves as we 
				really are.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I think about this 
				cluster, I see a former student body president applying for a 
				leadership position in the Student Activities Program.&nbsp; He is 
				not selected; but his friend, a quiet young man from a small 
				town in Oklahoma, gets the assignment.&nbsp; Happy for his friend who 
				has had little leadership experience on campus, the former 
				student body president decides to volunteer in that 
				organization.&nbsp; He takes on assignments and makes a valuable 
				contribution.&nbsp; He supports and prays for his friend and rejoices 
				to see him develop as a strong leader.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The power of this 
				cluster lies in its connection to Christ.&nbsp; When we approach life 
				with a spirit of humility and meekness, we open the way for the 
				Savior to be our guide and our strength.&nbsp; It is in Him and 
				through Him that we work and accomplish His purposes.&nbsp; Like 
				Ammon of old, in [the] strength [of the Lord we] can do all

				3Obedience</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have called the 
				third cluster Obedience.&nbsp; It, too, includes a willingness to 
				sacrifice, not only self-interest as in the cluster I called 
				Love but whatever else the Lord requires.&nbsp; It also includes a 
				spirit of consecration, integrity, hard work, high standards, 
				and personal responsibility.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The gifts of the 
				Spirit associated with this cluster include:&nbsp; an honest, 
				obedient heart; a willingness to sacrifice; dedication; 
				patience; diligence; a capacity to work hard; a sense of 
				responsibility.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I think of this 
				cluster, I see a married student couple on their knees not 
				knowing how they will meet all the expenses of their new baby or 
				get all their homework done or cope with their very complex 
				lives.&nbsp; But there they are praying morning and night, studying 
				the scriptures, keeping the commandments, paying their tithing, 
				attending the temple, serving in the ward, holding down two 
				jobs, doing their home and visiting teaching, staying up late to 
				write papers, working very hard, doing their very best, and 
				trusting in the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Cluster 4Learning

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The last cluster is 
				Learning by Faith.&nbsp; Inspired learning and teaching have been 
				part of this campus for decades.&nbsp; But with the advent of the BYUIdaho 
				Learning Model, the Lord would have us make learning by faith a 
				more common, daily, and pervasive experience in our lives.&nbsp; For 
				that to happen, all of us will need the gifts of the Spirit that 
				are part of this cluster:&nbsp; exceedingly great faith, courage, 
				listening by the Spirit, teaching by the Spirit, asking and 
				seeking by the Spirit, charity, guidance, understanding, and 
				knowledge.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I think of this

				never spoken in a classroom in her whole life.&nbsp; She studies and 
				then prays in faith for help.&nbsp; In her Foundations of Science

				faith that the Lord will bless us through the power of the Holy 
				Ghost with gifts of courage, knowledge, understanding, and 
				insight.&nbsp; And the wonderful thing isHe does.&nbsp; We do all we can; 
				we trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and we learn by faith.&nbsp; This

					honor and a delight to be here with you this afternoon.&nbsp; I 
					am grateful for the hospitality of President and Sister 
					Clark, who have been so kind to my wife, Pat, and me.&nbsp; I am 
					especially grateful to the First Presidency for this 
					assignment to speak at your devotional today.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not 
					my first opportunity to speak at BYUIdaho.&nbsp; The last time I 
					spoke here at a devotional was just about four years ago.&nbsp; 
					It is an experience to be savored.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I never stand 
					before an assembly of college students that I am not carried 
					back in memory to my own college days.&nbsp; I graduated college 
					in California in 1964.&nbsp; Like many of you, I had completed a 
					mission. &nbsp;At the time of graduation, Pat and I had been 
					married for about six months.&nbsp; As yet, we had no children.&nbsp; 
					During my undergraduate years, I had enrolled in an army 
					officer training program.&nbsp; Upon graduation the army extended 
					an offer for commissioning as a second lieutenant in the 
					Regular Army, Infantry.&nbsp; At the time, I thought I might 
					consider a career in the army.&nbsp; So, after considerable 
					discussion, prayer and fasting, Pat and I decided to accept 
					that offer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In June 1964, 
					Vietnam was, for most Americans, an obscure place on the far 
					side of the world.&nbsp; Nothing much was known about it except 
					what one might read in the capsule summaries of 
					international news appearing on the back pages of newspapers 
					and magazines.</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was &quot;gung ho&quot; 
					in those days, and I had volunteered for training as a U.S. 
					Army Ranger.&nbsp; Accordingly, after completion of the Infantry 
					Officer Basic Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, I was granted 
					admission to the nine-week Ranger training course, or 
					&quot;Ranger School,&quot; as I believe it is still known in the army.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our class in 
					Ranger School was what the Ranger cadre jokingly referred to 
					as &quot;Ranger Stew.&quot;&nbsp; In addition to newly commissioned 
					lieutenants like me, there were officers and NCOs from the 
					airborne division reconnaissance units, U.S. Army Special 
					Forces, U.S. Navy SEALS and officers and noncommissioned 
					officers from the U.S. Marine Corps fleet reconnaissance 
					units. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ranger training 
					is a grueling course in commando and elite infantry 
					tactics.&nbsp; The goal is to produce officers and 
					noncommissioned officers highly skilled in conducting raids 
					and reconnaissance patrols deep in enemy-controlled 
					territory.&nbsp; Three weeks of the training were spent at Fort 
					Benning.&nbsp; Another three weeks were spent at the Mountain 
					Ranger Camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains of north Georgia, 
					and another three weeks were spent in the Everglade-like 
					swamps and along the coast of Eglin Air Force Base in the 
					western panhandle of Florida.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The training 
					included what the cadre referred to as a series of 
					&quot;confidence tests.&quot;&nbsp; These tests were intended as challenges 
					to physical strength, stamina and courage. One purpose of 
					these confidence tests was to teach us that in the difficult 
					and trying circumstances of combat we were capable of doing 
					more than we thought we could do.&nbsp; Their purpose was to 
					teach us to have <i>confidence</i> in ourselves and in our 
					own training. As it turned out, many would-be Rangers about 
					half the class&nbsp; dropped out of the training as a result of 
					failing these confidence tests or injuries suffered in 
					attempting them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Confidence tests 
					occurred at every phase of the training.&nbsp; One of the very 
					first was a climb up an 80-foot telephone pole on the edge 
					of a small lake to a tiny platform perched on the very top.&nbsp; 
					A cable extended from that platform to a tree on the other 
					side of the lake.&nbsp; Upon reaching the top of the pole and 
					teetering on the platform, we were to grasp a pulley affixed 
					to the cable and slide down that cable until we were given a 
					command from a Ranger officer stationed on the opposite side 
					of the lake, whereupon we were to let go of the cable and 
					drop into the water.&nbsp; Letting go too soon would result in a 
					very long fall, and letting go too late would lead to 
					colliding with the tree.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Still another one 
					of our early confidence tests involved walking blindfolded, 
					fully clothed (including combat boots), off the high dive 
					into the base swimming pool encumbered with rifle, helmet 
					and combat pack.&nbsp; This was intended to simulate wading 
					through a swamp in the pitch blackness of night and falling 
					off into a slough.&nbsp; The point of the test was to see whether 
					encumbered with all of that equipment we could make it to 
					the edge of the pool without panicking.&nbsp; Anyone who dropped 
					his rifle or equipment failed the test.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Other tests 
					involved scaling 100-foot cliffs and rappelling back down 
					them, sometimes with another Ranger on your back. One of the 
					most difficult tests was challenging in a different way.&nbsp; It 
					was a 10-mile compass course that was run completely at 
					night.&nbsp; We were each paired with another Ranger and equipped 
					only with a compass, given a directional azimuth and 
					distance to follow over rough and wooded terrain to a 
					checkpoint.&nbsp; The checkpoint was simply a small metal 
					ammunition box on a waist-high pole.&nbsp; There we would find 
					another set of instructions to the next checkpoint, and so 
					on, from checkpoint to checkpoint until we had covered the 
					ten miles. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And so it was 
					with these Ranger school confidence tests.&nbsp; But today I 
					would like to speak to you of other more significant&nbsp; 
					confidence tests.&nbsp; Not so much tests of confidence in 
					oneself although that is also essential and might be a 
					subject for a different sermon than the one I wish to 
					deliver but of confidence in what we receive by the spirit 
					of God.&nbsp; I would speak of having <i>confidence in what we 
					know we know</i>.&nbsp; <i>I would speak of having confidence in 
					the Lord</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today's world 
					presents many challenges to our confidence in the Lord.&nbsp; 
					These are not challenges of climbing telephone poles or 
					running obstacle courses or scaling cliffs.&nbsp; Neither are 
					they challenges of traversing rough and unfamiliar terrain 
					at night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, they may come as intellectual challenges 
					questioning the still, small whisperings of the Spirit.&nbsp; 
					These challenges may come in the form of the allure of 
					unrighteousness, drawing us away from paths we know to be 
					right.&nbsp; They simply may come in the form of an uncertainty 
					sometimes a terrifying uncertainty&nbsp; about the future.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So, today I would 
					speak of meeting <i>these</i> confidence tests.&nbsp; I would 
					speak of facing down these challenges.&nbsp; The Apostle Paul's 
					great epistle to the Hebrews was written to Jews newly 
					converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; His purpose was to 
					help them see the importance of transferring their religious 
					devotions from the law of Moseswhich Paul said was now dead 
					and unnecessaryto faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, who had 
					become the Great and Last Sacrifice.&nbsp; He admonished them to 
					have &quot;confidence&quot; in their new faith.&nbsp; Said he, <b><i>&quot;Cast 
					not away, therefore, your confidence which hath great 
					recompense of reward&quot;</i></b> (Hebrews 10:35).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Paul admonished 
					them to have <i>confidence</i> in their faith.&nbsp; A few verses 
					beyond his exhortation to confidence, Paul declared that 
					faith is the &quot;substance (or assurance) of things hoped for, 
					the evidence of things not seen&quot; (Hebrews 11:1).&nbsp; In 
					substance, Paul's message was that we must always be 
					forward-looking in our faith.&nbsp; We stand with confidence&nbsp; 
					on truths that we have received in the past.&nbsp; And then we 
					look to the future.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This great 
					lecture on faith by Paul calls to mind Alma's great lecture 
					on faith, as recorded in Alma 32-33.&nbsp; All here remember that 
					great, dynamic sermon.&nbsp; Alma compared the development of 
					faith to planting a seed and then experimenting on that 
					seed.&nbsp; The seed is <i>belief</i>, and the experimentation is
					<i>faith</i>.&nbsp; The resulting spiritual assurance of the 
					truth and validity of that seed is <i>knowledge</i>.&nbsp; And 
					that knowledge becomes the springboard for further belief, 
					further experimentation and so on until, eventually, one's 
					faith ripens into a complete knowledge of the truthfulness 
					of the gospel and the reality of the Atonement of Jesus 
					Christ.&nbsp; Few, if any, reach the end of experimentation in 
					this life. Indeed, that process of experimentation is the 
					very process of living a faith-filled life.&nbsp; By definition, 
					it ends only when this mortal existence ends.&nbsp; But it is 
					engaging in that process of planting, experimenting, 
					receiving spiritual confirmation and more planting that is 
					the process of living the life of a disciple.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That process of 
					discipleship is what Paul referred to when he said, &quot;Cast 
					not away therefore your confidence which hath great 
					recompense of reward.&quot;&nbsp; The spiritual confirmation that 
					comes from living righteous principles is faith that is 
					confidence in the Lord.&nbsp; Engaging in this dynamic process of 
					discipleship is to engage in the greatest of all &quot;confidence 
					tests&quot;  one designed by the Lord Himself.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As with Paul and 
					Alma, prophet after prophet after prophet in holy writ has 
					exhorted believers to <i>remember what they already know</i>.&nbsp; 
					That is the only way in this life that we can move ahead 
					boldly in that dynamic, mortal process of experimenting on 
					the word.&nbsp;&nbsp; My message to you this afternoon is simply that:<i>&nbsp; 
					&quot;Remember what you know!&quot;</i>&nbsp; <i>&quot;Cast not away, therefore, 
					your confidence.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As recorded in 2 
					Nephi 9, that great wilderness prophet Jacob, attempting to 
					re-kindle the faith of his people, repeatedly declared to 
					them, &quot;<i>I know that ye know</i> . . . . &quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;<i>I know that 
					ye know </i>that our flesh must waste away and die; 
					nevertheless in our bodies we shall see God&quot; (2 Nephi 9:4; 
					emphasis added).&nbsp; Or, &quot;<i>I know that ye know</i> that in 
					the body he [Jesus Christ] shall show himself unto those at 
					Jerusalem . . . for it behooveth the great Creator that he 
					suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, 
					and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto 
					him&quot; (2 Nephi 9:5; emphasis added).&nbsp; Jacob reminded his 
					listeners that they already <i>knew</i> these things.&nbsp; But, 
					perhaps concerned with their natural, human tendency to 
					forget what we know in the fiery moment of adversity, he 
					then proceeded to declare unto them the gospel of Jesus 
					Christyet againand to exhort themyet againto righteous 
					living.&nbsp; In short, his message was simply this: remember 
					what you know!&nbsp; <i>Cast not away therefore your 
					confidence!</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Other Book of 
					Mormon prophets constantly exhorted their people to <i>
					remember</i>.&nbsp; Time after time, Book of Mormon prophets 
					admonished their people to <i>remember</i> those truths that 
					they already knew.&nbsp; King Benjamin urged his people to <i>
					remember</i> &quot;the happy state of those that keep the 
					commandments of God&quot; (Mosiah 2:41; emphasis added).&nbsp; He 
					admonished them to &quot;<i>remember</i> and <i>always retain in 
					remembrance</i>, the greatness of God . . . &quot; (Mosiah 4:11; 
					emphasis added).&nbsp; In challenging his people to cleave to 
					righteousness, Mosiah counseled his people to &quot;<i>remember</i> 
					the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam . . . and
					<i>remember</i> how great things he has done for them . . . 
					&quot; (Mosiah 27:16; emphasis added).&nbsp; In similar vein, Alma 
					likewise admonished the people to <i>remember</i> their 
					fathers' deliverance from captivity (Alma 5:6) and the 
					deliverance of Lehi and his family from Jerusalem (Alma 
					9:9).&nbsp; And there are numerous other such references across 
					the pages of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Remember what 
					you know</i>!&nbsp; That is a message that rings down the 
					centuries.&nbsp; It is Paul's message of holding tightly to one's 
					confidence.&nbsp; The great soldier-prophet Mormon used a 
					different phrase to capture this same idea when he referred 
					to faith as &quot;<i>a firm mind in every form of godliness</i>&quot; 
					(see Moroni 7:30; emphasis added).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many years ago, I 
					lead a group of explorer scouts on a rafting trip down the 
					Middle Fork of the Salmon River here in Idaho.&nbsp; As any who 
					has been in the Idaho Wilderness Area will attest, the 
					scenery was spectacular.&nbsp; Floating along on our tiny rafts 
					through spaces of calm water, we sat with paddles on our 
					laps just drinking in the sheer beauty of the place.&nbsp; But 
					then our ears would catch, faintly at first, a low roar in 
					the distance.&nbsp; As the current swept us along, the roar grew 
					steadily louder until it became a din drowning out all other 
					sounds.&nbsp; Suddenly, we were again in the white water of the 
					rapids, paddling desperately with all our strength to avoid 
					capsizing.&nbsp; Then, as suddenly as the rapids had been upon 
					us, we were past them and again in calm water.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I have 
					reflected on that experience, it has seemed an apt metaphor 
					for life itself.&nbsp; We are swept along by the inexorable 
					currents of mortality, sometimes in white water, sometimes 
					in calm.&nbsp; And at all times, we need our confidence in the 
					Lord our firm mind in every form of godliness firmly in 
					place.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sometimes the 
					white water comes in the form of&nbsp; challenges to what you 
					or I already know to be true.&nbsp; I speak of&nbsp; so-called 
					intellectual challenges,&nbsp; in which&nbsp; with subtlety&nbsp; some 
					attempt to cast doubt on the reality of Jesus Christ or of 
					the First Vision or to raise questions about the goodness 
					and integrity of modern prophets, seers and revelators.&nbsp; 
					When confronted with such challenges, remember what you 
					know!&nbsp; Cast not away your confidence in the quiet, but 
					oh-so-sure whisperings of the Holy Ghost that have in 
					seasons of calm water filled your heart and enlightened 
					your mind with a <i>knowledge</i> that <i>this </i>Church 
					and <i>this</i> gospel are true.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sometimes, 
					challenges to what we know come in the form of life's 
					crises.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I sat in a sacrament service where 
					a member of a stake high council was speaking.&nbsp; He related 
					just such an experience in his own life.&nbsp; He explained that 
					after serving several years in a bishopric, he had been 
					called as a member of the high council.&nbsp; He and his wife had 
					an appointment to meet with the stake president on a 
					weeknight for his setting apart.&nbsp; However, on the very day 
					of their appointment, this new high councilor's wife 
					received some devastating news.&nbsp; The results of a routine 
					cancer screening had disclosed a suspicious mass; a biopsy 
					was scheduled for the next day.&nbsp; Being a physician himself, 
					this high councilor understood the portent of such news.&nbsp; 
					Thus, it was that he and his wife went to their appointment 
					with the stake president with heavy and fearful hearts.&nbsp; 
					Concerned about what probably lay ahead for his wife and for 
					him, this good man sought to dissuade the stake president 
					from proceeding with the call.&nbsp; But the stake president 
					pointed out that the Lord knew of his wife's health 
					condition at the time the call was extended, that He had 
					chosen to inspire the call nonetheless and that, in any 
					event, there were eleven other high councilors who would be 
					eager to fill any assignment this man on occasion might be 
					unable to fill because of family challenges.&nbsp; Then, these 
					two priesthood holdersthe stake president and the newly 
					set-apart high councilor laid their hands on the head of 
					this stricken woman and pronounced a profoundly beautiful 
					blessing of reassurance and health.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next day, 
					however, the biopsy revealed what they feared the most: she 
					had cancer.&nbsp; Learning of this news, the stake president 
					telephoned their home.&nbsp; They were not there, but the stake 
					president left this message on the answering machine: <i>
					&quot;This changes nothing!&quot;</i>&nbsp; The Lord knew of her condition; 
					a priesthood blessing had been pronounced. In a manner of 
					speaking, she and her husband must not cast away their 
					confidence in this moment of distress.&nbsp; <i>Remember what 
					you know!</i> was in substance the message.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ultimately, 
					related the high councilor in this sacrament meeting talk, 
					surgery was performed.&nbsp; The cancerous mass was removed with 
					no indications that the disease had spread further.&nbsp; She was 
					cured, and the priesthood blessing was realized.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i>This 
					changes nothing!&nbsp; Cast not away, therefore, your confidence,

					know!</i></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With all of this 
					as background, I wish to turn now to one of the most 
					significant of the confidence tests that are faced by 
					those in your season of life.&nbsp; I refer to the <i>marriage</i>
<i>decision</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">No decision is 
					approached with greater trepidation by this generation of 
					young adults than the marriage decision.&nbsp; I dont remember 
					there being that much angst over this decision in my 
					generation, although I freely admit that the problem may be 
					more with my aging powers of recollection than with the way 
					things really were!&nbsp; But of this I am sure it is a subject 
					that provokes much anxiety for you!&nbsp; I'm not sure of all the 
					reasons that this is the case.&nbsp; However, here, I believe, 
					are some of them:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, socially 
					many of todays young people take themselves out of the 
					game, so to speak, in finding the right companion.&nbsp; They do 
					this by doing much of their socializing in groups.&nbsp; &quot;Hanging 
					out&quot; is a common description given to the phenomenon.&nbsp; Some 
					deceive themselves that because this hanging out occurs in 
					mixed groups with males and females that they are properly 
					engaged in the sifting process so essential to finding one's 
					eternal companion.&nbsp; But this is not so.&nbsp; Much of hanging 
					out, I believe, is the result of an insecuritya fear as to 
					how one can relate to <i>just one</i> person of the opposite 
					sex.&nbsp; It is a &quot;safety in numbers&quot; approach.&nbsp; But it denies a 
					person the opportunity of the close examination of the 
					character and personality of that &quot;special someone&quot; so vital 
					to making a wise choice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Finding the 
					right one is essentially a process, like buying clothes, 
					of trying others on for fit and comfort.&nbsp; And like 
					purchasing a dress or a suit this must be done one-on-one.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe that 
					another reason for the trepidation associated with the 
					&quot;marriage decision&quot; is the fear of making a mistake.&nbsp; 
					Divorce statistics are well known.&nbsp; Some young people have 
					lived through the heartache of seeing their own parents' 
					marriages fail, or the marriages of friends.&nbsp; They have 
					experienced exquisitely the trauma associated with such 
					breakups.&nbsp; Sometimes, the effect of all this is to make them 
					gun shyafraid to approach marriage lest they choose the 
					wrong person.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Yet another 
					reason, I believe, for the concern over the marriage 
					decision isat least for a fewan adolescent recoiling from 
					responsibility.&nbsp; A reluctance to meld one's desires and 
					interests to those of another&nbsp; the need to consider the 
					perspective of someone else in making the decisions of 
					life&nbsp; such selfishness has a way of prompting some to 
					postpone the marriage decision.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Whatever the 
					reason for the fear of the marriage decision, it leads to 
					some fallacious thinking, to a casting away of ones 
					confidence.&nbsp; And this, in turn, causes a person's failure to 
					firmly grasp his or her own responsibility for making that 
					decision.&nbsp; If such fear doesn't result in a postponement or 
					an avoidance of the decision altogether, it leads to some 
					other errors.&nbsp; For instance, some are inclined to treat the 
					decision as entirely a &quot;spiritual&quot; one.&nbsp; Short-changing 
					their own obligation to give due process to the decision, 
					they wait for the functional equivalent of a divine finger 
					writing an answer on the wall or for the seas to part or for 
					some other metaphysical phenomenon that tells them without 
					question that so and so is &quot;the right one.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Others look to 
					someone else to make the decision for them.&nbsp; I am told by 
					one BYU-Provo stake president that in his experience it is 
					not uncommon for some young women to defer to the opinion of 
					a current boyfriend telling her that he is &quot;the one.&quot;&nbsp; Or, 
					some defer to the judgment of a parentoften a fatherwho 
					has made decisions for them in the past to tell them whether 
					or not he or she should marry a certain person.&nbsp; In all such 
					instances, there is an abdication of responsibility for the 
					most significant decision that a person makes in this life.&nbsp; 
					Counsel from parents, bishops and other worthy persons can 
					be valuable.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, no one else can or 
					should tell you what to do.&nbsp; The decision of whom to marry 
					is an intensely personal one.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;<i>Cast not away 
					therefore your confidence which has great recompense of 
					reward!</i>&quot;&nbsp; Remember: we come into this life hard-wired, 
					so to speak, to fall in love.&nbsp; Don't make it harder than it 
					is!&nbsp; You are pre-programmed to make this decision.&nbsp; All you 
					need to do is to remember what you know, and move forward 
					with a confidence in the Lord and the standing you enjoy as 
					His son or daughter.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Faust 
					has stated succinctly the formula for confirming that you 
					have found the right person:&nbsp; &quot;Long courtships and short 
					engagements!&quot;&nbsp; Courtship is a time for two people to get 
					acquainted.&nbsp; Courtship is a time to get to know someone, his 
					or her interests, habits, and perspective on life and the 
					gospel.&nbsp; It is a time to share ambitions and dreams, hopes 
					and fears.&nbsp; It is a time to test someone's commitment to 
					gospel living.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder David A. 
					Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve a Church officer with 
					whom you may be somewhat familiar on this campus! tells of 
					a returned missionary who had been dating a special young 
					woman.&nbsp; He cared for her a great deal and was seriously 
					considering making a proposal of marriage to her.&nbsp; This was 
					at a time when President Gordon B. Hinckley had counseled 
					the members of the Relief Society to wear only one set of 
					earrings.&nbsp; This young man waited patiently for awhile, said 
					Elder Bednar, for this young woman to remove the extra set 
					of earrings that she wore.&nbsp; But it did not happen.&nbsp; For 
					this, and other reasons, with heavy heart he stopped dating 
					her.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In relating this 
					experience, Elder Bednar said,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
<font color="#000080">I presume that some of you . . . may 
					believe the young man was too judgmental or that basing an 
					eternally important decision, even in part, upon such a 
					supposedly minor issue is silly or fanatical. Perhaps you 
					are bothered because the example focuses upon a young woman 
					who failed to respond to prophetic counsel instead of upon a 
					young man. <i>[But, may I just point out to you that] the 
					issue was not earrings!</i> (Elder David A. Bednar, Quick 
					to Observe, <i>Ensign</i>, December 2006.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And here is 
					another tip.&nbsp; As a part of this courtship experience, be 
					careful not to base your judgments merely on what could be 
					described as superficial &quot;ticket punching.&quot;&nbsp; By that, I mean 
					do not base your decisions <i>solely</i> on whether someone 
					has served a full-time mission, or whether he or she holds a 
					calling of responsibility in your ward.&nbsp; These things can 
					be, should beand usually areindications of devotion, 
					faithfulness and integrity.&nbsp; But not always.&nbsp; That is the 
					reason you need to get acquainted.&nbsp; I know a former mission 
					president with several beautiful daughters.&nbsp; Several of 
					these young women accompanied their parents into the mission 
					field.&nbsp; As this mission president and his wife neared the 
					end of their three-year period of service, I asked him how 
					the mission experience had been for their daughters.&nbsp; His 
					response was interesting.&nbsp; Said he, &quot;My daughters have 
					learned that not all returned missionaries are created 
					equal!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My point quite 
					simply is just this&nbsp; get well enough acquainted with 
					someone to learn their heart and their character first hand, 
					and not just from his or her resume.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And here is a 
					corollary&nbsp; avoid being judgmental about someone until you 
					get to know them.&nbsp; Snap negative judgments can be just as 
					erroneous and misleading as snap positive ones.&nbsp; The old 
					adage that you can't tell a book by its cover is <i>
					sometimes</i> true.&nbsp; In summary, be just as alert for a 
					&quot;diamond in the rough&quot; as you are wary of &quot;fool's gold.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Only after 
					applying your own judgment and good sense to the 
					relationship after a sufficient period of time, <i>then</i> 
					put it before the Lord.&nbsp; Remember, like every other 
					important decision, marriage is <i>your</i> choice.&nbsp; The 
					Lord will expect <i>you</i> to exercise <i>your</i> 
					judgment.&nbsp; As He said on one occasion to Oliver Cowdery, who 
					desired to translate records: &quot;Behold you have not 
					understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto&nbsp; 
					you, <i>when you took no thought save it was to ask me</i>&quot; 
					(D&amp;C 9:7).&nbsp; Once you do your part through an appropriate 
					courtship, and make a tentative decision, have <i>confidence</i> 
					that He will respond to your supplication.&nbsp; Often, His 
					answer will come as a warmth in the bosom or a feeling that 
					your decision is right.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But, not always.&nbsp; 
					Years ago, I was serving as the bishop of a ward in southern 
					California.&nbsp; Because of a change in employment 
					circumstances, our family was moving to another community.&nbsp; 
					It would be necessary to replace me as bishop.&nbsp; The stake 
					president asked me for my thoughts concerning possible 
					successors.&nbsp; I gave him the names of several good men.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As to one of 
					these he said, &quot;I don't know him very well.&nbsp; I will find an 
					opportunity to get acquainted.&quot;&nbsp; A couple of weeks later, I 
					was again speaking with the stake president and the same 
					subject arose in our conversation.&nbsp; The stake president then 
					made this insightful observation that I have remembered ever 
					since.&nbsp; Said he:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well, I 
						interviewed Brother So and So. But I do not think he is 
						the man.<i>&nbsp; If the Lord wants me to call him, He is 
						going to have to tell me because I do not think he is 
						the man.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is a great 
					principle here with much broader application than merely 
					choosing a bishop.&nbsp; The Lord expects you to use your own 
					good sense.&nbsp; He expects you to rely on your own natural 
					feelings of man-woman attraction planted in you from birth.&nbsp; 
					Once you have been drawn to a person of the opposite sex; 
					once you have enjoyed a significant period of friendship<i>court</i>shipwith 
					him or her; once you have satisfied yourself that he or she 
					shares your values and is someone with whom you could 
					happily share the most intimate of relationshipsthen, put 
					the matter to the Lord.&nbsp; The lack of a contrary impression 
					to your own feelings may be the Lord's way of telling you 
					that He has no objection to your choice. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Years have passed 
					now since those challenging days in Ranger training.&nbsp; 
					Mortalitys currents have swept me far down stream from the 
					confidence tests of my soldiering days.&nbsp; But their memory 
					and their lessons linger.&nbsp; And more, the validity of Pauls 
					admonition to cast not away therefore a confidence in the 
					Lord and Jacobs injunction to remember what we know have 
					been reaffirmed time and again over the course of my life.&nbsp; 
					The white water along the way has taught me that we are 
					capable of weathering the storms of life, and more 
					effectively than we might have thought.&nbsp; It is just a matter 
					of always <i>knowing what we know</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In November 1966, 
					I had been in the combat zone in Vietnam for nearly ten 
					months.&nbsp; I was an infantry platoon leader.&nbsp; I had 
					experienced much of the perils, the trials, the 
					moment-to-moment anxiety of combat.&nbsp; Our battalion had just 
					returned to our base camp for some R and R rest and 
					relaxation after several weeks in the jungles and rice 
					paddies.&nbsp; It was a Saturday night.&nbsp; Having taken our first 
					showers in a very long time, we were sitting around on our 
					bunks cleaning our rifles and listening to music on the 
					Armed Forces Radio Network.&nbsp; Suddenly, an urgent message 
					crackled over our battalion radio net.&nbsp; A sister battalion 
					in our brigade still in the jungle was being overrun by a 
					much larger enemy force.&nbsp; We were needed to go, right then, 
					to the rescue.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is very hard 
					to adequately describe the icy feelings that clutched at my 
					heart in that moment.&nbsp; I had experienced the anxieties of 
					combat many times before.&nbsp; I had seen men horribly wounded.&nbsp; 
					I had seen men die.&nbsp; But the news that we were going again 
					right then back into the jungle-...at night..to face a 
					fierce and determined foe.&nbsp; That news brought with it what I 
					can only describe as a dark sense of foreboding.&nbsp; Borrowing 
					from my metaphor of this talk, I found myself yanked from 
					calm water to white water in a matter of seconds.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How I would have 
					liked time to prepare!&nbsp; Time to ponder inspiring scripture.&nbsp; 
					Time to pray...to fast, even.&nbsp; Time to gird up [my] 
					loins.&nbsp; But there was no time.&nbsp; I only could grab my 
					helmet, my rifle, give some terse orders to my men and move 
					out.&nbsp; But one thing I could do was to utter a silent prayer 
					in my heart.&nbsp; And as I did, there came to my mind 
					literally a still, small voice.&nbsp; The voice repeated the 
					words to a passage of scripture that I had memorized in 
					seminary, and memorized again as a missionary.&nbsp; Words that 
					have become my very favorite in all scripture: <i>Trust in 
					the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own 
					understanding.&nbsp; In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will 
					direct thy paths</i> (Proverbs 3:5-6).&nbsp; As those words came 
					to mind, peace filled my heart.&nbsp; The foreboding retreated.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">More weeks 
					passed.&nbsp; We remained in the jungle on that operation 
					following that nocturnal SOS message.&nbsp; Finally, it was the 
					very last day of this particular operation.&nbsp; I was riding in 
					an armored personnel carrier through a lightly forested area 
					of jungle.&nbsp; Suddenly, an enormous explosion beneath the 
					vehicle seemed to lift it off the ground.&nbsp; Some enemy 
					soldiers nearby had detonated a huge landmine.&nbsp; The engine 
					was blown out.&nbsp; The tracks and all the road wheels were 
					blown off.&nbsp; Everyone inside, including me, was wounded.&nbsp; But 
					no one died.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And in that very 
					moment, there again came to my mind that same still voice 
					and that same passage of scripture.&nbsp; Trust in the Lord with 
					all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding.&nbsp; 
					In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy 
					paths.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear young 
					friends, I speak to you today not from the realm of theory 
					but from intense, personal experience in the at times quite 
					literal fiery trials of life.&nbsp; As with Alma, I speak in 
					the energy of my soul (Alma 5:43).&nbsp; Borrowing his 
					expression: Do ye not suppose that I know these things of 
					myself.&nbsp; Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that 
					these things whereof I have spoken are true (Alma 5:45).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i>Cast not 
					away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of 
					reward.</i></b>&nbsp; Have confidence in what you know!&nbsp; And you 
					will meet your own confidence tests with courage and 
					grace.&nbsp; And the Lord will surely direct thy paths...</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In courts of

						know God will help you, Third-person faith is also 
						good. For example, They know the Lord will bless them. 
						But, however good they may be, second and third-person

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To the 
						Master, one of the multitude brought his son, his only 
						child, who was afflicted with a dumb spirit.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">1</font></span> 
						The father explained to Jesus that this evil spirit had 
						often cast his boy into the fire and into the waters to 
						destroy him. Then, with all the tenderness of an 
						emotionally wrung out parent, the father pleaded, if 
						thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help 
						us. Note that he said, us. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This was not 
						simply an issue with the lad. No, this was an entire 
						family in distress. Can you even begin to imagine the 
						stigma levied against this boy and his parents?  
						neighbors warning their children not to go near that 
						house because that is where you know who lives. 
						Ostracism and exclusion everywhere they went and biting 
						remarks on every hand. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We dont know 
						where the mother was on this occasion. Maybe she had had 
						all she could take. Perhaps she simply could not bring 
						herself to face one more glare of scorn or one more word 
						of derision. We dont know those details but we do know 
						that the father was not seeking help for the boy alone 
						but for us, the whole little family of three.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Jesus said, 
						If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him 
						that believeth. And straightway the father of the child 
						cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help 
						thou mine unbelief.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have 
						pondered much on this fathers cry of the soul. It is a 
						paradox. I believe; help thou mine unbelief. What does 
						it mean? While I am sure there are other ways of 
						explaining it, it has been helpful to me to think of the 
						fathers reply in terms of generalized versus 
						personal faith.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Jesus, I 
						believe thou art all-powerful. Thou canst make the blind 
						to see, the deaf to hear and the lame to walkand thou 
						hast done so. Thou canst calm tempests, command the 
						elements, and raise the dead to lifeand thou hast done 
						so. Thou art the sovereign God of the universe and canst 
						do all things for other people in other circumstances. 
						ButJesus, I know my boy. Can you really pull this one 
						off for us?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Like so many 
						then and so many now, the father of the boy had 
						generalized faith in Jesus love and unlimited power. He 
						knew that the Master of ocean and earth and skies 
						could, generally speaking, command and calm in order to 
						bless the general masses; but could he really, might he 
						actually, deliver this seemingly insignificant little 
						threesome from a life of perpetual despair? </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Progression

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is a 
						worthy and timely subject for our discussion. As 
						children of Zion, we know something about adversity in

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">May I share

						will teach you. Please write down any impressions you 
						may receive. Some will assure you are doing well and 
						others may suggest a change or two. Will you please join 
						me in inviting the Holy Ghost to give each of us that 
						portion that will be of most help?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Principle 1:

						process. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Principle 2: 
						Developing first-person faith in God requires personal 
						involvement. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Principle 3: 
						Developing first-person faith in God involves 
						remembering Jesus always. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Principle 4: 
						Developing first-person faith in God matures into doubt 
						not, fear not, only believe.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#000080">PRINCIPLE 
						1: DEVELOPING FIRST-PERSON FAITH IN GOD REFERS TO A 
						PROCESS. </font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The oil of 
						first-person faith is added to our lamps drop by drop. 
						It is a process not an event, and if you understand and 
						really believe this, then you will move with surprising 
						serenity through lifes experiences that do not turn out 
						as you had planned. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What happens, 
						for instance, when you desperately want to be delivered 
						from a trial, and you pray and fast and ratchet up your 
						worthiness  but nothing? At such times, brothers and 
						sisters, knowing that faith development is a process, 
						will let you let the process take its course. Otherwise, 
						impatience might persuade you to make some well meaning 
						but very foolish demands of God. Consider, for example, 
						the Parable of the Impatient Expectant.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The woman 
						learned she was going to have her first baby. She and 
						her husband were overjoyed with the prospects of 
						becoming parents. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With each 
						passing day, the young wife became more anxious for the 
						babys arrival. During the day she would imagine and 
						during the night she would dream of how it would be to 
						hold and love and nurture her little one.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Two months 
						into the pregnancy she went to see her doctor. She 
						explained that she simply could not stand the waiting 
						any longer, and insisted that he deliver the baby that 
						very day. The doctor kindly refused explaining that were 
						he to do so, it would be abortion, not delivery. The 
						woman understood, continued to wait, to learn, to grow, 
						and in due time her baby was born.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Your delivery 
						from trial is important to Heavenly Father but so too is 
						the growth you make while awaiting that relief. If all 
						deliveries came immediately upon demand, the process of 
						developing first-person faith would be aborted. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To the 
						impatient mother-to-be and to all of us who want God to 
						deliver according to our terms and timing, Paul wisely 
						counsels, For ye have need of patience, that, after ye 
						have done the will of God, ye might receive the 
						promise.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1" color="#000080"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">3</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Understanding 
						that faith development is a process gives staying power 
						in times of adversity. The natural man is an enemy to 
						God as well as to Gods plans for our development. 
						Little wonder that murmuring is so prevalent. It is so 
						popular because it is so natural. Like Laman and Lemuel, 
						when one does not understand the dealings of that God 
						who created him, grumbling is inevitable. God is working 
						to develop the mans faith  here a trial, there an 
						adversity  but all the natural man sees is God 
						repeatedly picking on him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">True 
						disciples on the other hand know that charging God 
						foolishly will abort the faith development process and 
						so meekly allow the process to continue. They understand 
						that as long as they obediently seek the Lords will, 
						seeming setbacks can actually be steps forward in their 
						faith development. Like the man who is asked to move 
						back one seat in a bus that is speeding forward on the 
						freeway. Inside the bus, it looks like a move backward, 
						but observing the bus from a distance, the mans forward 
						progress is clearly evident.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Naaman<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">4</font></span>, 
						the leprous captain of the Syrian host was insulted when 
						the Lords prophet told him to dip seven times in the 
						River Jordan to be healed. Persuaded by his servants, 
						however, Naaman relented and obeyed. Healing did not 
						occur with the first dip but Naaman did not let the 
						disappointment of the moment abort possibilities for the 
						future. And so, he continued the process. Naamans 
						objective was to heal his skin. The Lords objective was 
						to grow his faith. And, for Naaman, both objectives were 
						met. The now healed Syrian became also the now converted 
						Syrian exclaiming, Behold, now I know that there is no 
						God in all the earth, but in Israel. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As he did 
						with Naaman, the Lord will invite you to experience 
						lifes challenges in order to grow your faith. 
						Occasionally you will be tempted to abort the process 
						when you meet with multiple disappointments. At such 
						times, please, be of good cheer and meekly allow the 
						process to continue. Your objective is to get through 
						the trial. The Lords objective is to grow your faith. 
						And both objectives can be met.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#000080">PRINCIPLE 
						2: DEVELOPING FIRST-PERSON FAITH IN GOD REQUIRES

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Faith without 
						works is dead  and the works cannot be vicarious. Even 
						for Nephi of old, whose very name many of us equate with 
						faith in God, first-person faith could only be developed 
						through first-hand works. With heaven expecting him to 
						build a ship, Nephis faith in God could not have grown 
						with him in a hammock and Sam and Jacob doing all the 
						work. Nephi, himself, had to be personally involved in 
						building the ship, sunburn, wood splinters, and all.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Surely the 
						Lord could have had a fine ocean-worthy ship waiting for 
						Lehis family when they came to the ocean shore. But He 
						did not. Then, as always, personal faith needs personal 
						involvement to grow. Note in the following verses<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">5</font></span>, 
						Nephis generous use of first-person pronouns:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now <b>I</b>, Nephi, 
						did not work the timbers after the manner which was 
						learned by men, neither did <b>I</b> build the ship after the 
						manner of men; but <b>I</b> did build it after the manner which 
						the Lord had shown unto <b>me</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And <b>I</b>, Nephi, 
						did go into the mount oft, and <b>I</b> did pray oft unto the 
						Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto <b>me</b> great things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Nephis faith 
						grew with each construction problem that was solved and 
						with every step of progress that was made. That is the 
						essence, the very essence, of the Lords drop by drop, 
						line upon line pattern. The end result was not just a 
						sea-worthy ship of inspired design, but a disciple of 
						Christ with faith equal to escalating stewardship 
						demands.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Nephis 
						brothers could lean on Nephis involvement for a 
						while, but there came a time when they had to enter the 
						very personal process of growing first-person faith. And 
						in this instance, they did. And when the ship was all 
						done, Nephi said, My brethren beheld that it was good, 
						and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine;

						Laman and Lemuels personal involvement led to

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and

						hand working wonders in the lives of others. That will 
						encourage you. But, I witness that the saving kind of 
						faith in Christ is a very personal, sweetly private, 
						first-person kind of faith developed only in the 
						process of personal involvement in lifes challenges.</font></p>

						REMEMBERING JESUS ALWAYS.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Members of 
						the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are 
						under covenant with the Father to always remember His 
						Son, Jesus Christ.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">9</font></span> 
						One of the many compelling reasons for doing so is that 
						it is essential to an ever-growing first-person faith in 
						the Lord. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again, we 
						turn to the Book of Mormon for examples. Who can forget 
						Nephis extraordinary demonstration of faith when his 
						murderous brothers tried to throw him into the ocean? 
						Unflinching, Nephi stood his ground and said, in so many 
						words, touch me, you die. And then this unparalleled 
						expression of first-person faith saturated with 
						first-person pronouns. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And <b>I</b> said 
						unto them; If God had commanded <b>me</b> to do all things 
						<b>I</b> 
						could do them. If he should command <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> should say 
						unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and 
						if <b>I</b> should say it, it would be done.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">10</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How did Nephi 
						do that? Where did he get such great faith? Brothers and 
						sisters, he did it in the very same way that you have 
						and will yet do it. He remembered Jesus. When Nephis 
						brothers refused to help him build the ship, he began to 
						speak to them.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">11</font></span> 
						Now, he did not know that Laman and Lemuel would try to 
						kill him just 25 verses later, but the Lord did and he 
						bolstered Nephis faith so it would be sufficient when 
						the crisis came. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One after 
						another, the Holy Ghost brought to Nephis mind a 
						virtual cascade of past experiences wherein the Lord 
						saved and strengthened those in need. Israel delivered 
						out of bondage, the Red Sea parted, Israel saved  
						Pharaohs armies drowned, manna from heaven, water from 
						a rock, day cloud, night pillar, cure for fiery 
						serpent venom, and on and on, one faith-building memory 
						of Jesus after another. Then, when the moment of need 
						came, Nephi and his bolstered faith were ready.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please note 
						however, that something happened, had to happen, in 
						Nephis mind to connect Gods involvement in ancient 
						Israels lives to Nephis present circumstances. This 
						was the connection, And now, if the Lord has such great 
						power, and has wrought so many mighty miracles <i>among the 
						children of men</i>, how is it that he cannot <i>instruct me, 
						that I should build a ship?</i><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">12</font></span> 
						Nephi went from remembering what God did for others, all 
						the way to trusting Hell do the same for me!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When lifes 
						challenges bear down upon you, it is not enough to know 
						that Jesus saved ancient Israel and Nephi or that he 
						helped your classmate or roommate. I know that you know 
						that your Redeemer lives must progress to, I know that 
						my Redeemer lives! Then, when you hear Jesus say, 
						Peace, be still!<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">13</font></span> 
						you will know he is talking to your own personal storms 
						and not just in generalities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But there is 
						another very compelling reason to remember Jesus always 
						and it has everything to do with the inner peace for 
						which every one of us, whether we know it or not, is 
						yearning.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Bible 
						Dictionary teaches, Faith must be centered in Jesus 
						Christ in order to produce salvation. To have faith is 
						to have confidence in something or someone. The Lord has 
						revealed himself and his perfect characterso as to 
						enable the mind of man to place confidence in him 
						without reservation.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">14</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remembering 
						Jesus keeps us focused on the Redeemer of Israel, on 
						whom for a blessing we can confidently call.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">15</font></span> 
						Otherwise, when we slip slightly  or crash terribly  
						we will look in vain for the Deliverer because he is far 
						from the thoughts and intents of our hearts.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">16</font></span> 
						In moments of spiritual alarm, when we cry out for help, 
						we will reflexively direct that cry to Christif we 
						have been remembering him always. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and 
						sisters, the bridegroom does come quicklyand repeatedly 
						in our lives. An unexpected illness, death of a loved 
						one, poor test grade, frustrated relationship, rejection 
						to graduate school, and moreon such occasions the oil 
						of first-person faith in God must already be in our 
						lamps. Where, when my aching grows, where is my solace? 
						We will know, instinctively we will know, where and who 
						our solace isbecause we have been thinking about Jesus; 
						because we have been remembering him always.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our 
						remembering, like our faith, must be centered in Jesus 
						Christ if it is to bring us the peace that we seek.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the 
						aftermath of sin, Alma the Younger was spiritually going 
						under. In his moment of greatest alarm when this very 
						young and very frightened prodigal needed help like he 
						had never needed it before, his first-person faith in 
						Christ was awakened by a first-person memory of his 
						fathers teachings of Jesus.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">17</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And it came 
						to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I 
						was <i>harrowed up by the <b>memory of my many sins</b></i>, behold, 
						<i>I 
						<b>remembered</b></i> also to have heard my father prophesy unto 
						the people concerning the coming of one <b><i>Jesus Christ, a 
						Son of God</i></b>, to atone for the sins of the world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, as my 
						mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And now,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Young Alma 
						gained a first-person faith that there is a Deliverer in 
						Israel. Alma also learned first-hand that when he 
						remembered Jesus always, he remembered former guilt 
						never. How priceless a truth for all who sin. The Father 
						commands us to repent and remember His Son always, 
						knowing that, a memory of Jesus will crowd out a memory 
						of guilt. How gentle Gods command  indeed!</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#000080">PRINCIPLE

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Alma

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have 
						pondered much about why Alma would say to Helaman, and 
						not his other two sons, look to God and live. It seems 
						significant that this is the same Helaman who, just 
						eight years or so later would lead a little rag-tag band 
						of 2000 believing boys to war.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">20</font></span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i>Each</i></b> boy 
						would survive because of first-person faith. <b><i>Each</i></b> had to 
						know that God would preserve him if he looked to God and 
						did not doubt. <b><i>Each</i></b> had to know he must obey with 
						exactness. And when he, scarcely knowing one end of a 
						sword from another, lunged into battle, <b><i>each</i></b> boy had to 
						yield his fears to God. It was just that literal, look 
						to Godand live or look elsewhereand die. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And who was 
						their leader? Who helped them develop first-person faith 
						in God? It was Helaman who was looking to God in every 
						thought, doubting not and fearing not  because the 
						prophet had told him to. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we look 
						to God, we yield to Him everything  our fears, our 
						doubts, and our own stern preferences, with the meek 
						entreaty, Thy will, not mine be done.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And brothers 
						and sisters, it really should be a cheerful yielding of 
						the heart. Our submission should not be a grumpy giving 
						up to the universal superpower who is going to win the 
						arm wrestle anyway. But rather a joyful yielding because 
						we know that what God wants is truly the best thing that 
						could ever happen to us. Therefore, when grappling with 
						lifes heavy-weight trials, dont yell uncle! just 
						pray, Father!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This comes 
						easily, even naturally, when the steps ahead are well 
						lit and clearly marked. But, for faith to grow, some 
						things must, for now, remain unseen. What then, do you 
						do when the next step of the trial as well as the 
						duration and outcome of the trial are hidden? You obey 
						God, doubt not, fear not, only believe.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The 
						scriptures are filled with experiences wherein prophets 
						and disciples struggled to develop first-person faith in 
						God in the face of stifling unknowns. How much easier it 
						would have been had they known, while in the furnace, 
						how things would eventually turn out. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For example, 
						look with me down the long corridor of time. We see 
						Father Abraham<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">21</font></span> 
						preparing, as God had commanded, to sacrifice his only 
						begotten son, Isaac  hot tears matching the heat of the 
						fiery trial. Then, as he raises the sacrificial dagger, 
						you and I call to him down through the millennia, 
						Abraham, O Abraham, dont worry. Its all going to be 
						just fine! See, I have the book! I know how this story 
						ends! Abraham, hang in there, dont give up! But 
						Abraham, in the thick of developing first-person faith 
						cannot, must not, hear us. It must be just Abraham and 
						God. Then, after the fiery trial of his faith, the 
						miracle occurs, we sigh with relief, and Abraham becomes 
						not only the father of millions, but the father of the 
						faithful as well.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And what about 
						those 2000 Lamanite youth under Helamans command youth 
						near the age of many of you? The most powerful army of 
						the Lamanites pursues them for a couple of days then 
						silence. And then the terrible questions must be 
						answered, questions like: Do we turn back to help 
						Antipus? And, is it an ambush? And, could you show me 
						again how to hold a cimeter? Back they go, this little 
						band that never before has fought an enemy. And we call 
						down the corridor of time, Hello! You are going to win 
						and not one of you will be killed! Here, read Alma 
						chapters 56 through 58. We love you! Thanks for your 
						examples. Remember, your team wins! But, again, they 
						cannot, must not, hear us. It must be each youth and his 
						God. Only after the trial of their first-person faith 
						was it written, And now, their preservation was 
						astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be 
						spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who 
						were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the 
						miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding 
						faith in that which they had been taught to believe.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">22</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Looking down

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
						Thirteen-year-old Mary Goble of the Hunt wagon company

						11, 1856. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Mary wrote in 
						her journal, three out of the four that were living 
						were frozen. My mother was dead in the wagon. When 
						Brigham Young came in, he shook hands with all of us. 
						When he saw our condition, our feet frozen and our

						wanted to cut my feet off at the ankles, but President 
						Young said, No, just cut off the toes and I promise you 
						that you will never have to take them off any 
						farther,The doctor amputated my toes using a saw and a

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But it wasnt

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We need so

<font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Many

							general manager of a small company there. We only 
							had 42 employees, but one of them was a member of 
							the Church, a young salesman named Mario. I was 
							serving in the stake presidency, and on one occasion 
							I asked the bishop of our ward: </font></p>
<p class="Style" style="line-height: 16.05pt">
<font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
							&quot;Bishop, how is your family?&quot; He said: &quot;My family

<font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Her

							ever started to pay his tithing, I would give him an 
							11 % salary increase (so that he would have the same 
							amount of money after paying tithing, that he had 
							had before). Naturally, I didn't communicate this to 
							anyone. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My objective 
						this afternoon is to increase your resolve to avail 
						yourselves of everything this university has to offer, 
						in order that you will be prepared for that which lies 
						ahead.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While serving 
						as a mission president I would often have a new 
						missionary approach me and ask the question, How do I 
						regain the spiritual intensity I enjoyed at the MTC? 
						&nbsp;Further discussion would reveal he was having a hard 
						time adjusting to the rigors of the work and the daily 
						adversity and rejection he faced.&nbsp; To help him through 
						this period of his mission I came up with an analogy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Every spring 
						at our home in Bountiful, Utah, we plant flowers.&nbsp; We go 
						down to our local garden center and painstakingly pick 
						out the cartons containing the healthiest flowers we can 
						find including many already blooming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We come home 
						and carefully plant them in the soil, fertilize them, 
						water them, and sit back to watch them grow.&nbsp; Much to 
						our dismay, after a few days they start to wilt.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why does this 
						happen?&nbsp; These plants had lived their whole life in a 
						greenhouse where conditions were ideal, and suddenly 
						they faced the real-world shock of our flower garden.&nbsp; 
						We may get a late snowstorm or a heavy rain; dogs run 
						through the flower beds; grandchildren kick their soccer 
						ball into them or pull the whole flower up and proudly 
						present it as a gift to my wife; deer come often to dine 
						on the tender shoots and nip off the buds or pull the 
						whole flower up and spit out the roots.&nbsp; Last year I 
						trapped and transplanted nine squirrels that delighted 
						in feasting on every new blossom our petunias produced.&nbsp; 
						Our plants had left the greenhouse where all of the 
						elements were ideal and entered the real world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">However, the 
						miraculous thing is that after a few weeks the plants 
						sank their roots deeper and you would see new and 
						stronger growth emanating from within the plant that 
						could withstand the storms of the real world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The MTC is a 
						wonderful greenhouse, but the time comes when 
						missionaries must leave and be subjected to the 
						adversities as well as the joys of the real mission 
						field.&nbsp; It is a delight to watch them grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I 
						received the assignment to speak here, the university 
						sent me a big packet of free stuff.&nbsp; In the brochure 
						entitled, <i>Welcome to BYUIdaho</i>, we read: Guided 
						by its affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of 
						Latter-day Saints, BYUIdaho seeks to develop students 
						who are faithful disciples and capable leaders.&nbsp; This is 
						done by creating a wholesome, righteous learning 
						community in which students can strengthen their 
						testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and 
						receive a quality education that prepares them for 
						leadership in the home, the Church, the community, and 
						the workplace.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In other 
						words, this university is a greenhouse.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again, I 
						encourage you to take advantage of everything offered by 
						this great institution in order that you can face the 
						real world upon graduation and not wilt.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You may be 
						thinking that once you finally graduate you will have 
						reached the end of your troubles.&nbsp; You are right, but I 
						wont tell you which end.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we are not 
						careful, we go through our whole life believing that 
						some upcoming stage of life will bring us ultimate 
						happiness.&nbsp; Once I get my drivers license Ill be 
						happy; then when I graduate from high school Ill be 
						happy; when I go on my mission; when Im released from 
						my mission; when I graduate from college; when I get 
						married; when I have children; when I get that son of 
						mine to go on a mission; when I have grandchildren; 
						etc., etc., etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The truth is, 
						unless you are properly prepared, the challenges of your 
						next stage of life will overshadow the joys associated 
						with it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What are some 
						of the conditions you will face as you enter the real 
						world?&nbsp; The whole world seems to be in commotion. 
						Todays news is filled with accounts of large&#8209;scale 
						famine, civil unrest, wars, and natural disasters.&nbsp; In 
						1979 Elder Bruce R. McConkie spoke of the trials and 
						tribulations ahead when he said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Great trials 
						lie ahead.&nbsp; All of the sorrows and perils of the past 
						are but a foretaste of what is yet to be.&nbsp; And we must 
						prepare ourselves temporally and spiritually.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Peace has 
						been taken from the earth, the angels of destruction 
						have begun their work, and their swords shall not be 
						sheathed until the Prince of Peace comes to destroy the 
						wicked and usher in the great Millennium.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is one of 
						the sad heresies of our time that peace will be gained 
						by weary diplomats as they prepare treaties of 
						compromise, or that the Millennium will be ushered in 
						because men will learn to live in peace and to keep the 
						commandments, or that the predicted plagues and promised 
						desolations of latter days can in some way be avoided 
						(in Conference Report, Mar.-Apr. 1979, 130-32).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Even more 
						devastating to me, in the long run, is the spiritually 
						destructive hurricane of disobedience to Gods 
						commandments that is engulfing the world. This horrible 
						storm is blowing the moral fiber out of the nations of 
						the earth and leaving the land in moral desolation.&nbsp; In 
						the midst of this hurricane most people have become so 
						desensitized that they dont even feel a breeze.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe 
						another challenge you will face is that of increased 
						attacks on the Church and its doctrines.&nbsp; Certainly we 
						have seen an increase this year.&nbsp; As society continues 
						to abandon traditional values and churches compromise 
						doctrines and policies to bring them in line with 
						popular public opinion, we will increasingly stand out 
						as being a peculiar people (Titus 2:14).&nbsp; &nbsp;We most 
						likely will find ourselves standing alone on some 
						issues.&nbsp; We must prepare ourselves for that barrage of 
						public opinion and turn it into a positive opportunity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I dont want 
						to be known as a conveyor of doom and gloom, although at 
						this point I would not be found innocent in a court of 
						law.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While the 
						world is in commotion, the kingdom is intact.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How long can 
						rolling waters remain impure?&nbsp; What power shall stay the 
						heavens?&nbsp; As well might man stretch forth his puny arm 
						to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to 
						turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from 
						pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the 
						Latter-day Saints (D&amp;C 121:33).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We are living 
						in the greatest and most exciting part of this 
						dispensation since the Restoration itself.&nbsp; You will see 
						unbelievable growth in the kingdom.&nbsp; This university 
						experience will help you maximize your victories as well 
						as mitigate your defeats. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">From the 
						mission statement read earlier I would conclude that the 
						role of this university is to prepare you spiritually 
						and intellectually for that which lies ahead in order 
						that you can not only be prepared for leadership in the 
						home, the Church, the community, and the workplace, but 
						so you can survive and thrive in the real world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would now 
						like to discuss the interplay between the spiritual and 
						intellectual knowledge you will gain at this 
						university.&nbsp; My hypothesis is that spiritual and 
						intellectual learning and progress are mutually 
						dependent on each other if we are to reach our ultimate 
						potential in both disciplines.&nbsp; Without spirituality and 
						the ability to obtain revelation, your intellectual 
						powers are limited and, likewise, your spiritual 
						progress is curtailed if you dont increase and use your 
						intellectual skills.&nbsp; Thats the beauty of a university 
						such as this, where the importance of both are 
						understood and taught.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As General 
						Authorities we interview prospective teachers for this 
						and other Church schools.&nbsp; I will usually ask the 
						candidates why they want to teach here.&nbsp; With few 
						exceptions they will include the unique luxury this 
						university provides to increase the testimonies of the 
						students along with teaching them their respective 
						courses.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As a 
						sophomore at BYU in Provo I took a geology class.&nbsp; A 
						large part of this class concerned itself with the 
						scientific explanation of this earths history, 
						including the theory of evolution.&nbsp; On the first day of 
						class the teacher went to the blackboard and took us 
						through the Creation as outlined in our ancient and 
						modern scriptures, making a chronological list of 
						events. He spent the whole hour speaking of the Savior 
						and His creations.&nbsp; He bore a powerful testimony about 
						the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, including our 
						modern scriptures, with special emphasis on the Pearl of 
						Great Price.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am indebted 
						to this great teacher for expanding my vision about the 
						Creation as recorded in the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter of 
						Abraham.&nbsp; For example, in the 18<sup>th</sup> verse we 
						read:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">And the Gods watched those things 
						which they had ordered until they obeyed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">You may wish to read and ponder

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">On the second day of class the 
						teacher had covered up the blackboard of the previous 
						day and wrote the chronology of the earths history 
						according to science, including all the various 
						periods.&nbsp; He then pulled the board back and displayed

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Most of you students 
			listening to this talk today have great dreams and aspirations. For 
			some of you, these dreams have been systematically recorded as 
			written goals. For others, they may be just whispy hopes of how life 
			will turn out to be. Hope springs eternal in the hearts of the 
			youngespecially those seeking a college education. What would your 
			dreams sound like if reduced to writing?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">About this time every 
			year, some people begin to compose their annual Christmas letters, 
			the newsy epistles they stuff into envelopes with their Christmas 
			cards. Christmas letters are a custom in the United States, 
			especially among Latter-day Saints. Lets fast forward twenty-five 
			or thirty years and read a Christmas letter that reflects the 
			fulfillment of some of the dreams you and your classmates may have. 
			Well pretend this one is written by you or your spouse.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Dear family and 
			friends, the letter begins inauspiciously. But it builds from 
			there. Our Christmas greetings this year come from the sunny 
			beaches of Hawaii, where Mary and I are spending the holidays with 
			all of our children. Actually, Mary and I have been here since we 
			stopped by on our way back from Oslo, Norway, where we jointly 
			received the Nobel Peace Prize.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With humility, the letter 
			continues: If the truth be known, the Peace Prize came as a total 
			surprise to us. After I won the prize for chemistry a few years ago 
			and Mary won the one for literature, we thought we were done. For 
			most recipients, as you know, a Nobel Prize <i>is</i> a 
			once-in-a-lifetime experience. But life is full of surprises.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Anyway, the letter 
			continues, enough about the two of us. The children are all doing 
			great. John Jr. finished his mission this year as assistant to the 
			president and returned home in time to start spring football 
			practice. Hes able to spend only a couple of days with us here in 
			the islands because he has to get back to prepare for the BCS 
			championship game. Being quarterback for the number one team in the 
			nation does have its drawbacks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While we were in Oslo, 
			we were pleased but stunned to learn that John Jr. had won the 
			Heisman Trophyagain. It came as a real shock to us, especially 
			after the two years he took off for a mission. In hindsight, I guess 
			we should have known he was a serious candidate, since he also won 
			the trophy during his freshman, sophomore, and junior years. But we 
			didnt want to assume anything. And if the truth be known, the 
			fourth Heisman wasnt quite as thrilling as the first. When he 
			graduated from high school at age sixteen and immediately became 
			starting quarterback on his college team, we were thrilled. When he 
			won the Heisman that same year, we just couldnt believe it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our daughter Ann is 
			following in her mothers footsteps. She brushed up that novel she 
			wrote during her sophomore year and sold it to a major New York 
			publisher. Its been at the top of the <i>Times</i> bestseller list 
			for twenty-six weeks now, and sales show no signs of slowing down. 
			Shes having a tough time deciding which offer for movie rights she 
			should accept. Were pleased that she won the National Book Award 
			and the Pulitzer Prize while still in collegeand shes only 
			nineteen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Finally, our dear little 
			Suzie is quite the prodigy, if we do say so ourselves. Participating 
			in both the summer and winter Olympics, she has now won twelve gold 
			medals. Although shes just seventeen, she received her third 
			technology patent last month and already has royalties running in 
			the millions. After passing by offers to teach at Harvard, Oxford, 
			Julliard, and M.I.T., she has focused on musical performance, and 
			her first recording just reached platinum status. Shes been 
			interested in politics for a long time, and officials in our state 
			are already talking about running her for senatorthat is, when she 
			gets old enough to qualify.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We all love our church 
			callings. I really enjoyed serving as bishop at age twenty-five, 
			stake president at thirty, and mission president at forty, 
			especially after I sold my start-up company for billions and was 
			able to retire young. Mary has been serving as stake Relief Society 
			president and has nearly worn herself out on the fireside circuit. 
			Being on the cover of <i>Time,</i> <i>Newsweek,</i> and half the 
			fashion magazines this past year has been flattering for our family, 
			but I think we liked being on the cover of the recent <i>Church News</i> 
			most of all.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well, we hope the past 
			year has been as good to you as it has been to us. Best wishes for a 
			Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A little over the top? 
			Perhaps. But most young people have dreams of life that end, like 
			fairy tales, with the line, And they lived happily ever after.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please dont 
			misunderstand me. The Book of Mormon teaches us, Men are, that they

			Happiness really is lifes purpose and will ultimately be our 
			blessing if we live the laws on which it is predicated. But it may 
			not come in quite the way we expect it. We sometimes think that 
			being happy means avoiding all problems, and we may grow 
			disillusioned if our superficial dreams seem to shatter. We may 
			forget that one of lifes requirements is to face opposition and 
			overcome itand we dont always get to choose the kind of opposition 
			we will face.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Simply put, mortalitys 
			tests mean that life wont turn out exactly the way we planned it. 
			For example, most young Latter-day Saints plan to marry. They hope 
			for spouses who are spiritual giants, besides being physically 
			attractive, mentally brilliant, and emotionally strong, supportive, 
			and fun-loving. In addition, many just assume that someday they will 
			be richor at least prosperous enough not to worry about money. Many 
			young people plan to be healthy their whole lives, living to a ripe, 
			old age while retaining all the beauty and vigor of youth. Most hope 
			to have children someday, children who are born whole and healthy 
			and who grow up to be well-behaved and accomplished, both 
			spiritually and temporally. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we have such typical 
			dreams, at some point in life disappointing reality may set in, 
			bringing with it heartache. For example, despite a strong desire to 
			marry, many persons go through life without ever having the 
			opportunity to do so. Some who marry experience the distress of 
			watching a spouse wander from the path of righteousness. Others 
			struggle with their spouses through physical or mental illnesses or 
			tragic accidents that may permanently alter some aspects of the 
			marriage relationship. Still others experience the pain of becoming 
			widowed or divorced. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many couples who long for 
			children find themselves childless. Others have children, only to 
			lose them to death. Still others help bring children into the world 
			who face challenging physical or mental handicaps. Many teach the 
			gospel to their children, only to watch, in dismay, as they wander 
			into sinful paths or make other serious mistakes that might have 
			been avoided. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Despite dreams of riches, 
			most people end up facing financial challenges that create deep 
			worries. Some students struggle through school only to find that the 
			real world is even colder and crueler than they expected. Some 
			dream of acceptance into a particular graduate school or program, 
			only to face rejection. Others make it in and work hard but fail to 
			achieve the worldly success or recognition for which they hoped.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Even those who seem to 
			succeed in school and land high-potential jobs may still face 
			reverses. Health problems, family difficulties, economic downturns, 
			layoffs, and other challenges can derail or destroy careers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why am I telling you all 
			this? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Not to discourage 
			youquite the contrary. What I want to do today is focus our 
			thoughts on one simple concept that will lead to the kind of success 
			that really matters in lifesuccess that lasts beyond the grave. 
			That simple concept is true love.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What? some of you are 
			thinking. I thought he just told us that true love may never be 
			ours in this life!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If youre thinking about 
			true love in the mushy, oohy-gooey, Hollywood sense, youre right. 
			But thats not what Im talking about. In fact, Hollywoods version 
			of true love may be a contradiction in terms. The kind of love 
			often touted on television and in movies seems to be an endless 
			pursuit of a selfish romantic high. When one partner fails to 
			deliver the required fix, the so-called lover moves on to the next 
			one, trying to regain the high, like a drug addict seeking more or 
			harder drugs. I have watched people move from one girlfriend, 
			boyfriend, or spouse to anothersometimes with the cloak of 
			legalized marriage, sometimes withoutall in the hopeless pursuit of 
			Hollywoods version of true love. But what could be less true than 
			such unfaithful chasing of what turns out to be merely a mirage?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">No, the kind of true 
			love I am talking about today is not something that we chase. 
			Rather, it is something that we choose, using the divine gift of 
			agency. Anyoneregardless of physical appearance, emotional appeal, 
			or marital statuscan have this true love. It has two components: 
			(1) a selfless attitude, and (2) selfless action. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To illustrate what I mean 
			by real true love and to contrast it further with its counterfeit,&nbsp; 
			let me give an example from the marriage contextthough once again I 
			emphasize that it is not restricted to marriage. One reason Im 
			using this marriage example is that many of us in this audience 
			today will not be fooled by Hollywoods counterfeit love, but we may 
			fall into our own version of it if we are not careful.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So heres the scenario, 
			BYUIdaho style: A young man and young woman meet and begin to date. 
			At some point, they begin feeling a romantic attachment for one 
			another. The feeling grows intense. Soon they feel that they cant 
			live without each other. Being faithful and honorable people, they 
			maintain the standards of the Church and of the Honor Code. Before 
			long, arms wrapped around each other, they are gazing longingly at 
			the Rexburg temple. They get engaged. Eager to be married, they pine 
			for their temple wedding day. Finally it comes, fulfilling a 
			lifetime goal and followed by a blissful honeymoon. True love, 
			right?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well, not exactly. Lets 
			call it an opportunity for, or perhaps even the beginning of, true 
			love. But true love in its fullness will come only over time as our 
			commitment and faithfulness is tested. Remember the definition of 
			true love: (1) a selfless attitude, and (2) selfless action. In our 
			BYUIdaho example, how much of what happens during the dating, 
			engagement, and honeymoon comes about because of selfless attitudes 
			and actions? If we are not careful, we can easily fall into the trap 
			of thinking more about ourselves in such settings than about the 
			other person. However wonderful we may feel at the time, that is not 
			true love.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We laugh when we hear the 
			old joke about the young woman on her wedding day who sighs to her 
			Mother, At last, I am at the end of all my troubles. Her wise 
			mother responds, Yes, dear. You just dont know at which end. We 
			laugh because there is so much truth to this statement. Even in our 
			own Latter-day Saint culture, many men and women on their wedding 
			days are focused inwardly on themselves. Just look at the pronouns 
			in our example: At last, <i>I</i> am at the end of all <i>my</i> 
			troubles. It is this inwardly focused attitude that makes me 
			hesitate in calling our BYUIdaho version of romance true love, at 
			least in its fullness. Remember again that true love is a selfless 
			attitude combined with selfless action. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For those fortunate 
			enough to marry, loving a companion is comparatively easy during the 
			heady, euphoric days of dating, courtship, and the honeymoon when 
			beautiful bodies, shared dreams, and raging hormones make spending 
			eternity together seem incredibly attractive. The real test of love 
			comes when beauty, intellect, and emotions fade and much of what we 
			hoped to get from marriage may seem no longer possibleat least in 
			this life. Contrast the popular concept of romantic ecstasy with 
			true love in the full, mature sense. President Gordon B. Hinckley 
			has said, I am satisfied that a happy marriage is not so much a 
			matter of romance as it is an anxious concern for the comfort and 
			well&#8209;being of ones companion. . . . Selfishness is the antithesis 
			of love.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My windows in the Church 
			Office Building let me look out onto the plaza south of the building 
			and east of the Salt Lake Temple. Most weeks of the year, and 
			especially from spring through fall when the weather is warm, brides 
			and grooms fresh from the temple walk across to the plaza to have 
			wedding pictures taken. Local visitors and tourists often stroll 
			through the Church administration block and Temple Square to see the 
			flowers and fountains for which they are famous. When they see 
			brides in their wedding dresses and grooms in their formal attire, 
			they often stop and watch, as if to say, Ah, young love . . . And 
			it is a lovely sight, a picture of hope for the future, a future 
			that can be glorious if the newly married man and woman can shed 
			selfishness and focus on giving, not just receiving. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I want to see true 
			lovegenuine true loveI look at Temple Square and the adjacent 
			Church campus blocks to behold not just the brides and grooms but to 
			watch the hundreds of young and senior missionaries who pass in, 
			out, and through the blocks going to and from their assignments. I 
			see mature couples, sometimes wrinkled and bent with age, walking 
			hand in hand after a lifetime together that has seen trials and 
			tests of their love. I see young and elderly singles likewise going 
			to their assignments, focused on the Lords work and their 
			opportunities to serve others. I see them all going to and from 
			missionary assignments that are sometimes routine or thankless but 
			utterly unselfish, assignments that contribute to benefiting others 
			with little recognition or personal gratification of a worldly 
			nature. Old or young, married or single, walking or 
			wheelchair-bound, they help bring to pass the Lords work and glory.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some of these 
			missionaries come from humble circumstances, others from more 
			affluent homes. Some have attained worldly recognition in their 
			careers, others very little. But they have one thing in common: they 
			will all someday die. Life, for all its wonders, is a terminal 
			condition. Be it today or a century from now, all of us will someday 
			pass beyond the veil into the next life and come to the judgment 
			bar, where our attitudes and actions will be weighed in the balance. 
			What will be the verdict then?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Think about King 
			Belshazzar mentioned in the fifth chapter of Daniel in the Old 
			Testament. He was rich and renowned and reveled in luxury and lust. 
			He threw a party for a thousand of his lords, and they drank 
			wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of 
			iron, of wood, and of stone. In their eating, drinking, and 
			merriment, they forgot about tomorrow until suddenly there came 
			forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote a message on the plaister 
			of the wall of the kings palace. Suddenly the merrymaking came to 
			a screeching halt; the kings countenance was changed, and his 
			thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, 
			and his knees smote one against another.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The king called for his 
			wise menthe astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the 
			soothsayersbut they could not read the writing, nor make known to 
			the king the interpretation thereof. Finally, at the queens 
			suggestion, they called for Daniel, a man filled with the Spirit of 
			God. They offered him the same enticements they had offered the 
			others: that he should be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of 
			gold about his neck, and . . . be the third ruler in the kingdom if 
			he would just interpret the writing on the wall.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">4</font></sup></sup></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let thy gifts be to 
			thyself, and give thy rewards to another, Daniel replied 
			unselfishly, yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make 
			known to him the interpretation. And interpret he did, clearly and 
			unflinchingly. This is the interpretation of the thing, Daniel 
			said. God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it . . . Thou art 
			weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. That night was the 
			kings last.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">5</font></sup></sup></span><font color="#000080"> 
			What reward in the eternities do you think was his?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, the 
			writing is on the wall for us too. Will we spend our days in the 
			selfish pursuit of fame and fortune, lust and luxury? If so, we too 
			will be weighed in the balances, and . . . found wanting. Or will 
			we spend it instead selflessly serving the Lord and our fellowman?
			</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Which is the great 
			commandment in the law? a lawyer asked Jesus in Matthew 22:36. 
			Jesus answered:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">37 . . . Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
			all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in">
<font color="#000080">38 This is the first and great commandment.
			</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt 
			love thy neighbour as thyself.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What are the two great 
			commandments on which the rest of the scriptures hang? Love of God 
			and love of our fellow human beings. True love. Love that combines a 
			selfless attitude with selfless action. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But what about getting an 
			education, making a living, and developing talents? Arent those 
			righteous goals? Dont they count for anything? Of course they do. 
			But in the end, they have little value unless combined with true 
			lovewhat the scriptures call charity. Moroni 7:47 tells us that 
			charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and 
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well 
			with him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It all comes back to 
			charitytrue loveunselfish attitudes and unselfish actions. It 
			doesnt matter what else we accomplish in life. If we obtain 
			degrees, wealth, and honors untold, we are nothing without charity 
			and will be found wanting at the last day. The same is true even of 
			great spiritual gifts. Without charity, they profit us nothing. Paul 
			concludes his treatise on spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 by 
			admonishing us to covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet, he 
			adds, shew I unto you a more excellent way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then follows his 
			masterful discourse on charity in chapter 13. Think about education, 
			wealth, talents, fame, and spiritual gifts in light of his words:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and 
			of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a 
			tinkling cymbal. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and 
			understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all 
			faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am 
			nothing. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the 
			poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, 
			it profiteth me nothing. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Whats he saying? Can we 
			exercise spiritual gifts or have great faith or give all our wealth 
			to feed the hungry and still lack charity? Yes, if we do those 
			things with selfish intent, for personal recognition, or primarily 
			for our own satisfaction or advancement. True charity subjugates all 
			those desires to unselfish intent. Paul continues:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity

<font color="#000080">5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This great principle of 
			charitypure love, true loverequires both unselfish intent and 
			unselfish action. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Applying charity may mean 
			giving up some of our lifetime hopes and dreams in favor of 
			something better, though it be difficult and even painful at times. 
			It means facing the challenging parts of keeping our covenants, 
			fulfilling assignments, and living righteously, even if doing so 
			causes agony. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The perfect example of 
			unselfish attitude and behavior is our Lord and Savior, Jesus 
			Christ. Despite planning His whole life to work out the great 
			atonement in our behalf, He in all His wisdom and perfection was 
			surprised by how hard it finally turned out to be. We read the 
			following in Mark 14, beginning with verse 32:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">32 And they came to a place which was named 
			Gethsemane: . . .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and 
			John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">35 And he went forward a little, and fell on 
			the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might 
			pass from him. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are 
			possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not 
			what I will, but what thou wilt. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How did God the Father 
			react to this prayer? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He could, of course, have 
			taken the cup awaybut not without spoiling the great plan of 
			happiness. He could remove pain in the present, but not without 
			spoiling the future. In His great loveHis pure unselfish love for 
			His Only Begotten and for all of usHe permitted the pain to 
			continue that Christ could win the victory over death. Of one thing, 
			we can all rest assured. God knows us; He loves us; and He will 
			bless us with whatever we need to be ultimately happy. But that 
			happiness will come from bending our will to His, learning of His 
			purposes for us, and serving in whatever circumstances He provides 
			for us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That may mean changing 
			our plans, shelving our dreams, and facing realities we hoped never 
			to confront. Bending our will to the Lords may be our greatest 
			challenge in life. He knows better than we do what is best for us 
			and allows us to face agony that at times seems unbearable. Bending 
			our will to His includes accepting His timing. Gods greatest 
			blessings come in His own due time, often after much pain. We must 
			wait patiently for these blessings, which may or may not come not in 
			this life but will come eventually to the faithful. How often have 
			we been guilty of praying, Please bless me with patience . . . and 
			I want it <span style="font-variant: small-caps">right now!</span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While we are waiting for 
			unrealized but righteously desired blessings, we should not languish 
			or murmur. If marriage, children, economic security, or any other 
			blessing sought with unselfish intent does not come to us soon or 
			ever in this life, we should, like the Lord, say to the Father, 
			nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. Meanwhile, we 
			should recognize and take advantage of the opportunities the Lord 
			does provide. They are all around us, but we need to open our 
			spiritual eyes to see them.</font></p>

			be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Like Alma, we should all 
			be content with what the Lord has allotted to us, difficult or 
			painful or frustrating though it may be at times. President Spencer 
			W. Kimball taught:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">If we looked at mortality as the whole of 
			existence, then pain, sorrow, failure, and short life would be 
			calamity. But if we look upon life as an eternal thing stretching 
			far into the premortal past and on into the eternal post&#8209;death 
			future, then all happenings may be put in proper perspective. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">Is there not wisdom in his giving us trials 
			that we might rise above them, responsibilities that we might 
			achieve, work to harden our muscles, sorrows to try our souls? Are 
			we not exposed to temptations to test our strength, sickness that we 
			might learn patience, death that we might be immortalized and 
			glorified? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">If all the sick for whom we pray were healed, 
			if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the 
			whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic 
			principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended. No man would 
			have to live by faith.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">9</font></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As President Kimball 
			taught, we should live by faith, accept what has been allotted to 
			us, and go forward unselfishly in the spirit of true love to advance 
			the Lords purposes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we live by the Spirit 
			and break out of the selfish shell of self-pity, we will recognize 
			the Lords purposes and become an instrument in His hands. Sometimes 
			lifes greatest challenges are the problems or handicaps that seem 
			irreversible in this life, those that arent healed miraculously as 
			we might hope. Yet charity, the scriptures tell us, envieth not 
			and seeketh not her own.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">10</font></sup></sup></span><font color="#000080"> 
			Seeking not our own means that we dont have to wait to be 
			perfected, or to be healed ourselves, or to have all of our own 
			needs met before we reach out to others. Some of the greatest 
			examples of love come from those who disregard their own needs to 
			help others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In general conference a 
			year ago, Elder Don R. Clarke of the Seventy told how his 
			grandfather went blind and could no longer care for his farm on his 
			own. He received a notice requiring him to make a $195 mortgage 
			payment, something that seemed impossible given the familys reduced 
			circumstances. Then a miracle occurred. Elder Clarkes grandfather 
			later wrote:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">I shall never forget that cold evening, just 
			before Christmas of 1919. It looked as though we would lose the 
			farm. My daughter, Gladys, laid a slip of paper in my hand and said, 
			This came in the mail today. I took it to her mother and asked her 
			what it was. This is what my wife read to me, Dear Brother Larsen, 
			Ive had you on my mind all day today. I am wondering if you are in 
			financial trouble. If you are, I have $200 you may have. The letter 
			was signed Jim Drinkwater. Jim was a small, crippled man, and he 
			would have been the last man on earth that anyone would have thought 
			had that much money on hand. I went to his house that night and he 
			said, Brother Larsen, I received a wireless message from heaven 
			this morning, and I could not get you off my mind all day. I was 
			sure you were in financial trouble. Brother Drinkwater gave me $200 
			and we sent the $195 to the mortgage company, and with the extra $5 
			we bought boots and clothes for the children. Santa Claus did come 
			that year.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></sup></sup></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Jim Drinkwater, the 
			small, crippled man, demonstrated true love. How easy it might 
			have been for him to wallow in self-pity or to think of the comforts 
			he could buy with his money. Instead, he prepared himself by 
			righteous living to be in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. He had

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The hymn A Poor

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Now we are here on earth, and

		and grief. We experience the heartache over the unexpected death of a 
		loved one.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Some couples cannot bear

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to recognize 
		that living a righteous life does not guarantee that bad things will 
		never happen to us. A common misperception among members of the Church 
		is that if we strive with all our might to live the commandments, 
		nothing bad will happen to us. We may believe if we are married in the 
		temple our marriage will automatically be heaven on earth, or if we live 
		the Word of Wisdom we will never get sick. But the truth is that bad 
		things may happen to the best of people. The consequences of good and 
		bad actions will come, but all of the consequences do not always come 
		immediately, and they may not even come in this life.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today well discuss the 
		origins and purposes of adversity and review suggestions on how to
		</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">patiently trust in the 
		Lord and His eternal plan and how to use these trials to learn and grow 
		stronger.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of lifes trials come as 
		a result of sin, others because of unwise choices, and others simply 
		because we are mortals living in a fallen world.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Suffering that comes as a result of our sins or 
		the sins of others is man-made. A husband who chooses to rule his family 
		through intimidation or physical abuse causes suffering and heartache. 
		An individual who chooses to disobey the Word of Wisdom may find himself 
		ensnared in the bondage of addiction. When people use their agency to 
		disregard the commandments of God, they follow Satans plan of misery 
		rather than Gods plan of happiness. If people would embrace and live 
		Gods plan of happiness, there would be peace and joy in the world. Much 
		of the suffering we know today would be eliminated if people just lived 
		the gospel of Jesus Christ.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">7</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Other problems in life are 
		the result of poor decisions and unwise choices by us or other people. 
		For example, many people struggle with the burden of financial debt 
		because they choose to make purchases on credit rather than use 
		self-discipline to delay purchases until they can afford to pay for them 
		in cash. Some students fail classes and later have trouble finding 
		employment because they chose to waste time playing video games.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Some problems we face in life are a natural result 
		of mortality and the world we live in. We are mortals with bodies that 
		will age and that can become ill or injured. Our mortality is an 
		important part of Gods plan of salvation. God created natural laws and 
		put His plan in motion. Although he can control the elements and thus 
		prevent earthquakes and other natural disasters, for the most part He 
		allows nature to run its course.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">So how do we know when a 
		difficulty is our fault or not? Often, we judge ourselves harshly, 
		concluding that problems occur because of something we did wrong or 
		because we failed to do something to prevent them. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">As we consider the degree of 
		our personal fault for the trials in our lives, it may be helpful to 
		think of a continuum with sin at one end and adversity at the other. <br />
<br />
</span></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Our degree of fault is high at the end of the 
		spectrum marked as sin. We should accept full responsibility for these 
		problems we cause. We should repent of these and continually strive to 
		do better. However, as we continue down the spectrum, our fault drops to 
		zero at the end marked by adversity, where we may bear no 
		responsibility at all. These are trials that may come to us, as they did 
		to Job in the Old Testament, regardless of any conscious action on our 
		part.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">9</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		If we blame ourselves for things that are not our fault, we make a bad 
		situation worse by seeing ourselves as bad people who deserve bad 
		things. At times it may be difficult to judge our level of 
		responsibility for problems that fall between these two ends of the 
		spectrum. In these cases, it may be unproductive to spend much effort on 
		establishing blame and searching for answers because it may cause us to 
		lose focus on the very reason for the trial.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the face of misfortune, we 
		can take comfort in knowing that Christs Atonement can heal all 
		suffering. We often speak of the Atonement in terms of relief from sin 
		and guilt. But the Atonement is more. Alma taught that Christ would go 
		forth, <i>suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind;</i> 
		and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon 
		him the <i>pains and the sicknesses</i> of his people. And he will take

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught, If your faith and

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan whereby we 
		can <i>become</i> what our Heavenly Father wants us to become. Elder 
		Oaks explained:&nbsp; The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a 
		sum total of good and evil actswhat we have <i>done.</i> It is an 
		acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughtswhat we have

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">It wasnt until well into my 
		adulthood that I finally realized that life was about more than 
		accumulating points for good deeds. What really matters is what those 
		good actions do to build our characterwhat they help us to <i>become.</i> 
		Take, for example, the parable in Matthew, chapter 20, of the laborers 
		in the vineyard. The master of the vineyard hired laborers at different 
		times of the day. Some worked all day and others only an hour, yet he 
		paid them all the same wage. You will recall that some of the workers 
		murmured at the seeming unfairness of their relative wages. One lesson 
		we can learn from this parable is that we will not earn our eternal 
		reward by a heavenly accounting of the number of hours worked. What will 
		matter is whether our efforts have caused us to <i>become</i> something 
		better. We may be able to refine some aspects of our lives in a few 
		hours work, while other characteristics may take days, years, or our 
		entire lives. God allows each of us to experience the challenges, the 
		suffering, and the trials we need to grow and finally <i>become</i> all 
		that we can be.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Elder Orson F. Whitney explained:&nbsp; No pain

		our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, 
		fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, 
		especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, 
		purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and 
		charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is 
		through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the 
		education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Spiritual growth and strong character can often be 
		achieved more readily by trials and adversity than by comfort and 
		tranquility. Trials can teach us that faith in our Heavenly Father and 
		His Son, Jesus Christ, is the source of inner strength. One of the 
		survivors of the ill-fated Martin handcart company said:&nbsp; We 
		suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and 
		starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Whether your trials are small

<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">the </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Since adversity will come to 
		us all, consider the following ideas to help you face your trials and 
		benefit from them.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">My first suggestion is to develop a relationship 
		with your Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you experience your trials 
		in life. Elder Richard G. Scott explains that God loves you perfectly 
		and would not require you to experience a moment more of difficulty 
		than is absolutely needed for your personal benefit or for that of those 
		you love.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">17</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">President Harold B. Lee once remarked:&nbsp; 
		Dont be afraid of the testing and trials of life. Sometimes when you 
		are going through the most severe tests, you will be nearer to God than 
		you have any idea, for like the experience of the Master himself in the 
		temptation on the mount, in the Garden of Gethsemane, and on the cross 
		at Calvary, the scriptures record, And, behold, angels came and 
		ministered unto him. (Matt. 4:11.) Sometimes that may happen to you in 
		the midst of your trials.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">18</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">You can face adversity more 
		easily when you understand who you are, who your Father is, who your 
		Savior is, and the relationship you have with Them. One of the purposes 
		of trials is to help you come to know Christ, understand His teachings 
		in your mind, feel them in your heart, and live them in your life. It is 
		through our struggles that we come to know and appreciate Him.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">My second suggestion is to let others help you. 
		President Spencer W. Kimball taught,&nbsp; God does notice us, and he 
		watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets 
		our needs.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">19</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Allow other people to be instruments in the Lord's hands to help you 
		through the challenges in life.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">President Ezra Taft Benson taught that heavenly 
		hosts are also pulling for us. He called them friends in heaven that we 
		cannot now remember who yearn for our victory.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">20</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		A survivor of the Martin handcart company recounted his experience, 
		saying:&nbsp; I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary 
		from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of 
		the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope 
		and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I 
		cannot pull the load through it. . . . I have gone on to that sand and 
		when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many 
		times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew 
		then that the angels of God were there.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">21</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Another suggestion is to 
		remember to let God carry your burdens. When I face trials in life, I 
		often find myself trying to carry the entire load on my shoulders. Then 
		I remember the Saviors invitation, Come unto me, all ye that labour 
		and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span></font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">22</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In some cases, He removes our 
		burdens; in other cases, He strengthens us to endure them. When Alma and 
		his people were under the oppression of the Lamanites, they cried 
		mightily to God for deliverance. The Lord did not remove their 
		persecution, but promised to help them carry the burden.&nbsp; And it 
		came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their 
		afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I . 
		. . will . . . ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that 
		even you cannot feel them upon your backs. . . . And now it came to pass 
		that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made 
		light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their 
		burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to 
		all the will of the Lord.</span></font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">23</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">God can ease your burdens and 
		make them light. When you turn to God, you will not only find the 
		comfort you seek, but in so doing you will gain an increased testimony 
		of the reality of the Savior and His Atonement. This may be one of the 
		higher purposes of adversity in our lifeto build our faith and help us 
		come unto Christ.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">My fourth suggestion is to 
		trust that the Lord is in control and allow His will to be done. He lets 
		us have hard days, months, or lives because those are the experiences we 
		need to grow. I believe that the specific challenges I have faced in my 
		life were the specific ways I had to learn the lessons I needed to 
		learn. I believe I am the man I am today <i>because</i> of the trials 
		Ive experienced, not <i>in spite</i> of them.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">A year ago, a man in our ward 
		was diagnosed with cancer. By the time the cancer was detected, the 
		tumor had grown around the bone and nerves in a way that made it 
		inoperable. Randy was given 10 months to live. He began chemotherapy 
		treatments, and his family and the ward began fasting and praying for 
		him and others in the ward with serious health problems. At nine months, 
		on Randys last visit to his doctor, the doctor sat at the desk and 
		shook his head. Nine months before, Randy was given no chance of 
		survival; that day, the tests showed no signs of a tumor.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">God answers prayers and 
		performs miracles today. But why did God perform a miracle by sparing 
		Randys life when another man in our ward died from cancer just a few 
		weeks later? The other mans family and the ward prayed and fasted for 
		him as well. In both cases, there were lessons to be learnedfor the 
		individuals involved, for their families, and for the ward. Faith was 
		tested, people became stronger, and a ward grew closer together.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">As we pray for the Lord to 
		remove our burdens, we should also pray that His will be done and that 
		we be granted the strength we need to endure our trials with patience 
		and faith. As we do, the Lord will grant us the peace and comfort we 
		seek.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Elder Richard G. Scott explained:&nbsp; The Lord 
		is intent on your personal growth and development. That progress is 
		accelerated when you willingly allow Him to lead you through every 
		growth experience you encounter, whether initially it be to your 
		individual liking or not. When you trust in the Lord, when you are 
		willing to let your heart and your mind be centered in His will, when 
		you ask to be led by the Spirit to do His will, you are assured of the 
		greatest happiness along the way and the most fulfilling attainment from 
		this mortal experience. If you question everything you are asked to do, 
		or dig in your heels at every unpleasant challenge, you make it harder 
		for the Lord to bless you.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">24</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">My next suggestion is to 
		recognize that everyone has challenges. When we consider the trials that 
		other people have, ours may not seem so difficult. I once met a man who 
		was just a few months old when he lost sight in both eyes. He could have 
		let his disability ruin his life, but instead he empowered his hearing 
		and became a concert pianist. He developed the ability to re-create on 
		the piano the music he hears. Since he cant read the scriptures, he 
		could have become spiritually dormant. But instead, he developed a 
		spiritual sensitivity by listening daily to recordings of the 
		scriptures.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">A colleague of mine has a 
		disabled child who needs total care. Even now that she is an adult, they 
		must lift her out of bed, feed her, and change her diapers. She requires 
		physical therapy and daily medication. As my friend goes about his daily 
		work, I seldom think about the extra emotional energy he gives at home 
		to care for his daughters needs. He is sometimes fatigued by the late 
		nights and the financial pressures but somehow finds the strength to go 
		on. When I talk with parents of disabled children, they explain that 
		their experiences increase their capacity to love, and they are blessed 
		in many ways. They often seem to be the ones who develop strong 
		character traits of sensitivity and endurance that perhaps they would 
		not have been able to develop without these experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">My sixth suggestion is to 
		take advantage of adversity by letting it make you a better person. 
		Trials effect people in different ways. Some people see them as 
		challenges to overcome; others see them as excuses to fail. Although we 
		cannot control all the forces that cause adversity, we can control what 
		adversity does to us. We can let trials make us bitter and jealous, or 
		we can use them to become sensitive and compassionate. </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">A woman in my stake fought a 
		battle with cancer. Although she endured pains and heartache that few 
		people understood, she remained cheerful and optimistic. She lost her 
		hair and, after spinal surgery, wore a metal brace to immobilize her 
		head. As embarrassed as she must have felt by her appearance, she came 
		to church meetings and smiled and tried to cheer up everyone else.</span></font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">25</font></span></span><font color="#000080"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
		She wrote her own obituary, which, in part, reads: Today at the young 
		age of 33 I left this mortal existence to a holier sphere. I was born . 
		. . to wonderful parents . . . who taught me to live life well. . . . We 
		have three sweet children who I will miss greatly. At the young age of 
		29, I was introduced to something called cancer. Cancer was my great 
		adversary but I have learned that in this life our enemies can become 
		our choicest friends; the secret is in learning what to do with the 
		conflict.</span><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
</span></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">To find strength in challenges, draw closer to 
		God, even if conditions dont appear to be resolved as you would want. 
		Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught:&nbsp; Healing blessings come in many ways, 
		each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. 
		Sometimes a healing cures our illness or lifts our burden. But 
		sometimes we are healed by being given strength or understanding or 
		patience to bear the burdens placed upon us.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">26</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">In the face of trials, take comfort in these words 
		of the Lord: My grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves 
		before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in 
		me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">27</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		What an amazing blessing! The very things we thought were weaknesses can 
		become our strengths! Take the trials you have and use them to your 
		advantage. Remember, we become great people <i>because</i> of our 
		trials, not <i>in spite</i> of them.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Another important concept is 
		to live with integrity in the midst of your trials. When faced with 
		seemingly insurmountable challenges, you may be tempted to take the easy 
		way out. For example, the world teaches that people who experience 
		same-gender attractions are born that way and have no other option. The 
		gospel teaches differently. However, in the face of such a difficult and 
		often confusing challenge, people may find it easier to accept the 
		worlds view. Satan whispers to people that they cant control their 
		behavior or that they shouldnt have to deprive themselves of 
		same-gender sexual relationships. If you have a testimony of the 
		truthfulness of the gospel and if you are converted to Christ, your only 
		option is to live your life with integrity to the principles you know to 
		be true. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Cody has felt same-gender 
		attractions ever since he was a young boy. He knows he is a son of God. 
		He knows that the commandments and the blessings of the gospel are as

		understanding of his feelings. He has also talked with others who have 
		grown past their same-gender attractions and hardly ever feel them 
		anymore. But for whatever reason, Codys feelings are still intense. 
		Nevertheless, he is committed to living a chaste life, even if he never 
		gets to the point in this life that he can marry. He knows that if he 
		lives faithfully, all the blessings of the gospel will be his, either in 
		this life or in the next. I admire Cody for his integrity in the face of 
		an immense inner struggle. Cody and others like him are great examples 
		of standing up courageously to the trials in their lives. </span></font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Yielding to adversity makes 
		us weaker. Keeping the commandmentsno matter how tryingmakes us

<font color="#000080">President Henry B. Eyring reminds us:&nbsp; We 
		need strength beyond ourselves to keep the commandments in whatever

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Another helpful guideline is 
		to be patient. We live in a world of instant gratification. We want fast 
		food, quick loans, instant solutions to our problems, and constant 
		emotional comfort. If we cant solve a problem in minutes or days, we

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">There were times when I have 
		asked a few direct questions in my prayers, such as, What lessons dost 
		Thou want me to learn from these experiences? </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">On a few occasions, I told the Lord that I had 
		surely learned the lessons to be taught and that it wouldnt be 
		necessary for me to endure any more suffering. Such entreaties seemed to 
		be of no avail, for it was made clear to me that this purifying process 
		of testing was to be endured in the Lords time and in the Lords own 
		way. It is one thing to teach, Thy will be done (Matt. 26:42). It is 
		another to live it.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">29</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the midst of your trials, 
		consider that the Lord may ask you to show your faith by enduring 
		patiently. Today, you may not be able to grasp all the reasons for your 
		challenges or the opportunities they will give you to grow. You may have 
		to learn line upon line. As you patiently endure in righteousness, He 
		may reveal to you greater understanding about your trials and the 
		purpose of them in your life.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">Another important way we can meet our challenges 
		successfully is to focus on serving others. We heal ourselves of pain 
		when we reach out to help others. Service is the great healer. There is 
		an old Chinese tale of a woman whose only son died. In her grief, she 
		went to the holy man and said, What prayers, what magical incantations 
		do you have to bring my son back to life? Instead of send­ing her away 
		or reasoning with her, he said to her, Fetch me a mustard seed from a 
		home that has never known sorrow. We will use it to drive the sorrow out 
		of your life. The woman set off at once in search of that magical 
		mustard seed. She came first to a splendid mansion, knocked at the door, 
		and said, I am looking for a home that has never known sorrow. Is this 
		such a place? It is very important to me. They told her, Youve 
		certainly come to the wrong place, and began to describe all the tragic 
		things that had recently befallen them. The woman said to herself, Who 
		is better able to help these poor unfortunate people than I, who have 
		had misfortune of my own? She stayed to comfort them, then went on in 
		her search for a home that had never known sorrow. But wherever she 
		turned, in hovels and in palaces, she found one tale after another of 
		sadness and misfortune. Ultimately, she became so involved in 
		ministering to other peoples grief that she forgot about her quest for 
		the magical mustard seed, never realizing that it had in fact driven the 
		sorrow out of her life.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">30</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">My final suggestion in facing lifes challenges is 
		to keep an eternal perspective. Elder Richard G. Scott taught us to keep 
		a long-term perspective when he said:&nbsp; The challenges you face, 
		the growth experiences you encounter, are intended to be temporary 
		scenes played out on the stage of a life of continuing peace and 
		happiness. Sadness, heartache, and disappointment are events in life. It 
		is not intended that they be the substance of life. I do not minimize 
		how hard some of these events can be. When the lesson you are to learn 
		is very important, trials can extend over a long period of time, but 
		they should not be allowed to become the confining focus of everything 
		you do. Your life can and should be wondrously rewarding. It is your 
		understanding and application of the laws of God that will give your 
		life glorious purpose as you ascend and conquer the difficulties of 
		life. That perspective keeps challenges confined to their proper 
		placestepping-stones to further growth and attainment.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">31</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of the personal 
		challenges we experience in this life are conditions of mortality that 
		will not continue into the next life. To the person who was born with 
		mental deficiencies, and to the person who has no reasonable expectation 
		of marriage in this life, and to the person who has not yet been able to 
		overcome same-gender attractions, I counsel you to keep an eternal 
		perspective. Even though the present difficulties may at times seem more 
		than you can bear, an understanding of eternal truths is a powerful 
		motivation for righteous behavior. You are best served by concentrating 
		on the things you can presently understand and controlnot wasting 
		energy or enlarging frustration by worrying about that which God has not 
		yet fully revealed. Our present trials do not determine who we really 
		are, but our response to them does influence who we will become.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font color="#000080">President Brigham Young taught:&nbsp; We talk 
		about our trials and troubles here in this life; but suppose that you 
		could see yourselves thousands and millions of years after you have 
		proved faithful to your religion during the few short years in this 
		time, and have obtained eternal salvation and a crown of glory in the 
		presence of God? Then look back upon your lives here, and see the 
		losses, crosses, and disappointments, the sorrows . . . ; you would be 
		constrained to exclaim, but what of all that? Those things were but for 
		a moment, and we are now here. We have been faithful during a few 
		moments in our mortality, and now we enjoy eternal life and glory, with 
		power to progress in all the boundless knowledge and through the 
		countless stages of progression, enjoying the smiles and approbation of 
		our Father and God, and of Jesus Christ our elder brother. </font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">32</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">If we turn to Christ for 
		strength, we can find comfort in the face of adversity. We can have 
		faith and hope to accept and face it when it comes. We can suffer trials 
		with patience. We can forgive cruelty. We can love those who hate us. We 
		can face death with dignity.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">I am grateful for the 
		doctrines of the restored gospel. They give us an eternal perspective 
		that provides hope and courage to bear all of lifes trials. Trials can 
		bless our lives if we learn from them and turn weakness into strength. I 
		testify that each of us has the strength to bear each challenge in life 
		because of who we are, who God is, and who we are together. In the name 
		of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">1845 was a 
		busy year for the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois. Still mourning 
		the violent death of the Prophet, they continued their efforts to 
		complete the Nauvoo temple, spread the gospel, and gather believers, 
		even as conflict with critics and dissenters hastened plans for an 
		exodus to the West. On a Sunday in August 1845, Brigham Young paused 
		from the demands of leadership to record a dream hed had the previous 
		night. I dreamed . . . I saw Brother Joseph Smith, he wrote, and as I 
		was going about my business, he said, Brother Brigham, dont be in a 
		hurry. Joseph repeated the counsel twice more, with some degree of 
		sharpness:&nbsp; Brother Brigham, dont be in a hurry. Brother Brigham, 
		dont be in a hurry (History of the Church 7:435).&nbsp; </span></font></p>

		then, and think of all the thingsmundane and meaningfulthat compete 
		for our attention every day. We live in a world of fast food, rapid 
		transit, instant messaging, and constant claims about how to get rich

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Perhaps

		45:26; 88:91). As President James E. Faust observed, Our hurry to meet 
		the relentless demands of the clock tears away at our inner peace 
		(Ensign, July 2005, 2). Its easy to see how love can fade, fear can 
		rise, and sin can harden a distracted heart in a hurry.</span></font></p>

		Holy Ghost to help us understand one another, be edified, and rejoice 
		together (see D&amp;C 50:22)and you can pray too. Lets explore four areas 
		where the tendency to hurry may blind us to the immediate goodness of

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In the

		earth is actually a gift from God? While we go about our business, 
		this earth is hurtling through space, spinning on its axis, and all the 
		while the Lord is preserving [us] from day to day, lending [us] 
		breath to live and move and do what we will, and even supporting [us] 
		from one moment to another (Mosiah 2:21).</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Consider 
		the Creators magnificent effort to organize our place in the solar 
		system to provide us with days and nights and seasons and years. If 
		attentive, we can sense the rhythms of mortal life reminding us that He 
		first loved us (1 John 4:19) Do we recall, when complaining that 
		theres just never enough time, that God actually prolonged the days 
		of our first fallen parents, granting them time to repent and find 
		joy in this life and beyond? (2 Nephi 2:21, 25) Can we remember, when 
		peeved at pauses and delays, that we live on borrowed time, purchased by 
		the Saviors blood, and that everything He does is for the benefit of 
		the world? (2 Nephi 26:24; see also 1 Corinthians 6:19-20)</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">And in

		Which is the first commandment of all, Jesus replied, thou shalt love 
		the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . soul, . . . mind, and . . . 
		strength: this is the first commandment (Mark 12:28-30; see also Deut. 
		6:5; Matt. 22:37). I think we know those wordsthey hearken back to 
		Sinai and have been restated in our day (see Exodus 20:2; D&amp;C 59:5)but 
		we may sometimes forget the power of keeping the first commandment in 
		our hurried pursuit of other good things.</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The 
		problem reminds me of a little test teachers sometimes give students to 
		see how well they follow directions. The test is pretty simple, but it 
		uses the press of time, a lengthy list of directions or tasks, and our 
		forgetful tendency to hurry against us. Remember, the first set of 
		directions is <b>crucial</b>, and they go something like this: read all 
		directions carefully before doing anything. Got it? Then come some 
		other instructions: write your name in the upper right hand corner of 
		the page; draw five squares in the upper left hand corner of the 
		page; write the city where you were born; and everyones favorites, 
		clap your hands three times, and say out loud, I am nearly finished. 
		I have followed directions. Did you recognize the trap? What were 
		those first directions again? Those who read all directions carefully 
		before doing anything, find the following instructions, usually at the 
		end: now that you have read all of the directions carefully, go back 
		and do only number 2. &nbsp;They write their name and sit quietly, while

<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
		Remembering the first great commandment can save us from far more 
		serious traps. I think that this is what President Spencer W. Kimball 
		meant when he said, we will move faster if we hurry less. Undistracted 
		by other gods, we trust the Lord to help us allocate our time and 
		talents to their very best uses each day. As a result, we do more good,

<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Years ago, 
		President Ezra Taft Benson asked a great question: Why did God put the 
		first commandment first? His answer showed me the grace that flows into 
		our lives when we love the Lord. Not only will we want to keep His other 
		commandments, but He will help us keep them better, granting us wisdom 
		and strength that enhance our capacity to love our neighbors as our 
		selves. When we put God first, President Benson promised, all other 
		things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. For that 
		reason and others, We bless our fellowmen the most when we put the 
		first commandment first (Ensign, May 1988, 4, 6). </span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">If youre 
		wondering what you can do to put God first and love him more deeply, 
		consider the power of the word. President Kimball found that he drew 
		closer to God and loved him more intensely when he immersed himself in 
		the scriptures (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 135). President Henry 
		B. Eyring taught us to go to the words of prophets because they help us 
		know [God. And as] we know Him better, we love Him more (Ensign,

		Saviors Atonement actually preserved our agency (see 2 Nephi 2:26-27). 
		And this life is more than an earthly career; it is a time to prepare 
		to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state . . . after the 
		resurrection (Alma 12:24). God knows infinitely more about that state

<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">I love

		Nephi put it this way: [Y<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">e] must

<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; layout-grid-mode: line">
		That kind of praying was modeled for me one morning when I taught at the

<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">And yet, 
		it seems that many of us live each day like we give talkswe generally 
		remember to close in the name of the Son, but we forget to open the day 
		in His name. Decades after that dream with Joseph, Brigham asked a 
		congregation in Utah if they had prayed that morning as families. 
		Observing that many had not, he proposed an all too familiar reason: I 
		was in too much of a hurry. I fear that rings familiar for many of us, 
		as time to commune with the Lord gets squeezed in the morning rush 
		hour.&nbsp; Ere you left your room this morning, did <b>you</b> think to 
		pray? (see Hymns, 140)</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Then

		in the morning, before you suffer yourselves to eat one mouthful of 
		food, . . . bow down before the Lord, ask him to forgive your sins, and 
		protect you . . . from temptation and all evil, to guide your steps 
		aright, that you may do something that day that shall be beneficial to 
		the kingdom of God on earth (Deseret News Weekly, 5 June 1872, 248).</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">That 
		counsel has blessed my life as it reminds me each morning to kneel in 
		prayer before I tackle the tasks ahead. As I pray, I frequently think of 
		the metaphor Brigham used to teach the Saints: Keep your dish right 
		side up, he said, so that when the shower of porridge does come you 
		can catch your dish full (Deseret News Weekly, 5 June 1872, 248). Do 
		you picture the image? Youve got your dish, prayer turns it upward to 
		receive, and the porridge is Gods sustaining spiritual gifts, sent to 
		nourish and strengthen you through the demands of the day.&nbsp; Think of it 
		as your daily breadmanna from heaven. </span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">How sad to 
		dash into the world without thinking to pray, and thereby fail to 
		catch our Fathers gifts that day. Too many in college are like the 
		little boy President Faust once described. Asked why he prayed at night 
		but not in the morning, the little boy said, I aint scared in the 
		daytime (Ensign, May 2002, 60-61). But wait a minuteyou know better. 
		Daytime is when you do most of your work and face most of your 
		testsits usually scarier than sleeping time, isnt it? As President 
		Faust put it, You need help from a power beyond your own to do 
		something extraordinarily useful (Ensign, May 2002, 47). And some days 
		you may need that power just to be <b>ordinarily</b> decent and kind.

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
		Missionaries learn that they cant do it all themselves, and it shows in 
		their mornings. They seek the Lord early in prayer and study, usually 
		calling on Him at least a few times before they even leave their 
		apartment. By getting up early and not hurrying past prayer, they 
		prepare themselves for help and guidance later, and thereby bless others 
		in the name of the Son.</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">My 
		neighbor Joe Woods had such an experience while serving in Trinidad. One 
		day in November, like other days, he and his companion prayed several 
		times before they went to work. Later that day, they had a long walk up 
		Port-au-Spains biggest hill to teach an investigator at the home of a 
		local Church member, and they were a little behind schedule. As they 
		hustled up Z street, a drunken man named John loudly asked them what 
		they were doing on the island. (Now, drunken men are often less than 
		ideal contacts, as my wife could tell you.) But this time, despite their 
		hurry, the elders stopped; it may have been Johns felt hat or red 
		sneakers, but it was probably something more. </span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">That 
		morning they had practiced teaching through questions, so Elder Woods 
		tried out a couple of questionsWhat are <i>you</i> doing? Why are you 
		drunk? In reply, John asked them to pray for him. There in the street 
		they bowed their heads, and Elder Woods prayed, asking God to help John 
		stop drinking and get baptized. You dont get to pray like that in your 
		own name, but only in the name of the Son. As he prayed, John started 
		weeping. Its true that drunken people can weep easily, but this was 
		different. The elders walked a little way with him, made an appointment 
		to teach him the next day, and continued to their previous engagement, 
		arriving late. When they returned to teach John the next day, he 
		struggled to explain what he felt as Joe prayed. It was so new, and so 
		powerful, that remembering it quenched his thirst for alcohol. Elder 
		Woods prayer was answered: John stopped drinking, and later he got 
		baptized. They met in the evening, but the story began that morning.</span></font></p>

		between [our] tasks to the green belts of grass, trees, and water that

		about the wonder of creation? Have you read any evidence of a mad dash 
		to guard the tree of life after Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden 
		fruit? When young Joseph Smith found himself in the fight of his life, 
		seized upon by a powerful enemy who wanted to choke his prayer with 
		despair and destroy him; when it took all [of Josephs] powers 
		[simply] to call upon God to deliver him; at this moment of great 
		alarm (not only for the Prophet but his adversary)how did deliverance 
		come? In a pillar of light . . . which descended <b>gradually</b> until 
		it fell upon me (JS-H 1:15-17). The Father and the Son were in no 
		hurry, for they were masters of the situation.</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Do we want 
		to be tutored by such masters? If we do, we should recognize that their 
		pace and timing may be much different from our own. Remembering the 
		patient and watchful care with which they prepared the schoolroom of 
		this earth, we can anticipate a long and wondrous tutorial when it comes 
		to the perfecting of their saints. Paul described their aim for us 
		this way: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the 
		knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the 
		stature of the fulness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13). To learn and grow 
		into the <b>stature of the fulness of Christ</b> is an awesome aimand 
		it is not an overnight project.</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">So, are we 
		ready? Where to begin? For me, it is significant that the first step 
		King Benjamin taught his people about becoming Saints was to <b>yield</b> 
		to the enticings of the Holy Spirit (Mosiah 3:19). Learning to yield 
		is foundational, I think, in the tests that follow. It is certainly 
		prerequisite to the final examination, which requires us to be meek, 
		humble, patient, full of love, [and] willing to submit to whatever the 
		Lord requires (Mosiah 3:19). The word yield reminds me of another 
		verbto letas in let the Holy Spirit guide (Hymns, 143); or let the 
		solemnities of eternity rest upon your mind (D&amp;C 43:34); or let your 
		hearts be comforted (D&amp;C 98:1); or let your hearts rejoice (D&amp;C 
		100:12).</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Still, 
		many of us grow impatient with our progress, continually seeking hints 
		that the Lord is really working with us, that our efforts please him, 
		and that we are changing for the better. In a frantic search for 
		approval, we may even settle for the honors of men or ask for a sign 
		that [we] may consume it upon [our lusts] (D&amp;C 121:35; 46:9). Instead, 
		we need to ask with a firmness unshaken . . . that [we] will serve the 
		true and living God (Mormon 9:28). If we commit our hearts and minds to 
		love and serve God and our neighbors, our small deeds will bring about 
		something great in us; even though all things must come to pass in 
		their time (D&amp;C 64:31-33).&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">President 
		Boyd K. Packer said we grow taller in testimony like our bodies grow 
		in stature, which makes it hard to notice. He pleaded, Do not be 
		impatient to gain great spiritual knowledge. Let it grow, help it grow, 
		but do not force it or you will open the way to be misled (Ensign, 
		January 1983, 53-54). </span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Think 
		about the metaphor Alma used to show how testimony and conversion 
		progressit was a seed that grows into a tree. Have you ever planted a 
		tree from a seed? That takes time! And this particular tree is designed 
		to last forever, bearing fruit that is sweet above all that is sweet, . 
		. . and pure above all that is pure. Surely such a treewhether just 
		sprouting or more deeply rooteddeserves our faith and diligence and 
		patience (Alma 32:37, 40-43).</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">If youre 
		still in a hurry to be done, remember President Bensons description of 
		the process: Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often 
		involves growth and change that is slow, <b>almost imperceptible</b>.
		<b>Almost</b> is an important word there. If we are in a hurry, the 
		growth will be imperceptible, but if we slow down, God will help us 
		perceive true progress. As the song says, take time to be holy; let <b>
		Him</b> be thy guidein times of prayer, study, meditation, and other 
		periods of reflection, such as the sacrament and temple service. The 
		Lord is pleased with every effort, said President Benson, even the 
		tiny, daily ones in which we strive to become more like Him, and if we 
		let Him, He can tell us so (Ensign, October 1989, 4)</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In these 
		quiet moments, we may remember the invitation we heard when Gods 
		servants confirmed us members of the Churchreceive the Holy Ghost. 
		And as President Eyring has taught, we choose to accept that invitation 
		not [just] once, but every day, every hour, every minute (Ensign, May 
		2002, 28). In doing so, we let the Lord renew our hope and teach us what 
		we lack as yet to become godlyto grow into the stature of the fulness 
		of Christ (Ephesians 4:13; see Moroni 8:26). And He does this 
		patiently, line upon line, and precept upon preceptfor He is not in a 
		hurry, and He knows that we are like little children who cannot bear 
		all things now, so He has promised, I will lead you along (D&amp;C 
		78:17-18).</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">So 
		remember, dont be in a hurry to be done.</span></font></p>
<p class="NoSpacing"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Perhaps 
		all Ive said was summarized in eight words by the Psalmist long ago, 
		Be still, and know that I am God. Notice that the Lord reaffirmed that 
		counsel in our day, during a time of great commotion for the Prophet 
		Joseph and early members of the Church (Psalms 46:10; D&amp;C 101:16). Be 
		still, and know that I am God. I suppose that can be read as two 
		separate commands, but I think it works especially well as a statement 
		of cause and effect. If we will be still, put God first, call on Him 
		first, and wait on Him always, then we will come to discern His still 
		small voice, reminding us how well He knows us and how much He loves 
		us, and He will teach us how to love and serve our neighbors as our 
		selves (see 1 Kings 19:12; 1 Nephi 17:45). As we do so, the promise is 
		sure, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come 
		(D&amp;C 59:23). So, brothers and sisters, please dont be in a hurry.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Thank you President Clark for 
		your introduction.&nbsp; The last time Raquel and I were on this campus was 
		over 20 years ago as we were dropping off our eldest son as a freshman.&nbsp; 
		Much has changed and its obvious you are in a phase of rapid expansion. 
		Many thousands more will be blessed to learn and build foundations for 
		their lifes work here in this beautiful corner of the world.&nbsp; Its most 
		fitting that latter-day prophets have chosen to build a temple in your 
		midst as a beacon on the hill to look upon often for inspiration and a 
		constant reminder of true doctrine learned, and sacred covenants made in 
		the house of the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You are indeed a chosen 
		generation; blessed to be tutored by the best, watched over by apostles 
		and prophets, and prepared to go forth in this wide world to serve in 
		His kingdom.&nbsp; No wonder someone in the know, President Gordon B. 
		Hinckley has said on several occasions that this place and institution 
		is the best kept secret in the Church.&nbsp; I am afraid the secret is now 
		out.&nbsp; May this Institution bless and prepare many more for generations 
		to come. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I have prayed and pondered 
		of what the Lord would have me say to you this afternoon, I have gone 
		back in my minds eye 40 years ago when <u>our </u>circumstances and 
		surroundings were similar to yours now.&nbsp; Those were the most crucial 
		formative years of our lives, just as they are for each one of you here 
		today.&nbsp; Decisions made during this period of your life must be made 
		based on true doctrine, correct principles, and sound practices as 
		taught by the Lord and all His prophets past and present.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Before we get into some of 
		these basic truths as taught in the scriptures and by living prophets of 
		our day, let me go back again in time some thirty years ago when we were 
		living in Mexico City with our young family.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was an executive with a 
		large international bank, and involved in the construction of our new 
		corporate headquarters.&nbsp; It would be 23 stories tall and would cover a 
		small block on the beautiful Paseo de la Reforma Avenue.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Mexico City is one of the 
		great cities of the world, but part of it sits atop a former lakebed.&nbsp; 
		In such areas the ground is unstable, so we actually spent more money 
		below the ground than we did on the part of the building that would be 
		visible.&nbsp; The pilings and footings as part of the foundation were like 
		giant pillars and went all the way down to solid bedrock.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 1985, three years after 
		the building was completed, a powerful earthquake hit Mexico City.&nbsp; 
		Thousands were killed, and many buildings were completely destroyed, 
		including office buildings, hospitals, hotels and government buildings.&nbsp; 
		The quake registered 8.1 on the Richter scale, and the default line ran 
		right down Reforma Avenue.&nbsp; Despite the enormous destruction around us, 
		the building was preserved.&nbsp; Many of the destroyed buildings had been 
		built about the same time as ours.&nbsp; The difference was pillars that 
		anchored our foundation and building<b> </b>to bedrock. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You may never build a 
		corporate headquarters.&nbsp; But you are a builder.&nbsp; We all are.&nbsp; You are 
		laying the foundation for your life, and your eternity.&nbsp; Even the most 
		modern building has a limited lifetime.&nbsp; Eventually it will crumble.&nbsp; 
		But you and I are building both for time (this life) and for eternity.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What are the giant pillars, 
		or eternal truths that we must know<b> </b>and live by to anchor our 
		souls for time and eternity?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i><u>First, the most 
		basic and eternal truth is the reality of our Heavenly Father</u></i></b>, 
		that He lives, that you are His precious son or daughter.&nbsp; He knows you 
		by name, He loves you and wants you to return to Him with your eternal 
		family.&nbsp; You lived with Him before; you cannot remember what it was like 
		with Him as He has placed a veil over your memory.&nbsp; He is God, the great 
		ruler of the universe; He is over all and everything, yet He is your 
		Father and mine.&nbsp; You can go to Him in prayer with a firm assurance that 
		He hears you, and will answer you in <i>His own time, in His way, and 
		according to His own will</i>, (<i>D&amp;C 88:68) </i>.&nbsp; Our Fathers whole 
		purpose is to bring us back as joint heirs with His beloved son Jesus 
		Christ. To the Nephites Jesus said,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Therefore ye must pray 
		to the Father in my name; And whatsoever shall ask the Father in my 
		name, which is right, believing ye shall receive, behold it shall be 
		given unto you. (<b>3 Nephi 18:19,20)</b></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What a privilege we have to 
		pray to our Father at any time night or day.&nbsp; A loving parent welcomes 
		communication with a child, so it is with our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; We have 
		so much to thank Him for, to report on, to go over with, to plead for, 
		and to recognize His hand in our lives and those of our loved ones.&nbsp; As 
		we reverently and in a spirit of worship approach him in prayer ; the 
		Holy Ghost will give us, many times, the words to say.&nbsp; Communion with 
		the Father will transform you, mold you, cleanse you, and change your 
		heart.&nbsp; Through the power of prayer, you will know His will and make the 
		right decisions concerning your eternal welfare<b> </b>and bless the 
		lives of others as well.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i><u>The second great 
		pillar to anchor our souls on is the reality of Jesus Christ</u></i></b>, 
		that He is the author of our salvation.&nbsp; He has purchased us through his 
		atoning sacrifice; He is the way, the&nbsp;truth and the life.&nbsp; He is our 
		advocate with the Father.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Listen to Him who is the 
		advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him- Saying: 
		Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom 
		thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the 
		blood of him who gavest that thyself might be glorified;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Wherefore, Father spare 
		these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me 
		and have everlasting life.</i> (<b><i> D&amp;C 45:3-5)</i></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He is your lifeline back to 
		the Father.&nbsp; His Gospel, his ordinances and the pattern he has given us 
		for our lives, will get us back.&nbsp; Helaman quoting King Benjamin to his 
		sons Lehi and Nephi said: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>. Remember that there is 
		no other way, nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the 
		atoning blood of Jesus Christ </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Helaman then quotes Amulek, 
		in verse 11 <i>And he hath power given unto him from the Father to 
		redeem them from their sins...</i> (<b><i> Helaman 5:9)</i></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Then in his own words, 
		Helaman uses the analogy of building their foundation for eternal life 
		on the rock of the redeemer:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And now, my sons, 
		remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is 
		Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when 
		the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the 
		whirlwind, yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon 
		you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of 
		misery and endless wo, because of the rock on which you are built, which 
		is a sure foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. ( Hel 5:12)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><i><u>The third great 
		pillar of eternal truth is the reality that the Holy Ghost, the third 
		member of the Godhead can be our companion, our tutor and teacher of the 
		truth of all things</u></i></b>.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">He is our guide and 
		inspiration from the Father, our comforter, our witness of the reality 
		of the Father and the Son and their Plan of Happiness for each of us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Yea, behold, I will tell 
		you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come 
		upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Now, behold this is the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;(<b>&nbsp; D&amp;C 11:12 )</b></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Holy Ghost will never 
		inspire us to do something contrary to the will of the Father concerning 
		us, or to break one of His commandments.&nbsp; The adversary however, will 
		seek to mislead us and will try to use the same channels of 
		communication; our emotions and feelings, as well as wrong thoughts that 
		come into our mind. <b>&nbsp;</b>These verses&nbsp; help us distinguish between 
		inspiration from the Holy Ghost and promptings from the adversary.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Verily, verily, I say

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Section 46 of Doctrine and 
		Covenants, and the sections previously quoted, were given to the early 
		saints to help them understand how the Holy Ghost works with us.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp; But ye are commanded in

		of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that 
		ye may not be seduced by evil spirits or doctrines of the devils, or the 
		commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils. To some 
		is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited 
		thereby.&nbsp; To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus 
		Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the 
		world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D&amp;C 46:7, 12,13)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we learn to listen to the 
		spirit, He will teach us how to pray, how to approach the Father, as 
		well as what words to use.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost will inspire us to express 
		our love and gratitude to the Father, and to recognize his hand in our 
		life.&nbsp; In verse thirty-three we have the key to having the Holy Ghost 
		with us, </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And ye must practice 
		virtue and holiness before me continually (D&amp;C 46:33)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our great struggle as members 
		of the Church is to have the Holy Ghosts companionship, and that is not

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Mormons writings to his son

		the process required, as we live the principles of the Gospel, to have 
		the spirit with us on a more continuous basis.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And the first fruits of 
		repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling

</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As members&nbsp;we dont get 
		baptized again each time we feel repentant and show our faith in Christ, 
		in His atonement, by striving again to keep all His commandments.&nbsp; But, 
		we do practically the same each Sunday as we partake of the sacrament 
		and promise and covenant again to keep His commandments.&nbsp; Thoughts of 
		the Savior and His atonement during the sacrament will give us a 
		repentant heart; and the actual taking of the sacrament worthily, like

</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>( </i>maybe for long time

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We become meek and lowly of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These basic principles 
		regarding marriage and children were widely accepted by most of the

		advanced economies dont marry, postpone marriage, or if married, 
		severely curtail the number of their children.&nbsp; Birth rates have fallen 
		dramatically in Western Europe, Russia, and practically all of Asia.&nbsp; 
		Most of these nations have both a looming cultural and economic crisis, as their 
		work force ages. Worker replacement in the case of Europe especially, 
		are immigrants from predominately Muslim societies. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As members of His church and 
		kingdom in the latter-days, our concern<b> </b>is not so much an ever 
		increasing wicked world we must live in, but that we begin to accept for 
		ourselves these standards of society and ignore the counsel given by 
		living prophets concerning families. Regarding postponing marriage the 
		brethren have stated the following:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Temple marriage,&nbsp;the 
		sealing of husband and wife for time and eternity by the authority of 
		the priesthood is a sacred privilege and obligation that every able 
		member of the Church should have as a goal.&nbsp; The Church strongly 
		counsels members, especially men, not to put off or avoid marriage. 
		(Church Handbook of Instructions)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Young men, especially you 
		single return missionaries, now is the season to find and marry your 
		eternal companion. Here and now! You should take the initiative.&nbsp; Get to 
		know, the young women you are attracted to.&nbsp; Dont wait until you finish 
		school to marry.&nbsp; Take that leap of faith now.&nbsp; Probably 95% of my 
		friends in college found their eternal companion while in school.&nbsp; She 
		is here, find her! The reason you are here is more than just preparing 
		for your profession; now is the season; marriage should not be delayed 
		for education.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now some words for those of 
		you who are already married:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we were a young married 
		couple struggling to get through BYU.&nbsp; I think it was Elder Joseph 
		Fielding Smith, then President of the Quorum of the Twelve, who came and 
		talked to us students in a devotional like this, about not postponing 
		our children until we finished school, or limiting the number that would 
		come to us.&nbsp; I went back to our little apartment understanding clearly 
		what the Lord wanted of us at that stage of our lives.&nbsp; Let me use the 
		words of other prophets to help you understand the Lords will regarding 
		these very sacred, personal and intimate decisions the two of you will 
		make in this regard. President Hinckley speaking to university students 
		over 10 years ago said the following:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> You people who are 
		starting out life together, you people who are working so hard to try to 
		keep up with everything, you people who have too much to do and too 
		little money, you people who are struggling to get an educationbe 
		faithful in the church, <u>begin your families</u> and go forward with 
		your lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Church News, Nov 9, 1996)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Previously, President Ezra 
		Taft Benson, a Idaho born prophet and President of the Church at the 
		time, stated in a Church wide broadcast to parents the following:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Do not use the reasoning 
		of the world such as, Well wait until we can better afford having 
		children, until we are more secure, until John has completed his 
		education, until he has a better paying job, until we have a larger 
		home, until we have obtained a few of the material conveniences, and on 
		and on.&nbsp; This is the reasoning of the world, and it is not pleasing in 
		the sight of God.&nbsp; Mothers, who enjoy good health, have your children 
		and have them early.&nbsp; And husbands always be considerate of your wives 
		in the bearing of children.&nbsp; DO NOT 
		CURTAIL THE NUMBER of your children for personal or selfish reasons.&nbsp; 
		Material possessions, social convenience, and so-called professional 
		advantages are nothing compared to a righteous posterity.&nbsp; In the 
		eternal perspective childrennot possessions, not position, not 
		prestigeare our greatest jewels. </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>( Address given at a 
		Fireside for Parents by President Ezra Taft Benson, 22 February 1987.)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How many children? I don't 
		know but over the next 15 to 20 years you will probably be faced with 
		this decision, again and again. No one will tell you how many.&nbsp; When the 
		time is right for another child, and in counsel with your spouse, go to 
		your Father in Heaven in reverence and ask to know His will; if there is 
		another to be sent to your eternal family.&nbsp; At least one of you will 
		receive His answer. The last of our three children came to us that way, 
		one at a time over a period of eight years.&nbsp; After our last was born we 
		received the confirmation that all were here, our family was complete. 
		Many noble and great spirits have been held back to come now to 
		Latter-Day Saint homes, to be prepared and nurtured by women in the 
		know as the Lord prepares His kingdom for His second coming.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now lets turn to Matthew 22: 
		36-40, to help you visualize what I consider the last of the 
		foundational pillars for your life.&nbsp; When asked,&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Master, which is the 
		great commandment in the law? Jesus answered, Thou shalt love the Lord 
		thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
		mind. This is the first great commandment.&nbsp; And the second is like unto 
		it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments 
		hang all the law and prophets. </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In this summary statement he 
		teaches this all-encompassing foundational truth, <u>OUR FIFTH PILLAR, 
		to inherit eternal life you must have love in your souls;&nbsp; love for God 
		your Eternal Father, love for your eternal family, and love for your 
		fellowmen.</u>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On another occasion when 
		Jesus told the lawyer that in order to inherit eternal life he must love 
		his neighbor as himself, the lawyer asked: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And who is my 
		neighbor?&nbsp; Jesus responded with His parable of the Good Samaritan and 
		then asked:  Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto 
		him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on 
		him.</i> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>( Luke 10:29, 36,37)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With this parable, Jesus 
		taught that each of us should exhibit an active love and benevolence 
		towards every one of His Fathers children.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The operative word for love 
		is service.&nbsp; King Benjamin taught this principle in simple terms:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And behold I tell you 
		these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye 
		are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of 
		your God. ( Mosiah 2:17)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">King Benjamin in chapter 4: 
		12 goes on to say:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080"><i>&quot;For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to 
		day,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I would that ye should impart of your substance to the 
		poor,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;such as feeding the hungry,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;visiting the sick and 
		administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">Do you administer spiritual or temporal relief to those who need it? Do 
		you reach out and strengthen the faith of those around you?&nbsp; To love 
		others means consecrating your life in caring for and serving others who 
		need your help and sharing your gifts and blessings. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">Every unselfish act of kindness and service increases your spirituality. 
		God would use you to bless others. Your continued spiritual growth and 
		eternal progress are very much wrapped up in your relationshipsin how 
		you treat others. Do you indeed love others and become a blessing in 
		their lives? The person who does only those things that concern himself 
		alone, will never reach the goal of perfection. <i><u>Service to others 
		is what the gospel and exalted life are all about.</u></i> In your 
		journey through life, you are to reach out and bless the lives of your 
		fellow travelers, to give of yourself to those who need you. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">James, a church leader in the 
		primitive church at Jerusalem, teaches in his epistle principles that 
		should guide our relationships with other members of the church.&nbsp; He 
		considers the commandment to &quot;love thy neighbour as thyself&quot; to be the 
		&quot;royal law.&quot; To </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;James, a testimony alone is 
		not enough. The gospel has to become a living reality in our lives.
		<i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And I will shew thee my 
		faith by my works</i>.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;<i>But be ye doers of the word, and not 
		hearers only.&quot;&nbsp; </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">James's definition of the 
		converted is: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&quot;Pure religion and 
		undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and 
		widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the 
		world.&quot; </i>He ends his brief epistle with these words: <i>&quot;Brethren, if 
		any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; Let him know, 
		that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save 
		a soul&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and shall hide a multitude of sins. ( James verses from 
		chapters 1,2,&amp;5)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By reclaiming an errant 
		brother, you save both him and yourself. Your sins are hidden or 
		remitted because you ministered for the salvation of another.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One final word on 
		interpersonal relationships; regardless of your chosen profession, most 
		of those you work and come in contact with, will probably be 
		non-members.&nbsp; Be a person of absolute integrity, in your relationships 
		with others.&nbsp; Just as serving other members in the kingdom, have a 
		spirit of love and service for all those around you.&nbsp;&nbsp; President 
		Hinckley (our prophet and builder of buildings that will last 
		into eternity like the building on the south side of campus here) has 
		said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> How rare a gem, how 
		precious a jewel is the man or woman in whom there is neither guile, nor 
		deception, nor falsehood, nor greed, nor preoccupation with getting 
		ahead.&nbsp; ( Be Thou an Example by Gordon B. Hinckley. P.46)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In your lifes work you will 
		be guided by the spirit and blessed in your responsibilities and others 
		around you, will be blessed and prosper because of your righteousness.<i>
</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> And this is life 
		eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ, 
		whom thou has sent.</i> (<b><i>John 17:3)</i></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This was the theme at mutual 
		when I was a young man.&nbsp; We would stand up and repeat it every Tuesday 
		after the opening song and prayer. I have learned since then, that to 
		know them is much more than understanding their true nature, more than 
		facts about Jesus life two thousand years ago, and even more than 
		knowing their doctrine.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Earlier this year we visited 
		the Holy Land and walked where he walked and saw the places he lived 
		Bethlehem, Nazareth, Capernaum, the Sea of Galilee, the river Jordan, 
		and Jerusalem.&nbsp; Places where many saw Him and witnessed His miracles.&nbsp; 
		Most that saw Him then, never really knew Him.&nbsp; To know them, the Father 
		and the Son, is a continuing and ever changing process in us.&nbsp; 
		Eventually becoming more like they are.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Jesus wants us to become more 
		like Him, to teach us, to tutor us, and mold us as we receive direction 
		from Him and the Father through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; We must be obedient to 
		the promptings if we are to change.&nbsp; Much of what we will receive will 
		be in regard to what we should do to bless and serve others.&nbsp; In reality 
		the all-encompassing&nbsp; way to  know Him is to love and serve others as 
		he loved and served. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, a word to the wise.&nbsp; 
		Human nature is such that we tend to put off for tomorrow, what we 
		should do today.&nbsp; Amulek in Alma 34:33 says:<i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>. I beseech of you that 
		you do not procrastinate.for after this day of life, which is given us 
		to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in 
		this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no 
		labor performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Alma 34:33)</i>&nbsp; 
			</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Even the Lord, I feel, had a 
		sense of urgency for each day and set the example,&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>I must work the works of 
		Him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can 
		work. ( John 9:4) </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now is the time not tomorrow. 
		Your college years are not a rehearsal for the years ahead, but the most 
		crucial, and pivotal years of your life. Youre building youre 
		foundation for your life<b></b>now, this is part of eternity.&nbsp; Now is 
		the time to make your decisions, to act, to build and strengthen your 
		foundation and pillars.&nbsp; Now, get serious about finding your eternal 
		companion.&nbsp; Get married.&nbsp; If you are already married, start your 
		family.&nbsp; Graduate, get out into the world.&nbsp; Time is short; dont let 
		your life just slip by. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; text-indent: .5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young while referring 
		to section 88 of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, said to the youth of his day,&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Will you spend the time

		celestial law, and keep the commandments of God.</i>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I understand that the new 
		theme used in YW/YM is the last recorded words of King Benjamin to his 
		people. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i> Therefore I would that

		eternal life, through the wisdom and power, and justice, and mercy of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My young brothers and sisters

		While prayerfully contemplated what I should say to a group of 
		relatively young people, along with some others who are relatively 
		speaking, a little more mature, I considered a host of topics that I 
		felt might be appropriate and that would be in line with what the Lord 
		might have me say. For me, some topics are easier to approach and 
		prepare for than others. Fortunately, I realize and fully believe that 
		the responsibility I have to serve something to you that will be 
		spiritually nourishing, is probably equal to your responsibility to come 
		to the table spiritually hungry. I have done my part to prepare properly 
		and to have the spirit. If you have come similarly prepared, we will 
		both be edified and will rejoice together. Hopefully, it wont be simply 
		rejoicing that we got through an uncomfortable ordeal, alive! I would 
		also remind you that the things which come to your mind by the power of 
		the Holy Ghost are most significant for you. I have had some of those 
		feelings as I have been preparing this address. It has been good for me 
		to be taught. Im grateful that we share in this learning and teaching 
		responsibility. That should sound vaguely, and really, not so vaguely 
		familiar. Does it sound like the learning model to you, or am I just 
		imagining this? </span></font></p>

		In considering on what I should speak, I was drawn to two verses in the 
		Book of Mormon that have always given me direction when it comes to 
		preparing a talk: Alma 7:7  where Alma speaks to a faithful group of 
		saints who lived in a city called Gideon. These saints must have been 
		similar in spiritual make up to those of you gathered here today. These 
		were, generally speaking, members of the Church of Christ who were 
		making an effort to keep the commandments of God. Alma clearly 
		illustrated the difference between these striving saints in Gideon and 
		some of those members of the Church in Zarahemla who were struggling and 
		to whom his counsel was much more of a warning and a call to repentance. 
		He counseled the members in Gideon to continue to repent as needed and 
		always strive to do better. <u>Because of the spiritual preparation of 
		the people</u>, Alma was able to teach them some very plain and powerful 
		doctrines. &nbsp;He said: <b>For behold, I say unto you there be many things 
		to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than 
		they all  for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer 
		liveth and cometh among his people (Alma 7:7). T</b>his message from 
		Alma was given around 80 B.C., therefore, he spoke of the birth and 
		ministry of Christ, who would come in the near future. Of all the topics 
		upon which Alma could have spoken which may have been most beneficial, 
		he felt that prophesying and testifying of the Redeemer was the most 
		important principle to teach these good people. </span></font></p>

		Jacob asked a most significant question and gave prophetic commentary in 
		Jacob 4:12-13. This question is one we should all contemplate regularly. 
		It is the same scriptural question which was quoted frequently by a 
		beloved Apostle of the Lord, now in the Spirit World, Elder Neal A. 
		Maxwell. It is interesting to me to consider some of the topics upon 
		which Elder Maxwell spent so much time. Many of his Conference talks 
		were on the topic of Discipleship and Submitting to the Will of the 
		Lord. At his funeral, he was described by President Boyd K. Packer as 
		the most Christ-like person I have ever known. Elder Maxwell was a 
		great example of someone who possessed and tried to continually improve 
		upon his love for and devotion to the Savior and His gospel. It is no 
		wonder that he often quoted these thoughts of Jacob: <b>And now, 
		beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not speak of 
		the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of a

		through the words of ancient and modern prophets, through the ordinances 
		and covenants of the gospel, and clearly, through the whisperings of the

		I have been curious as to why some of our acquaintances and even friends

		On one occasion I asked a man, a minister in another faith, why he felt

		said that we were not Christians because we did not teach the concept of

		feel that we dont believe in, what they consider to be the true 
		Christ. As many of you know, President Gordon B. Hinckley, in the 
		October 2007 General Conference (Ensign, November 2007, p. 84) made 
		clear the unique teachings of this Church regarding the nature of the 
		Godhead. Though we may differ from other faiths about what the Father 
		and the Son are like, there can be no question at all as to how we feel 
		about the absolute necessity of a Savior and Redeemer. 2 Nephi 25: 23-29 
		expresses the sentiments of each faithful member of this Church in 
		relation to our dependence on, our love for and our sacred faith in, 
		Jesus Christ. As expressed by Nephi, this is what I know is taught in 
		the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the importance of 
		Jesus Christ:</span></font></p>

		scriptures, identifying the son who was to take the leadership and 
		protective role of the family, as well as become the patriarch at the 
		death of his father. This is the son who was given a double portion of 
		the inheritance, not because he was so much more intelligent and wise

		The Savior spoke to the Nephites disciples sometime after His 
		resurrection and appearance to them in the western hemisphere. He 
		answered some questions and then gave them this charge: Therefore, what 
		manner of men ought ye to be: Verily I say unto you, even as I am (3 
		Nephi 27:27). He commanded us to be perfect even as I, said Jesus, or 
		your Father who is in heaven, is perfect (3 Nephi 12:48). We are taught 
		that this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true 
		God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3). The Lord spoke 
		to Joseph Smith and gave a slightly different version of this New 
		Testament verse: This is eternal lives  to know the only wise and true 
		God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he (D&amp;C 132:24). There 
		should be no question that He who speaks to us in celestial terms 
		requires us, the children of God, to become what it was intended for us 
		to become. John, the Revelator, the beloved, tells us Beloved, now are 
		we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we 
		know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see 
		him as he is (1 John 3:2). To know the Father and to be like Christ 
		are phrases that describe what we must become to enjoy that association. 
		It is much more than an acquaintanceship or knowing about the Father and 
		the Son who they are; it is voluntarily desiring and obeying and 
		learning to be as they are. It is to be comfortable in their presence. 
		It is to be clean before them and to be holy through the atonement of

<font color="#000080">Elder Robert J. Whetten, in last weeks devotional

		we set our hearts upon riches and the corruptible things of this earth

		Another category of scriptural references teaches that many of the 
		prophets sorrowed in their hearts, almost universally because of the 
		wickedness of the very people they were trying to turn to the Lord. In 
		nearly all of the references I reviewed, a sorrowing heart was the 
		result of sadness that comes when loved ones stray and especially when 
		they wont repent. &nbsp;There are also times when our hearts may sorrow 
		because our lives are not in harmony with what we know is right. Even 
		the great prophet Nephi sorrowed because of his sins. He said: My heart 
		sorroweth because of my flesh and my heart groaneth because of my 
		sins (2 Nephi&nbsp; 4:19). I am certain that the more our lives conform to 
		celestial law, the more we recognize imperfections in our lives and 
		desire to rid ourselves of something that slows our eternal progression. 
		My own view is that Nephi felt sinful because he was angry with his 
		brothers who were trying to kill him. Now, most of us wouldnt really 
		feel guilty for having anger toward those who were trying to harm us, 
		but then, most of us are probably not living quite as close to the 
		celestial law as Nephi. The righteous see more clearly what they are as 
		opposed to what they know they should be. I suppose our Father and His 
		Son may sorrow for us at times. We can change that. Maybe some of us can 
		also comprehend, to some degree what a sorrowing heart is like. </span>

		We read many instances of those who have a broken heart and a contrite 
		spirit. This is the kind of heart we must have to approach our Heavenly 
		Father. It is the kind of heart that feels the truth and yearns for the 
		Spirit. A broken heart is the opposite of a hard heart. It may have been 
		hard at one time, but through repentance and a humble desire to improve 
		ones life and be better, the hardness has been broken up, allowing for 
		the heavenly, life giving dew of the Spirit to seep into the broken 
		cracks and mend the heart that was so impenetrable and impervious to the 
		quiet enticings of the Lord. A broken heart is a celestial kind of 
		heart.</span></font></p>

		Another phrase speaks of the condition of being lowly in heart. This 
		suggests meekness and a desire to learn with no pretension of 
		superiority, and with an innocence and openness to do anything the Lord 
		commands. It is a special blessing to be lowly in heart. Christ gives us 
		encouragement to develop this kind of heart when He said; learn of me, 
		for I am meek and lowly in heart (Matthew 11:29). If Christ has a lowly 
		heart, we should all strive to have one as well.</span></font></p>

		The scriptures teach us about pure hearts. You will remember that Elder 
		David A. Bednar taught us about clean hands and pure hearts in his last 
		conference address. He said it was possible to have clean hands, but not 
		a pure heart. We can be relatively free from sin and yet not be holy. 
		Holiness and purity of heart must come from the atoning blood of Christ. 
		It is through Him and because of Him that we can be made holy. Of 
		course, the same is true about having clean hands. Repentance is a gift 
		from the Lord. We can receive it and act upon it and He will wash us and 
		cleanse us. Or, we can choose to continue on in a life that is not what 
		it should be and pay the price of our sins by ourselves. Doctrine and 
		Covenants 19:15-19 &nbsp;gives strong encouragement to take advantage of the 
		cleansing and sanctifying power of the atonement.</span></font></p>

		There are many references showing a close relationship between the act 
		of prayer and the kind of heart that should accompany it. We read of 
		praying with all our heart; with real intent of heart; with all the 
		energy of heart; with sincerity of heart, and that we should come unto 
		Christ with full purpose of heart. &nbsp;It is in this demonstration of our 
		devotion and trust in God that we can truly think and feel as He does. 
		We can and should pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, but 
		the words we use will not always be our own. There are times when our 
		hearts are so in tune with the Lord that we will ask that which He would 
		have us ask, because we are praying in the Holy Ghost (Jude 1:20) as 
		taught by Jude. The Nephite Disciples were praying while the Savior 
		prayed nearby as recorded in 3 Nephi 19. They had prayed for some time 
		and did not multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they 
		should pray, and they were filled with desire (vs. 24). The Doctrine 
		and Covenants illustrates this type of perfect prayer as Elder 
		McConkie calls it. <b>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, 
		ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be 
		done. But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask . . . 
		(50:29-30)</b>. When we are praying in the Holy Ghost, our thoughts 
		are divinely inspired. We are truly one with the Father, being 
		directed by the Spirit as to what we should say in our prayers. I dont 
		think this type of prayer is common. We too often have a checklist type 
		of prayer, not really thinking about what we have said until our next 
		prayer. We hope we are all praying a minimum of twice a day. Lest we 
		feel guilty (although a little guilt isnt too bad if it propels us to 
		action and helps us to improve), I am certain that all prayers offered 
		by the Son of God were completely in tune with the Holy Will of His 
		Father, but we learn from Luke (22:44) that even the Savior, when under 
		the heaviest of all burdens that night in Gethsemane, being in an agony 
		he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great drops of 
		blood falling down to the ground. We can be more earnest and sincere in 
		our prayers and at times we will pray will all the energy of heart. I 
		know I can do better.&nbsp; And in doing so, we will truly become one in 
		thought and mind with God. </span></font></p>

		One last thought about our prayers. Adam (and each of us) was commanded 
		to do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent 
		and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore. We pray to our 
		Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. Sometimes we might say, 
		The Lord has certainly blessed me and we wonder, which member of the 
		Godhead is responsible for that blessing. They all are. They are one. 
		They work in harmony. There is no division or jealousy among them. Each 
		member of the Godhead carries the title of God: God the Father, God the 
		Son and God the Holy Ghost. This is not unlike the members of the First 
		Presidency. Though President Hinckley is the President of the Church, 
		President Monson is a president and so is President Eyring. It doesnt 
		matter by what means we were blessed, or from which member of the 
		Godhead that blessing came, but it does matter that we acknowledge that 
		blessing and give heartfelt thanks.</span></font></p>

		I concluded that there is a scriptural category rejoicing heart; of 
		hearts that are brim with joy; hearts that are swollen with 
		thanksgiving; hearts that take courage with the hope that comes of 
		faith; hearts that rejoice and hearts that glory in the Lord. These are 
		the heartfelt feelings expressed by many scriptural heroes, including 
		Captain Moroni in Alma 48. <b>Yea, [he was] a man whose heart did swell 
		with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings 
		which he bestowed upon his people (Alma 48:12).</b> This is the kind of

		The scriptures teach about the effect the Lord can have on our hearts. 
		Our wonderful example and friend Nephi said that the Lord did soften my 
		heart and that he also softened the heart of Ishmael. Alma the Younger 
		spoke about the mighty change wrought in the heart of his father, Alma 
		the Elder. Alma the Younger also asks us a most important question: if 
		ye have experienced a change of heart, can ye feel so now? Enoch taught 
		And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and 
		one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there was no poor among them.&nbsp; 
		Alma expressed the desires of his heart when he said, I wish from the 
		inmost part of my heart, with great anxiety even unto pain that ye would 
		hearken to my words and cast off your sins and not procrastinate 
		repentance.&nbsp; He also said, Oh that I were an angel and could have the 
		wish of my heart to go forth and cry repentance unto every people. If 
		only our hearts were as pure and desirous of doing good and expressing 
		gratitude to &nbsp;the Lord as was Almas. I think some of you do have hearts 
		like that and the rest of us are working on it. But keep in mind that 
		through our willingness, the Lord has great power to change our hearts 
		to become like His.</span></font></p>

		But the Lord has said something else about our hearts; something that he 
		wants from us and something that we may too often hesitate to give 
		completely. It was expressed to the Savior by a certain lawyer who asked 
		the Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? In response to a 
		question posed by Christ, the lawyer said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
		God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
		strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself, to which 
		the Savior responded, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt 
		live (Luke 10:25-28). So, we are to love God with all our hearts. That 
		should not be a surprise to anyone. But notice this mandate from the 
		Lord: Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind(D&amp;C 
		64:34). He wants our heart  all of it  willingly, gladly, without any 
		hesitation or ulterior motive. Alma taught his son Shiblom (and all of 
		us): let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.

		So, how do we get to the point when what we want is exactly what the 
		Lord wants us to want? And when do we get to the point when we seek only 
		to do the will of the Lord  that which pleases Him, that which blesses, 
		not only ourselves, but others? We seek after and follow the Spirit. We 
		clear our lives of that which is unseemly, impure or improper. We pray 
		for and hearken to those promptings which come. How do we know that 
		these impressions are from the Lord and not just our own thinking? 
		Mormon taught: <b>all things which are good cometh of God; and that 
		which is evil cometh of the devil. . . behold, that which is of God 
		inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, everything 
		which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve 
		him, is inspired of God (Moroni 7:12-13)</b>. We can also recognize 
		that a feeling of peace will accompany promptings from the Lord. The 
		Lord said to Oliver Cowdery: Did I not speak peace to your mind 
		concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God 
		(D&amp;C 6:23).</span></font></p>

		Not only can our prayers be precisely what they ought to be, but as we 
		continually strive to overcome the challenges and sins, which do so 
		easily beset [us} (2 Nephi 4:18), and consistently exercise, even a 
		particle of faith by setting our hearts upon God, we begin and continue 
		on in our journey of becoming like Christ. But, remember the priority 
		for the affections of our hearts. President Ezra Taft Benson taught that 
		we should put God first over everything and everyone else in our lives 
		(Conference Report, April 1988, p.3). This does not mean that our 
		parents and family members are way down the list of importance; our 
		families should have a deep and special place in our hearts. But we must 
		not let them take precedence over our love and devotion to God. If we 
		do, we will lose them. </span></font></p>

		I recognize and fully believe that there is a different spirit about us 
		at this time of year. Yes, it can be stressful as we approach the end of 
		a very swift and concentrated semester of study. But at Christmas time, 
		as President Hinckley expressed in the First Presidency Devotional 
		Sunday evening, there is something a little different about us at this 
		time of year. We feel more disposed to lift and help others. We have 
		desires for the happiness of others, often more than for ourselves. 
		Still, &nbsp;I would hope and pray that the feelings we have in our hearts 
		for the Savior of mankind - that Babe born in Bethlehem who grew into 
		the greatest of all men, would be strong all year long. Worthily and 
		sincerely partaking of the sacred sacrament each week helps us to 
		remember who we are and what the Lord invites us and even requires us to 
		become. Having a sacred and holy House of the Lord in our midst is a 
		symbol of our devotion to God. It is the feeling that he is with us, 
		among us, and that our hearts are and can be eternally entwined with 
		His.</span></font></p>

		I bear solemn witness that God the Father lives. He is literally our 
		father and we pray to and thank Him for our manifold blessings. Jesus 
		Christ is the Only Begotten Son of the Father. He is the Anointed One. 
		Through the atonement offered to us by the shedding of His most precious 
		and perfect blood, we will not only overcome death, but we can in 
		reality return to the presence of the Father, enjoying exaltation and 
		eternal life with our families. It is through Jesus Christ that we can 
		become what we must become. We have the privilege, but also sacred 
		responsibility of having the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, replete 
		with prophets, scripture, revelation, truth and power. Where much is 
		given, much is required, but what a blessing. I feel in my heart to 
		exclaim with Jacob who rejoiced saying: O how great the goodness of our 
		God. May we become even as [Christ} is, I pray in the holy name of the 
		Lord Jesus Christ, amen. </span></font></p>

		The call to be a disciple-leader is a call to minister and to serve. &nbsp;It

		kindness and love and unselfish devotion to the Lord and His work. &nbsp;It 
		is the kind of leadership that we need at every level of every kind of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Saviors life is full of

		especially powerful in leading a family. &nbsp;I know that all of you will 
		need these principles in your lives.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>
		Principle #1: Lead by 
		Example</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior established this 
		principle when He said, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say 
		unto you, even as I am.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">2</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		One of the most important things that leaders do is what they do. &nbsp;In 
		your family, your most powerful influence on your children will be the 
		example of your life. &nbsp;That example includes the actions that you take 
		and the principles and values that guide you.&nbsp; Your children will watch 
		you very, very closely.&nbsp; They will learn from you and follow your 
		example(eventually!).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is wonderful news! &nbsp;It 
		means that you can lead your children in the paths of righteousness.&nbsp; I 
		know you all want your children to be obedient and faithful, to love the 
		Lord, to have the Spirit in their lives, to receive their temple 
		blessings, to build an eternal family, and to bless you with 
		grandchildren! &nbsp;The best way to lead them in that path is to be in that 
		path yourselves. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You teach your children to 
		obey the commandments of God by keeping the commandments of God. &nbsp;It is 
		important to talk with them and tell them what you are doing and why. 
		&nbsp;But it is in the doing that there is real power to shape their lives. 
		&nbsp;If you want to teach them to love the temple and to see its power and 
		importance, put pictures of the temples on your walls, have lessons 
		about the temple in family home evening, and go to the temple often.&nbsp; In 
		this, and every other gospel principle, your life can be a living model 
		of what you want your children to be.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>
		Principle #2: Lead with 
		Vision</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior used this 
		principle all throughout His ministry on earth, and He uses it now. On 
		many, many occasions he prefaced a parable with the words, The kingdom 
		of heaven is like . . .</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		and then He would connect a principle from familiar day-to-day life with 
		salvation in His kingdom.&nbsp; He always held before His disciples, and 
		holds before us, the ultimate purpose of our work and our lives.&nbsp; He 
		gives us the vision of what we should do in our daily lives and what we 
		might accomplish eternally if we will follow Him. &nbsp;One of the most 
		important things that leaders do is to help the people they lead 
		understand the larger meaning and purpose of their daily work.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In your family this means 
		teaching your children how cleaning their rooms, doing their homework, 
		keeping the commandments, and learning to love each other is connected 
		to exaltation in the celestial kingdom as an eternal family.&nbsp; It means 
		filling your home with the Spirit. &nbsp;It means putting pictures of the 
		Savior on the wall along with pictures of your family and teaching your 
		children the connection between them and the Savior. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But it may also mean leading 
		your family through times of grief and pain caused by death or illness. 
		&nbsp;It may mean teaching them and showing them that staying the course, 
		moving forward despite the pain, is deeply connected to your familys 
		eternal destiny.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>
		Principle #3: Lead with 
		Love</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Saviors life, suffering, 
		and death are testimony of His perfect love for us. Everything He has 
		done for us, He has done because of His great love for His Father and 
		His perfect love for us. &nbsp;There is a powerful principle of leadership in 
		Johns words about the Saviors love: We love him, because he first 
		loved us.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">4</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		&nbsp;Effective small L leaders learn to energize the people around them 
		through love in action. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">To you mothers and 
		fathers and prospective mothers and fathers, the very most important 
		thing you can do for your children is to love each other and support 
		each other and help each other become everything Heavenly Father wants 
		you to be. &nbsp;You stand before God and your children as husband and wife, 
		father and mother, equal partners in the sacred responsibility of 
		creating an eternal family.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">As the leaders of your 
		family and faithful disciples of Christ, you will put love into action. 
		&nbsp;You will care for your children and nurture them. &nbsp;Every week in family 
		home evening you will teach them to love and serve one another and to 
		keep the commandments God. &nbsp;You will support them and encourage them and 
		love them enough to put structure and discipline in their lives. &nbsp;You 
		will pray with them and read the scriptures with them every day. &nbsp;You 
		will lead them with love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In conclusion, I would like 
		to leave you with a request and my testimony. &nbsp;Here is the request: When 
		you leave here today, please take the Spirit of Ricks with you.&nbsp; Please 
		take BYUIdaho and what it means and what it stands for with you.&nbsp; You 
		now represent the university.&nbsp; I hope and pray that wherever you go, 
		whatever you do, the people around you will see in you the principles 
		and the purposes of BYUIdaho and will feel the Spirit that is on this 
		campus.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, 
		I bear witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;He is our Savior and Redeemer. 
		&nbsp;He lives. &nbsp;He is the great Exemplar of leadership.&nbsp; He leads us today. 
		&nbsp;I bear witness that this is His work, His church, and His kingdom, 
		restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. &nbsp;Gordon B. 
		Hinckley stands today where Joseph stood.&nbsp; He is the prophet of the 
		Lord. &nbsp;You have a marvelous destiny and a great work to do in the 
		kingdom.&nbsp; I pray that no matter where you go, no matter what you do, you 
		will always be disciples of the Savior and lead by example with vision 
		and love.&nbsp; In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
<font size="2" color="#000080">December 14, 2007</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is an honor for me to 
		represent the Commissioner, Elder Kerr, and be invited to share a few 
		introductory remarks to you graduates at this commencement.&nbsp; He would 
		have liked to have been here, but had a conflicting assignment and asked 
		that I represent him here today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Graduation represents a 
		pivotal point in your lives.&nbsp; It offers an exciting perspective while 
		looking forward, as well as an opportunity for contemplating while 
		reflecting on the past.&nbsp; While you have been here at this great 
		institution, you have learned a number for very important things.&nbsp; At 
		some point  either prior to being admitted to the university; perhaps 
		while serving a mission; or for some, after you arrived at BYUIdaho  
		you have learned the importance of having good study habits.&nbsp; In order 
		to study effectively, you needed to find a place where you could create 
		an appropriate learning environment.&nbsp; Most of you probably figured out 
		that staying in your dorm room or apartment was not one of the most 
		effective or efficient places to study, largely due to the energetic 
		sociality that often surrounds that setting.&nbsp; You generally resorted to 
		the library, the lab, a practice room, or a focused study group to get 
		the most out of your study time. Establishing an appropriate study 
		environment is essential to learning, whether it be at home, at school, 
		at work, or in your personal spiritual devotions.&nbsp; Being able to find or 
		create such an environment may be challenging at times. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When it comes to formal 
		education, President Kimball once acknowledged that one of the most 
		effective learning environments ever established, both for accumulating 
		and disseminating knowledge, is a university.&nbsp; It is a place for 
		learning, a place for growth, a place for discovering your potential, a 
		place for becoming more than perhaps you ever dreamed possible (and some 
		might say, more than your mother-in-law ever expected).&nbsp; The environment 
		at BYUIdaho is unique among universities.&nbsp; It is conducive not only to 
		learning, but also to living the gospel, and being obedient.&nbsp; It is a 
		place where you have been nurtured and strengthened by the Spirit.&nbsp; 
		Wherever you go throughout the balance of your life, the knowledge you 
		have gained will serve you well and the memories of your experiences 
		here will hold a special place in your heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For many of you, this BYUIdaho 
		experience represents the pinnacle of your formal academic pursuits.&nbsp; 
		However, dont let it be the end of your learning experiences.&nbsp; Many of 
		the facts and details you have gained while here will either be 
		forgotten or outdated over time.&nbsp; However, knowing how to think and how 
		to learn allows you to keep current on important issues and ideas, or to 
		expand your knowledge by learning new things, or to think about things 
		in new ways.&nbsp; The more you learn of things both in heaven and in the 
		earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, 
		things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things 
		which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the 
		judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and 
		of kingdoms, as stated in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C 88:79), you 
		will continually marvel at the knowledge and majesty of God and His 
		creations, and in the process, you will be prepared to be of greater 
		service in His kingdom.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another learning environment 
		has been created for us by the Lord himself.&nbsp; It has been referred to at 
		times by some of the Brethren as the University of the Lord.&nbsp; I am 
		referring of course to the temple. Entering the House of the Lord is a 
		privilege for those who qualify and an exquisite environment for 
		spiritual learning for those who seek, ask, and knock.&nbsp; President Packer 
		stated, The temple is a great school. It is a house of learning.&nbsp; He 
		continues, In the temples the atmosphere is maintained so that it is 
		ideal for instruction on matters that are deeply spiritualIf you will 
		go to the temple and remember that the teaching is symbolic you will 
		never go <i>in the proper spirit</i> without coming away with your 
		vision extended, feeling a little more exalted, with your knowledge 
		increased as to things that are spiritual. The teaching plan is superb. 
		It is inspired.&nbsp; Likewise, he observed, the temple itself becomes a 
		symbol. [As] you have seen one of the temples at night, fully lighted, 
		you know what an impressive sight that can be. The house of the Lord, 
		bathed in light, standing out in the darkness, becomes symbolic of the 
		power and the inspiration of the gospel of Jesus Christ standing as a 
		beacon in a world that sinks ever further into spiritual darkness. &nbsp;The 
		temple is a place to learn more about the Lords plan of happiness; the 
		nature of eternity; and the nature of who you really are and your 
		relationship to God.&nbsp; It is a place of learning that is, or should 
		become, integral to your lives.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Perhaps the most important 
		learning environment established and endorsed by the Lord is the home 
		and family.&nbsp; The culmination of all learning should be for the purpose 
		of blessing your home environment.&nbsp; Extending the counsel of the Lord 
		regarding the purpose of temples to your own home, He instructed, 
		establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house 
		of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a 
		house of God (D&amp;C 88:119).&nbsp; By creating such a house, you can establish 
		the kind of environment and be entitled to the kind of blessings 
		described by Joseph in the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp; 
		The environment should be such that no unclean thingbe permitted to 
		come into thy house to pollute itthat all people who shall enter upon 
		the thresholdmay feel [Gods] power, and feel constrained to 
		acknowledge that [He has] sanctified it and that those of your family 
		may seek learning even by study, and also by faith (D&amp;C 109:20, 
		13-14).&nbsp; The blessings are that those who dwell there may go 
		fortharmed withthy power, and that thy name be upon them, and thy 
		glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them; and 
		from this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in 
		truth. (D&amp;C 109:22-23). &nbsp;Your home can be a refuge from the storm, a 
		spiritual light in an ever-darkening world, a sanctuary for all those 
		who seek shelter from the vicissitudes of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Paul said to Timothy, in the 
		last days perilous time shall come.&nbsp; For men shall beever learning, and 
		never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. (2 Timothy 3:1-2, 7).&nbsp; 
		The Lord knew that many of His children would lack faith, especially in 
		the last days.&nbsp; As a result of your experiences here, live your life so 
		you can be an example of faith and a witness for truth at all times and 
		in all things, and in all places. (Mosiah: 18:9).&nbsp; Continue to create 
		special learning environments where you can ponder new ideas and engage 
		in important, uplifting, and insightful conversations. &nbsp;But most 
		importantly, create an environment where you can let the doctrines 
		distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven (D&amp;C 121:45), where you 
		can contemplate the mission, the ministry, the majesty, and the 
		mysteries of God.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you go forward now, and 
		throughout life, learning more about who you are, about who God is, and 
		about your relationship with Him will influence not only the direction 
		you go, but also your final destination. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To this I testify, in the 
		name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Christmas is coming 
				and I havent done much shopping, but I am well on my way to 
				being prepared with my gift for my husband John.&nbsp; The gifts that 
				we as a family give him are memorizations.&nbsp; For as long as I can 
				remember John has discouraged buying store-bought presents to 
				celebrate his holidays.&nbsp; Instead, he has asked that we memorize 
				a poem, song, or scriptural passage to recite for him.&nbsp; This way 
				our offerings could be described the same as William Shakespeare 
				describes mercy: It is twice blessed; it blesses him that gives 
				and him that takes&nbsp;(<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, 
				4.1.186-87).&nbsp; I know this passage because I once memorized it 
				for John.&nbsp; He has always felt that memorization gives our 
				children and me a chance to give him something that we can also 
				keep for ourselves.&nbsp; It is a gift from the heart when we learn 
				things by heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I like the phrase 
				learning by heart.&nbsp; In contrast to learning by rote, to 
				learn by heart is to commit things to memory so deeply and 
				richly that they sink deep into the soul.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have learned that 
				there can be many benefits to learning things by heart.&nbsp; For 
				me personally, to commit a passage to memory deepens my 
				understanding of the passage and fixes it in my heart.&nbsp; As I go 
				over and over a passage in my mind, I think about it again and 
				again.&nbsp; The richness of the wordsthe way they are put together, 
				the possible symbolism, the clever use of literary devices, and 
				new meanings that I may never have noticed or understood 
				beforeall become apparent in the process of memorizing. 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorizing can become a rich way of studyinga way of studying 
				things out in my mind, then letting them sink deep into my 
				heart. &nbsp;Learning by heart (which may be somewhat of a dying 
				tradition) means to learn something so deeply that it becomes 
				part of our core; it fills us; it changes us. &nbsp;This type of 
				learning by heart prepares our minds and hearts for revelation 
				and witnessing from the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Joseph Fielding Smith said, 
				Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fibre 
				and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten (<i>Doctrines 
				of Salvations</i>, Vol. 1, p. 48).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Often my heart has 
				been filled with the Spirit during early morning runs as I have 
				gone over in my mind The Proclamation on the Family, The 
				Living Christ, or some scripture or poem I was memorizing.&nbsp; I 
				had read the Proclamation on the Family many times and felt 
				love and appreciation for it, but memorizing it forced me to 
				linger over and repeat each word and sentence.&nbsp; As I did so, my 
				mind and heart were prepared to be taught by the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;I 
				began to see how the Proclamation spoke in detail to each of the 
				cultural ills that plagues our society.&nbsp; I felt hope that the 
				eternal truths taught in the Proclamation could arm me as I 
				faced current and difficult moral issues.&nbsp; I began to feel 
				greater affirmation from apostles and prophets and from the Lord 
				for the family choices I had made over a lifetime.&nbsp; I was 
				comforted by the knowledge that we had a Father in Heaven who 
				has an unfailing plan for us.&nbsp; I felt His matchless love and 
				goodness.&nbsp; I felt as it explains in Proverbs that the Lord 
				giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and 
				understanding and . . . wisdom entereth into thine heart 
				(Proverbs 2:6, 10).&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was filled with knowledge, 
				understanding, wisdom, and love which encouraged gratitude, 
				personal improvement, and the desire to strengthen others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This tradition of 
				memorizing and reciting has allowed us as parents additional 
				glimpses into the hearts of our children, to come to know them 
				better.&nbsp; As they choose their own passages we often discover 
				what challenges or joys they are experiencing.&nbsp; We also learn of 
				their wisdom and sometimes of their sense of humor.&nbsp; I remember 
				on John's 40<sup>th</sup> birthday when our then 
				fifteen-year-old daughter presented a poem by Lewis Carroll:&nbsp;
				</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">You are old Father William, the young 
				man said</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">And your hair has become very white.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">And yet you incessantly stand on your 
				head.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">Do you think that at your age it is 
				right?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My husband forgot his 
				dismay at his passing years as he delighted in our daughter's 
				sense of humor.&nbsp; Another time a daughter chose to recite 
				Shakespeare's Sonnet 29, When in disgrace with fortune and 
				men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state.&nbsp; This came at 
				a time when she was feeling inadequate and friendless.&nbsp; One 
				child chose a love poem when he was feeling heady and in love.&nbsp; 
				Another memorized Section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants and 
				announced to us that she had decided to serve a mission.&nbsp; What 
				they learn by heart and share with their father becomes an 
				expression of their own heartfelt emotions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Learning by heart is 
				a rich phrase.&nbsp; Think about the word heart.&nbsp; We all know that 
				our hearts are central to life.&nbsp; Physically the heart is the 
				life-sustaining organ of our bodies.&nbsp; Likewise, heart is used 
				to describe the essential, most vital part of our spiritual 
				being; one=s innermost character, feelings or inclinations.&nbsp; In 
				a gospel sense, the heart is our spiritual core.&nbsp; Hence, the 
				scriptures teach that as a man thinketh in his <i>heart</i> so 
				is he (Proverbs 23:7) and that where your treasure is, there 
				will your <i>heart</i> be also (Matt. 6:21).&nbsp; The Gospel must 
				be written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; 
				not in tables of stone; but in fleshy tables of the <i>heart</i> 
				(2 Cor. 3:3).&nbsp; Over and over in the scriptures, prophets remind 
				us, as Alma tells his son, to let the affections of thy <i>
				heart</i> be placed upon the Lord forever (Alma 37:36).&nbsp; 
				Learning by heart in its richest sense is a gospel duty.&nbsp; It is 
				a twin commandment to remembering.&nbsp; We are to learn spiritual 
				truth by heart and then retain in remembrance what we have 
				placed deep in our hearts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many of you here 
				today have spent several years at this wonderful university to 
				become educated.&nbsp; What have you learned by heart?&nbsp; Some of what 
				you have learned by heart is factual or informational.&nbsp; Such 
				learning is useful.&nbsp; It helps us solve daily problems and meet 
				immediate needs.&nbsp; Dr. Todd Britsch, former Academic Vice 
				President of BYU, observed that in this world where we have 
				ready access electronically to information, it is still 
				important to have some information stored in our mind so we 
				arent dependent on being plugged in to access it.&nbsp; He said,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
<font color="#000080">. . .we remember some data that helps us 
				solve a problem, we direct someone to a particular location, we 
				discuss a painting without a copy of it in front of us, we order 
				a part for a computer without a catalog at hand.&nbsp; In each case 
				we have memorized something that helps us shorten the process of 
				dealing with daily experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without this storehouse of 
				facts and data, we would be helpless.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Other things we learn 
				by heart serve even more profound ends, as Dr. Britsch goes on 
				to describe: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
<font color="#000080">. . . a scripture that aids in counseling 
				a sorrowing friend; a hymn whose words and music express our 
				most profound religious feelings when we are struggling with a 
				matter of faith. . . a technical point that helps us defend a 
				position that is important for us, our family, or our 
				community.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you deposited 
				rich and worthwhile learning into your memory bank so that when 
				you need to make a withdrawal there will be abundant treasures 
				of knowledge and wisdom available to you?&nbsp; Have you acquired the 
				skill of learning how to learn so that you can continue 
				throughout your life to fill your bank?&nbsp; In <i>Preach My Gospel</i> 
				it says, While learning from a good teacher is very important 
				it is more important for you to have meaningful learning 
				experiences on your own (<i>PMG</i>, 2004, p.17).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Recently I saw some 
				young women learn how to find answers for themselves to their 
				burning gospel questions.&nbsp; A Young Women president called our 
				presidency and said that her girls had a question for us.&nbsp; The 
				question was, What is the Churchs stand on wearing two-piece 
				swimming suits?&nbsp; As a presidency we discussed their question 
				and then continued talking about it with our General Board 
				members.&nbsp; Then we returned the call to the Young Women president 
				and said, Although we have lots of thoughts about this topic, 
				we dont feel we should give an answer for you.&nbsp; Instead, we 
				would like your young women, under your guidance, to study this 
				question, reading everything they can in the scriptures and from 
				Church leaders, including listening to General Conference with 
				their question in mind.&nbsp; Then in a couple of months we would 
				like them to come report their findings to us.&nbsp; We just 
				recently had that meeting.&nbsp; It was clear that these girls had 
				not only learned answers to their question, but had learned how 
				to learn answers to future questions.&nbsp; As it states in BYUIs 
				Learning Model, when learners and teachers exercise agency by 
				acting in accordance with correct principles, they open their 
				hearts to the Holy Ghost and invite His teaching.&nbsp; Now these 
				young women have found their own answers which will stay with 
				them at their very core, in their hearts, and they will know how 
				to continue to deposit treasures of knowledge in their hearts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Learning by heart 
				enables us to pursue lifelong learning more fully by study and 
				also by faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Learning Model also states:&nbsp; Learning to 
				act in accordance with ones faith in Christ is fundamental to 
				enjoying deep, life-changing learning.&nbsp; The power we access by 
				acting in faith that is focused on the Savior allows us to 
				exceed our natural limits and learn beyond our natural 
				capabilities.&nbsp; That type of education will stretch us and make 
				us more fit for the kingdom  more serviceable to others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young stated: 
				We might ask, when shall we cease to learn?&nbsp; I will give you my 
				opinion about it; never, never (JD 3:203).&nbsp; He also taught: 
				Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us 
				for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the 
				human family (JC 14:83).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am grateful for 
				powerful examples in my life of people who assume the 
				responsibility to continually learn and serve, thus making the 
				world a better place by their vibrant, faithful minds and 
				hearts.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">John's 
				eighty-seven-year-old mother is one such example. &nbsp;It is always 
				fun to talk to her because there is such excitement in her voice 
				about each personal new discovery, be it about literature, 
				history, culture, language, the scriptures, or any other topic. 
				&nbsp;She has taught herself to speak several languages to be more 
				useful in her temple service.&nbsp; She is the mother of thirteen 
				children who follow her example in hungering for knowledge and 
				sacrificing to serve.&nbsp; She is someone who has taken learning to 
				heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I, likewise, saw a 
				pattern of learning by heart with my dad.&nbsp; As a young man he 
				served a mission in Czechoslovakia.&nbsp; At that time there was no 
				MTC to train him in the language.&nbsp; He had to learn it as he 
				went.&nbsp; He established a habit of studying both the scriptures 
				and the language diligently early every morning.&nbsp; In 1990 when 
				that country was again opened to the Gospel, he was called back 
				to be the Mission President.&nbsp; He continued that early morning 
				study of the language each day of his mission, and thus he 
				became quite proficient in it.&nbsp; Several years after his return 
				from the second mission, he was called to be a patriarch to the 
				Czech people so that, in the words of President Boyd K. Packer, 
				they can receive this personal blessing and message from God in 
				their native language.&nbsp; Studying and memorizing the language, 
				in his mind and in his heart, prepared my father to be a more 
				useful servant in our Heavenly Fathers kingdom.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the many 
				things I love about our dear prophet President Hinckley is his 
				bright mind and his love for learning.&nbsp; At the dedication of a 
				campus library, there was much talk about the vast technology 
				that had been acquired that would help people access information 
				from the great collection of books.&nbsp; President Hinckley was 
				grateful for that, but then he tenderly held a beautiful book in 
				his hands.&nbsp; He talked of his great love for the heft and feel of 
				a book, that nothing surpassed the pleasure of holding it and 
				reading from its pages.&nbsp; He inherited a vast library of books 
				from his father and he knew its contents.&nbsp; Books have become 
				part of him. His daughter Virginia Pearce said of him, He 
				frequently quotes Shakespeare.&nbsp; He quotes Kipling.&nbsp; Passages of 
				great literature are just floating around in his head (quoted 
				in Jake Parkinson, U. Endowment Expands, Deseret News, 6 April 
				2003, A7).&nbsp; &nbsp;This is because he memorized them in his youth and 
				sometimes recited them to his parents, as our children have done 
				for us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My husband and I have 
				heard lots of other relevant information &nbsp;just seem to pop out 
				at the appropriate times, as we had the opportunity to take two 
				ambassadors to visit him, one from the Czech Republic and one 
				from China.&nbsp; In each case we were astounded as to the depth of 
				his knowledge of the historical and political events of those 
				lands.&nbsp; He is well read.&nbsp; He is a good thinker.&nbsp; He has a good 
				memory and is wise in his ability to assimilate and utilize his 
				knowledge.&nbsp; This lifelong learning has allowed him to be much 
				more serviceable in the kingdom.&nbsp; He is able to draw treasures 
				of wisdom out of the abundance of a mind and a heart well 
				stocked with knowledge.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A combination of 
				well-developed faith, intellect, and character prepares students 
				for a lifetime of service. &nbsp;I memorized a poem by George Elliot 
				that speaks eloquently about developing ourselves so that we may 
				become one of the choir invisible whose lives bring strength 
				to others:&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By lifelong learning 
				and service, we may join the choir invisible whose music is the 
				gladness of the world.&nbsp; As graduates of BYUIdaho, you have a 
				special duty so to live.&nbsp; As President Kimball said of the 
				university graduates in our Church: you provide the music of 
				hope for the inhabitants of this planet.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For our lives to 
				become the music of hope for the world, our learning must be 
				heart-deep; it must reach our very core. We must be able not 
				only to access information but to understand; we must acquire 
				not only knowledge but wisdom.&nbsp; In this day and age, we can look 
				up anything, but it can only change us if we know it in our 
				hearts.&nbsp; T. S. Eliot said, Where is the wisdom we have lost in 
				knowledge?&nbsp; Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?&nbsp;
				</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">O remember, remember 
			Alma said to each of his sons.&nbsp; Let us treasure up wisdom in our 
			hearts (D&amp;C 38:30) by appreciating in our hearts our blessings of 
			protection, comfort, and peace; by pondering in our hearts moments 
			of inspiration and revelation received from the Holy Ghost; and 
			above all, by remembering, remembering in our hearts that we are 
			covenant children of Heavenly Father.&nbsp; We must engrave our covenants 
			in the fleshy tables of our hearts.&nbsp; It is my hope and my prayer 
			that, as Jeremiah says, God will put his law in our inward parts 
			and write it in [our] hearts&nbsp; (Jer. 31:33).&nbsp;&nbsp; May we learn by heart 
			those things that will continually fill our memory banks with wisdom 
			and then use that wisdom in His service. </font></p>
