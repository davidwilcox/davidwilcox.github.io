<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to speak to you today. I love you very much, and it is good to be with you at the beginning of a new semester on another great day at BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />Many years ago, I served a mission in Southern Germany. One morning early in my mission, I knelt in prayer to ask my Heavenly Father for help. I was discouraged and worried, unsure of myself, and troubled by fears and doubts. I pleaded with the Lord for relief, for help, and for guidance. As I prayed, I heard a voice, as clear as if someone were standing by my side, say to me: "Believe in God." I looked up but only saw my companion across the room fixing breakfast. I said to him, "Is there a scripture somewhere that says, 'Believe in God'?" In an offhand way he said, "Oh yeah. Mosiah chapter 4, verse 9."&nbsp;<br /><br />I sat on the bed, opened the Book of Mormon and read that scripture:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p>
<p>As I read that verse, the Spirit bore a powerful witness of its truth. I had my answer.&nbsp;<br /><br />In an hour of intense need, in a time of trial, I received reassurance of the Savior's love, mercy, and grace, along with divine counsel for a lifetime: when you are in tough situations, when you face important decisions, when you need to repent, when you are discouraged or lonely or afraid, turn to Christ. Act with faith and humility to seek the blessings of His Atonement in your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I bear witness that marvelous blessings can flow into our lives through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I bear that witness to you today because I want the Atonement of Christ to work more powerfully in your lives. I want you to have greater faith in Him, more thoroughly forsake sin and repent, and have His Spirit with you always. I want you to love Him more, obey Him more, trust Him more, and serve Him more. I want you to be converted more deeply unto the Lord so that in your trials that surely will come, the Savior's redeeming and strengthening power will be with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />And so, today, in this sacred place, I will speak first about the Atonement of Christ and its blessings. I will then focus on what we need to do so that the Atonement of Christ will work more powerfully in our lives in times of trial.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Atonement of Christ and Its Blessings</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the premortal realm, our Heavenly Father chose His firstborn spirit son to be the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. Born of Mary in Bethlehem, Jesus was the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. He came to live in this fallen, mortal world in order to experience and overcome everything that stood in the way of immortality and eternal life for all of Heavenly Father's children.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Gethsemane and on Calvary, Jesus took upon Himself our sins and suffered the "whole law of the demands of justice"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;for us. He felt in His pure and sinless soul the searing torment of "a perfect knowledge of all our guilt and our uncleanness."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;He suffered the agony of "[death] as to things pertaining unto righteousness"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;and the "awful chains"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;of Satan's power and captivity.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus also chose to take upon Himself all of our infirmities. Alma taught that Christ would know our infirmities through the Spirit but would choose to suffer them in the flesh.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;In that magnificent act of love and sacrifice, Jesus would suffer "pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;and indeed, "the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In His love and compassion for us, Jesus chose to suffer every infirmity of mortal life for two reasons: first, that He would be filled with mercy and know from His own experience how to use His power to succor each one of us in our weakness, our sorrow, and our trials; second, that He might "blot out [our] transgressions according to the power of His deliverance."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />This means that the Atonement of Christ can work in every aspect of our lives. Jesus experienced and overcame everything we experience so that His almighty power can cleanse us from every sin and lift us and strengthen us in every trial we face. He knows each one of us perfectly. He has walked our path. He has felt what we feel. He has perfect love and empathy for us, and He has all power to redeem us and strengthen us perfectly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus has that power because of His suffering. We have His own words describing what He felt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn10" target="_self">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The culminating experience of Christ's suffering and sacrifice was the Resurrection. Jesus died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose the third day a glorious resurrected being. He burst the bands of death and the chains of hell. In a way we only dimly comprehend, Jesus descended below all things and overcame all things. Because of His atoning sacrifice, He "received all power both in heaven and on earth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;He is the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is remarkable that out of such awful suffering there could come such amazing blessings. Because of the Atonement, every little child born into this world is born innocent, "alive in Christ"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>; every person receives the Light of Christ; and everyone will be resurrected and return to "stand in the presence of [God], to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in Him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;These blessings are all unconditional gifts of Christ to everyone.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus opened the path to exaltation and eternal life to those who have faith in Him, repent of their sins, are baptized by water and the Spirit, desire to serve Him, and endure valiantly to the end. As the Lord taught Nicodemus, each repentant soul may be born again, a new person in Christ. We are not trapped by our past. Through the Atonement of Christ, we can be redeemed from all the burdens of sin and enjoy all the blessings of the Lord's true and living church--including the gifts of the Spirit, the blessings and power of the priesthood, and the sacred ordinances of the temple of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we walk in that path and learn to consistently and persistently act with faith in Christ to do His will, the power of the Atonement will work in our lives. Jesus will redeem us from sin and change our very nature. He will strengthen us with His gifts and blessings and help us become more and more like Him. Through His mercy and His grace, we can qualify for exaltation and eternal life.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Power of the Atonement Working in Our Lives</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The path to eternal life is not the easy way. It is strait and narrow; and it runs right through this fallen, mortal world. In this world there are storms of sorrow and suffering that break upon us and forces of evil that try to draw us away.&nbsp;<br /><br />Trials come to everyone in mortal life; no one is exempt. Some trials are short and intense. Some last a long time. These times of trial are one of life's great crucibles of personal, spiritual growth. They test us and try us. They are part of the Father's plan. The growth and learning He wants for us can only come through mortal trials.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan tries to exploit those very same trials for his evil purposes. In times of trial he tempts us to stop doing the things that bind us to God and to seek relief in the ways of the world that lead to sin and darkness.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is very important to remember that while trials make us vulnerable to temptation, Satan has no power over us unless we give it to him. As long as we keep the pleasures, philosophies, and riches of the world out of our hearts and live the plain and simple truths of the gospel, the power of the Atonement of Christ will work in our lives. We will be warned and strengthened and blessed to resist and escape from temptation, and we will find strength in times of trial. As Jesus said to the Prophet Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn14" target="_self"></a></sup>I love the message of that scripture--"hold on thy way,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;"press forward with a steadfastness in Christ,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;relying on the "merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;and He "shall be with you forever and ever."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>We "hold on [our] way"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;by turning to Christ with all our hearts, relying on His teachings and example to guide us, and trusting in Him for strength and capacity beyond our own. The Savior's experience after He descended from the Mount of Transfiguration illustrates a pattern that will help us apply these principles in times of trial.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Jesus had come down from the mountain, a father said to Him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;&nbsp;And they brought him unto [Jesus]: and when [Jesus] saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</p>
<p>The father then said to Jesus:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">. . . if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.Jesus said unto him, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Moved with divine compassion, Jesus cast out the evil spirit and healed the boy and his family.&nbsp;<br /><br />The father's experience is instructive. He came to Jesus with his only son who was beset by a foul, dumb spirit. The father and mother had cared for the boy for a long time. They loved him. The father had turned to Jesus hoping that He might be able to do something for them. His faith was weak. The Savior helped the father recognize his weakness, open his heart, and put his trust in Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a pattern in the father's experience that can help us "hold on our way" in times of trial. It has three parts:<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Part I: Turn to Christ with humility and faith in Him</em><br />The Savior knows you perfectly and has suffered what you suffer. He knows how to help you address and overcome the trials you face, and His love never fails. You can turn to Him with confidence and trust.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, in times of trial, difficult issues and new demands on our attention and our time may distract us. There may be temptations to turn elsewhere for relief. If we are not careful, we may stop doing the very things that will bring us divine help. We "hold on our way" by consciously saying to ourselves: I am going to look to Christ, give my heart to Him, and keep doing the things that connect me to Him and to His power.&nbsp;<br /><br />Once the father in the story decided to turn to Christ for help, he went looking for Him in the roads and on the hills of Palestine. When we turn to Christ in times of trial, where do we find Him? The answer is very clear. We find Him in prayer to our Father in Heaven, in the scriptures, in the words of the living prophets, in obedience to His commandments, in personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, and in His Church--including in His authorized servants, in sacred ordinances and covenants, in His temple, and in His service.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of these things are channels through which we can seek the strength, guidance, and support of Christ in times of trial. We can pray and search the scriptures; we can counsel with parents, family members, and priesthood leaders; we can partake of the sacrament, worship in the temple, and serve others. When the Atonement of Christ is working in our lives, these channels literally "light up" with His Spirit, truth, guidance, love, and power.<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Part II: Hear the Word of the Lord and Do It</em><br />When we turn to the Lord with humility and faith, He guides us and directs us. Insights and understanding come when we ask the Father in the name of Christ what we are supposed to learn from our trials and what we should do. The Lord wants us to "hold on our way," and He will speak to us.&nbsp;<br /><br />The key for us is to hear His word and do what He directs us to do. What He gives us will depend on the very specific situations we face. I can tell you, however, two things the Lord will direct all of us to do in times of trial.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first is to repent. Look back at the example of the father. When he asked Jesus for help, the father said, "If thou canst do any thing."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;The father's faith was weak and incomplete. He did not believe that Christ could do all things. Jesus called the father to repentance with these words: "If thou canst believe."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;With His searching statement, Jesus gave the father an opportunity to repent and grow in his understanding and faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord uses our trials to help us put our lives in order and become more like Him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;This may seem especially daunting in a time of trial. However, if we pray and ask what we need to change in our lives, the Lord will guide us. If we heed the call to repent, the Lord will forgive us. His redeeming power will cleanse us and change our hearts and our lives, no matter the nature of the sin or how long it has been going on. Repentance will be a source of great power in overcoming the trials we face.&nbsp;<br /><br />The second direction the Lord will give us is to serve. Even in our most trying times, Jesus will guide us to serve other people. Serving others on the Lord's errand opens our hearts to His Spirit and His love. We turn away from a preoccupation with ourselves and focus more on the Lord and the people we serve. And very often the people we serve lift and strengthen us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here, again, Jesus is our great example. Because He heard and did the Father's will, Jesus can guide and direct us, redeem us, and strengthen us in every time of trial.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Part III: Face the Trial Head-On with Faith and Not Fear</em><br />When Jesus came down from the Mount of Transfiguration, He faced that difficult situation head-on; He did not turn away. With divine love and power, Jesus healed the boy and the mother and father. He is our example, and He is the source of the strength we need. When we "hold on our way" and face trials head-on in the Lord's way, we have access to His guidance and His power.</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The history of the Church . . . is replete with the experiences of those who have struggled and yet who have remained steadfast and of good cheer. The reason? They have made the gospel of Jesus Christ the center of their lives. This is what will pull us through whatever comes our way. We will still experience difficult challenges, but we will be able to face them, to meet them head-on, and to emerge victorious.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn24" target="_self">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The trials of mortal life usually require that we do hard things. Because things are hard, our natural reaction may be frustration, disappointment, a desire to find an easier way, and especially fear. That is why it is a trial; we feel inadequate and even at a loss.&nbsp;<br /><br />But we do not have to take counsel from our fears and our frustrations. We can act with faith in Christ's power and His love to do what is hard with an attitude of hope and optimism. The scriptures teach us that through the power of His atoning sacrifice, Jesus can make our burdens light. He can strengthen us to do things that are hard. He can change our hearts and bless us with assurance of His help.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like Helaman and his army who at one point were "grieved and also filled with fear,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn25" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;we, too, can turn to Christ and He will "grant unto us great faith" and "cause [that] we should hope for . . . deliverance in him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_Clark.htm#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;He will help us face hard things head-on, with hope and assurance and good cheer.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong></p>
<p>I want to return now to my experience with Mosiah, chapter 4, verse 9.&nbsp;<br /><br />On that day in Germany, I did not know what trials I would face in my life. But the Lord knew, and He began to teach me that day how to "hold on my way." Over many years and many trials, I have gained a sure witness of the pattern I have taught today and of the power of the Atonement of Christ in times of trial.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me give you an example from a trial Sue and I and one of our children faced together.&nbsp;<br /><br />When our son Jonathan was in the third grade, he was diagnosed with a serious learning disability. The counselor who tested him told us that by his early twenties Jonathan would develop the ability to learn effectively, but until then he would have difficulty learning.&nbsp;<br /><br />That turned out to be true on both counts. Throughout his years in middle school and high school, Jonathan really struggled with schoolwork. He coped with his frustration and disappointment psychologically by making school unimportant and by getting into trouble in a variety of ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sue and I had not dealt with these challenges before, and we were often at a loss when new behaviors and new challenges would emerge. There were years when every time the phone in my office would ring I would get a knot in my stomach because I worried it was about some problem with Jonathan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sue and I turned to the Lord for guidance and strength. There were times when we did not know how we were going to make it. We needed more insight, more love, more firmness, more patience, and more resilience than we had. We prayed and trusted that the Lord would help us, and then we faced what we had to do every day head-on. We loved Jonathan, taught him, talked to him, disciplined him, worked with him, and prayed for him for many years.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many blessings came. We had some wonderful times with Jonathan. We received new insights from the Lord, and many angels of mercy helped Jonathan and us. Through the strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ, Jonathan matured spiritually and emotionally. Sue and I gradually learned how to help Jonathan with more love and more structure. And we became more patient and more resilient.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jonathan graduated from high school, did a year of college, and then served a mission. But the trials were not over. He had to come home from his mission because of a serious anxiety disorder that surfaced for the first time. That was a really difficult time for him and for us. Over a number of months, with lots of faith in the Savior, with priesthood blessings and the help of a wise physician, Jonathan made progress. He had learned to trust the Lord, and the Lord blessed him.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most powerful blessings was Deborah, whom Jonathan had met in college and who became his wife. They moved to Minnesota so Jonathan could play football and go to school when another trial hit them, literally. Jonathan was out tubing one day with a friend from Church when he lost control of his tube and spun out onto a state highway. A truck hit him and crushed his left leg between the knee and the ankle.&nbsp;<br /><br />He survived the crash and recovered through months of painful therapy with priesthood blessings and lots of faith. One day Jonathan called me on the phone and said the words his mother and I had hoped to hear for 14 years. He said, "Dad, I'm starting to really like school, and I am doing well. I think I need to go to a better school." He transferred to Boston College where he majored in economics. The boy who struggled mightily in high school later earned a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D. in health policy and management at Harvard. Today he teaches at Penn State, has a wonderful family, and serves in the bishopric in his ward.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I know from my own experience that the path to eternal life comes with trials. But I am a witness of the strengthening and redeeming power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Holy Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer. I know He lives. The power of His Atonement is real.

<p></p>
<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had the opportunity on a Monday in December to present a family home evening lesson to four of our grandchildren. We talked about the Wise Men finding the Baby Jesus. The three youngest boys, usually quite rambunctious, were unusually attentive that night and so I was able to put my energy into trying to help them learn something from that story that they could apply to their own lives.<br /><br />I took them through the story this way: The Wise Men saw a star in the east and followed it traveling to Jerusalem, asking, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />King Herod heard of their quest and inquired of his chief priests and scribes where Christ was to be born. They told him it had been prophesied that He would be born in Bethlehem of Judaea.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;And so, with evil intentions, Herod sent the Wise Men to Bethlehem and instructed them to search diligently and return and bring him word. The Wise Men departed, ". . . and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I asked my grandchildren what it might have been about the Wise Men that allowed them to have the "gift of a star."&nbsp;<br /><br />We talked about the Wise Men being wise and knowing what to look for; but I also wanted to teach them about another light, a light besides the star, that worked in leading the Wise Men to Jesus.</p>
<p>I told them that when we lived with Heavenly Father before the world was created, we accepted Heavenly Father's plan of happiness. Because we accepted that plan, all of us born on earth have the Light of Christ within us. This Light helps us to feel and recognize our connection to Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As John taught, Jesus is "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Wise Men had that Light within them. They nurtured that Light by studying the prophecies about the coming of Christ and by watching with faith for the signs that would foretell His birth. With that preparation, when the star appeared they felt a connection to the star and rejoiced with "exceeding great joy"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;and followed the star to Bethlehem and to the stable where Mary and Joseph cared for the newborn baby.&nbsp;<br /><br />When they found him, the Wise Men bestowed valuable gifts upon the baby Jesus. But the Wise Men also received a valuable gift. The joy and rejoicing they experienced when they saw the star was multiplied by an immeasurable amount when they saw the Christ child. They knew that the Baby they found in the stable in Bethlehem truly was sent from God to light the world, to be the King of Kings, the Savior and Redeemer who the prophets had taught would come into the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />With that witness as their gift and having been "warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_07_SueClark.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />To end our family home evening, I told the children that like the Wise Men, we have the Light of Christ that helps us find and follow Jesus so that we can receive all the gifts He has for us. One of those gifts is repentance. I told the children that when they repent, Jesus forgives them and helps correct their mistakes.&nbsp;<br /><br />At that point five-year-old Matthew asked, "And helps us get off the naughty list?" "Yes, Matthew," I said. "We can always get off the naughty list if we trust in Jesus and His light within us."&nbsp;<br /><br />Probably the reason those three little grandsons had been so attentive in home evening that night was because they were working hard to get off the naughty list before Christmas.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am grateful that the Light of Christ guided me to teach a lesson that reinforced a lesson that they had already begun to apply. It was a sweet gift.&nbsp;<br /><br />I share that experience in order to testify of the love Jesus has for us. He, whose birth we have just celebrated, is literally our Savior. He knows those sweet grandchildren and loves them. I love Him. I bear testimony that He knows and loves each of you. It is my prayer that you will feel that love and His guiding light in your lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>President, Rexburg ID Married Student 3rd Stake</p>
<p>I grew up in Rexburg and attended Ricks College, graduating in the Centennial Class in 1988.&nbsp; My grandfather Clyde Packer coached for Ricks College from 1917 to 1939 and appears in many of the old photographs in the gallery.&nbsp; My father, Alden Packer, worked as the director of the student health center.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Following my Ricks College Education, I attended the University of Utah, graduating with a BA in English while doing my pre-medicine coursework.&nbsp; I then attended the University of Washington, School of Medicine.&nbsp; My residency in Family Medicine was in Fort Worth, Texas.&nbsp; I started practicing Family Medicine in Rexburg in 1997 and have loved my career.&nbsp; <br /><br />My most important decision was to marry Shannon Hanks.&nbsp; She is the center of my life and of our home.&nbsp; We have 4 children, the oldest of which, Laura, leaves tomorrow to start her missionary service in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin mission.&nbsp; Alden, 17, Christian, 15, and Lincoln, 11, keep our family life entertaining.&nbsp; <br /><br />Despite growing up in Southeast Idaho and spending most of my adult life here, there are still many hills to hike and scenes to see.&nbsp; We enjoy backpacking and camping.&nbsp; I consider myself a sailor and my family sometimes join me as crew.&nbsp; But my little sailboat sits idle most of the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I served as a missionary in the Seoul, Korea mission and am currently serving as the president of the Rexburg Idaho Married Student 3<sup>rd</sup> Stake.&nbsp; I deeply appreciate the opportunities I've had to serve in the church and associate with some outstanding individuals who have had profound effects on my testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>What an amazing experience it is to stand before you. &nbsp;&nbsp;While I would never have asked for this opportunity, I am grateful to President Clark and this magnificent university for the experience I've had in learning from the spirit as I prepared this talk.&nbsp; I can testify assuredly that at least one person will walk out of this great hall today a better person for having been here--that person is certainly me!</p>
<p>I love Brigham Young University Idaho and the heritage that dwells here of Ricks College.&nbsp; In the course of my own academic adventures I have attended a few universities.&nbsp; I can recall lessons I learned at each but in all truth, no subsequent educational experience impacted my life more than the time I spent here at Ricks College.</p>
<p>As I've reflected on my years of study on this campus, or at least a smaller version of this campus, I think I've come to understand some principles about education and my own journey in the path of learning that might be instructive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I was blessed to sit in the classrooms of some truly outstanding teachers at Ricks College.&nbsp; Most have since retired but there are a few who still haunt these hallowed hallways.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I came home from my mission tremendously enthused about learning.&nbsp; Medicine had long been my goal and now it was the time to start building the foundation of an academic career.&nbsp; I'm grateful for liberal arts requirements that exposed me to more than science classes.&nbsp; I came to understand that the spirit will confirm the truthfulness of Dickens as well as Faraday.&nbsp; So it was that I came to sit in a literary criticism class taught by Professor Larry Thompson.&nbsp; The spirit that I had begun to identify in my life as a missionary now seemed to intensify dramatically in these classrooms.&nbsp; Brother Thompson would teach and it seemed like my whole being was awash in knowledge.&nbsp; These were profound moments for me.&nbsp; I had that same experience in many disparate courses, day after day, semester after semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These moments of brilliant illumination came in flashes at the hand of so many great teachers here.&nbsp; I honor them all--they were more than teachers.&nbsp; They were mentors.&nbsp; They imparted a body of knowledge but more importantly they imparted enthusiasm for learning and confidence in the spirit.&nbsp; I still remember Doctor Lyle Lowder, a professor of anatomy, stopping in the middle of a lecture on the nephron, and bearing a short but obviously profound testimony about God's hand in the creation.&nbsp; "Isn't it amazing" he said, "that God knows the basis of all physical laws and could create the complexity of the human body?"&nbsp; Then he added with a wry smile, "But man's mind is pretty good--we've figured this much out!"&nbsp;<br /><br />I suggest that Mentoring is a divine relationship and as a grateful receiver of inspired mentoring I would like to testify to you of the blessings of mentored learning.&nbsp; We will all be mentored and in turn mentor others.&nbsp; I think there are some great examples of this relationship from which we can learn how to appreciate the process of sharing understanding and most importantly, pointing each other toward the greatest mentor to have walked the earth, even Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I have learned from many teachers in my life but have been influenced deeply by a smaller circle of outstanding brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Whereas the passing of knowledge is the hallmark of a student-teacher relationship, I think the mentor imbues much more than knowledge to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;.&nbsp; The lecturer stands in front of the student--the Mentor stands next to the student.&nbsp; A mentor teaches, yes, but also shares a vision and guides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a spark of relationship, a kind of continuing conversation that sometimes lasts a semester and sometimes lasts the length of a hallway.&nbsp; Many times, it is a life-long relationship that flourishes.&nbsp; It is a walk together, the master leading at first and then walking together, learning and sharing knowledge and excitement for life.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Mentor Teaches<br /></strong>I want to share some examples of mentoring, some of which come from my own life.&nbsp; I hope that you'll see the universal application of these examples.&nbsp; Whether you study music or math, there are individuals who will influence you and in turn the student will become the mentor.&nbsp; I hope you'll also be able to appreciate those in your life who have influenced you.&nbsp; In the course of preparing this talk, I've reflected on so many people, too many to list, who had profound effects on me.</p>
<p>Let me start with a historical example.&nbsp; William Osler has long been a hero to me.</p>
<p>He is famous in the world of medical education.&nbsp; He is credited with establishing a method of teaching and learning medicine which stands today.&nbsp; At the beginning of his career in the mid 1800's, medical students could conceivably graduate from school without having touched a patient, assisted a surgery or observed the delivery of a baby.&nbsp; He advocated a change in the style of education from the classroom method that now occupies the first 2 years of medical school to ward-based, hospital-based education of the last 2 years and in post graduate years.&nbsp; It harkens to the role of apprenticeships.&nbsp; Osler brought medical education, at least in the United States, to the bedside of the patient.&nbsp; This is a great example of the "Case Study" you all know well.&nbsp; He didn't discount the value of lectures and "learning in the amphitheater."&nbsp; But he realized that the conversational nature of bedside teaching was supreme.&nbsp; He taught by questioning, commendation and correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus Osler's pattern is carried out in teaching hospitals around the world.&nbsp; True to this form, in the early morning every day, the group--medical students, interns, residents, and the attending physician--gather round the patient's bed to discuss the patient, the disease, the exam, and the treatments.&nbsp; One student said of Osler's teaching style:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ward visits were an unusual combination of informality and dignity.&nbsp; Students and patients were quickly put at ease by Dr. Osler.&nbsp; His criticisms of students and their work were incisive and unforgettable, but never hard or unkindly; they inspired respect and affection, never fear.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A biographer said of him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Osler's approach to education was not only to produce technically competent physicians but extended to their personal lives in an effort to make reliable, caring physicians of high character and standards.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a></sup></p>
<p>There's that image of mentor and student on a path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I've stood at the bedside with many great teachers of medicine.&nbsp; I was commended by a few and corrected by many.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was deeply influenced during a family medicine rotation many years ago.&nbsp; He was quite possibly the smartest physician I have met.&nbsp; He loved to teach in those few moments between and during patient visits.&nbsp; &nbsp;When we would walk to lunch, during our brief break, he would say something like, "Mike, what should I teach you about today?&nbsp; I think I'll tell you about acid-base balance."&nbsp; He proceeded to explain more about the physiology of acid-base regulation in the body than I had learned--or at least understood--the previous year.&nbsp; And this was all on our walk to the lunch counter.&nbsp; Years later I have forgotten the information but not the impression of his concern for me or his bright teaching.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Mentor Shares a Vision<br /></strong>I have this image of mentor and student, walking a road side by side.&nbsp; The conversation continues past many landscapes, not only the classroom, but in their homes, occupations, and church callings.&nbsp; This pattern of being inspired by a mentor is oft repeated in today's media.</p>
<p>I tell my teenage sons that anyone can make a block buster movie franchise. The formula is simple: outcast boy finds out that he has special powers; he meets an old guru or mentor, who then trains the boy in an effort to defeat some great evil.&nbsp; I suppose there is an archetype here, for it is found in many, many movies and books: this is Star Wars, Percy Jackson, Merlin and Arthur, Kung Fu Panda.&nbsp; The list goes on and on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Think for a moment about Luke Skywalker or even the whole Jedi Order.&nbsp; There is always a pairing of master and learner--the padawan.&nbsp; The master's role is to teach, help the padawan gain a vision of his future and abilities, and to guide him toward that vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I should caution you about depending on Hollywood for our archetypes: they may try to convince you that there are times when we must overthrow our mentor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I want to suggest that you don't have to be a washed up wizard or Jedi knight in order to assume the role of mentor.&nbsp; You may be a classmate, a friend, a visiting teacher or home teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That sharing of a vision comes by conversation but also by example.&nbsp; Think of the times in your life when you have been deeply influenced to change.&nbsp; I would suspect that there is someone who stood there beside you, giving encouragement and pointing the way, mentoring you. &nbsp;&nbsp;In Luke 22:32 we read: "When thou are converted, strengthen thy brethren."&nbsp;<br /><br />The motivation that comes from mentor-student interaction is informed by the spirit.&nbsp; It is the medium of the conversation or teaching.&nbsp; All truth is known by the same mechanism: through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And as I learned here at BYU Idaho, there is truth in gospel learning but also truth in physics, the performing arts, and even medicine, if you pick the right research study or internet site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at another example of a mentor and how the student gained a vision, realized through influence of the Holy Ghost.As a glorified, resurrected being, Moroni came to Joseph Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There may be as many as 20 recorded visits of Moroni to Joseph as he learned line upon line.&nbsp; On his first visit, he introduced himself and gave some remarkable prophecy about Joseph Smith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>It is interesting that Moroni returns and repeats his advice and recitation of scripture three times that night and again the next day when Joseph stumbles while crossing a fence.&nbsp; It's reassuring, isn't it, that even Joseph Smith needed to have lessons reiterated a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In subsequent years Joseph had other interviews with Moroni, opportunities to learn from a spiritual mentor:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's apparent, isn't it, that in matters of spiritual growth and gaining a vision, the passage of time has a maturing influence.&nbsp; Moroni, the mentor, was there each year to give more information and advice.&nbsp; Then Joseph would spend the following months working things out through the guidance of the Spirit.&nbsp; Whether we are the student or the mentor, it's important to realize and acknowledge who the real teacher is.&nbsp; We may be brilliant in our capacity to present information.&nbsp; But the spirit "will manifest the truth of it unto you.&nbsp; And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Right now, I'm blessed to serve as the president of a stake of Zion, the Rexburg Idaho Married Student 3<sup>rd</sup>Stake.&nbsp; And I can testify to you that getting me to my current level of spiritual competence took many years of work by some wonderfully inspired mentors, by my wife, and by the influence of the spirit.&nbsp; In church callings, in particular, I have been mentored by faithful teachers and leaders.&nbsp; The goodness of men with whom I served as a counselor is a striking example in my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our stake leadership and my counselors continue to add depth to my understanding of the Gospel.&nbsp;Think of the structure of the church.&nbsp; We are a mentoring-centric kingdom.&nbsp; Young women leaders, scout leaders, missionary companionships, presidencies all exemplify the influence of inspired mentoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if any man among you be strong&zwj; in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified&zwj; in all meekness, that he may become strong also...Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was a teacher and priest in the Aaronic priesthood, I was blessed to be assigned to home teach with a wonderful high priest named Reed Squires.&nbsp; Reed was a humble and very faithful home teacher and, amazingly, made me feel like he enjoyed going with me.&nbsp; As we drove to do our visits, he would ask about what was happening in my life.&nbsp; I can't imagine that he would have been all that interested in some kid from the ward but he made me feel like a companion.&nbsp; He would ask my opinion about what to teach and how we might help people.&nbsp; And best of all was his example.&nbsp; We were assigned to visit a gentleman who really didn't want to see us on his doorstep.&nbsp; With the TV blaring and cigarette in hand, he would barely acknowledge us as we came into his home.&nbsp; But Reed would gently ask about this man's life and whether there was something we could do for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I recently attended a priesthood Preview meeting with our 11 year old son Lincoln. &nbsp;As the leaders stood to explain what receiving the priesthood and serving in the office means, I thought about this same pattern.&nbsp; He will be blessed, as his brothers Alden and Christian have been, to learn from a grand succession of mentors in the young men's organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Laura, our oldest, enters the MTC tomorrow.&nbsp; I have to admit I'm a nervous father.&nbsp; But I can testify that she will embark on a great spiritual adventure.&nbsp; She'll be mentored by mission leaders and companions who seek to enlighten her soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As the spirit testifies of the truth of God's word, amazing changes come into the life of both mentor and student.&nbsp; Alma explained how the spirit brings about change:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn7" target="_self"></a></sup>I have felt that illumination by the Spirit.&nbsp; It's what brings understanding but also inspires me to be a better person, to better follow the Savior.</p>
<p>These mentoring interactions occur on many levels.&nbsp; I realize that in the course of higher education, it's sometimes hard for a teacher to have very personal impact on each student.&nbsp; But in each life, in each classroom and dorm room, the spirit can accomplish the work of mentoring by testifying of truth more personally and touching than any human contact.</p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">A Mentoring Guide<br /></strong>As in all aspects and descriptors of his life, our Savior Jesus Christ gives the perfect example of a mentor.&nbsp; It is enlightening to examine how the Savior taught and influenced his disciples. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to recommend three methods of mentoring that Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught are evidenced by the Savior: Questioning, Commending, and Correcting.&nbsp; The Savior said, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>I've mentioned that mentoring is an on-going conversation--a sort of sharing of knowledge that occurs while walking toward some goal.&nbsp; Remember the image of mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute; along the road.&nbsp; How does the mentor gauge the level of understanding of the student without probing questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Savior used questions as a powerful means of teaching.&nbsp; Remember what he asked Peter.&nbsp; He said "Simon Peter, ... lovest thou me?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;This use of a question, not once but three times, is both a searching for Peter's understanding and a beautiful means of giving Peter a commission for action toward his fellow-men.</p>
<p>Think of some other masterful questions Jesus asked and contemplate how these questions make you feel, consider what the great mentor is trying to teach us:&nbsp;<br /><br />To the one grateful healed leper He asked "Where are the other nine?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />To the woman caught in adultery, He asked "Where are those thine accusers?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />To his disciples: "Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?" "Whom say ye I am?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />And: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a><br /><br />Students ask questions of the mentor to gain understanding.&nbsp; Mentors ask questions of the student to gain understanding as well, but it's to improve the insight of the student.&nbsp; The Savior was masterful in using questions to teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe that women have the instinctual advantage in asking questions.&nbsp; They are skilled at tuning to the frequency needed and they also understand the subtleties better than I do.&nbsp; I know that when my wife asks, "So did anything happen today?" she's not asking to look at my calendar but trying to get me to shed my insular cocoon and converse.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Commending</strong><br />Jesus also mentored by commending.&nbsp; Think of His praise of Hyrum Smith, "Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a>&nbsp;</sup>And you'll remember that the brother of Jared endured three hours involving divine correction. Yet as we read later in Ether, the Lord gave him a superlative commendation: "Never has man come before me with such exceeding faith"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Realize that commending may mean praise which I think is important in measured amounts for students but it also means to endorse a certain path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Here, in Heinrich Hoffman's painting, we see Christ entreating the rich young ruler to "sell whatsoever thou hast, and give&zwj; to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow&zwj; me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;You notice that his hands gesture toward a different path, toward these people who appear to need help, but they don't seem to command.&nbsp; Those are not the hands of a dictator wielding unrighteous dominion.&nbsp; He is entreating this potential student.&nbsp; I love how the scripture records, "Then Jesus beholding him&nbsp;<em>loved him</em>"&nbsp;<br /><br />All we know of the outcome of this student is that, "he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;It does happen that students don't follow the path exemplified by concerned mentors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Correcting</strong><br />In all my studies of mentoring, nothing strikes me as more critical to the relationship than the ability of a mentor to correct with positive outcomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Whether in my experience teaching medicine or in the course of serving in the church, I find correcting error particularly challenging.&nbsp; Correcting with abrasion, with too much indignation or inflammation, may cause the student to doubt our devotion or themselves.&nbsp; The failure to correct, however, may precede the failure of the student.&nbsp; How can we allow our friends to continue with false assumptions simply because we are too timid to cross the line of correction?&nbsp; A sign post is all that is needed to point the way to Rexburg, leaving the traveler to decide what road to travel, but a mentor will not only point the way, but will intervene when the traveler is going the wrong way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Maxwell said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By its very nature, mentoring is an exercise filled with hope. It is instructive and inspirational, for instance, for us to know that the original Twelve, once chided for being unable to wait a mere hour, will one day stand at Jesus' right hand at the day of [His] coming...<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></sup></p>
<p>I have felt the sting of correction; more often than I care to list!&nbsp; From my mentors, correction was given in an effort to help, to push me toward more knowledge or better behavior.&nbsp; Corrections that come with the flavor of humiliation or to bolster that persons sense of importance simply adds to the weight of my guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As Osler's student said, so should it be said of our corrections, "they inspired respect and affection."&nbsp;<br /><br />In matters pertaining to the administration of the priesthood, the Lord instructed that power or influence can only be maintained:...by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul&zwj; without hypocrisy, and without guile--Reproving&zwj; betimes with sharpness, when moved&zwj; upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love&zwj; toward him whom thou hast reproved.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes as students we are unaccustomed to being corrected with sharpness.&nbsp; The prevailing ideology is that everyone's effort is acceptable and that corrections must be very gentle, that praise is the only method for effecting good behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentors have done the most good for me when they cared enough to tell me I was wrong, when they reproved me with guidance and then showed forth an increase in love.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Paul taught in Hebrews, "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&nbsp; If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_14_Packer.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Correction can be difficult for both student and mentor but if we follow the pattern given to us in the scriptures, there can be a harmony of understanding and spurring of real spiritual growth.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>Mentors will come in many phases of your life.&nbsp; You will do well to respect anyone who offers a hand of fellowship by accepting their teaching by testimony, their commendation with humility, their correction with obedience.&nbsp; Remember this is a walk along a path for you and the mentor.&nbsp; For a time, you will follow behind him or her, then you will enjoy the years of walking side by side, continuing the great conversation.</p>
<p>And you will be a mentor.&nbsp; This will be an experience borne of love for your fellow man.&nbsp; You will graciously impart your knowledge and enthusiasm in a spirit of love and desire for their welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we remember the Great Mentor, even Jesus Christ, we will act as directed by the spirit.&nbsp; He sacrificed all that he might put perfection within our reach, that we all might rise and that faith will bring us home to our Loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I leave you my testimony of his love for me and you.&nbsp; We are so blessed to stand within the confines of His kingdom here on earth and bask in the light of His Gospel.&nbsp; I say this in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, today I would like to discuss the practical pursuit of building Zion specifically in your apartments and homes. According to the beautiful opening hymn, for Zion to cover all the earth, the saints must keep God's law and&nbsp;<em>live</em>&nbsp;in love and peace.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;Zion, therefore, is characterized and established by the way we live wherever we live. I pray that the Holy Ghost will attend us. I pray that my remarks may be useful and provide you with functional knowledge and personalized impressions of the practical application of key principles that shape, support, and sustain Zion.<br /><br />The great prophet Brigham Young declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The work of building up Zion is in every sense a practical work; it is not a mere theory. A theoretical religion amounts to very little real good or advantage to any person. To possess an inheritance in Zion or in Jerusalem only in theory-only in imagination-would be the same as having no inheritance at all. It is necessary to get a deed of it, to make an inheritance practical, substantial and profitable. I have Zion in my view constantly. We are not going to wait for angels, or for Enoch and his company to come and build up Zion, but we are going to build it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three extremely important interrelated messages taught by Brigham Young in this brief excerpt from one of his discourses. First, Zion cannot be established through theoretical or speculative musings. At its core, Zion typifies real striving, struggle, and strength. Second, to possess an inheritance in Zion requires a unique title deed that cannot be purchased by money or transferred from one individual to another by a mere signature. The deed required to inherit Zion is obtained through the&nbsp;<em>deeds</em>&nbsp;of righteous living. In other words, the practical, everyday work of living the basic principles of the gospel leads us to and places us in Zion. Truly, "we no longer think of Zion as&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;we are going to live; we think of it as&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we are going to live."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup>Third, Zion will not build itself, nor will anyone build it for us. We must take personal and collective ownership of the effort to establish Zion wherever we reside.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just about three months ago, one little girl resolved within herself to establish a special place where only goodness and kindness were permitted--her own little Zion. While visiting our children's grandparents' home, I observed our youngest daughter, Sophia, spend most of the morning in a small playhouse situated under the stairs. When she finally finished arranging everything just the way she wanted it, she came upstairs and began writing something on bright orange paper. After inquiring, I learned that this paper and, more importantly, its message, represented the finishing touch to the playhouse. Before entering the small opening under the stairs and posting the orange paper, little Sophie posed for a picture. When I finally examined the paper, I was amazed at what I saw. Would you like to know what it said?&nbsp;<br /><br />Rules:</p>
<p>In the simplest, yet most profound way, a six-year old girl established behavioral guidelines that would lead to peaceful and profitable interaction--her own little Zion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, there are 2,129 individual apartments and 36 additional houses in BYU-Idaho Approved Housing. These numbers provide the potential for about 2,200 little Zions within three blocks of campus. Minus the proximity to campus, the same potential exists for our married students across the roughly 3000 community apartments that house BYU-Idaho student families. Think about the apartment where you live. Think about your roommates. Think about your room-roommate. For those who are married, in case you didn't know, your room-roommate is your spouse and your roommates are any children you may have. Think about the culture of your apartment or home.&nbsp;<em>How</em>&nbsp;do you live? Consider the following questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you want to build a little Zion in your apartment, but aren't quite sure how to go about doing it. If only we could guarantee that no one would be bossy, no one would be annoying, no one would be mean or bad. Wouldn't that be great? It may be working for little Sophie in her playhouse under Grandma's stairs, but reality reminds us that the only guarantee is that roommates will be bossy and annoying at times. They may even be mean or bad. There will be miscommunication. There will be disagreements. There will be moments of offense. There may even be conflict. Remember, Zion does not exist in some ideal, theoretical realm comprised of a massive population of clone-like individuals that think, speak, and act alike. Zion is characterized and established by the way we live together in the face of reality. Zion is built through the practical, everyday work of individuals with diverse backgrounds, personalities, and interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, the question remains: What is the practical work required of you in your apartments and homes that will create and cultivate a culture of Zion? Student Living provides an answer. Allow me to clarify one very important point: Student Living at BYU-Idaho is not a program. It does not require registration or sign-ups. Student Living is a model that governs the way we live through the application of basic principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As BYU-Idaho students, you are all inherently and automatically enlisted in Student Living.&nbsp;<br /><br />Student Living represents a blueprint--a pattern of principles and practices--that you and your roommates can apply now, throughout the semester, and over the course of your entire time at BYU-Idaho that will lead to the establishment of Zion in your apartments and throughout your apartment complex.&shy; The three guiding principles of Student Living are love, shared responsibility, and mutual respect.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Principle #1: Love</strong><br />Often when we speak of love in relation to Student Living, we emphasize the need for roommates to love one another. This is certainly the desired goal, but sometimes, too simplistically, we say, "If you would just love your roommates your apartment would be a lot happier." Or, "You have to find it within yourself to love others and see them for who they are." Or, my favorite, "You don't really have to like your roommates, but you better love them!" May I offer an alternative emphasis? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the first and only chapter in the book of Fourth Nephi we read: "And it came to pass that there was no&nbsp;contention&nbsp;in the land, because of the&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;of God</em>&nbsp;which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (emphasis added).<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;As he synthesized the records, Mormon thoughtfully, purposely, and specifically attributed the societal peace the people were enjoying at that time to their love of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the next verse, Mormon continues: "And there were no&nbsp;envyings, nor&nbsp;strifes, nor&nbsp;tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings . . . nor any manner of<sup></sup>lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a&nbsp;happier&nbsp;people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;This people's love, centered in God and undoubtedly His Son, clearly had a remarkable direct effect on their interpersonal relationships.&nbsp;<br /><br />In today's language, there was no resentment, jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, discord, dissension, friction, disorder, or turmoil-all synonyms of envyings, strifes, and tumults. There was simply love one toward another and, as a result, peace and happiness. Loving roommates, then, will be a natural extension of your love for Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />"But I do love God," you might say. "He's much easier to love than my roommates!" OK.&nbsp;<em>How</em>&nbsp;do you love God? Love is certainly a feeling; but "love--the feeling--is a fruit of love the verb."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;Your love for God must be more than a declaration made in your prayers or in your journal or in a testimony you bear from the pulpit. Love requires action; it is something you do. What more can you do to love God than to love His children? Your love for God is ultimately manifested in the way you live and in the way you love those with whom you live.&nbsp;<br /><br />The following statements represent the practical manifestation of your love for God as it applies to where and with whom you live.</p>
<p>This is the practical work of love that will lead you to and place you in Zion. Because your love for God is personified and manifested in the way you love your roommates, God will bless your apartment and prosper your relationships and provide peace and happiness to you and to those with whom you live.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Principle #2 Shared Responsibility</strong><br />The second principle of Student Living is shared responsibility. Roommates share responsibility for creating an atmosphere of righteous living and obedience in the apartment. Shared responsibility gets to the very heart of our baptismal covenant to "bear one another's burdens . . . mourn with those that mourn . . . comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;Shared responsibility addresses the ever-stirring question: "Am I my brother's keeper?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;Some feel uncomfortable by this question and even believe it carries a negative connotation. Both ancient and modern prophets, however, have collectively and consistently testified of our covenant responsibility to care for, protect, and rescue our brothers and sisters.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;Perhaps a slight modification to the question may be helpful and more intuitive: "Am I my brother's brother?" or "Am I my sister's sister?" The answer to these inquiries is irrefutably and emphatically "Yes!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />How then do we apply this understanding? What exactly does shared responsibility look like in the apartment? The practical application of this principle and its companion principle of love is well demonstrated in the following video.<br /><br />&nbsp;<iframe frameborder="0" height="465" id="kaltura_player" src="https://www.kaltura.com/p/1157612/sp/115761200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/16687322/partner_id/1157612?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player&amp;entry_id=0_ntawhk6z&amp;wid=0_6f5glg06&amp;flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;" width="780"></iframe>&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, you can be your brother's keeper! You are responsible for one another. In a Zion apartment, roommates support and strengthen one another. In a Zion apartment, roommates combat the code of silence and get involved. In a Zion apartment, roommates refer for help when needed to provide additional strength and love and assistance to brothers or sisters spiritually wounded on the battlefield of life. Consider this covenant responsibility a privilege, not a burden. I know it's not always easy. It may even be uncomfortable, awkward, or risky at times. But, through your love for God and faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ, you can truly partner with your roommates to create an apartment culture in which you look out for one another, take care of one another, lift one another, and encourage one another to stay close to the Lord and honor sacred covenants. This is the practical work of shared responsibility that, with the practical work of love, will lead you to and place you in Zion. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Principle #3: Mutual Respect&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />The third principle of Student Living is mutual respect. By standard definition, mutual respect implies a sense of value, appreciation, and esteem shared between two or more people.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;The scriptures define mutual respect in the following way: "And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;This timeless and transcendent value, taught by the Savior Himself, has come to be known as the Golden Rule.&nbsp;<br /><br />"[Mutual] respect is an expression of our sense of universal brotherhood or sisterhood--a testimony of our membership in the human&nbsp;family. Acting disrespectfully suggests we do not esteem others as ourselves."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;Everyday forms of disrespect include gossip, backbiting, mocking, ridiculing, fault-finding, selfishness, indifference, and the dreaded silent treatment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mutual respect is naturally and inextricably linked to the principles of love and shared responsibility. It is ultimately personified as roommates treat each other the way they want to be treated and value one another as sons and daughters of God. In a day-to-day, hour-by-hour practical sense, mutual respect is manifested in the apartment in a variety of small, yet significant ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's explore the practical application of mutual respect through a bit of an interview. Do you reliably complete your part of the apartment clean-check? Or do you neglect your assigned tasks or leave them undone for others to complete? Do you wash or load your dishes immediately after each use? Do you pick up what you drop, put away what you get out, ask before using, return what you borrow, and take turns buying the toilet paper? Do you replace the toilet paper when you use the last square on the roll? Or do you leave the empty brown tube on the dispenser fully expecting someone else to reach into the cabinet and replace the roll before nature calls you again? Do you remove your clothing from the washer and dryer in a timely manner? When you find clothing left in the only washer available, do you rip it out and throw it in some dusty corner or hide it to teach the person a lesson? Or do you gently remove the clothing and leave it in a clean and conspicuous place? Do you leave enough hot water for roommates on Sunday mornings? In essence, do you think of others and how&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;actions will affect&nbsp;<em>them</em>?&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you address an offense or concern directly with a roommate or neighbor as the Savior taught in Matthew 18?<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;Do you genuinely listen to roommates' point of view without rolling your eyes or interrupting? Do you refrain from criticism if a roommate doesn't load the dishwasher exactly the way you would do it? Are you a "backseat driver" or an "armchair quarterback" constantly correcting and nitpicking? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Joe J. Christensen taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Don't be too critical of each other's faults. Recognize that none of us is perfect. . . . 'Ceaseless pinpricking' (as President Kimball called it), can deflate almost any [relationship]. Generally, each of us is painfully aware of our weaknesses, and we don't need frequent reminders. Few people have ever changed for the better as a result of constant criticism or nagging.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn15" target="_self"></a></sup>A few short months ago in October, my wife and I performed vicarious sealings in the Rexburg Temple. During the ceremony, the sealer paused to share an inspired thought with the assembly. He asked us to consider the beautiful sunsets that are frequently present on the horizon in the great state of Idaho. He reminded us that we never look at a sunset and regretfully sigh, "Oh, I wish there were more hues of red or stronger hues of purple in this sunset. If there were only a little more orange or not so much yellow. It's a bit off-center or not quite evenly distributed." We simply enjoy the sunset for what it is and cherish and value its distinctive beauty. Though he wasn't very explicit in stating why he shared this thought with us, we all recognized the lesson: see the good in others and accentuate the positive. People change as a result of God's love and our love and respect for them. Do you lift roommates through kindness and compliments? Do you do all you can to make them feel good about themselves? Do you overlook certain idiosyncrasies or harmless habits and accentuate the positive?</p>
<p>"[Mutual] respect is [truly] an expression of Christlike living."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a>&nbsp;</sup>Together with love and shared responsibility, the practical, everyday work of mutual respect will lead you to and place you in Zion.<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />Brothers and sisters, building Zion is a practical work characterized and established by the way we live wherever we live. Your love for God and your genuine efforts to love and respect roommates, assume responsibility for the culture in your apartment, and honor the commitments and covenants you have made while helping others do the same will lead you to and place you in Zion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Student Living--the principles and associated practices of love, shared responsibility, and mutual respect--represents a pattern for you to build little Zions in your apartments so you can build Zion in your home. And why is this so important? "Zion readies us to see the Savior come again."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_21_Dougherty.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a><br /><br />Now, finally, when you think about an apartment where Student Living really works, what do you see?<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="465" id="kaltura_player" src="https://www.kaltura.com/p/1157612/sp/115761200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/16687322/partner_id/1157612?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player&amp;entry_id=0_fh480cnh&amp;wid=0_brbkxh39&amp;flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;" width="780"></iframe>&nbsp;<br /><br />May your apartments be filled with light; may your lives be filled with light; and may you build Zion now and wherever you go in preparation for the Second Coming of the Savior.

<p>Young Men General President</p>
<p>David L. Beck was serving as a ward mission leader when he was called as the new general president of the Church's Young Men organization. &nbsp;He served previously as a stake president, high councilor, and bishop and as president of the Brazil, Rio de Janeiro North Mission.</p>
<p>Brother Beck is an executive with a manufacturing and distribution company and serves on the board of a technology college.&nbsp; He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in engineering administration from the University of Utah. &nbsp;He and his wife Robyn are the parents of four children.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Fulfillment</strong><br />My dear young friends, I am grateful to be with you this morning and appreciate you making time to attend this devotional. I pray that what I share today will prove practical and meaningful.&nbsp;I remember what it was like to sit where you now are sitting. A few years ago I was an engineering student at the University of Utah trying to plan my future--how will I make a living? whom will I marry? where will I live? I wanted a happy and fulfilling life, but the future seemed uncertain. I imagine each of you can relate to those feelings. College can be a turbulent time, and happiness and fulfillment can seem difficult to attain.&nbsp;<br /><br />The world tries to convince you that it has the answers to obtaining fulfillment in life. Last year alone, U.S. companies spent nearly $500 billion dollars advertising a variety of products and services that promise to make you happy. It has been reported that the average city-dwelling American is exposed to thousands of advertisements in a given day. Your lives are saturated with messages about how you should look, what you should wear, and who you should be. The pitch is usually that you will have greater self-esteem and more fulfillment if you have that hair or those clothes or that car. It is difficult for even the most committed disciple to be completely free from the pull of all these messages; and though not all of them are bad, certainly their promise of fulfillment is hollow.&nbsp;<br /><br />The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches just the opposite. To find yourself, the Savior taught, you must lose yourself.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; Fulfillment is found not in materialism or self-gratification but in sacrifice and service in a great cause, especially when that service stretches us or challenges us.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, raising a righteous family is challenging. For both fathers and mothers, it is a selfless commitment of time, hard work, and sacrifice unlike anything else you do. It can be exhausting physically and emotionally. In today's society, this serious work has been discounted. Many selfishly delay or avoid marriage and child bearing. Ironically, they are cheating themselves of fulfillment.&nbsp;<br /><br />My brother Gary was very committed to raising a righteous family. He didn't let his education, career, or other interests distract him from that commitment. He worked hard and sacrificed to provide for his family. After a full day's work, he proactively helped his wife care for the children. When they were little, he changed their diapers, bathed them, and put them to bed. When they grew older, he helped with their schoolwork and supported them in their activities. He loved his children. He was concerned about their welfare and development. He taught them the gospel and helped them live it. He fasted and prayed for them. He made sure that family scripture study and prayer were a daily practice. He was a great example of a true family man. Finally, after 40 years of active and successful parenting, his last child was married in the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a beautiful October morning, our family gathered in a sealing room at the Newport Beach California Temple. My father performed the sealing ordinance for Gary's daughter Andrea and her husband, Trent. After the ceremony, Gary expressed deep satisfaction and joy. He felt that raising his children and seeing them married in the temple had been his most important work on earth. Considering his single-minded effort and devotion to raising a righteous family, it was clear why he felt that way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Three months later, almost to the day, we received the shocking news that Gary had been killed in a car accident. Following his memorial service, we gathered in the living room of his home. His daughter Julie was inspired to read Gary's patriarchal blessing to us. The blessing spoke of the great work the Lord had appointed and prepared him to fulfill. It promised him that his life would be protected until it had been completed. These inspired blessings and promises given to Gary as a 19-year-old now comforted his family. We felt that he truly had fulfilled his work on earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is true fulfillment in its ultimate sense--to gain eternal life, to be with our family in the presence of Heavenly Father. It requires our very best efforts and a lifetime of hard work, sacrifice, and service. Even this, however, is not enough. We need the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>The only way that we can truly be fulfilled is in Christ.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Come unto Christ</strong><br />The Book of Mormon bears powerful witness of this truth, perhaps nowhere more dramatically than in the final chapters of Nephite history.&nbsp;<br /><br />We read that following the Savior's appearance in the Americas, both the Nephites and Lamanites were all converted to the Lord. They enjoyed over 100 years of righteousness, peace, and prosperity. During this time, Mormon wrote that families "were blessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord had made unto them."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Slowly however, some began to deny Christ and set their hearts instead on the "fine things of the world."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a>&nbsp;</sup>Wickedness and unbelief spread. Pride hardened hearts. Contention replaced peace. Disciples of Christ were despised and persecuted. Ongoing wars resulted eventually in the complete annihilation of a nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Certainly, the Book of Mormon stands as a witness of Christ and of the calamity people suffer when they leave Him to seek fulfillment elsewhere.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mormon and Moroni witnessed the final destruction of their people, understanding fully that it was the result of forsaking Christ. Is there any surprise that in the concluding chapters of the Book of Mormon, these prophet-writers focus so intently on Christ? They knew that it was now too late to save their own people but that their record would cry from the dust to our dispensation. Moroni's final exhortation is especially powerful:&nbsp;<br /><br />"...Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We come unto Christ through ordinances and covenants that anchor our heart to the Savior. When you were baptized, for example, you covenanted to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, keep His commandments, and serve Him to the end. You renew this covenant each time you partake of the sacrament.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Not surprisingly, you feel closest to Christ as you keep your covenants.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sacrifice<br /></strong>Keeping covenants is not always easy; it often requires sacrifice. But we do so willingly because of promises like this one:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command--they are accepted of me. For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ's life was fulfilled by His sacrifice, and so is ours. Those for whom the Savior sacrificed are the precious fruit of His life. He will cause us to be fruitful when we do the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the precious fruit of your life?&nbsp;<br /><br />To my wife, Robyn, and me, nothing is more precious than our children and grandchildren. There was a time when we didn't think we would have children. Following our marriage we went seven years longing to have a baby. Finally, we were able to adopt our daughter Christy, and life changed dramatically for us. Robyn left a demanding job to do something she found was much harder yet much more fulfilling--motherhood.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Christy joined our family, we decided to buy some expensive furniture that we could pass down to our posterity as heirlooms. A beautiful hardwood highchair and brass canopy crib soon adorned our home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then another miracle happened. Three months after adopting Christy, we got the great news that Robyn was expecting a baby! She gave birth to a little boy the next year. We discovered that our little boy had a tendency to be a bit more destructive with expensive furniture! One day, our son decided that it would be great fun to hang like a monkey from the slender canopy on the crib. As you might imagine, the weight of our little monkey caused the brass poles to collapse, and our heirloom crib was ruined. Later he stood on the highchair, knocking it backwards and crashing it against the buffet. Gratefully, he wasn't hurt, but the chair was ruined!&nbsp;<br /><br />So much for heirlooms! We learned quickly that material things can turn to junk in an instant. Everything we bought afterwards was the cheapest we could find, and we began to focus on spiritual things we could pass on to our posterity.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our family grew. We were blessed with two more boys. Now we are welcoming grandchildren into our family. Parenthood is not easy, but could there be more precious fruit to fulfill your life than a righteous posterity?&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of you are not parents yet, but perhaps many of you have served missions. If so, you know that missionary work really is hard work! There is rejection and disappointment. Discouragement can easily set in. However, these are small sacrifices for the privilege of helping someone come closer to Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />On my mission, I sometimes wondered why the fruit of our work wasn't more immediate. We spent hours in the hot Brazilian sun knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could. Some of those days were difficult, and to be honest, they didn't always feel particularly fulfilling. But other days were richly rewarding as I caught a glimpse of how the gospel of Jesus Christ can change lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the years after my mission, I lost touch with many of the people I had taught and baptized. Imagine my surprise one evening when our doorbell rang and there stood the son of a man I had baptized 35 years earlier in Brazil. His son was a returned missionary, sealed in the temple, and raising a righteous family. Words cannot describe the depth of fulfillment I felt that evening as he tearfully expressed thanks for bringing the gospel to his family. Since then I have embarked on a wonderful journey to reconnect with every person I baptized. What I have learned is that the precious fruit of missionary work grows even sweeter with the passing years.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can easily lose opportunities like these if we are not careful. This is one reason Moroni warned, "Deny yourselves of all ungodliness." What is ungodliness? It is anything that is contrary to the divine nature. It includes everything from the grossest sins to unrighteous words or thoughts. It includes the toxic ungodliness of pornography; it could be idleness, mediocrity, and being distracted from our important duties. Today's world is saturated with ungodliness. To be fruitful, to find true fulfillment, we must be willing to sacrifice anything in our lives this is ungodly.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Serve</strong><br />Moroni also taught, "Love God with all your might, mind and strength." The more you love God, the more you want to be pure. You love more people and you love them more deeply. You want to be fruitful. You serve with your full capacity and you work to increase that capacity-to become everything you can be and to utilize every resource you have been given. You identify and develop your spiritual gifts, and you seek additional gifts that you can use in the service of others. You seek to grow the way the boy Jesus did: "in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a>&nbsp;</sup>You pursue education, maintain physical health, enhance your social skills, and deepen your spirituality-all with the pure intent to bless others.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you love God, Church callings, home and visiting teaching, and other assignments are not burdens but opportunities to express the love you feel. As a result, opportunities to minister to family, friends, and strangers flow to you every day. When you see them, you act reflexively. And you magnify your ministry by helping others to minister.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like the Savior, you feel to say, "I will hasten my work." You understand that your work is really His work. With this understanding, you pray with real intent to know His will. You feast on His words. You seek His guidance to know the sacrifices He would have you make. You ask to know whom and how to serve. You seek to be strong in the Spirit.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>His Grace Is Sufficient for You</strong><br />Now, you may think this doesn't sound much like you right now--at least, not all the time. I'd like to speak to those who feel unworthy or unable to do what I have described.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the months and years after the First Vision, Joseph Smith faced intense opposition. He said that he frequently fell into many foolish errors and often felt condemned for his weakness and imperfections. He sought forgiveness for his sins and follies and prayed to know his standing before God. As he did, an angel appeared, called him by name, and said that he was sent from the presence of God, that his name was Moroni, and that God had a work for him to do.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />How comforting and ennobling it must have been to Joseph to know that in spite of his weaknesses, God had a work for him to do. He repented of his sins and served and sacrificed throughout the remainder of his life.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He was persecuted. He was thwarted time and again in his efforts to establish a Zion community, but he never gave up. He suffered, but he endured. In the end, he was killed for his convictions. Through his sacrifice and service he became the magnificent instrument of the Restoration. The power of God was upon him, and he was fruitful.&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the precious fruit of his life? Today, the Church he helped to establish is thriving, and millions are blessed immeasurably.&nbsp;<br /><br />We all have challenges and adversity in the journey of life. You will make mistakes and feel unworthy. Like Joseph Smith, you will wonder about your standing before God. I testify that He knows you and loves you. No matter what you have done, He has a work for you. He needs you to help Him complete the work He called the Prophet Joseph to do.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />If that feels overwhelming at times, remember the Savior's words: "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;I testify to you today that if you are connected to Christ, you can do anything He asks you to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moroni said, "Come unto Christ and be perfected in him." This is an invitation to be fulfilled in Him. Only through Christ can we become all that we are capable to become.&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Perfect,</em>&nbsp;as used in the scriptures, means "complete, whole, and fully developed. ... True followers of Christ may become perfect through his grace and atonement."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Russell M. Nelson taught that the process of development extends through and beyond this life. He said: "We need not be dismayed if our earnest efforts toward perfection now seem so arduous and endless. Perfection is pending. It can come in full only after the Resurrection and only through the Lord. It awaits all who love him and keep his commandments."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_01_28_beck.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Mutual theme for 2014 is "Come unto Christ." As we watch together now the Mutual theme video, please listen carefully to the lyrics of the song.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to be with you this afternoon on the BYU-Idaho campus. I am honored to be invited to speak to you. For seven years I served as a member of the Church Board of Education, which includes the Board of Trustees for all of the Church Educational System institutions, including BYU-Idaho. In all of our frequent meetings, which included the First Presidency and several members of the Quorum of the Twelve, the key concern was that you, the student, would secure a good education, and that you would be happy and achieve what you desire from this university.<br /><br />I know that every selection of faculty will result in a person of faith who can guide and teach you, by example, both academically and spiritually. I was in attendance when your highly esteemed president, Kim B. Clark, was inaugurated as president of BYU-Idaho in 2005. I know that the Board of Trustees supports his leadership. I was on the Board when the discussions occurred that resulted in the construction of this BYU Idaho Center. It is an honor for me to finally be in this beautiful building.&nbsp;<br /><br />In preparation for my remarks today, I have studied other presentations given at this university. Most speak of the traits and accomplishments you, the student, should acquire during your education and as you graduate. They encourage acquiring skills and training, scholarship in professional fields, wisdom, and understanding people, events, and worldly matters. They also speak of the spiritual qualities you should obtain as you attend this university, which is sponsored by living prophets. All of these subjects and themes are important and valuable to you, the student.&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear students, what I suggest you obtain as a result of your education at BYU-Idaho is a strong, bold testimony of Jesus Christ. To this end I have entitled my talk "But Whom Say Ye That I Am" as recorded in the 16th chapter of Matthew in the New Testament.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you recall from your studies of the scriptures, Christ asked the disciples this question: "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The disciples responded and said, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus responded again with the question, "But whom say ye that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I desire that you can boldly declare, with conviction, as did Peter, that Christ is the Son of the living God. I have three suggestions on how you may obtain this testimony.&nbsp;<br /><br />First: know who Jesus Christ is. In 1 Nephi, chapter 11 of the Book of Mormon, Nephi sought and was given the privilege to see in vision what his father, Lehi, had previously seen of the tree of life. The fruit (which was very delicious) of the tree represented the fulness of the gospel. The tree, although surrounded by the wickedness of the world, as noted by a large and spacious building full of people, was accessible to those who followed a strait and narrow path and who held onto a rod of iron.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the vision, Nephi beheld a virgin most beautiful and fair above all other virgins. He then saw the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The angel, who explained the vision to Nephi, twice asked Nephi this question: "Knowest thou the condescension of God?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />That, my dear fellow students, is the question I ask you. "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" For you to know who Jesus Christ is, you must know of His condescension.&nbsp;<br /><br />The dictionary defines condescension as a "voluntary descent from one's rank or dignity in relations with an inferior."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;A well-known LDS scholar said it this way:&nbsp;<br /><br />The condescension of God the Son thus consists in the fact that the Eternal One would 'descend from his throne divine,' be born in the most humble of circumstances, become among the most helpless of all creation--a human infant--and submit to the refining influences of mortal life.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Abinadi, in the Book of Mormon, said that "God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />It should help you to know, as you desire to know Jesus Christ, that He knows what you are experiencing on this earth. He knows your challenges and anxieties. He knows the temptations you face, and He knows how you can meet all of these challenges.&nbsp;<br /><br />Try to envision that it was the Father's plan that Jesus Christ come to earth for a short period of time. In John we read: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;Just imagine that Christ, the Creator of the world and this earth, where we now live, came here to live.&nbsp;<br /><br />A former General Authority has beautifully described Christ's condescension in these words:&nbsp;<br /><br />He descended to be born of a mortal woman. He descended to be baptized of man, even though He was perfect and sinless. He descended to minister to the humblest of the humble. He descended to subject Himself to the will of the Father, suffering Himself to be tempted, mocked, scourged, cast out and disowned, even though he was all powerful. He descended to be judged of the world, even though He was the judge of the world. He descended to be lifted up on the cross and slain for the sins of the world, even though no man could take away His life.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The third prophet in this dispensation, President John Taylor, speaking of Christ's condescension, said:&nbsp;<br /><br />It was further necessary that He should descend below all things, in order that He might raise others above all things; for if He could not raise Himself and be exalted through those principles brought about by the atonement, He could not raise others; He could not do for others what He could not do for Himself, and hence it was necessary for Him to descend below all things that He might be raised above all things, that by and through the same power that He obtained His exaltation, they also, through His atonement, expiation and intercession, might be raised to the same power with Him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Please remember that Jesus Christ comprehends all that you are attempting to comprehend. He knows and understands you. He loves you and desires that you return to His presence. He wants you to know Him. He confirmed all of this in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />May your understanding of the condescension of Jesus Christ help you to know who He is and increase your knowledge and testimony of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second: Jesus Christ was known to many prophets who lived on the earth before the Savior was born in the meridian of time. Today, you are attempting to obtain a testimony of Jesus Christ by reading and studying His life and teachings. Imagine obtaining a testimony before He was born.&nbsp;<br /><br />The key sources where prophets have borne testimony of Jesus Christ before He was born are the Book of Mormon and the Old Testament. These writings and testimonies are referred to as Messianic prophecies.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon abounds with Messianic prophecies. All of the prophets who lived before Jesus Christ was born knew of His coming birth, life, death, and Resurrection.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, Jacob, 600 years before the birth of Christ, saw the Redeemer as he exclaimed:&nbsp;<br /><br />My soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish. For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no God we are not, for there could have been no creation. But there is a God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Nephi testified: "We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />You are familiar with these scriptures through your studies in seminary, institute, and here on campus. However, there is another group of prophets who lived before Jesus Christ came to earth and who testified with remarkable clarity of His birth, life, death, and Resurrection. These prophets are found in the Old Testament, and you are probably less familiar with their testimony than the prophets in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of these prophets was Isaiah, who lived approximately 800 years before the birth of Jesus Christ. He saw, testified, and recorded as scripture with amazing clarity of the life of Jesus Christ. His account is so accurate; it is as if he were alive when the Savior was on the earth. I would like to read several verses of Isaiah, chapter 53. Listen carefully. Perhaps you might even briefly close your eyes (but don't fall asleep) to listen and meditate on the words of Isaiah. Let the Spirit teach you about Jesus Christ as recorded by Isaiah 800 years before Christ was born.&nbsp;<br /><br />Who hath believed our report?&nbsp; and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?&nbsp;<br /><br />For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.&nbsp;<br /><br />He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.&nbsp;<br /><br />But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&nbsp;<br /><br />All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation?&nbsp; for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.&nbsp;<br /><br />And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Think and ponder how these verses might affect you and help you to obtain a testimony of Jesus Christ. For example, you more completely understand the Atonement of Jesus Christ when you ponder Isaiah's statements:&nbsp;<br /><br />Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.&nbsp;<br /><br />But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may ponder the Crucifixion of Christ as you read: "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth."&nbsp;<br /><br />The reality of his condescension is clearer as you read: "He was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken."&nbsp;<br /><br />His death on the cross between two thieves and His burial in the sepulcher of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, a rich man, is foretold in the verse: "He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death."&nbsp;<br /><br />Each time I read these beautiful Messianic verses, I know that Jesus is the Christ. There is no other explanation. I feel the spirit of the words of Isaiah, and I prayed before I came here today that you would feel the same spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third: As you prepare yourself to boldly answer the question, "But whom say ye that I am?" you must look at yourself. How badly do you desire to have a strong and convincing testimony that Jesus is the Christ? Are you willing to pay the price in personal habits and daily experiences to earn the right to have such a testimony?&nbsp;<br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson, our beloved prophet, challenges you to obtain a testimony in the following statement:&nbsp;<br /><br />In order for us to be examples of the believers, we ourselves must believe. Our testimonies are no doubt of varying degrees. It is up to each of us to develop the faith necessary to survive spiritually and to project a light for others to see. Amidst the confusion of our age, the conflicts of conscience and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives. Among the most effective ways to gain and keep the faith we need would be to read and study the scriptures and to pray frequently and consistently.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, have you read the Book of Mormon? Have you put to the test the promise found in Moroni chapter 10, verse 4, asking your Heavenly Father with a sincere heart, with real intent and having faith in Christ whether or not that which is found in that book is truth?&nbsp;<br /><br />To gain a testimony, he suggests that you develop and increase your faith, read and study the scriptures, pray frequently and consistently, and read the Book of Mormon and put to the test the promise of Moroni.&nbsp;<br /><br />Are you doing these things? I know that as a student you are very busy with your studies, homework, and examinations. We want you to excel academically. Some of you have part-time employment to provide for your education. Others of you are married with family responsibilities. I know that you are busy. But do not be so busy in these matters that you neglect to obtain, nourish, and strengthen your testimony.&nbsp;<br /><br />Faithful church attendance and service is essential. Attend your block meetings. Partake of the sacrament each week. Serve in a church calling when called. With the nearness of the new and beautiful Rexburg Idaho Temple, participate in temple ordinances regularly and consistently.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you study spiritual matters, especially the scriptures, and participate in temple ordinances, learn how to "ponder" and "meditate" upon that which you are studying and participating.&nbsp;<br /><br />In section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read where Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon were studying and translating parts of the book of John in the New Testament. As they were doing this very intense study, the 76th section describes the process with the following phrases:&nbsp;<br /><br />We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on the sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two--&nbsp;<br /><br />By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God--&nbsp;<br /><br />And while we meditated upon these things, the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about.&nbsp;<br /><br />And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fullness.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />You see the pattern Joseph and Sidney followed; they were in the spirit and their eyes were open to understand the things of God. They meditated over the truths of the gospel. Another word like "meditate" is to "ponder" and think seriously about the things you are studying.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through this process, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon received one of the most beautiful testimonies of Jesus Christ ever recorded in scripture. We further read in section 76:&nbsp;<br /><br />And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!&nbsp;<br /><br />For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father --&nbsp;<br /><br />That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_02_04_Tingey.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I am not suggesting that you will have an experience similar to that had by Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon. As President Monson earlier said, "Our testimonies are no doubt of varying degrees."&nbsp;<br /><br />In conclusion, I have challenged you to obtain a strong and enduring testimony of Jesus Christ while you are a student at this university. I have offered three suggestions to help you.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, know that through the condescension of Jesus Christ, He came to this earth as an infant and fulfilled the mission of the Father. He knows all that you experience. He loves you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, He was known by the prophets in the Book of Mormon and in the Old Testament. They left what is known today as Messianic prophecies. Isaiah, in chapter 53, was one of the most accurate and descriptive of all the prophets in testifying of the coming of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, secure your own personal testimony by studying and pondering the scriptures, daily prayers, building faith by church attendance, moral living by keeping the commandments, and by temple worship. Knowing the Book of Mormon is true is one of your most powerful tools in obtaining a testimony of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout my life I have followed these suggestions to obtain my own testimony of Jesus Christ. I know that He lives and that He is the only Begotten of the Father. I know that He fulfilled the will of the Father as He completed His mission here on this earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear record that He loves me as He loves you. I have felt His presence many times, especially while serving in the temple. I know Jesus Christ. I have received many promptings throughout my life and, in particular my service as a General Authority, that testify that He hears my prayers and that He provides answers as needed and deserved.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Church is directed by Jesus Christ as He whispers revelation to His prophets. President Monson is truly the prophet of our day, as was Joseph Smith when the Church was restored.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have sat in the councils of the Church and bear witness that Jesus Christ is directing the affairs of the Church through revelation to His prophets. I bear testimony that He will direct the affairs of your life and of your family through personal revelation as you properly seek such direction in your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Four days ago on Valentine's Day, my wife Geri and I celebrated the birth of our oldest child, Kellen, 33 years old and now the father to five of his own with one more to come in June. Ten days from now we'll celebrate the birth of our youngest child, Jenna, who will be 18 and who is here with us today. In between, three other pregnancies resulting in five children--you do the math. Kellen, Megan, Morgan, Matt, Greg, Caitlin and Jenna--each one the part of a new generation.<br /><br />&nbsp;My children, separated by 15 years, are each part of this new generation called the millennial generation, or those born after 1980. The challenges of today are different from the challenges that other generations faced. Some would argue that the challenges that youth today face are more difficult than those who have gone before, while others would argue that they're all difficult, but simply different challenges and temptations. However, I think we can all agree that things will not get any easier. We know that we are in the latter days and with that, Satan's influence is stronger and will continue to get even stronger yet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Never before has there been a greater need for God's influence of righteousness, and for each of us to understand what God's will is for us, and for Him to be a part of our lives and to those around us.&nbsp;<br /><br />According to recent research by the Pew Research Center's Religion and Public Life Project, younger Americans, those ranging in age from 18-29, or really most all of you here today, are noticeably less religious than those who are older, or most of us here on this stage.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img border="0" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/1st image-1.png" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Among some of this research it was found that your generation, is less likely to be affiliated with any particular religion than your parents or grandparents. The numbers indicate that nearly one-third of Millennial's claim to be unaffiliated with any particular religion, the highest percentage ever in Pew Research Center polling.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<img border="0" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/2nd image.png" />&nbsp;<br /><br />If you include the entire U.S. population the number is lower at just under one-fifth, as indicated here and as you also notice, is on the rise. But again for your generation it is 32 percent.&nbsp;<br /><br />In fact the number of people who attend church infrequently, yet describe themselves as unaffiliated to any religion has been growing.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<img border="0" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/3rd image.png" />&nbsp;<br /><br />As you can see here to the left side of the vertical bar, those who fit that description has increased from 38 percent in 2007 to 49 percent in 2012. In the line below, those who are affiliated with a religion has dropped from 60 percent to 50 percent over the same period of time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Data from the General Social Surveys, which has been in existence since 1972, also found that your generation attends religious services less often than those older than yourselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img border="0" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/4th image.png" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Eighteen percent of you attend religious services weekly or nearly weekly as you can see with the little yellow dot in the lower right corner of the graph, compared to 26 percent of Baby Boomers at the same age on the far left, and nearly the same as that of Generation X, those born just before you and indicated here at 21 percent with the dark blue line. The Silent Generation, those born between 1928 and 1945 are in yellow, and the Greatest Generation, those born before 1927, are shown in red. Again all compared at the same age.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another interesting fact--this one from Gallup surveys, indicate that the percentage of, what they call "nones," in the U.S., or those of all ages not identifying with any particular religion has risen 22 percent over the past four years.&nbsp;<br /><br />But let's talk for a minute about those who are unaffiliated with religion, those who do not believe in organized religion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some opinions conclude that the reason for this change is a trend to marry later in life and that engagement in organized religion and marriage rates go hand-in-hand. Others say that today's churches, in an attempt to attract the younger generation, need to be more hip by making worship services more fun and entertaining and less formal. Many do not like the strict rules of organized religion and would prefer to go it on their own.&nbsp;<br /><br />But if we look more closely and see what the effects of not having organized religion would have been and might be, it just might change opinions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's take a look at history and see what effects not having organized religion might be. We'll begin in the Bible to see what it has to say about the church and about organized religion.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the surface, the belief that there is no need for organized religion may seem innocent enough. Being a good person is certainly within reach. I know how to treat other people, I can pray and my prayers can be answered, and I have the Light of Christ to direct me. By living the 10 commandments I know I must worship God and God only, that I should keep the Sabbath Day holy, honor my father and mother, not kill, commit adultery, or steal.&nbsp;<br /><br />But to deny the need of organized religion would be to also deny the need for the word of God, including the Bible and the 10 commandments, because the Old and New Testament have the word of God to his prophets as the leaders of&nbsp;<em>His&nbsp;</em>church during that time. In fact it is the words in the Bible that help much of mankind be good people, understand the Light of Christ and live the 10 commandments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Secondly, it is in the Bible that we find how Paul taught the Savior's church should be set up on earth, and why it was important.&nbsp;<br /><br />"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers..." And why did he give us prophets and apostles? Paul continues, "For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Til we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems obvious that from this scripture that there was a need and the Savior provided a solution to that need. He gave prophets and apostles so that we can be perfected and that&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;might do the work of the ministry, until we all come to a unity of the faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />Without the Bible mankind would quickly become a wicked and perverse nation and subject to Satan and his followers. We would quickly be lacking any moral compass because of a lack of the word of God and not knowing good from evil. And we would no longer have all that the Bible contained including how Christ's church was set up anciently, lead by the Savior himself with prophets and apostles. And most importantly, we would not have the record of the birth of the Savior Jesus Christ, His life and teachings, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and of course the knowledge of the atonement. It is necessary for us to have the Bible--it is necessary to have the Word of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />This leads us to the restoration of all things.&nbsp;<br /><br />During the time Christ lived on this earth he established his church, called apostles and prophets and instituted the sacrament, all with the approval of God, the authority of God, the priesthood of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later the Apostles and other righteous leaders were killed or left the church. This departure also meant the loss of God's priesthood authority and the Church no longer functioned as the Savior had done while alive. The ordinances of the Gospel changed and the truths taught by Christ were lost and no longer available to those who remained. Without these important and necessary components of the Church it would no longer function as God's church, and so it was. The Church was no longer on the earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Apostle Paul prophesized of this apostasy:&nbsp;<br /><br />Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let&nbsp;no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />To deny the need for organized religion is to deny the need for the restoring of all things, including the Church of God as it was anciently organized. It would be the belief that living in this time of apostasy without any direction from God was sufficient. And very importantly, there would be no need for the covenants and ordinances that existed during the time of the Savior, assuming that they would somehow magically reemerge again--or not. God does not work in this manner. He is a God of order and there was a need for a restoration of all things. The prophet Peter prophesized of this need:&nbsp;<br /><br />Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so this need was established. That, we, according to Paul:&nbsp;<br /><br />. . .henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so to say that there is no need for organized religion would result in the loss of God's word; the Bible, and as prophets prophesized in the Bible, no need for a restoration of these important truths ever again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Enter Joseph Smith Jr<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;For one thousand seven hundred and fifty years man lived in the dark ages, absent of God's authority held by Jesus Christ and His 12 apostles. The First Vision in April of 1820 marked the beginning of the return of this authority. This young man of 14, struggling to understand God's will needed help. In his own words, "it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong<em>.</em>"&nbsp;<br /><br />And so he asked himself the question that each serious investigator of truth would ask, "What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith was later lead to a hill where he found gold plates, and with the power of God he was able to translate and produce a second witness of Jesus Christ--the Book of Mormon.&nbsp;<br /><br />And so began the restoration of all things. And with that restoration a need to perform God's work on earth as it was while the Savior was here--with Gods guidance, His approval, His authority.&nbsp;<br /><br />To deny the need for organized religion would then be to deny the need of this power and authority--the priesthood of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />And so on the banks of the Susquehanna River early in the summer of 1829, from the hands of three of Christ's apostles--Peter, James, and John--the power and authority of God given to man to act in His name returned to the earth again.&nbsp;<br /><br />One year later, in Fayette, New York, at the home of Peter Whitmer, a small group of Saints met and the Church of Jesus Christ was once again organized on the earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />And with the organization of His church once again with Priesthood authority, he spoke once again to His prophet and declared:&nbsp;<br /><br />Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion. And furthermore;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Organize yourselves, prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The loss of God's authority--the Bible containing the word of God, and later the Book of Mormon as a second testimony of Jesus Christ. The authority of God being restored to the earth followed by the organization again of His church.&nbsp; And yet there was still a need to reinstitute the covenants and ordinances of God's church as they existed at the time of Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Without organized religion and the authority to act in God's name, we would be living without the ordinances of the Gospel, including the power of the endowment and the power to seal families together forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later God gave the ordinances and covenants of the temple to the prophet Joseph Smith, and with the power of the Priesthood he gave it to others.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd like to play for you now, something that when I heard it several years ago strengthened my testimony of Joseph Smith, the reality of the Priesthood, and the need for the ordinances and covenants of the Church. On March 19, 1897, just 18 days following his 90<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday, President Wilford Woodruff recorded his testimony into what he calls a "talking machine."&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm going to play a portion of this recording, and if you haven't heard it, I think you'll find it pretty remarkable. As you listen, ponder in particular the use of the priesthood power by the Prophet Joseph Smith and the resulting endowment bestowed upon the head of Wilford Woodruff and others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I bear my testimony that in the early spring of 1844, in Nauvoo, the prophet Joseph Smith called the Twelve Apostles together and he delivered unto them the ordinances of the Church and kingdom of God; and all the keys and powers that God had bestowed upon him, he sealed upon our heads, and he told us that we must round up our shoulders and bear off his kingdom, or we would be damned.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am the only man now living in the flesh who heard that testimony from his mouth, and I know that was true by the power of God manifest to him. At that meeting he stood on his feet for about three hours and taught us the things of the kingdom. His face was as clear as amber, and he was covered with a power that I had never seen in any man in the flesh before.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was the author of the endowments as received by the Latter-day Saints. I received my own endowments under his hands and direction and I know they are true principles.&nbsp;<br /><br />I not only received my own endowments under his hands, but I bear my testimony that Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards, George A. Smith, John Taylor and other brethren received their endowments under the hands and direction of the Prophet Joseph<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that three months and one day from the time that this momentous meeting took place in Nauvoo, the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were martyred. This meeting, called the Last Charge, was also the last meeting the Prophet had with the 12 before they left for missionary work in the East, and of course the last one before his death.&nbsp;<br /><br />We&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;a church built on true principles. For those who believe there is no need for organized religion we declare two important truths.&nbsp;<br /><br />1) Individually, mankind can and does receive revelation and inspiration for matters of importance for him or herself.&nbsp;<br /><br />2) Collectively, mankind receives revelation and inspiration through a prophet of God for matters of importance necessary for the organization and needed purposes of His church.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine the circumstances from many years ago of Moses had there not been this second truth, the need for revelation from God through His organized way.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Moses and Israelites</strong><br />Moses and the Israelites had lived in Egypt for approximately 400 years during which time a Pharaoh had come to power that opposed the Israelites, and then enslaved them. Moses issued a request to the Pharaoh to set He and the Israelites free, but was denied. He asked to let them go into the desert to worship, but was denied and instead the Pharaoh gave the Israelites added difficulties making their daily labors of making bricks even more difficult. The Lord again asked Moses to request freedom for the Israelites but because of Moses' feeling of inadequacy he had to be reminded of who he was--"I have made thee a God," or as indicated in the Joseph Smith translation, "I have made thee a prophet."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so with the priesthood authority, Aaron, who had been made the spokesman for Moses, performed the first of many miracles to convince the Pharaoh to let them have their freedom by casting down his rod and making it become a serpent. That was followed by 10 plagues including the river turning to blood, cattle dying, of boils, of hail and fire, darkness, and the killing of all of the firstborn in the land. And in the many attempts of the Pharaoh's magicians to imitate the miracles and plagues, they failed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally the Pharaoh was willing to let Moses and the Israelites go and Moses again, by the authority of the Priesthood, performed this final miracle to free the Israelites by parting the Red Sea and allowing them to depart into the Promised Land.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine the circumstances for Moses and the Israelites had not the authority of God been manifest through His Priesthood and through His prophet. There is a need, a necessity for God's power of this second truth. The Israelites needed a prophet, they needed someone to help them collectively, and the Lord delivered.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Israelites needed a prophet to be delivered. They could not have done it on their own. They needed this additional communication from God to His prophet . . . this second important truth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Oaks speaks of these two truths, first receiving our own personal revelation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the personal line we pray directly to our Heavenly Father, and He answers us by the channels He has established, without any mortal intermediary. We pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, and He answers us through His Holy Spirit and in other ways.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second truth allows us to have the knowledge necessary for us to pass through the gate to return back to our Father in Heaven. This knowledge is the commandments, covenants and ordinances given to us by God to bless us and strengthen us while on this earth, and to allow us to pass through this gate. Without them the gate will be closed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of this second truth, Elder Oaks says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some members or former members of our church fail to recognize the importance of the priesthood line. They underestimate the importance of the Church and its leaders and its programs. Relying entirely on the personal line, they go their own way, purporting to define doctrine and to direct competing organizations contrary to the teachings of prophet-leaders. In this they mirror the modern hostility to what is disparagingly called "organized religion." Those who reject the need for organized religion reject the work of the Master, who established His Church and its officers in the meridian of time and who reestablished them in modern times.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>From these two truths we have available to each of us all that we need to know and do to return to our Father in Heaven. Simply being good, and doing good, is not enough.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most important things that has returned to us in the latter days is the re-instituting of the sacrament. If there were no organized religion, we would not be able to participate in this important ordinance every week.&nbsp;<br /><br />While serving as a bishop here on campus, I met with students who were struggling with sin and transgression and tried to help them begin the repentance process, which in some cases meant taking away, for a time, the privilege of this sacred ordinance. To have this sacred opportunity taken away was important to them and difficult for them to endure. But over time, as they met the requirements to be made whole again in the eyes of their Father in Heaven, and were finally able to partake of the sacrament, the hurt and pain was replaced with joy and happiness. I cannot imagine not having this opportunity each week to rededicate myself to following God. Without organized religion, without the Gospel of Jesus Christ, this would not be possible. We cannot do it on our own.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having the Gospel and its teachings on the earth allows those teachings to spread to others and make changes in people's lives. It moves the focus of those who do not believe in organized religion from themselves, to others. It removes selfish acts and replaces them with selfless acts.&nbsp;<br /><br />The restoration of the Gospel has indeed affected every corner of the earth. Even for those who live in the far reaches of earth, far away from any branch, ward, or stake. Far away from any members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, many who have never heard of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--they have been affected in a positive way by the existence of the restoration of the church and its priesthood on the earth once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Faith</strong><br />When all is said and done brothers and sisters--faith must, and will always be a component in our understanding of many doctrines of the gospel.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma instructs us to experiment upon his words, and then exercise even a particle of faith and then finally if you can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, that ye can give place for a portion of his words.&nbsp;<br /><br />We may already be familiar with the topics that I have discussed today--the apostasy, the restoration, priesthood, the organization of the Church, the power to seal families, and finally faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />But sometimes it may be necessary to be reminded of what we already know. My own testimony is a good example of this. Just over 38 years in an apartment on Kentucky Ave. in Evansville, Indiana, I learned something that I already knew.&nbsp;<br /><br />I grew up in a home with good, honest, loving, and hard working parents. I never doubted how much they loved me and my three sisters. However the church was not an important component of our lives. I attended on my own almost every Sunday, but through a lot of hard work and practice, I got&nbsp;<em>pretty</em>&nbsp;good at finding ways on occasion to not attend. But I always wanted to serve a mission. I had cousins who served in Iowa, Brazil, and France, but still I wasn't as ready to serve a mission as I should have been and my testimony wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be, or so I thought. And so feeling a need to know the truth, and after praying and fasting in an attempt to get an answer, I finished my prayers at my bedside that night in Evansville, and the answer came in a very clear and concise way. The words were simply, "You have always known the church is true." And then my own realization that maybe I had wasted time questioning, and that it was time to go and do the work.&nbsp;<br /><br />I knew what I knew, but I didn't know how to know it. Thankfully I turned to God who reminded me of what I already knew.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Holland tells us to, "hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And from President Uchtdorf some of the best and simplest advice and counsel we might ever receive regarding this subject, and many like them. "First doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith."&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Spring of 1842, John Wentworth, the editor of the Chicago Democrat newspaper asked the Prophet Joseph Smith to send to him a synopsis of the church, and of its rise, persecution, and faith of the Latter-day Saints. The subsequent document of several pages included 13 statements of our beliefs. Although Wentworth never published any of the letter in his newspaper it did appear in March of that same year in the church's newspaper,&nbsp;<em>Times and Seasons</em>. Those statements of belief, now called the Articles of Faith support the need for organized religion that we have discussed today. And I quote in reverse order:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6 We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.&nbsp;<br /><br />5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.&nbsp;<br /><br />4 We believe that the first principle of the Gospel is, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ...</p>
<p>We must exercise our faith in a way that in many cases most of us have never done before. We must indeed hold fast to what wealready know, and additional knowledge&nbsp;<em>will&nbsp;</em>come.&nbsp;<br /><br />And while the number of young adults unaffiliated with any religion continues to climb, there is also hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />Again from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Only 11 percent of those who abandon their childhood Christian faith, say they had a very strong faith as a child and came from a home where a vibrant faith was taught and practiced. Just 11 percent.&nbsp;<br /><br />An individual's childhood is greatly influenced when religion is in their lives. When society invests in a child religiously during their younger years, it makes a difference. They are then much more likely to be influenced for and in favor of religion when they are adults. We have a responsibility to raise children in religious homes and when we do, it is more likely that religion will be important to them as they grow older.<br /><br />And so in conclusion, to have no organized religion would be our earthly existence without access to His word and the life and teachings of the Savior contained in the Holy Bible and His appearance to the Nephites living on this continent. Likely? I don't' think so. With the crucifixion of the Savior and subsequent death of the apostles and the loss of the authority of God, would God have left us alone? I don't think so. And so with the restoring of His authority again on the earth, would God have set up His church differently than how it was while he was on this earth? I don't think so.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Church of Jesus Christ has a response to those who feel there is no need for organized religion--for those who are leaving their religion. God has reestablished that which was once lost. From the words of the Living Christ, the testimony of the apostles, we read:&nbsp;<br /><br />We declare in words of solemnity that His priesthood and His Church have been restored upon the earth-"built upon the foundation of . . . apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I add my testimony. God does live and He loves us. There is a purpose for our being here. We have a living prophet once again, he speaks with God for matters of importance to members of His church, and God speaks to him. We are not alone. In our brightest days and in our darkest moments, there is and always will be a plan, an organization, a way back--a church of God. There will always be the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>My fellow students: I have felt impressed to speak to you about the significance of our belief in God.&nbsp; I do so because we live in a world where many deny the existence of God or the significance of His commandments.&nbsp; I hope what I say will help you be more effective in your duty to witness of God and to act for truth and righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I.</p>
<p>I begin with the first three of our Articles of Faith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of theGospel" (<em>A of F</em>&nbsp;1:1-3).</p>
<p>A great Book of Mormon prophet taught these same truths:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you" (Mosiah 4:9-10).</p>
<p>In contrast, today many deny or doubt the existence of a God, and insist that all rules of behavior are man-made and can be accepted or rejected at will.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why do I speak of such basic truths as the existence of God and the reality of the absolutes of right and wrong that govern our behavior?&nbsp; Sometimes the most needed things we can teach are things we tend to take for granted.&nbsp; We can neglect simple basic truths because we assume they are understood by all, but they are not.&nbsp; We must stress the fundamental truths on which our beliefs are based.&nbsp; Ultimately, these include the existence of God and the eternal reality of the truths and the right and wrong defined by His teachings and His commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">II.</p>
<p>The denial of God or the downplaying of His role in human affairs, which began in the Renaissance, has become pervasive today.&nbsp; The glorifying of human reasoning has had good effects and bad.&nbsp; The work of science has made innumerable improvements in our lives, but the rejection of divine authority as the ultimate basis of right and wrong by those who have substituted science for God has many religious people asking this question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[W]hy [is] the will of any of the brilliant philosophers of the liberal tradition, or, for that matter, the will of the Supreme Court of the United States . . . more relevant to moral decisions than the will of God"?<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Those who have used human reasoning to supersede divine influence in their lives have diminished themselves and cheapened civilization in the process.&nbsp;<br />I am grateful to know that there are two methods of gaining knowledge--the scientific method and the spiritual method, which begins with faith in God and relies on scriptures, inspired teaching, and personal revelation.&nbsp; There is no ultimate conflict between knowledge gained by these different methods because God our Omnipotent Eternal Father knows all truth and beckons us to learn by them both.&nbsp;<br /><br />Prophecies of the last days foretell great opposition to inspired truth and action.&nbsp; Some of these prophecies concern the anti-Christ and others speak of the Great and Abominable Church.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-Christ</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Apostle John uses the term&nbsp;<em>anti-Christ</em>&nbsp;to describe one who "denieth the Father and the Son" (1 John 2:22).&nbsp; Today, those who deny the existence of God are called Atheists.&nbsp; Some of these ridicule the faith of those who believe in what cannot be proven, even as they aggressively deny a godly existence they cannot disprove.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are prepared for such denials of God by the Book of Mormon's account of a man named Korihor.&nbsp; In terms reminiscent of the most atheistic writings of our day, Korihor, twice called an "Anti-Christ" (Alma 30:6, 12), taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins.&nbsp; But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so" (Alma 30:15-16).</p>
<p>Korihor also declared "that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men" (vs. 17).&nbsp; His description of the consequence of his rejection of the idea of sin and a savior is strikingly similar to the belief of many in our time:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[E]very man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and&nbsp;<em>whatsoever a man did was no crime</em>" (Alma 30:17; emphasis added).</p>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral Relativism</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Today we call Korihor's philosophy moral relativism.&nbsp; Two observers describe that philosophy as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[W]hen it comes to moral issues there are no universally objective right or wrong answers, no inappropriate or appropriate judgments, and no reasonable or rational ways by which to make moral distinctions that apply in every time, in every place, and to every person."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>This is the belief applied by many in the popular media and in current peer pressure.&nbsp; "Break free of the old rules.&nbsp; Do what feels good to you.&nbsp; There is no accountability beyond what man's laws or public disapproval impose on those who are caught."&nbsp; Behind such ideas is the assumption that there is no God or, if there is, He has given no commandments that apply to us today.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secular Humanism</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The rejection of an unprovable God and the denial of right and wrong is most influential in the world of higher education.&nbsp; Secular humanism, a branch of humanism probably so-labeled because of its strong alignment with secularism, is deliberately or inadvertently embodied in the teachings of faculty members in many colleges and universities.&nbsp;<br /><br />For religious people, the objectionable element in the various humanist manifestos is their rejection of the existence of God and their denial of the moral absolutes rooted in His commandments.&nbsp; Thus, the 1973 Humanist Manifesto rejected "traditional moral codes" and "traditional dogmatic or authoritarian religions that place revelation, God, ritual, or creed above human needs and experience."&nbsp; It further declared, "We can discover no divine purpose . . . for the human species . . . [H]umans are responsible for what we are or will become.&nbsp; No deity will save us; we must save ourselves."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, adherents of humanism, called humanists, have had many positive effects.&nbsp; For example, they have been supportive of democracy, human rights, education, and material progress.&nbsp; So long as these advancements do not exclude believers, our issue with humanists is their rejection of divine authority and values.&nbsp; As BYU philosophy professor Chauncey Riddle has written,"Humanism makes a man to be god, the supreme being, and the educated human mind becomes the arbiter of all that is true, good and beautiful."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Riddle also reminds us that humanism "enjoys good press in the world today because most of the writers, publishers, scholars and media people are of this persuasion."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; Thus, my wife Kristen heard a recent interview in which a prominent figure in a major U.S. university proclaimed that he was a humanist.&nbsp; That was not surprising, except for the fact that he was his university's&nbsp;<em>chaplain</em>.&nbsp; Whatever&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;beliefs, it is a regrettable fact that many of today's Christian&nbsp;<em>ministers</em>&nbsp;cannot truthfully affirm their belief in God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many who deny or doubt the existence of God would probably disclaim the philosophy of moral relativism.&nbsp; They would see themselves as having some external standards of right and wrong, though absolute standards not based on belief in God are difficult to explain.&nbsp; Secular humanists, who formally reject "traditional religious morality" and declare their reliance on "the tests of scientific evidence,"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;seem to fulfill a Book of Mormon prophecy of those who "live without God in the world" (Mosiah 27:31).&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Great and Abominable Church and Other "Churches"</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Book of Mormon prophecies describe the "great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil" (1 Nephi 14:17).&nbsp; This "church" is prophesied to have "dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people" (1 Nephi 14:11).&nbsp; Called "most abominable above all other churches," this church is also said to act "for the praise of the world" to bring the saints of God "down into captivity" (1 Nephi 13:5, 9).&nbsp; Since no religious denomination--Christian or non-Christian--has ever had "dominion" over all nations of the earth or the potential to bring all the saints of God down into "captivity," this great and abominable church must be something far more pervasive and widespread than a single "church" as we understand that term today.&nbsp; It must be any philosophy or organization that opposes belief in God.&nbsp; And the "captivity" into which this "church" seeks to bring the saints will not be so much physical confinement as the captivity of false ideas.&nbsp;<br /><br />In modern usage and in many scriptural passages the word&nbsp;<em>church&nbsp;</em>usually identifies (1) a house of worship or (2) a particular Christian denomination, including the true church of God.&nbsp; But if we apply either of those meanings to the scriptures describing the "great and abominable church of all the earth" (1 Nephi 14:17), we miss the intended meaning.&nbsp; For example, Nephi was told by revelation that there were only "two churches" (1 Nephi 14:10), "the church of the Lamb of God" and "the church of the devil" (1 Nephi 14:17; also see 1 Nephi 13:4-6).&nbsp; This description suggests the contrast between those who believe in God and seek to serve Him according to their best understanding and those who reject the existence of God (see 1 Nephi 14:10).&nbsp;<br /><br />Other teachings in the Book of Mormon also use the word&nbsp;<em>church&nbsp;</em>to signify belief or non-belief in God.&nbsp; The final chapters of Second Nephi prophesy that in the last days the Gentiles will build up "many churches" that will "put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain" (2 Nephi 26:20).&nbsp; They tell of "churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord" (2 Nephi 28:3), which will "teach with their learning" and "deny the power of God" (2 Nephi 28:4-5).&nbsp; They will "say unto the people:&nbsp; Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept, for behold there is no God today" (2 Nephi 28:5).&nbsp; In the Savior's ministry among the Nephites, He warned against a "church" that "be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil" (3 Nephi 27:11).&nbsp; These warnings are not limited to religious organizations.&nbsp; In the circumstances of our day they include a multitude of secular philosophies and activities.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lehi and Nephi had a vision of this.&nbsp; Those who partook of the fruit of the tree of life were looked upon with scorn and mocked by those who had entered a nearby "great and spacious building" (1 Nephi 8:26-33).&nbsp; This building was "the vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men" (1 Nephi 12:18), its occupants were "the multitude" of the earth, and together they represented "the world and the wisdom thereof" (1 Nephi 11:35).&nbsp; Many people who believe in God experience such scorn and mocking from worldly teachings and from the denial of God in many organizations, including educational institutions and media.&nbsp;<br /><br />III.I have spoken of prophetic challenges faced by the diminishing numbers of God-fearing people who share our belief in God and the right and wrong that exist because of His commandments.&nbsp; This only repeats what existed at the time of the Savior.&nbsp; The Apostle John wrote that the Son of God, who made the world, "was in the world, . . . and the world knew him not.&nbsp; He came unto his own, and his own received him not" (John 1:10-11).&nbsp; So it is today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even as we are "troubled on every side," we are "not in despair" (2 Corinthians 4:8).&nbsp; We know that our spiritual growth requires "an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). &nbsp;We also know that the Lord "seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith" (Mosiah 23:21).&nbsp; But the scriptures also teach that He will deliver those who put their trust in Him (e.g., 1 Samuel 17:37, 45-46; Psalms 34:22; Proverbs 3:5-6; Alma 23:22).&nbsp;<br /><br />Believers need to be witnesses of God.&nbsp; I will now suggest three kinds of things we can do in response to current conditions, beginning with what is easiest.&nbsp; All of these respond to a great Book of Mormon teaching that we should "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9).&nbsp; My suggestions also try to fit within the teaching that our good works should be "done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27).&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Prayers and Greetings</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />We are taught to "believe in Christ, and deny him not" (2 Nephi 25:29), to "look unto [Christ] in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;C 6:36), and to "talk of Christ," "rejoice in Christ," and "preach of Christ" (2 Nephi 25:26).&nbsp; Two ways we can do this are in our private prayers and in our personal greetings.&nbsp;<br /><br />In our private personal and family prayers we should ask God to help us and our neighbors and leaders recognize God our Creator and the right and wrong established by His commandments.&nbsp; We should do this for the good of His children everywhere.&nbsp;<br /><br />We should also assert ourselves against the current trend to refrain from religious references even in private communications.&nbsp; In recent years the inclusion of religious symbols and reverent words in Christmas greetings and sympathy cards have almost disappeared.&nbsp; When we make choices on these kinds of communications, we should not participate in erasing sacred reminders from our personal communications.&nbsp; As believers, we have a duty to preserve the name and influence of God and Christ in our conversations, our lives, and our culture.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publicly Recognize the Blessings of God</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />A second thing believers can do to stand as witnesses of God is to support public recognition of the blessings of God.&nbsp; This seeks to counter the diminishing mention of religious faith and references to God and His blessings in our public discourse.&nbsp; Contrast current public documents and the current rhetoric of government leaders with the similar documents and words of leaders in the first two centuries of our nation.&nbsp; In that contrast you will have evidence of deliberate efforts to edit out references to God and the influence of religion in our nation's founding and preservation.&nbsp;<br /><br />What can we do about this?&nbsp; First, we can set the right example in our family and Church teachings by acknowledging the blessings of the Lord in the establishment of this nation.&nbsp; To do this "in wisdom and order" we should not seem to deny that this nation includes and is blessed by citizens of Jewish, Muslim, Atheist, and other non-Christian persuasions.&nbsp; But we should speak truthfully of the fact that this nation was founded by persons and leaders who were predominantly Christians and who embodied the principles of their faith in the constitution, laws, and culture of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our friend, John A. Howard, esteemed educator and thinker, explains why this is appropriate.&nbsp; His book,&nbsp;<em>Christianity:&nbsp; Lifeblood of America's Free Society&nbsp;</em>(1920-1945), describes the religious commitments of the heroic founders of this nation.&nbsp; He states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is because a large majority of Americans during the next century and a half tried to lead a life according to the principles of Christianity, and expected others to do the same, that America succeeded so fully in establishing and maintaining a self- governing free society, juster, kinder and more lawful than any other.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>A recent essay by our friend and highly honored teacher and thinker, Clayton Christensen, insists that religion is the foundation of both democracy and prosperity.&nbsp; He reminds us that democracy and capitalism both depend on large-scale obedience to the unenforceable, and that this prerequisite is dependent upon religions that teach such fundamentals as "the equality of people, the importance of respecting others' property, and personal honesty and integrity."&nbsp; Secularism, which aspires to displace theistic religion in our country, has no power or program to provide what Christensen calls "the requisite foundation of extensive obedience to the unenforceable."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We should also contend for the inclusion in textbooks and teaching in school settings of accurate accounts of great historical documents that recognize and invoke the blessings of God in the founding and preservation of this nation.&nbsp; I refer to such as George Washington's farewell letter to the thirteen colonies when he retired as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army.&nbsp; He ended with a prayer to "Almighty God . . . that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy Holy protection," and concluded, "Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; Benjamin Franklin's stirring call for prayer at the Constitutional Convention is well known.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; Lincoln invoked the blessings of God in many of his formal communications, including the Emancipation Proclamation and his great Second Inaugural Address.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; Such acknowledgements and pleas are part of our history and should not be omitted from our memories or our culture.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contend for the Free Exercise of Religion</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />My third suggestion of what we can do to be better witnesses of God is to contend for the free exercise of religion.&nbsp; This is more difficult because it requires cooperative action by believers of various faiths.&nbsp; We should press officials in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of governments to honor the constitutionally guaranteed free&nbsp;<em>exercise&nbsp;</em>of religion.&nbsp; I am one of many in our Church who have spoken on this subject.&nbsp; Here I will emphasize only two examples of current concern.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first involves public prayer.&nbsp; Prayer occurs when anyone addresses the Divine Being, whatever their concept of God and how ever they choose to address Him.&nbsp; Regardless of the content of a prayer, which will vary according to the belief of the one who prays, when a prayer is offered in a public setting it is important as an affirmation or&nbsp;<em>symbol&nbsp;</em>of a group's common dependence upon and reverence for God.&nbsp; This is the nature of the prayers offered at the beginning of legislative assemblies or council meetings and in oaths administered to precede court testimony or official installations.&nbsp;<br /><br />This symbol of prayer has been under legal attack for over 50 years, first in public school classrooms, where prayers were outlawed fifty years ago, and now in college graduations, city council meetings, and other public settings.&nbsp; Whatever the designated pray-er's concept of God and whatever his or her religious persuasion or language of prayer, I hope the citizens of this nation can continue to witness their belief in God by the symbol of prayer, wisely and tolerantly administered.&nbsp; That is worth contending for.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, we should be alert to oppose the potential significance of the fact that some government officials and public policy advocates are describing the First Amendment guarantee of the "free&nbsp;<em>exercise"&nbsp;</em>of religion as merely "freedom of worship."&nbsp; But, the guarantee of "free exercise" protects the right to come out of our private settings, including churches, synagogues and mosques, to&nbsp;<em>act&nbsp;</em>upon our beliefs, subject only to the legitimate government powers necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare.&nbsp; Free exercise surely protects religious citizens in acting upon their beliefs in public policy debates and in votes cast as citizens or as law-makers.&nbsp;<br /><br />We should also use our political influence to resist current moves to banish from legislative and judicial lawmaking all actions based on religious convictions and motivations.&nbsp; A dangerous recent example of this was the opinion of the single federal district judge who invalidated the California Proposition 8 constitutional amendment.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; The precedent of his decision on the inappropriateness of presumed religious or moral motivations as a basis for law-making was used by the lawyers who persuaded another federal district judge to invalidate the Utah constitutional provision and laws affirming the traditional limitation on marriages to one man and one woman.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; Then, when an eminent lawyer was hired to take the appeal, he was criticized by the Human Rights Campaign for having religious motivations for his decision to defend traditional marriage.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; Where will this illogical attack on religious motivations end?&nbsp;<br /><br />As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said in his powerful address to a nationwide audience of Christian leaders, we Mormons are "eager to join hands . . . to guarantee the freedom of religion that will allow all of us to speak out [and I would add to&nbsp;<em>act</em>&nbsp;out] on matters of Christian conscience regarding the social issues of our time."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp; We should all agree with the Christian writer he quoted:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[A]ll of our nation's religious citizens need to develop a respect for other religious people and their beliefs.&nbsp; We need not accept their beliefs, but we can respect the people and realize that we have more in common with each other than we ever will with the secularizers of this country.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>We need to support the coalitions of religious leaders and God-fearing people who are coming together to defend our nation's traditional culture of belief in God and the acknowledgement of His blessings.&nbsp; As Clayton Christensen's impressive essay reminds us, religion is essential to our nation's democracy and prosperity.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />IV.In conclusion, I say to my fellow Latter-day Saints--and I suggest to all believers everywhere--that we have a solemn religious duty to be witnesses of God.&nbsp; We must affirm our religious faiths, unite to insist upon our constitutional right to the free exercise of our religions, and honor their vital roles in establishing and preserving and prospering this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remind my fellow Christians of the solemn teaching of the Apostle John:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God:&nbsp; and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world (1 John 4:3).</p>
<p>The consequence of our failing to speak out as witnesses of God are evident in our Savior's teaching about the salt that has "lost&nbsp;its savour."&nbsp; Mixed with other substances--just as we can be diluted by the values of the world--it loses its unique influence on&nbsp;the mixture of the mass.&nbsp; As the Savior taught, it is "thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot ofmen" (Matthew 5:13).&nbsp;<br /><br />My fellow students, we are the "salt of the earth."&nbsp; We must retain our savour by living our religion and by asserting ourselves as witnesses of God.&nbsp; When we do so, we associate ourselves with those who will enjoy the ultimate victory of truth and righteousness, when "every knee shall bow . . . and every tongue shall confess to God" (Romans 14:11) and the Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship and whose servants we are.&nbsp; I testify of them and invoke their blessings on all who witness of them, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I would like you to take a minute and look around. Really, look around you. Have you ever sat here in this space and just marveled at the people around you? The size of the BYUI center itself is noteworthy, to say the least, but I marvel at the people. Since the day Elder Eyring came to dedicate this building, and I was sitting right back there with an incredible panorama of all the people (it was just a little more full that day), I have not been able to look around this space and not be deeply moved by the potential power to do good in the world. The impact that all of you will have on the world is literally awe-inspiring.<br /><br />As I have thought about the impact you will have, three of Christ's parables or analogies have come to my mind. These three analogies all seem to speak to the same topic, but have very interesting and insightful variations between them. I have been interacting with students here at BYU-Idaho for over five years and have become more and more convinced of the applicability of these analogies to you specifically. I would like to talk with you about Christ's parables of salt, light and leaven.Let me start with salt.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Salt of the Earth</strong><br />In Matthew 5: 13, Christ tells his gathered disciples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye are the&nbsp;salt&nbsp;of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
<p>The Lord needs us, his disciples, to be the salt of the earth. But what does he mean by this? What really is he asking of us? I think the second part of his statement helps us understand better what it is he needs. He refers to the salt losing its savor or its flavor or losing its usefulness. When salt loses its flavor, it is no longer distinguishable from other minerals. It has lost its distinctiveness and becomes similar to the other elements it is surrounded by. When this happens it can no longer be used to impart flavor to other food items and no one wants it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So it is with us. When we allow ourselves to lose our distinctive flavor, the Lord can no longer use us to attract his children to his gospel. When we become indistinguishable from the world that surrounds us, we become less effective instruments in the Lord's hands. This happens when we look the same, dress the same, speak the same, act the same, think the same, and entertain ourselves the same as the rest of the world; we have lost our flavor and the Lord cannot effectively use us for his purposes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales said, "As Latter-day Saints we need not look like the world. We need not entertain like the world. Our personal habits should be different. Our recreation should be different."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As the world moves further and further away from the standards the Lord has set, we have the opportunity to hold our own course, to set ourselves apart, to be different. The Lord needs us to be different so others can sense or "savor" that difference and desire to follow.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Light of the World</strong><br />Just after directing his disciples to be the salt of the earth, Christ used a different analogy and directs them to be the light of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Matthew 5:14-16 He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye are the&nbsp;light&nbsp;of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Neither do men light a&nbsp;candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p>Here Christ speaks of two different effects this light has. He speaks of a city on a hill; a city that can be seen at a distance. A landmark that people can use to find their way. Something that draws people to itself. If any of you have been camping you know the comfort and help a lantern can be when left lit in a campsite. On numerous occasions I have been somewhat disoriented on a dark night while camping and have felt comforted by seeing our camp's lantern burning off in the distance. I use that light to find my way back to my camp. We are to be that kind of light. The Lord needs us to be that kind of light. It is interesting that in 3 Nephi 12:14 the Lord varies "Ye are the light" and says "I give unto you to be the light." The Lord is not just describing something that is; he is telling us something that he needs us to be and something he needs us to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Quintin L. Cook said, "The moral foundation of our doctrine can be a beacon light to the world and can be a unifying force for both morality and faith in Jesus Christ."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord needs us to be a beacon light to attract those that seek the truth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The other aspect of light Christ referred to was that of a candle illuminating all those that are in the house. This is also our opportunity and responsibility. As we act in accordance with the Lord's teachings, we bless the lives of others by allowing Christ's light to be reflected in our lives so others can see that light and be blessed by it.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Dieter F. Uchtdorf has said, "The most effective way to preach the gospel is through example. If we live according to our beliefs, people will notice. If the countenance of Jesus Christ shines in our lives, if we are joyful and at peace with the world, people will want to know why."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;As we share with them the gospel, their lives are then filled with light and they enjoy the happiness, comfort and blessings of the gospel--and thus the light is spread.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the rest of the world becomes darker, we have the opportunity to be a brighter beacon to those that seek the truth--by conscientiously living our lives in accordance with the guidelines we receive from the scriptures and living prophets.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Leaven in the Loaf</strong><br />The third analogy that I would like to refer to is that used by Christ as found in Matthew 13:33:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p>Christ is referring here to yeast being placed in dough. If you have ever made bread you know that a very small amount of yeast is placed in a relatively large amount of dough and the yeast causes the loaf to rise, sometimes lifting the loaf to four or five times its original size. This is another opportunity and responsibility that the Lord give us. President Joseph Fielding Smith said, "While it may be said...that we are but a handful in comparison with...the world, yet we may be compared with the leaven of which the savior spoke, which will eventually leaven the whole world"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Did you hear that last part? We will leaven or lift the whole world! Wow. How do we do that?&nbsp;<br /><br />The first and most critical element that allows leaven to function effectively is to be in the loaf. How can the leaven lift, if it is not in the loaf? Many of us might think, during these times of increasing evil, that we should take our families and hide out in some small town in Idaho, surrounded by other Mormons. But remember, the&nbsp;<em>world</em>&nbsp;needs us.&nbsp;<br /><br />M. Russell Ballard gave us this great guidance regarding the topic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In spite of all the wickedness in the world, and in spite of all the opposition to good that we find on every hand, we should not try to take ourselves or our children out of the world. Jesus said, "the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven," or yeast. We are to lift the world and help all to rise above the wickedness that surrounds us...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Lord does not need a society that hides and isolates itself from the world. Rather, it needs stalwart individuals and families who live exemplary lives&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the world and demonstrate that joy and fulfillment come not of the world but through the spirit and doctrine of Jesus Christ.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>So taken together, what might all of this actually look like; being the salt, the light and the leaven? I found a short film made by a church member in New Jersey in November of 2012 that does a pretty good job of demonstrating what this might look like in action. It may not be exactly what you expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHSkiEeLpTk?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>What a powerfully made video of a powerful example of being the salt, the light, and the leaven. You could see the impact it had on the recipients, they were lifted, they were lit. I was so touched by the video when I first saw it a year ago that it has stayed with me ever since. What a wonderful example of how we can be the salt of the earth, a light to the world, and the leaven in the loaf. We know how to do this--and we do it well.&nbsp;<br /><br />I also realized that there was meaning here beyond the immediate, descriptive message. I see the events portrayed in this film as symbolic of the spiritual storms we live in and will live in. Many of our inspired leaders use storm symbolism such as the "latter-day storms of darkness and evil" and "darkening clouds of wickedness" to describe these latter days. And to those of us looking, the storm clouds are fairly obvious. One response to the threat of the gathering storm is to be fearful. To attempt to take refuge in our emotional storm cellars. But I would argue that we are not supposed to be hunkered down, cut off from the world. As in this video, we are to be out and helping those more effected than we are by the storm. We are to be the light in the darkness. Elder Boyd K. Packer has said, "We are not to be afraid, even in a world where the hostilities will never end. The war of opposition that was prophesied in the revelations continues today. We are to be happy and positive. We are not to be afraid. Fear is the opposite of faith."&nbsp;<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure if you noticed, but there were a few BYU-Idaho t-shirts in that video and it would not surprise me if there weren't a few people sitting in the audience right now that were actually there. That does not surprise me. This is why you are here at BYU-Idaho. This is why BYU Idaho exists--to be a place that teaches us to be disciples of Jesus Christ--a "Disciple Preparation Center" as Elder Bednar described it.&nbsp;<br /><br />You, we, are in training here to be better disciples of Jesus Christ, better salt, brighter light, stronger leaven. And the ultimate purpose is not so we can say we are better and it is not just for us to be better, but it is so we can better bless the lives of those around us--wherever we are or wherever we are sent. You've all heard the quote by Jacob Spori, "The seeds we are planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth." I have such a strong personal testimony of this: you will be sent from here out into the world to do good, to make good, to be a light, and to be the leaven.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was interviewing here back in 2008, before I had read Jacob Spori's quote, and I was seeking guidance from the Lord before I made such a significant change in my career and the image crossed my mind of acorns being cast all across this country. And in the place that each acorn landed a tree sprouted and grew. In my mind's eye, I saw these trees grow and become pillars of strength all across the country. Hundreds and thousands of strong, stabilizing trees spread throughout the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, this is what you will be. I don't mean that as some conceptual, undefined, future possibility. I mean you will be called on to be a stabilizing pillar of strength in less than four years. For some of you it will be in the next three months. You will graduate from this university and you will start your careers, you will start your families, you will be planted throughout this country and throughout the world. I know this because I have seen it every semester for the last five years. You will leave Rexburg and the Lord will plant you in another place and will ask you to be a light in that place, to lift in that place, to be a pillar of strength in that place.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was first assigned to speak in devotional, I sent out an email to the students I have taught over the last five years and asked them to share with me what callings they have had and any experiences they have had in building the kingdom and I received back some wonderful stories.&nbsp;<br /><br />To give you some idea of exactly what you will be doing in the next few months and years, I would like to share some of those stories with you.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Bradon Ballard--Charlotte, NC:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>When I graduated BYU-Idaho in 2012, my wife and I moved to Chicago for a job opportunity.&nbsp; There we were immediately put to&nbsp;work in our ward.&nbsp; My wife was&nbsp;in nursery and I was the 11 year old scout leader. &nbsp;I am an Eagle Scout, but to be on the leadership side as a 24 year old was an interesting experience.&nbsp; We were so few in number that we combined two wards together for the sake of being able to actually have enough boys and leaders to have campouts and activities.&nbsp; There were two boys total when we started.&nbsp; One boy from each ward, and they rarely attended the same week. &nbsp;After we got the ward list of the boys in our age group we went hunting for them.&nbsp; There were also a few boys that were turning 11 soon and would help strengthen our numbers.&nbsp; We had the blessing of introducing scouting to many 11 year olds of new converts who had never been involved before and their friends came as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We've recently moved from Chicago to Charlotte but on my last night there we had over 12 scouts attending.&nbsp; One of the boys, Juan, turned 12 and became a deacon.&nbsp; We watched him pass the sacrament and fulfill his priesthood duties. &nbsp;We were able to see him grow in his abilities but more importantly his faith.&nbsp; My partner and I picked him up every week because his parents weren't able to get him there each week.</p>
<p><strong>Derik Smith--Idaho Falls, Idaho:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>We spent a year in the Boston area getting a Master's in supply chain management.&nbsp; I was part of a small cohort of 36 students and only one other was LDS.&nbsp; It was a very diverse group.&nbsp; The 36 of us came from 17 different countries.&nbsp; Most of my classmates had never heard of the Church and many did not come from Christian backgrounds.&nbsp; In an effort to share the gospel and in response to a prompting, I invited my entire class to our ward's Christmas program.&nbsp; Two classmates accepted the invitation and one was baptized a few months later.&nbsp; We became very close and after finishing the program, he returned to China for work.</p>
<p><strong>John Pearson--Bentonville, Arkansas:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>(We) have ... introduced taught and baptized two individuals and escorted them through the temple with their families. Those tories alone have been worth every minute spent here. I hope this...hasn't come across as bragging.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Alley--Lehi, Utah:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>Home teacher has probably been where I've felt like I've done the most good. We bought a house a year ago and both my wife and I were assigned as visiting teacher and home teacher to an inactive couple with a new infant. We felt like we should get to know them and become friends before we started visiting as a "church assignment." We started inviting them over to our house for dinner and games, my wife started hanging out during the day with her, and we became friends. Eventually they started i nviting us to dinner, golf, and to just hangout. Counter-intuitively we never brought up church. Then one Sunday about two months ago they just showed up to church! We invited them to class with us, but they declined saying they were "slowly working back into church!" Since then they've started going to all three hours of church and have received callings. They sit by us in nearly every class and seem to feel comfortable. Feels nice knowing you may have been a positive influence on helping someone return to the fold.</p>
<p>None of the stories I have just shared are extraordinary, nothing that most would consider miraculous. But for those few individuals whose lives are lit, lifted, and blessed, the impact is significant. Brothers and sisters, I want you to look around this auditorium again. Can you<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;the good that will come from this campus? When you multiply each of these small stories by the five thousand that are in this auditorium or the more than 15,000 on this campus and 12,000 online students, can you imagine the light that will be released on the world; the combined lifting power of this many disciples of Christ. In the growing darkness of the world, the Lord has created a place where light is condensed and magnified, where the leaven is prepared. It is my testimony that this is why this university exists; this is why the Lord dedicates so much to building and sustaining BYU-Idaho. He needs salt, he needs light, and he needs leaven. So I would ask you, with all the Lord has given us here, all the sacrifices that have been made for us to be here, the growing need the Lord has of our help in these darkening days, are you sufficiently preparing yourselves to be salt of the earth, the light of the world, and leaven that lifts. I leave this question and these words with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Counselor, BYU-Idaho Counseling Center</p>
<p>Reed Stoddard has been working in the Counseling Center at BUI-Idaho since 1994 and he has served as the director of the Center since 2003.&nbsp; He currently serves as the first counselor in the Rexburg YSA 8<sup>th</sup> stake presidency.&nbsp; He and his wife DeeAnn met on a blind date at then Ricks College.&nbsp; They are the parents of 5 living children and they have 4 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I would like to start with a story from&nbsp;<em>Church News</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He stood to bear his testimony and could barely see over the pulpit. The counselor in the bishopric lowered the podium and 8-year-old Brandon, with tears in his eyes, bore a heart-rending testimony with such emotion that his little voice quivered, and it&nbsp;truly touched the congregation. When he finished and turned to leave, the bishop saw that Brandon couldn't leave. His fingers had been pinched when the pulpit had been lowered. The bishop quickly motioned for his counselor to raise the pulpit and Brandon was released and quickly returned to his seat. He leaned over and quietly whispered to his mother, 'Now I understand why people cry when they bear their testimony!'<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I wanted to explain in advance why I might get teary eyed during this talk.&nbsp;<br /><br />The title of my address today is "Living after the Manner of Happiness." I have spent my professional life and much of my ecclesiastical service helping people cope with adversity.&nbsp; I have come to learn that there are two types of adversity or trouble we can experience in our lives.&nbsp; One type of adversity we bring on ourselves by disobedience to God's commandments, but my focus today will be on managing the trouble in our lives that is not related to our sins.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes we assume that if I'm struggling it must be due to my disobedience. Years ago, shortly after my mother was diagnosed with cancer a woman from the ward visited her and said, "I bet you regret now all those years of drinking cola drinks."&nbsp; In her mind my mom's cancer must have been a result of my mother being disobedient to this woman's idea of the word of wisdom. In reality, many of the troubles we experience in life have nothing to do with sin. &nbsp;Adversity that is not related to disobedience can come in at least three ways:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;<strong>Our weaknesses</strong>: we make mistakes or poor decisions. Sometimes we are sinful, but sometimes we are just not very bright or we are weak. We use poor judgment because we are human.&nbsp; Adversity of this type might be a poor financial decision,&nbsp;procrastinating something important, or trying to take on more than we are capable of.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.&nbsp;<strong>Agent acts of others</strong>: a friend, Bill Riggins, likes to say, "I love the fact that I have&nbsp;agency, but I hate the fact my kids do." We can't help but be effected by other's choices,&nbsp;such as a family member choosing not to live the gospel, divorce, and being treated unkindly or even abused.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.&nbsp;<strong>Living in a telestial world</strong>: we have regular painful reminders that this isn't the Garden of Eden. For instance; growing old, thedeath of a loved one, illness both physical and mental, poverty, accidents, and loneliness.</p>
<p>I am drawing the title of my talk from a brief scripture, 2 Nephi 5:27, "And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness."&nbsp; The context of this comment by Nephi is a very troubled time for him and his people. He says in the start of this chapter that despite his prayers, his brothers' anger towards him had increased to the point they are planning to kill him, and he and his people are required to move away for their safety.&nbsp; Learning to live after the manner of happiness despite trials or affliction can be a challenge. I would like to suggest three keys to living after the manner of happiness despite our troubles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Faith in a loving Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Keeping an eternal perspective</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Taking action rather than being acted upon</p>
<p><strong>Key # 1 Faith in Heavenly Father and the Son</strong><br />Just as proper repentance begins with faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and results in a person changing, proper handling of adversity also begins with faith and results in a changed person. The atonement is not just for sinners. In&nbsp;<em>True to the Faith</em>&nbsp;it states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Through your faith and righteousness and through His atoning sacrifice, all the inequities, injuries, and pains of this life can be&nbsp;fully compensated for and made right. Blessings denied in this life will be given in the eternities. And although He may not relieve all your suffering now, He will bless you with comfort and understanding and with strength.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>And I would add happiness. This is sometimes referred to as grace or the enabling power of the atonement.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the angel asked Nephi if he understood the condescension of God in 1 Nephi 11:17, Nephi replied, "I know that He loves his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things." We may not be able to make sense of the suffering that is inherent to our mortal experience but we can be as Nephi and have confidence that no matter what we are required to suffer or experience our Heavenly Father loves us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks told the following in the April 2000 conference that gives a nice insight into God's love for us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While visiting the British Museum in London one day, I read a most unusual book. It is not scripture. It is an English translation of an ancient Egyptian manuscript. From it, I quote a dialogue between the Father and the Son. Referring to His Father, Jehovah--the premortal Lord--says: "He took the clay from the hand of the angel, and made Adam according to Our image and likeness, and He left him lying for forty days and forty nights without putting breath into him. And He heaved sighs over him daily, saying, 'If I&nbsp;put breath into this [man], he must suffer many pains.' And I said unto My Father, 'Put breath into him; I will be an advocate for him.' And My Father said unto Me, 'If I put breath into him, My beloved Son, Thou wilt be obliged to go down into the world, and to suffer many pains for him before Thou shalt have redeemed him, and made him to come back to his primal state.' And I said unto My Father, 'Put breath into him; I will be His advocate, and I will go down into the world, and will fulfil Thy command."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Heavenly Father knew that we would suffer and have tribulations in this life, but he knew that suffering was necessary for us to grow and to meet our potential.&nbsp; He also knew that his Son would be required to suffer to fulfill his divine destiny as our Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma describes Christ's suffering in this way in Alma 7: 11-12:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled&nbsp;which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their&nbsp;infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor&nbsp;his people according to their infirmities.</p>
<p>There is very little mention of suffering for sin in these verses, rather it emphasizes Christ's suffering adversity so He would know what our lives would be like.&nbsp; The definition of succor is "assistance in time of distress."&nbsp; Not only did Christ suffer for us but he compassionately suffers with us.&nbsp; Christ's suffering uniquely qualifies him to comfort us when we suffer adversity. President Benson labeled Him as "the Ultimate Comforter," and Elder Bednar taught, "There is no physical pain, no anguish of soul, no suffering of spirit, no infirmity or weakness that you or I ever experience during our mortal journey that the Savior did not experience first."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I have loved this poem by Olga Weiss since the days of my mission.&nbsp; It reminds us of Christ's ability to relate to our troubles.&nbsp; It is entitled "The Road is Too Rough."</p>
<p>The road is rough, I said,<br />There are stones that hurt me so<br />And He said, dear child, I understand<br />I walked it long ago.</p>
<p>But there is a cool green path, I said<br />Let me walk there for a time.<br />No child, he gently answered me<br />The green path does not climb</p>
<p>My burden, I said, is far too great<br />How can I bear it so?<br />My child, he said, I remember its weight<br />I carried my cross you know</p>
<p>But I said, I wish there were friends with me<br />Who would make their path my own<br />Oh yes, he said<br />Gethsemane was so hard to bear alone.</p>
<p>And so I climbed my stony path<br />Content at least to know<br />That where my master had not gone<br />I would not need to go.</p>
<p>And strangely then I found new friends<br />My burden grew less sore<br />And I remember- long ago<br />He went that way before.</p>
<p>At the appearance of Christ in 3 Nephi the people had the seminal experience of one-by-one touching His scars in His hands, feet, and side.&nbsp; Why would Christ choose to retain the scars of His crucifixion in an otherwise perfected, resurrected body?&nbsp; The wounds are symbols of His suffering for us, they are reminders to us of His most difficult trials.&nbsp; A testament that he can relate to any adversity we may ever suffer. We can connect to him through His suffering and our own suffering.&nbsp; Elder Holland described it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However dim our days may seem, they have been a lot darker for the Savior of the world.&nbsp; As a reminder of those days, Jesus has&nbsp;chosen, even in a resurrected, otherwise perfected body, to retain for the benefit of His disciples the wounds in His hands, and in&nbsp;His Feet, and in His side--signs, if you will, that painful things happen even to the pure and the perfect; signs, if you will that pain&nbsp;in this world is not evidence that God doesn't love you; signs, if you will, that problems pass and happiness can be ours.</p>
<p>In the 4th chapter of Mark verses 38-40 the Savior and His apostles are crossing the Sea of Galilee. &nbsp;While the Savior sleeps, a storm threatens to sink the ship.&nbsp; The apostles awakened him and asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">38 ... Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">39 And He arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.&nbsp; And the wind ceased, and there was a great&nbsp;calm.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">40 And He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?</p>
<p>At times, like the apostles in Jesus' day, we may feel that no one cares what we are going through.&nbsp; I testify that He does care that we suffer, and that as we exercise faith in Him, He will provide the peace and the calm we need to endure our trials and find happiness despite difficult circumstances.&nbsp; And as Alma taught, "your burdens may be light, through the joy of His Son."<sup>5</sup><em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br />I testify that there is a God in Heaven and He is in fact our Father and that He loves us more than we can comprehend.&nbsp; I also testify that Jesus Christ is the literal Son of God and that His atoning sacrifice qualifies Him to comfort us through our darkest times and bring us to happiness despite times of trouble.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Key # 2 Taking an Eternal Perspective</strong><br />Some of you who are married may have a toddler who is learning to walk.&nbsp; What if you were to say to your child, "It can be painful to learn to walk, you will certainly fall and hurt yourself and there will be tears. Because I love you so much I will protect you from your struggle and carry you all of the time.&nbsp; I will prevent the falls, the hurt, and the tears." Of course, if a child is going to learn to walk they must go through the stumbling and some pain.&nbsp; Reaching our full, divine potential is like learning to walk.&nbsp; If we allow it to, adversity can teach us the lessons that help us eventually become who God wants us to become.&nbsp; The term "snowplow parent" is used for a well-intentioned mother or father who tries to clear away all of the obstacles and challenges on their children's road to success.&nbsp; However, overcoming those very obstacles and challenges are what gives us the lessons and confidence we need to be successful. &nbsp;Some question that if there truly is a loving God how could he allow so much heartache and injustice in the world?&nbsp; I think it takes more love to allow us the growth that comes through enduring trials.&nbsp; He understands that growth comes outside of our comfort zone.&nbsp; He is too wise to be a "snowplow parent."&nbsp;<br /><br />Orson F. Whitney stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially if we endure it&nbsp;patiently, builds our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable--more worthy&nbsp;to be called the children of God.&nbsp; It is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation that we gain the education that we came here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The poet Robert Browning Hamilton wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I walked a mile with Pleasure;<br />She chattered all the way;<br />But left me none the wiser<br />For all she had to say.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I walked a mile with Sorrow,<br />And ne'er a word said she;<br />But oh, the things I learned from her,<br />when sorrow walked with me.</p>
<p>It is not what happens to us but our response to what happens to us that is important.&nbsp; If we allow them to, our sorrows can teach us to become who God wants us to become.&nbsp; Adversity can be a blessing in disguise.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Scott suggested:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When you face adversity, you can be led to ask many questions. Some serve a useful purpose; others do not. To ask, why does this have to happen to me? Why do I have to suffer this, now? What have I done to cause this? will lead you into blind alleys. Rather ask, What am I to do? What am I to learn from this experience? What am I to change? Whom am I to help? How can I remember my many blessings in times of trial?<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>These are questions that can lead us to an eternal perspective and to happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Alma 62:41 Mormon points out the two different responses the people had to the many years of war:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become&nbsp;<strong>hardened</strong>, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were&nbsp;<strong>softened</strong>&nbsp;because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God even in the depth of humility.</p>
<p>The same circumstance produced two different responses.&nbsp; This is the crucial question for us all: Will I be hardened by my trials or will I allow them to soften me and turn me to the Lord? Those who were softened kept an eternal perspective and allowed the circumstance to humble them and not make them hardened and bitter.&nbsp; Boyd K. Packer has made the analogy that this life is like the second act of a three act play and that happily ever after doesn't come until the third act.&nbsp; While that is true I know we can also find happiness in this life with the proper perspective.&nbsp; It is easy to fall into the "I'll be happy when..." trap. The truth is there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges.&nbsp; It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. So, let's stop waiting until the semester is over, until you get better roommates, until he finally asks you out, until it warms up, until you get married, until you have kids, until you graduate, or until you lose 10 lbs.&nbsp; Happiness is in the journey not the destination.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our daughter Meg who is serving a mission in Toronto has chosen this scripture in Philippians 4:11-13 for her theme "... for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I can do all things through Christ which strenghteneth me."&nbsp; Paul knew something about troubles in his life but somehow was able to find contentment despite them.&nbsp; The email that Meg sent with her scripture in it finished with this paragraph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the week as a missionary, it's hard to ensure that your testimony is strong enough. People are constantly telling you thatyou've been brainwashed, or throwing anti-mormon stuff your way. Then, on the Sabbath, I get to walk into the chapel and renew a covenant with God. Man! Church means so much more to me now. It really is my sanctuary. I feel the Spirit so strongly there. On&nbsp;Sunday I just sat in the pew crying. Who cares what all those people on the street say to me? What I have found is truth. What I&nbsp;have found is an environment where I can feel the Holy Ghost strongly- you can't replicate or fake feelings like that. I have found a&nbsp;gathering of Saints that have so much love it is unreal at times. I have found truth that all started back with our Savior, Jesus&nbsp;Christ. I'm here because of him. Because a young boy searched for answers, this lifestyle of mine exists. I'm here because I FEEL the gospel is true each day.</p>
<p>She titled this email, "I am so happy to be so happy here in Toronto."&nbsp;<br /><br />An eternal perspective can help us remain humble and asking the right questions as Elder Scott mentioned.&nbsp; We can know as President Howard W. Hunter stated, "If our lives and our faith are centered on Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, nothing can go permanently wrong."<sup>8</sup><em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br />When faced with adversity we can find happiness by being grateful for what is good in our lives.&nbsp; I suppose some are even thankful for their trials. I must admit I am not there yet most of the time, but we can always find things to be thankful for--even in our darkest moments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1 Nephi 18:16 Nephi was able to be grateful despite being tied up by his brothers on the ship.&nbsp; With swollen wrists and ankles he said, "I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because of my afflictions."<em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br />A popular counseling assignment is to have depressed clients keep gratitude journals. &nbsp;It is suggested that clients write down at least three things they are thankful for every day. The choice to focus on what is right in one's life as opposed to what is not can be very powerful.&nbsp; Expressing gratitude to Heavenly Father for His tender mercies and to the people who support and love us allows for a balanced perspective on life's trials.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Lorenzo Snow said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Lord has not given us the gospel that we may go around mourning all the days of our lives. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a religion of mourning and gloom. The faith of our fathers is one of hope and joy. It is not a gospel of chains but a gospel of wings. To embrace it fully is to be filled with wonder and to walk with an inner fire.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father's plan for us--this restored church--is a "great plan of happiness" that will be the result if we choose it.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Mosiah 24:15 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did&nbsp;strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord<em>.</em></p>
<p>The Lord did not remove their burdens but he made them light and because the people turned to the Lord and kept a positive perspective even in a challenging trial they were able to be cheerful.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Wirthin observed, "In spite of discouragement and adversity, those who are happiest seem to have a way of learning from difficult times, becoming stronger, wiser and happier as a result."<sup>10</sup><br /><br />Sometimes perspective comes with time and patience.&nbsp; Retaining our sense of humor during difficult times can be challenging but a blessing.&nbsp; Mark Twain said, "Humor is tragedy plus time." &nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat that, "Humor is tragedy plus time."&nbsp; My friend Marv Whyte likes to add, "If you can't laugh at it, you haven't waited long enough."&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Key # 3 Taking Action Rather than Being Acted Upon</strong><br />To live after the manner of happiness even in the midst of our adversity we must use a mixture of faith and hard work. If we get stuck in the victim role or in discouragement it can paralyze us from doing what we can to overcome our trials.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Uchtdorf said it this way, "When our wagon gets stuck in the mud, God is much more likely to assist the man who gets out to push, than the man who merely raises his voice in prayer."<sup>11</sup><br /><br />We can look to examples of others both in our own lives and from the past who have worked hard to overcome difficult circumstances.&nbsp;<br /><br />My father died when I was 8 years old leaving my mother a single parent of seven children at the age of 40.&nbsp; She certainly went through periods of sadness and heartache, see missed my father very much, but she "got out of the wagon" so to speak and went to work.&nbsp; She started school and graduated from Ricks College. With her oldest two sons and on a modest income from her job at Ricks College, she paid off the debt on my grandparent's farm where she lived a happy life despite less than ideal circumstances.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Lehi's vision we often overlook the beginning of the dream. Lehi is obediently following the man in a white robe and he says in 1 Nephi 8:7-9:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"></span>8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on&nbsp;me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious field.</p>
<p>The "dark and dreary waste" can be a metaphor for the trials of our lives.&nbsp; What if he had gotten discouraged by the many hours in the "dark and dreary waste" and given up.&nbsp; He would not have made it to the tree of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The incident of the broken bows in first Nephi is also instructive.&nbsp; While his brothers and even his father murmured that they had lost their means to feed their families, Nephi, set to work, built a new bow and went hunting.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder LeGrand Richards said, "For every worry under the sun there is a remedy or there is none; if there is a remedy hurry and find it.&nbsp; If there is not never mind it."<sup>12</sup><em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br />There are some things we cannot control. Let us do all we can to improve our troubles and then put our emphasis and efforts on doing other good things. Placing our troubles aside and getting involved in other pursuits such as service can be therapeutic.&nbsp; Reaching out to serve others can be a healthy distraction from our frustrations and bring joy into our lives by blessing others.&nbsp;<br /><br />An example of focusing on serving others when challenged is President Hinckley, as a discouraged missionary in England. He wrote, "I was not well when I arrived. Those first few weeks, because of illness and the opposition which we felt, I was discouraged. I wrote a letter home to my good father and said that I felt I was wasting my time and his money." &nbsp;His father's advice was "forget yourself and go to work."&nbsp; &nbsp;He followed his father's counsel and would later call this his "day of decision" that would lay a positive course for the rest of his life.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Wirthlin stated<em>:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><span style="color: #666666;">Learning to endure times of disappointment, suffering, and sorrow is part of our on-the-job training. These experiences whileoften difficult to bear at the time, are precisely the kinds of experiences that stretch our understanding, build our character, and increase our compassion for others.&nbsp; We experience hard things so that we too may have increased compassion and&nbsp;understanding for others.</span><sup style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">14</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"></sup></p>
<p><sup style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"></sup>Just as Christ's suffering taught him how to succor us, we can use the compassion we learn through our own trials to be more sensitive and to better serve others who are struggling.&nbsp; We can be Christ's hand in bringing comfort to others.</p>
<p>I am grateful for my dear wife who is a great example to me of someone who despite the adversity of losing a child at birth, being diagnosed with cancer, and dealing with parenting challenges, just to name a few, has unshakable faith, maintains an eternal and optimistic attitude and loses herself in service to others to find happiness.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />In closing, I bear my testimony that no matter how daunting our trials, happiness is possible.&nbsp; I encourage us all to use faith in a loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ, an eternal perspective and taking action rather than being acted upon so we might live after the manner of happiness no matter what our circumstances I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunday School General President</p>
<p>Russell T. Osguthorpe was serving as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy when he received the call to serve as the general president of the Sunday School. He has also served as a stake president, stake and ward Young Men president, counselor in a bishopric, branch president at the Provo, Utah, Missionary Training Center, and president of the South Dakota Rapid City Mission. He has also been a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.<br /><br /> Brother Osguthorpe holds multiple degrees from Brigham Young University, including a PhD in instructional psychology. He is a former director of the Center for Teaching and Learning and a professor emeritus in the Department of Instructional Psychology and Technology at Brigham Young University. Brother Osguthorpe and his wife, Lolly, are the parents of five children and have 21 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While serving as a mission president several years ago, I used to tell my missionaries that they came on a mission to help another person do what that person really wanted to do, but had not yet been able to do without some outside help. I watched missionaries help many people overcome addictions with tobacco, drugs, alcohol, and pornography. They found out what others wanted to do to make their lives better and then invited them to do what they really wanted to do but were having trouble achieving. This is how we edify each other--we build up another's soul. To edify literally means to build up, to lift one another.<br /><br />A few years ago, while teaching a missionary prep class at BYU, I asked students to practice extending commitments every week of the course. I explained that I did not expect them to invite someone to be baptized, just help someone else do what that person really wanted to do but had not yet been able to do without some outside help. One student explained to me how she had called a non-LDS friend in her home state just to see how she was doing. Her friend told her that she had developed a drinking problem and that she was thinking of dropping out of school and returning home. She said that she had become so discouraged, she was thinking of taking her own life.&nbsp;<br /><br />My student asked her if she wanted some help. Becoming emotional, her friend consented. My student then said to her friend:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In our Church we have the Book of Mormon. One verse we've been studying talks about some missionaries who got so discouraged they wanted to give up and go back home, but then they prayed and fasted and the Lord comforted them and said, "bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success" (Alma 26:27). I know that the Lord will help you. I know that he can help you overcome your drinking problem. I know He can help you succeed. Will you pray that He can do that?</p>
<p>Her friend agreed to pray. Later my student then said to me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I can't actually believe I did that. I didn't know if she would be offended or if my invitation to pray would help her, but I felt that it would, so I did it. A week later my friend called me back and said, "I just want you to know that you saved my life. I'm getting some help with my drinking problem, and I've decided to stay in school. I'm not so discouraged anymore. You really saved my life.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This student was building up the soul of her friend. Moroni teaches that when we meet together, we should "speak one with another about the welfare of [our] souls."<sup>1</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />She was doing exactly what you do as BYU-Idaho students when you adhere to Principle Five of your learning model: "Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho love, serve and teach one another." She taught her friend from the scriptures--but she was doing it out of love for her friend, not because she thought she might get a higher grade if she did it. No, she was doing it out of love.&nbsp;<br /><br />By the way, in preparation for this talk, I re-read your learning model. It is inspired. It is powerful. If you make a concerted effort as students and faculty to follow it and to live it, I promise you that the Lord will bless you in unimaginably positive ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />The reason you have this model is so that you can strengthen each other as learners and teachers. The model is a method to help us build up each other's souls. Most would not characterize my student's telephone conversation with her friend as teaching. We usually think of teaching as a formal thing that's done in classrooms. But when she quoted that scripture from Alma to her friend, she was actually teaching her the gospel pure and simple. She was bearing testimony of the Restoration without saying the words, "I want to bear my testimony."&nbsp;<br /><br />Teaching happens every time we try to strengthen someone else. "And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren [and sisters]."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We often quote the words I just cited, but the first of the verse is even more enlightening. This was a scene between the Savior and Peter.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />The Savior knew that Peter was struggling in some way. He knew that Peter needed help.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />So the Savior said, "[Peter], I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." The Savior was teaching Peter that conversion is not a one-time event, but a life-long quest.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />He was trying to build up Peter's soul for what lay ahead, just as my student was trying to strengthen her friend who was on the verge of giving up on life completely.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are all on the edge of failure or success every day. One minute things go well, and we think that life is great. Then the very next minute, something happens, and we feel negative for some reason. Discouraging thoughts gang up on us and try to pull us down. My hunch is that my student might have had discouraging thoughts herself, even right before she called her friend. But when she listened to her friend--really listened--and then felt her pain, that scripture from Alma popped into her mind--not by accident, not at all--but because her friend needed to hear those words right then. The Lord knew that, and He helped my student know that, and she shared what she had been inspired to share. It made all the difference.&nbsp;<br /><br />I once conducted a training session here in Idaho and asked for a volunteer to help me teach a principle. A man about 35 years old came to the podium. I asked him, "Is there anything in your life you would like to improve?" He responded, "You mean in my Church assignment or work or what?" I said, "You choose. Whatever comes to your mind first." He said, "Okay, what I'd really like to improve is I'd like to spend more time with my family. My career is just taking too much of my time, and I need to do better." Keep in mind that he is saying this in front of about 500 people in the chapel. So then, I asked, "Would it help if you reported back to me on how you're coming with your goal?" He immediately agreed that having to report back to a general officer of the Church might help. So I gave him my email address and invited him to contact me whenever he felt that he was making progress on his goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />About two weeks later, I received an email from this good soul. It was not a brief message. He gave a detailed account of what he had done to be able to spend more time with his family. He explained that our little conversation had helped him make some big changes in his life. He said that his marriage was better because of it and that he was happier than he'd ever been.&nbsp;<br /><br />Think of this experience I had. It took about three minutes. All I was doing was trying to build up his soul. It took so little of my effort. I simply invited him to do what he really wanted to do but had not yet been able to do without some outside help. My experience had some similarities with that of my student who telephoned her friend. It did not take that much effort for my student to call her friend. And all she did was give her strength and encouragement to do what her friend really wanted to do but could not do without some outside help.&nbsp;<br /><br />We came to this earth to prove ourselves. But we can't go through this test alone. We're in this complex, mixed-up world together. In that Great Council in Heaven before we came here, we probably had some premonition of how challenging mortality might be. But a loving Heavenly Father told us that his Only Begotten Son would save us from any calamity that might befall us. Any calamity. So we looked to the Lord and smiled. We knew that with His help, and only with His help, we would be able to make it through this life and return and live with Him forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the very beginning we knew that mortality would not be a solo venture. We needed a Savior to atone for our sins, and a loving Father assured us that Christ would provide that atonement. But this was not all. Salvation is not a do-it-yourself project. It cannot be gained alone. Mortality is something we work on together. That is precisely why the doctrine of the eternal family is so central to all that we believe. We grow up in families so that we can gain the strength we need to reach out and help others.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball taught that "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />One of the most basic of all human needs is to feel loved. And one of the easiest ways to show that we care for someone is to thank them. My student's friend called her back to thank her for sharing a scripture and building her up so she could face her problems. Our notes of thanks may not be so dramatic. But we all have people in our circle of acquaintance who could benefit from a message of thanks from us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Messages of thanks are easy to send--an easy way to build up the soul. Last November, when I spoke at the CES Devotional, I received a message of thanks from one of the brethren. Now you might imagine how wonderful that felt. Just to know that he was listening was blessing enough. But to know that he liked something I said--anything for that matter--gave me a real boost. Can you think of someone you could thank for something?&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I'm going to do something I've never done before in any talk I've ever given. I'm going to ask you to take your phone out of your pocket or your tablet or whatever device you might have. And if you're not into electronic devices, a pen and paper will work just fine. How many phones do we have here today? That's what I thought. I want you to look at this little device for a moment. Try to think of this, not just as a communication tool or a music player, but as a tool to build up another's soul.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I ask you, can you pick up your phone--without checking one single message--and think of someone you might thank for something? I'll give you a minute to write a message of gratitude.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />President Monson has taught us his whole life to reach out to each other. His life is a model of this. I love the title of a talk he gave in October general conference of 2012--"See Others as They May Become." He was counseling us not to focus on each other's faults or weaknesses, but to see how their gifts might grow stronger and stronger to help them become the person they are destined to be.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught that we should give more "deserved, specific praise." When we do this, we build up the soul. He also explained how people used to give him "prospective praise."<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />This is an interesting phrase. Perhaps only Elder Maxwell would have created it. But think about it for a moment.&nbsp;<em>Prospective&nbsp;</em>refers to the future. So Elder Maxwell was teaching that we can praise people for what they will one day do or one day be.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />For example, some might have told Elder Maxwell in his youth that they just knew that one day he would be a great missionary.&nbsp;<br /><br />These people were seeing Elder Maxwell as the person he was going to become, as President Monson taught. So we can all give more deserved, specific praise. We can all give prospective praise. These are simple ways to build up the soul. Can you think of someone who could use a word of praise? I will give you another minute to write a message of praise.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope you will come to see your phone as a way to give praise to others. Of course, you can do this in person face-to-face even more effectively. But I keep thinking of the messages that go back and forth. I read recently how we are sending about 300 billion emails per day. That's about 3 million per second. Americans who are 18-29 years old send on average 88 text messages per day. So I ask myself, how many of those messages are positive, helpful messages? How many of those messages truly edify? How many are destructive, damaging messages? And how many might best be called clutter--they don't build or destroy. They do almost nothing at all.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can all send more messages of thanks and praise. But these phones can also be powerful tools to learn and teach. They are tools for you to follow the principles in your learning model here at BYU-Idaho. We can learn new things every day on our phones. We can read a news article or read the scriptures. We can read a poem or a whole book. Most like to read books on larger devices than a phone, but because my phone is always with me, I find myself reading books on my phone. This reading leads to learning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anytime we learn something new, we have an obligation to share it with someone else. You'll notice I did not say it would be a nice thing to share it with someone else. I used the word obligation. Let's go back to the Savior's message to Peter. The Savior did not say, "And when thou art converted, it might be nice if you have time to strengthen your brethren." The Savior helped Peter see that teaching is simply the other side of learning. Recently I heard that the word "ako" or "a'o"<em>&nbsp;</em>in Tongan means both to learn and to teach. Because we came to earth to build up each other's soul, we have a divine duty to share with others what we are learning. Learning is a sacred privilege, an act of wonder. It's a change that takes place inside us. When we learn something new--and I'm not talking about learning a simple fact like what temperature it is outside right now--I'm talking about real learning, the kind of learning that expands us spiritually, intellectually, physically, emotionally or all of the above.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />We have a grandson serving a mission in the Philippines. In one of his letters he explained how he and his companion were teaching a man who had a drinking problem. They had invited him to quit drinking, but to no avail.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the subsequent visit, my grandson described how he became quite bold and told the man that if he did not stop drinking, they would not be able to teach him anymore, because he was always drunk when they came to his home and he could not benefit from their message when he was drunk. The man agreed to stop drinking. And the next time the missionaries visited him, he was sober for the first time in years.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of my five children read my grandson's letter. And then the fun began. We all started talking about how to help someone who is not like us. My grandson had never known an alcoholic before. So he had to reach down deep to know how to help him. He had to call upon the Lord. We have created a group email for our family so that my children who live in four different states can communicate easily with us and their siblings. Some began sharing scriptures, others shared experiences--all focusing on how we can relate more effectively to those with whom we don't have too much in common. It was a rich learning and teaching experience. My wife and I were learning from our children. They were learning from us. We were all learning from each other.&nbsp;<br /><br />So one additional invitation I would like to extend to you today is to look at your phone as a tool for learning and teaching. Try using it in some new way to learn and teach. You might create an email group as we have done in our family. You might use a social media tool to do the same. Or you might invent a whole new way to increase learning and teaching.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each morning my wife and I read the scriptures in Spanish. We've never had a formal class in Spanish, and we did not learn Spanish in the mission field. We began our study by using language software programs. And I had tutors who helped me so that I could then help my wife. We finished reading the Book of Mormon in Spanish last Christmas, and now we're reading the Pearl of Great Price and Old Testament scriptures for this year's Gospel Doctrine course.&nbsp;<br /><br />A student who used to work for me developed an app that places the Spanish verse of scripture next to the English on the same screen, so that as you scroll, you see both versions simultaneously. Frankly, a brilliant piece of work. Why did he develop it? Because his wife--knowing that he was a good programmer--asked him if it wouldn't be possible to see on your phone or tablet both languages at the same time, so you could check your comprehension instantly. He took the challenge and created the app. We use it every day.&nbsp;<br /><br />So for those of you who learned another language on your mission, I hope you'll keep it fresh. One of the best ways is to read the scriptures in your mission language. And for those of you who do not know another language, I would invite you to consider doing the same. You will need to get grounded in the language before jumping into the scriptures, but you can do that with free software right now. What could build up the soul in a more powerful way than reading the scriptures?&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's a simple example of how reading the scriptures in another language can be enriching.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />My wife and I were reading in Moses 7:18 where the "Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind. . ." In Spanish the word "mind" is translated&nbsp;<em>voluntad</em>. In other verses of the scriptures that talk about "one heart and one mind," or "with all your heart, might, mind, etc." the word mind is translated as the more common word in Spanish&nbsp;<em>mente</em>. So I asked myself why was it translated as voluntad in this verse--the very powerful verse describing what it means to be a Zion people.&nbsp;<em>Voluntad</em>&nbsp;in Spanish connotes will or volition. As I thought about it, I liked this Spanish word more than the English one mind because mind can mean so many things.&nbsp;<br /><br />Enoch's people became a Zion people because they wanted to become a Zion people. They had the will or desire to do it. And the greater that will and desire became, the more they drew together. The more they built up each other's souls. Can you imagine how much and how often they praised each other or expressed gratitude to one another? Can you envision how intent they were to learn all they could from each other about God and his will for them? All because they wanted to. They had the&nbsp;<em>voluntad</em>-the will, the desire to be one and to have no poor among them.&nbsp;<br /><br />My message to you today--and I'm saying this because I love you--is to do all you can to build up one another's souls. Seek every opportunity possible to thank, to praise, to learn and to teach. Reach out, as President Monson has so consistently counseled us to do. You can do all of these things without any electronic device at all. And I encourage you with all my heart to do that. The people of Enoch had no smart phones, but that did not stop them from becoming a Zion people. Hand written notes or cards are still as meaningful as they ever were. But now we also have these little devices in our pockets and purses, so I invite you to look at them in a new way. You can thank and praise and learn and teach wherever you are. You can lift others wherever they might happen to be-anywhere in the world. That's one thing the people of Enoch could not do. But we can, so I pray that we will.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have an epidemic of cyberbullying. What I'm hoping for is that we can nurture a much stronger movement of cyberedifying. Remember, to edify means to "build up the soul." This is what the Lord would have us do. So keep looking at your phone as a tool to lift someone else. We can all think of someone--a friend, a family member, a member you baptized on your mission, a teacher, a student--who might benefit from a message that we are uniquely qualified to send. We can all send a message that will strengthen and build up another person's soul, a message that will make them feel more competent, more loved, more able to meet the demands of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I pray that we might hearken to the Lord's words that "all might be edified of all." You have more potential to achieve this than any other generation who has ever lived. You are children of the covenant. You have all of the truths of the Restoration at your fingertips. And you have the ability, the desire, and the tools to achieve what has never been done before. This is one way that each of us can help "Zion in Her Beauty rise." I know you can do it. I bear witness that the Lord lives and that He will help us build up the souls of His children, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus member of the First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>A native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Elder Abrea was born September 12, 1933.&nbsp; He married Maria Victoria Chiapparino, also a native of Buenos Aires, on July 4, 1957, and their marriage was solemnized in the Salt Lake Temple in 1966.&nbsp; They are the parents of three daughters and have eleven grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.<br /><br />Elder Abrea graduated from the University of Buenos Aires and was employed as a certified public accountant by Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells in Buenos Aires prior to being called to preside over the Argentina Rosario Mission.&nbsp; His civic service included serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the city of San Miguel, General Sarmiento Department. &nbsp; <br /><br />Prior to his call as a General Authority, his Church assignments included calls to serve as president of the Argentina Rosario Mission, as Regional Representative, as president of the Buenos Aires Stake and the Buenos Aires West Stake.&nbsp; Earlier he served as district president, branch president, and counselor to a mission president. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Angel Abrea was named a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 1981.&nbsp; He served in the Philippines Area Presidency, the North America Southwest Area Presidency, and as president of the M&eacute;xico North Area.&nbsp; He was named an Emeritus General Authority in August 2003. &nbsp; <br /><br />Since receiving his call as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Elder Abrea has served as an Assistant Executive Director of the Temple Department, as Executive Administrator to Peru and Bolivia, as a counselor in the Mexico/Central America Area Presidency, as president of the Buenos Aires Temple, and as a counselor in the South America North Area Presidency.&nbsp; He has also served as a counselor in the Utah South Area of the Church and as an Assistant Executive Director in the Missionary Department.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>While serving in the Philippines I remember starting a conversation with a young lawyer. We were in the lobby of a hotel in heavily populated Manila. During that animated conversation, we talked of many different things until I introduced the reason for my stay in that country. At the same time, I mentioned and made reference to a copy of the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ that I had in my hand.<br /><br />When I mentioned the word "Mormon," the immediate reaction of this young and apparently well-educated lawyer was to tell me, "So you are a Mormon and you Mormons are not Christians."&nbsp;<br /><br />I have dealt with similar situations in different circumstances and places, and in all of them--in every case--my testimony of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, has been strengthened.&nbsp;<br /><br />The thought that there are so many people talking about Christ without knowing Him is what has prompted me to talk about Christ, to rejoice in Christ, to preach of Christ, and to testify of Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />For this talk, I would like to add to this wonderful audience an imaginary couple who have been influenced by groundless comments--comments without doctrinal foundation--that have frequently referred to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as not being Christians. These, my good friends, can be your friends; maybe they are now in your hometowns, or in the cities where you served as missionaries, or in those areas where you will be going to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />They are our friends, and I am sure that we all want to help them to reconsider, to engage with us under the guidance of the Spirit, to "let us reason together that [they] may understand."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I extend this invitation to reason together because the problem lies in the mistaken understanding they have about Christ and His life, His teachings, His mission, and so forth. This mistaken understanding, this distorted perspective, causes them to misjudge the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as "non-Christian."<br /><br />In his book&nbsp;<em>An Actor's Life</em>, Garry O'Connor explained the problem in this simple way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If a man without a sense of smell declared that this yellow rose I hold has no scent, we should know he was wrong. The defect is in him, not in the flower. It is the same with a man who says that there is no God. It merely means that he is without the capacity to discern his presence.<em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><sup></sup></strong></em>The differences that separate us are not those of procedures and interpretations (those which are found to divide the Christian denominations), but rather those of profound doctrinal character. Upon analyzing and presenting them, the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would appear as un-Christian in the eyes of those who are mentally caught up and absorbed in the incorrect teachings that have persisted since the time Jesus Christ was on the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why accusations that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is non-Christian can originate with different groups and religious denominations. This reasoning finds support in the definitions of Christianity and Christians given by Elder Bruce R. McConkie:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Christianity is the religion of the Christians. Hence, true and acceptable Christianity is found among the saints who have the fullness of the gospel, and a perverted Christianity holds sway among the so-called Christians of apostate Christendom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">True believers of Christ . . . were called Christians. . . . As the day of the great apostasy set in, the term Christian continued to be applied to the supposed followers of Christ, even though in reality they had departed from the true doctrines. Today those who purport to believe in Christ, though they may not actually accept Him as the Son of God, are called Christians.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>With these ideas in mind and with the help of the scriptures, we will try to speak to our friends who say that the Latter-day Saints are not Christians.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us proceed.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we agree on the idea that Christians are the followers of Christ--and consequently followers of His teachings and principles--then only the church that accepts, promulgates, teaches, and testifies to the principles of Christ can claim to be Christian.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's go to the scriptures to learn more about Christ and his life and teachings to know who his true followers are.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pay attention to the words used by the angel of the Lord announcing to Mary the birth of Jesus Christ. These are fragments of the scripture that can be found in the first chapter of Luke:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And . . . the angel Gabriel . . . was sent from God . . . to a virgin. . . and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled. . . . And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore, also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>If we are going to consider this passage only on its historical value, we will have lost that which is most important--the doctrine that this passage contains; in other words, the glorious truth that Christ came into this world as the Son of God. Almost one hundred years before Christ's birth, this same concept was magnified and clarified in the prophecy of Alma 7:9-10:</p>
<p>But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>"The Son of God." Regardless of the fact that many people feel offended for even using the word&nbsp;<em>Christmas</em>, how many times, especially during the month of December, is this name-title repeated in carols that are sung, in cards that are written, or in sermons that are pronounced? Even films with those words as a title have been produced.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, do your friends understand the eternal significance of the words "the Son of God"? Do they have the knowledge in their minds and in their hearts to answer the questions that the Savior asked to the Pharisees, "What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe not; at least not with the same powerful personal testimony of our Redeemer when He said: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<sup>7</sup><br /><br />In this succinct and wonderful description of the plan of salvation, our Lord Jesus Christ mentioned another of His names: "The Only Begotten Son."&nbsp;<br /><br />With his proverbial clarity of expression, Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained the meaning of this name-title, "Signify[ing] that our Lord is the only Son of the Father in the flesh. Each of the words is to be understood literally. Only means&nbsp;<em>only.</em>&nbsp;Begotten means&nbsp;<em>begotten;&nbsp;</em>and Son means&nbsp;<em>son.</em>"<em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></em>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Heber J. Grant, asking various religious ministers some questions, made reference to this subject:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Do you believe that Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God as you are the son of your father? Now I'm not asking if you believe that he was the greatest (moral) teacher that ever lived--that is conceded by all--but as a minister of the gospel, yes or no, was he literally the Son of God who came into the world, with the definitely appointed mission to die upon the cross for the sins of the world?"<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Now, when someone claims to worship a God without body, parts, or passions, who fills the whole universe and who is an undefined spirit, this declaration or the fact that they worship this type of person in itself demonstrates that they do not understand, that they can not conceive, that Christ is literally the Son of God in the same manner that you and I are children of our parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think that helps us to understand one of the reasons why some of our friends declare that the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are not Christians.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's go now to another example in the scriptures that will illustrate this discussion with our friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the beginning of the Savior's ministry, there is an event that clearly highlights erroneous ideas that the sectarian world has regarding Christ, his doctrine, and the ordinances that will take us back to Him. I refer to the Savior's baptism. The story narrated in Matthew 3:13-17 is extremely interesting and informative, and it is very well known in the Christian world; but, is it really understood?&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, verse 14 says that the Savior went to the river Jordan, and verse 16 says that "Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure that you will notice the demonstrated fact and testimony that Jesus Christ's baptism was one of immersion, with all its symbolic meaning.&nbsp;<br /><br />So if Christ set the example for us, and "fulfilled all righteousness,"<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;why is it that those who claim that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are not Christians are generally the same ones who practice a different form of baptism? Doesn't it seem that if we are going to be followers of Christ we are going to do the same things that He did, "Leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps,"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and perform the same ordinances--with the same authority and in the same manner in which He practiced them?&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, in the same scripture, it is mentioned that "the heavens were opened . . . and he saw the Spirit of God descending . . . and lighting upon him: and lo, a voice from heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What an inspiring moment. From the heavens, our Heavenly Father, the literal father of Jesus Christ, voices His approval of that which the Son has been doing. The Holy Ghost descends to Christ who is in the water being baptized. These give clear evidence of the distinctness and separateness of each individual. Does this not suggest that the great majority of those who say we are not Christians maintain and preach a confused identity of the members of the Godhead?&nbsp;<br /><br />If our friends don't know who Christ is, how can they follow Him? Strictly through intellectual means one cannot get to know Him. Paul said to the Corinthians, "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;In the&nbsp;<em>Inspired Version,</em>&nbsp;the Prophet Joseph Smith phrased it this way: "No man can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The same principle, the same promise, has been repeated in this last dispensation in these words, "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation. . . . This is thy gift. Apply unto it. . . ."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;This is where we find the reason that many may speak of Christ yet do not know Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our first Article of Faith says, "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost," and I bear my testimony that they are three distinct and separate personages, glorified and exalted with the sense of oneness that is found in deity, as the Savior expressed to the Nephites:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And for this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men, because of me.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Or how the Savior expressed it as is found in John 17:20-23:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>To the extent that His children are one and try to develop that perfect unity, they can achieve the purposes of the Lord and gain exaltation. They can reach that unity that enables them to walk the same paths, receive the same principles and ordinances, be given testimony of those same principles and truths. They can receive that priesthood and can testify of the same God.&nbsp;<br /><br />To follow the example of the life of Jesus Christ is essential, to understand the concept of being one and to know Him. That knowledge is obtained by obeying the gospel--the true gospel of Jesus Christ. If that is the case, I am sure that we will understand the beautiful eternal promises that the Lord presents in these words; first part of the powerful prayer of the Savior given during the last hours of his mortal life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>And in this last dispensation, in a revelation to Joseph Smith, the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as will believe on my name, that they may become the sons of God, even one in me as I am one in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>What a promise, what a divine destiny to those that accept the call from Jesus Christ, to "follow me."&nbsp;<br /><br />He is showing the way. As we walk on that path of faith, hope and obedience, following His example, we learn of Him, more and more we will know Him, and some day in the divine timetable of the Father the promise of becoming the sons of God will be a reality, or in other words, eternal life.When we think of this journey to eternal life, our hearts and minds go to Jesus Christ, the long awaited Messiah, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Through His Atonement and by obedience to gospel laws, men and women have the power to become the sons and daughters of God. Of the Atonement, President Brigham Young said, "The Latter-day Saints believe . . . that Jesus is the Savior of the world; they believe that all who attain to any glory whatever, in any kingdom, will do so because Jesus has purchased it by his atonement."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is impossible in my inadequacy to describe the price paid by the Savior, but these words of a beloved hymn help in part to do so:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,<br />Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me,<br />I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,<br />That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.<br />I think of his hand pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?<br />No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,<br />Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.<br />Oh, it is wonderful, that he should care for me<br />Enough to die for me!<br />Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful for me!<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To portray the Resurrection in its fullness of glory and hope is, I believe, beyond the ability of mortal man. It is simply more than even the best of us can understand; we cannot grasp it fully, try as we will. "No man can describe it to you--no man can write it."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The reality of the Resurrection is for us an object lesson in faith and hope. Increasingly, as the world ripens in iniquity, faith in Christ for many people is becoming an antique, and with that dimming of faith there are not many of the children of God who can answer positively the question of Job--"If a man die, shall he live again?"<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;To that question Christ's reply, as is always the case, is applicable at this time--"Because I live, ye shall live also."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We have been talking of some--not all--of the names, titles, and responsibilities of our Lord Jesus Christ, but before concluding, we need at least to make reference to one that lies yet in the future. That will be his glorious status as the Millennial&nbsp;Messiah. When that day comes, the earth will be changed. "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Then Jesus will return to the earth. "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, "the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;In that day he will bear new titles and be surrounded by special Saints. He will be known as "Lords of lords, and King of kings."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We have been talking of&nbsp;Jesus the Christ--our Master who said, "I am the Son of the Living God, that I was, that I am, and, that<em>&nbsp;</em>I am to come."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_03_25_abrea.htm#_edn30" target="_self">[30]</a>&nbsp;As His witnesses, and with our faith centered on Him, we want to demonstrate to our friends that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Church that "is called in my name,"<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;is true and is the legal administrator of the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />We want you, our good friends, to know what we know by the mediation of the Spirit--that God the Eternal Father lives and that Jesus Christ, his Only Begotten Son, is our Redeemer; to know that we, the members of His Church, have taken upon us His name in the waters of baptism. And yes, we are Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And now, with all those good members of the Church who every Sunday renew the covenant that "they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him,"<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;let us conclude with the surety that lead President Joseph Fielding Smith to declare:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let it be uppermost in your minds, now and at all times, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, who came into the world to lay down his life that we might live. That is the truth and is fundamental. Upon that our faith is built.&nbsp;It cannot be destroyed. We must adhere to this teaching in spite of the teachings of the world and the notions of men, for this is paramount, this is essential to our salvation. The Lord redeemed us with his blood; He gave us salvation, provided--and there is this condition which we must not forget--that we will keep his commandments and always remember him. If we will do that, then we shall be saved, while the ideas and the foolishness of men shall perish from the earth.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters.<br /><br />&nbsp;You all thought you were coming here to hear a devotional, well April Fools! No, I am just kidding.&nbsp; I am so grateful to be here today.&nbsp; A couple of additional things you should know about me.&nbsp; First, and least important, I love movies. I enjoy watching them, and I enjoy finding places in life where they can be applied and surprisingly there are many. Secondly, and more important, I have always had a desire to help others.&nbsp; I have wanted to make a difference all of my life and that is one of the reasons I chose the profession of human resources--I thought I would have the chance to help others. I have been right but just not always in the way I expected.&nbsp; Finally, and most important, I have a testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ and all that he has done for me and the example he has set for all of us. I just felt it was important that you know that.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I thought about what I would like to talk about today the "power of one" kept coming to mind.&nbsp; I thought of Joseph Smith in the old video, when he was reading in the scriptures "One Lord, One faith, One baptism".&nbsp; In Ephesians chapter 4: 4-6 it states, "<em>There</em>&nbsp;is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;&nbsp;One Lord, one faith, one baptism,&nbsp;One God and Father of all, who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;above all, and through all, and in you all."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The last line really stood out to me "who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;above all, and through all, and in you all."&nbsp; "In you all," God, is in us all.&nbsp; I currently teach the sunbeams in primary and every week we sing--okay we try to sing--I am a child of God. I have had the opportunity to sing that song for many years, but as I started working on this talk it was strongly reiterated to me that I truly am a son of God and God is in me and God is in you.&nbsp; We can be one with God.&nbsp;<br /><br />3 Nephi 28:10:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And for this cause ye shall have fullness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fullness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one;</p>
<p>This tells me that we can be even as Jesus is one with the Father.&nbsp; We have great potential but we so easily forget that and sell ourselves short of that privilege and potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />In April 2011 President Uchtdorf, gave a talk titled "Your Potential, Your Privilege."&nbsp; In this talk he spoke of a man that sold himself short.&nbsp; President Uchtdorf shared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There once was a man whose lifelong dream was to board a cruise ship and sail the Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp; He dreamed of walking the streets of Rome, Athens, and Istanbul.&nbsp; He saved every penny until he had enough for his passage. Since money was tight, he brought an extra suitcase filled with cans of beans, boxes of crackers, and bags of powdered lemonade, and that is what he lived on every day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He would have loved to take part in the many activities offered on the ship--working out in the gym, playing miniature golf, and swimming in the pool.&nbsp; He envied those who went to movies, shows, and cultural presentations. And, oh, how he yearned for only a taste of the amazing food he saw on the ship--every meal appeared to be a feast! But the man wanted to spend so very little money that he didn't participate in any of these. He was able to see the cities he had longed to visit, but for the most part of the journey, he stayed in his cabin and ate only his humble food.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On the last day of the cruise, a crew member asked him which of the farewell parties he would be attending.&nbsp; It was then that the man learned that not only the farewell party but almost everything on board the cruise ship--the food, the entertainment, all the activities--had been included in the price of his ticket.&nbsp; Too late, the man realized that he had been living far beneath his privileges.</p>
<p>This man did not understand what he could do and by doing so sold himself short.&nbsp; We so often do that to ourselves as well.&nbsp; We underestimate what we can do to make a difference in the lives of others.&nbsp; We are afraid to let show who and what we are, or we forget that others around us are the same. We and they are children of God.&nbsp; We all have that potential, and we should not sell ourselves short.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am reminded of one of my favorite movies. The movie is a story of a man that not only understood his place but understood the ability and potential of others.&nbsp; The movie is titled "Stand and Deliver." This movie is the story of Jaime Escalante who quit his job as a computer programmer to teach math at an inner city high school in Los Angeles.&nbsp; All of the people around the students in his class, teachers, parents, other students, even the students themselves, had already concluded that Mr. Escalante's students were going nowhere and did not have a chance in life--much less in school.&nbsp; Mr. Escalante did not buy into this belief and worked with all his strength to teach the students math up to and including Calculus.&nbsp;He helped them, worked with them during the summer, came in early, stayed late, and in the end prepared them for the advance placement test.&nbsp; Just before they were to take the test, one of the students asked him if he was worried that they would mess up on the test.&nbsp; Mr. Escalante, having a greater understanding of what his students could become, told the student that he was not worried about the test tomorrow. He was worried about their whole lives.&nbsp; Mr. Escalante understood the potential of those students even when they did not. He gave everything he had to work with them and help them achieve that potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The advantage we have here is we should understand our potential. We have help.&nbsp; The Lord has said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Or in other words, you have the potential to be with our Heavenly Father and to be like Him and He is working to help you.&nbsp; Look around you, every person you can see has the potential to be like God.&nbsp; We should not sell ourselves or others short.&nbsp;<br /><br />We, and when I say we I mean me, have a tendency to quickly judge an individual by what they are doing, what they might look like, or where they are. But as our own Vice President Andersen has shared with me a number of times, we want to be judged by our intentions, but we are usually quick to judge others by their actions. &nbsp;If we take a step back and look at each situation from a broader perspective it would be easier to be less judgmental.&nbsp; I guess what I am asking of you is to look a little deeper. Have a little more of an eternal perspective when you go through your day.&nbsp; Remember that this is a time to be tested--a time for us all to grow and learn. And if we help one another we just might be able to overcome some of the difficulties that we are facing together.&nbsp; This is very easy to say and much more difficult to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has always been interesting to me that often it is easier to do the big things.&nbsp; When there is a large need or an emergency.&nbsp; Most of us are very willing to jump in and assist.&nbsp; It is the smaller day to day service opportunities that we must increase our ability to do.&nbsp; A good friend of mine was teaching a class to a group of my human resource peers and the topic was one that has been covered a number of times.&nbsp; One of the attendees raised his hand and said, "You are preaching to the choir." The instructor looked directly at him and said "I understand, but the choir needs some practice." &nbsp;Increasing our ability to view others through the lens of eternity is something that we need to practice.&nbsp; As I say that, I am reminded of my former coach who would always tell us that practice does not make perfect but practice makes permanent so it is perfect practice makes perfect permanent.&nbsp; We would start with the basics and practice those things until he was satisfied that we had mastered it. Then we would move to the next thing.&nbsp; This applies directly to us and our ability to serve others and become one with God. &nbsp;Alma 37:6, "Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass."&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many stories that demonstrate the principle of "small and simple things," but the one I would like to share comes from an experience that my son, who is currently serving a mission in Brazil, shared with us relating to "small and simple things."&nbsp;<br /><br />He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On Sunday there was a baptism for the other elders in our house. It was scheduled for after the great big stake conference.&nbsp; So after the meeting we all went to try and set stuff up for the baptism. The only problem was that there was no water in the font! The water wasn't working! So we tried to find a place we could get water and there were some faucets and hose lines we were running into the font but it was so slow and we were running with buckets to anyplace on the church grounds where we could get water! The cool part was that just about the entire ward saw what we were doing and helped! There were little kids that would grab a tiny cup and run into the bathroom and fill it with water then run to the font and dump it in... we had older members grab big water bottles and fill it up at the drinking fountain and throw the water into the font! Cupful by cupful, step by step, the whole ward filled that font just enough to baptize someone they had never met... Man it was such a sweet experience seeing everyone doing everything they possibly could to help us fill the font! Each cupful doesn't seem like it did anything but with everyone pitching in, the work will press forward! We don't always need to do everything, have that huge gallon tank full of water! We need to do our part and help the church grow.....one cupful at a time.</p>
<p>You, brothers and sisters can be that one full cup for someone around you.&nbsp; One kind word, one kind action, one smile, one thoughtful email, one note of appreciation, those are the things that can be the "power of one", for an individual.</p>
<p>King Benjamin lived it and shared it with us in Mosiah 2:16-17:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.&nbsp;And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>
<p>Now, I ask: why give service?&nbsp; Is service just for those being served?&nbsp; Elder Derek A. Cuthbert in the 1990 April conference shared in a talk titled "The Spirituality of Service,"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Over the years, many people, especially youth, have asked me, 'Elder Cuthbert, how can I become more spiritual?'&nbsp; My reply has always been the same: 'You need to give more service.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Service changes people.&nbsp; It refines, purifies, gives a finer perspective, and brings out the best in each one of us.&nbsp; It gets us looking outward instead of inward.&nbsp; It prompts us to consider others' needs ahead of our own.&nbsp; Righteous service is the expression of true charity... Service helps us establish true values and priorities by distinguishing between the worth of material things that pass. And those things of lasting, even eternal, value.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 58:27, "Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;"&nbsp;<br /><br />One area I would like to quickly touch on is that of accepting service.&nbsp; We preach a culture of self-reliance and being able to take care of ourselves.&nbsp; We have grown resistant to accepting help.&nbsp; In fact if someone offers help or service we are often offended that they might think that we need some service.&nbsp; I will admit to being in this group until I had an experience that pushed me beyond what I could take care of myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just after our youngest son was born, we were living in the Salt Lake area, we had gone over Thanksgiving weekend to attend a family reunion.&nbsp; We were just all gathering to sit down for lunch when I received a phone call from the first councilor in the bishopric. He told me that our home was on fire.&nbsp; He proceeded to say that the fire department was there working on the fire and no one was injured he also shared with me that they thought they had contained the fire to one or two rooms.&nbsp; So at this point I had pictured in my head that we would be able to stay in our home while we were repairing it. That thought could not have been further from the truth.&nbsp; Our home, while only two rooms were damaged by fire, was unlivable due to smoke damage, and I suddenly found myself, along with my wife and 4 young boys, homeless.&nbsp; Fortunately, for us we were away and did have a change of clothes and some toiletries and no one was injured. We also belonged to a ward that completely reached out to us to help and support us.&nbsp;<br /><br />This was the crucial moment when you realize that you cannot do everything yourself and many people rallied around us.&nbsp; We had a family, with four children of their own, take us into their home for a couple of weeks until we could get other housing arranged.&nbsp; We had many people bring us clothing, food, and money.&nbsp; The first time an individual came up and handed me some money, I started to protest, and it was at this point I realized how ungrateful I was being. These people, my brothers and sisters from our ward, were attempting to provide to me and my family a service and I was protesting and complaining about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Please do not misunderstand what I am saying here.&nbsp; We should not get to the point where we are expecting or feeling that we are entitled to others doing something for us, but we should be grateful for any and all service willingly given to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Fielding Smith has said, "No man is independent. Put a man off by himself where he could communicate with none of his fellow beings or receive aid from them, and he would perish miserably" (Joseph Fielding Smith,&nbsp;<em>The Way to Perfection</em>, p. 218.).<br /><br />From my viewpoint the attitude of being grateful is the difference between being a self-reliant individual that can accept service and being a drain on society that feels entitled to service.&nbsp; My challenge to you is to practice accepting service with a grateful heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters we have a prophet today that has a life full of practicing serving others. The lesson of service came early to President Monson.&nbsp; As told by Elder Holland,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">President Monson was a Twenty-three-year-old, relatively new bishop of the Sixth-Seventh Ward in the Temple View Stake, and was uncharacteristically restless as the stake priesthood leadership meeting progressed.&nbsp; He had the distinct impression that he should leave the meeting immediately and drive to the Veterans' Hospital high up on the Avenues of Salt Lake City.&nbsp; Before leaving home that night he had received a telephone call informing him that an older member of his ward was ill and had been admitted to the hospital for care.&nbsp; Could the bishop, the caller wondered, find a moment to go by the hospital sometime and give a blessing?&nbsp; The busy young leader explained that he was just on his way to a stake meeting but that he certainly would be pleased to go by the hospital as soon as the meeting was concluded.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now the prompting was stronger than ever: "Leave the meeting and proceed to the hospital at once." But the stake president himself was speaking at the pulpit! It would be most discourteous to stand in the middle of the presiding officer's message, make one's way over an entire row of brethren, and then exit the building altogether.&nbsp; Painfully he waited out the final moments of the stake president's message, then bolted for the door even before the benediction had been pronounced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Running the full length of the corridor on the fourth floor of the hospital, the young bishop saw a flurry of activity outside the designated room.&nbsp; A nurse stopped him and said, "Are you Bishop Monson?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yes," was the anxious reply.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I'm sorry," she said. "The patient was calling your name just before he passed away."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fighting back the tears, Thomas S. Monson turned and walked back into the night.&nbsp; He vowed then and there that he would never again fail to act upon a prompting for the Lord.&nbsp; He would acknowledge the impressions of the Spirit when they came, and he would follow wherever they led him, ever to be "on the Lord's errand.</p>
<p>There are many stories that have been shared where President Monson has continued to hone his ability to listen to the promptings of the Spirit and be the "one" that has made a difference in individual's lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, the greatest example we have to follow is that of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Jesus spent his entire life serving and helping others.&nbsp; Christ served both physically and spiritually, He began by teaching at the temple when he was but 12 years old and he continued to teach and help to develop those around him until he was crucified. He also taught us that it did not matter your background, or where you were from, all people have need of being served.&nbsp; He shared that that service could come to you from anyone as in the parable of the Good Samaritan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior taught that you should love your neighbor as yourself, mourn with those who mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.&nbsp; He showed that ability to mourn with those that mourn when he came to the place where they had laid Lazarus.&nbsp;<br /><br />In John chapter 11 beginning with verse 32:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, &nbsp;And said, Where have ye laid him?&nbsp; They said unto him, Lord, come and see.&nbsp;Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
<p>The Savior was not mourning for Lazarus, He wept with those who were mourning to demonstrate his love for them. He had compassion for the needs of the living.&nbsp;<br /><br />Again in 3 Nephi chapter 17 he demonstrated his compassion and service for the people.&nbsp; He was visiting the people of Nephi and had just explained that he was going to depart so picking up in verse 5:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them. And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.&nbsp;Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters the example has been set. We are to look for opportunities to serve and then step up and serve.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Matthew chapter 25 the Savior provided us the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:&nbsp;For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:&nbsp;Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.&nbsp;Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?&nbsp;When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?&nbsp;Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?&nbsp;And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me"</p>
<p>So we end where we began Ephesians 4:6, "One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. I know that I am a child of God and so are you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an address from April 1999 given by President Gordon B. Hinckley titled "Thanks to the Lord for His Blessings", he shared these words that I would like to leave with you today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can all be a little kinder, a little more generous, a little more thoughtful of one another...Let us not take one another for granted, but let us constantly work to nurture a spirit of love and respect for each other.&nbsp; We must guard against faultfinding, anger, and disrespect one for another... Let us be a people of honesty and integrity, doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances.</p>
<p>This is my prayer for us all, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you on another great day at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;It is always a privilege and a blessing to speak to you.<br /><br />When I was a little boy, my mother sent me off to school with words I will never forget. &nbsp;She looked me in the eye and with love and firmness said to me: "You remember who you are." &nbsp;My mother's words carried two messages for me. &nbsp;The first was about my identity. &nbsp;When I walked out that door, she wanted me to remember my heritage as a child of God and that I represented our family and the hopes and dreams of generations of faithful grandparents who had sacrificed so much to give me the great blessings I enjoyed.&nbsp;<br /><br />The second was about my purpose. &nbsp;She wanted me to remember that I had important work to do here on earth, and I needed to prepare to do it. &nbsp;My mother let me know in no uncertain terms that she expected me to be a good boy and do my very best.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to talk to you today about your identity and your purpose in God's eternal plan. &nbsp;Each of you has a special place in Heavenly Father's plan of salvation. &nbsp;He knows you perfectly. &nbsp;He knows your past, and He knows your future. &nbsp;He knows everything about your experiences in the pre-mortal realm, in your mortal life thus far, and in what lies ahead of you in mortality and in the eternities. &nbsp;And He loves you. &nbsp;He has prepared for you a divine plan that confers upon you an eternal identity and purpose that truly qualify as supernal.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will speak first about identity and then about purpose. &nbsp;I will then close with some thoughts on the way your eternal identity and purpose may give you perspective, strength, guidance, and hope as you face the critical decisions you must make and the actions you must take in your lives right now, even this very day.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Identity</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The effects of identity on what we do and how we relate to others are important and powerful. &nbsp;When we think of identity, we usually think about things like personal and family background, activities, interests, talents, occupations, and roles in organizations we belong to.&nbsp;<br /><br />These aspects of identity help other people locate us in their experience and establish connections and relationships with us. &nbsp;Identity also influences how we see ourselves, and it affects our feelings of connection and community and the duties and obligations we embrace.&nbsp;<br /><br />As important as these dimensions of identity are, however, they are not who we really are. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As Elder David A. Bednar has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You may enjoy music, athletics, or be mechanically inclined, and someday you may work in a trade or a profession or in the arts. &nbsp;As important as such activities and occupations can be, they do not define who we are. &nbsp;First and foremost, we are spiritual beings.&nbsp; We are sons [and daughters] of God and the seed of Abraham.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Our true, eternal identity begins with our heritage as spirit sons and daughters of heavenly parents. &nbsp;That divine origin gives to God's sons and daughters a divine nature and destiny. &nbsp;He endows us with the capacity to become like Him and to enjoy eternal life, the life that He enjoys. &nbsp;This is the most fundamental dimension of one's true, eternal identity. &nbsp;It has profound consequences for every one of us and for every aspect of our lives. &nbsp;Additional dimensions of eternal identity flow from the Father's great plan of salvation for His children and the redeeming work of Christ in that plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Father's plan, His spirit children are born into a mortal family with lineage and ancestors, receive a physical body, learn of the gospel of Jesus Christ, act with faith in Christ through the trials of mortal life to repent of their sins, and receive the ordinances and covenants of baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;They "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and endure to the end, which includes making and keeping the sacred covenants of the temple. &nbsp;That is the plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />The sacred ordinances of the temple confer upon God's spirit children new dimensions of eternal identity. &nbsp;Though subject to temptation and the weakness of the natural man, God's faithful sons and daughters choose to become holy men and women through the power of the Atonement and the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;They are spiritually born of Christ and become new creatures, His sons and daughters. &nbsp;As Paul taught, they become identified with Christ--they take on themselves His name, become His true followers and trusted servants. &nbsp;They become His.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>True followers of Christ are called the seed or the children of Abraham. &nbsp;This identification reflects the special place of Abraham in the plan of salvation. &nbsp;Elder Russell M. Nelson has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The covenant God made with Abraham and later reaffirmed with Isaac and Jacob is of transcendent significance.&nbsp; It contained several promises, including:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Abraham is linked to all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<sup style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;The Lord reaffirmed the Abrahamic covenant in our day through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<sup style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>In the temple we receive our ultimate blessings, as the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<sup style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">5</sup></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Our spiritual heritage and the ordinances of salvation confer upon us at least three dimensions of eternal identity.&nbsp; 1) Children of God: we are spirit sons and daughters of God, born into mortal families with a divine nature and destiny.&nbsp; 2) Seed of Abraham: we are heirs to the promises of Abraham, true followers of Christ, His trusted servants with His name upon us.&nbsp; 3) Fathers and mothers in an eternal family: we are husbands and wives, sealed forever in celestial marriage with all the promised blessings of exaltation, eternal life, and an eternal family that God promised to Abraham.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of these dimensions of identity carries with it eternal purpose.&nbsp; Let's consider each one in turn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dimension #1: Children of God</em></p>
<p><em></em>This is the most fundamental of the dimensions of eternal identity. &nbsp;It carries with it an overarching purpose: to become like our Heavenly Father and the Savior Jesus Christ and to qualify for exaltation and eternal life with Them.&nbsp; Our experience here is a test, a trial of our faith in Jesus Christ "to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;amidst the temptations, trials, and challenges of mortal life.&nbsp; Through the redeeming and strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ, we may overcome the natural man, grow in knowledge and understanding, serve and obey, experience joy and happiness, and become more and more like the Savior.&nbsp; In the words of King Benjamin, we seek to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal [us] his, that [we] may be brought to heaven, that [we] may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.&nbsp; Amen.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>This is our eternal purpose: to become holy men and women in Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dimension #2: Seed of Abraham</em></p>
<p>God promised Abraham that his seed would take the gospel of Jesus Christ and the holy priesthood, including the ordinances of salvation, unto all nations to bless all the families of the earth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . and in thy seed . . . shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>The Lord has scattered the children of Abraham "upon all the face of the earth among all nations,"<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;and He has promised that "all the people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in . . . from the four quarters of the earth."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; The scattering of branches or remnants of the house of Israel has already blessed the nations of the earth.&nbsp; Think, for example, of the impact of Lehi's family and their records as well as the many branches like them whose records are yet to come forth.&nbsp; But the ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant and the gathering of scattered Israel is a latter-day work.&nbsp; It is in our days that "the remnants of the house of Israel, should . . . come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer."<sup>11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The gathering of scattered Israel is a gathering unto Christ, to His holy temple, and to the stakes of Zion to build up the kingdom of God and establish Zion.&nbsp; The restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ launched this great latter-day work.&nbsp; It is done by the authorized servants of Christ all across the earth in homes, in neighborhoods, in cities, in nations, in holy temples, and on the other side of the veil.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is our eternal purpose: to do the Lord's work as His trusted servants.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dimension #3: Fathers and Mothers in an Eternal Family</em></p>
<p>When a man and a woman enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage in the holy temple, the sealing power of God creates the bonds of a celestial marriage and the basis for an eternal family.&nbsp; The new couple promises to cleave unto one another and none else and to become one in Christ with their hearts knit together in unity and love.&nbsp;<br /><br />A husband and wife who make and keep the covenant of celestial marriage are prepared to bring children into the world in accordance with God's eternal plan.&nbsp; Their children will be born in the covenant and reared in light and truth.&nbsp; They will grow up in an eternal family founded on the teachings of Christ.&nbsp; They will be guided, protected, and nurtured by a mother and a father who bring the blessings, power, and authority of the holy priesthood into their home and family.&nbsp; The children will feel the Savior's love for them.&nbsp; They will see His light and His power because His love, His light, and His power are in their parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moreover, the hearts of the children raised in such a family will turn to their fathers and mothers.&nbsp; They and their parents will seek out the stories of their departed ancestors and will make sure that the ordinances of salvation are done for them.&nbsp; The Spirit of Elijah will be in that family.&nbsp; Thus, the mortal family into which the children will be born becomes an extended eternal family sealed forever across the generations.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is our eternal purpose: to create a celestial marriage and an eternal family. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Impressions about Identity and Purpose</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />We have discussed identity and purpose in God's eternal plan. &nbsp;His plan is truly glorious and powerful. &nbsp;I have reflected on our Father's plan often in the last few months, and I have thought much and prayed much about you. &nbsp;I want to share with you some impressions I have had about you and your eternal identity and purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />The dimensions of eternal identity we have discussed apply to all of God's faithful sons and daughters. &nbsp;You might think that means you are all destined to become the very same. &nbsp;But that is not true. &nbsp;God infuses your personality and the special gifts and talents He has given you into your eternal identity. &nbsp;You are all the seed of Abraham, for example, but with the Lord's help you become uniquely qualified to carry out the very specific work of salvation He will give you to do. &nbsp;You truly are a unique, special instrument in His hands.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your eternal identity has been a part of you for a long, long time.&nbsp; As a spirit son or daughter of God, you learned all about the Father's plan and its implications for you in the pre-mortal realm. &nbsp;You accepted the plan and participated in the great War in Heaven. &nbsp;Because of your faith in Christ and your valiance in the testimony of Christ, you were foreordained to be the seed of Abraham in mortality and receive the blessings, power, and authority of the priesthood in your life. &nbsp;You were prepared in the pre-mortal realm to be a trusted servant of the Lord and a mother or father in an eternal family in the earth's latter days.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, in mortality you have to choose your eternal identity. &nbsp;You have to act with faith in Jesus Christ to become holy men and women with your whole soul. &nbsp;You made that choice in the pre-mortal realm in the spirit, but now you have to make that choice with your eternal spirit clothed in a mortal body. &nbsp;You have to choose to be a faithful, trusted servant of the Lord. &nbsp;You have to choose to be sealed in the holy temple, and you have to choose to keep those sacred covenants.&nbsp; You have to become your eternal identity. &nbsp;It is not like a checklist that you work through. &nbsp;Your true, eternal identity is something you choose to become through the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may wonder if God has an identity and purpose like this for you. &nbsp;You may feel that being a holy and trusted servant or being sealed to a beloved companion and having children may be out of your reach. &nbsp;When you look in the mirror, you may not see what I have described today. &nbsp;If that is the way you feel, I want you to take another look. &nbsp;Look into the mirror with the eye of faith and see in the mirror not only your face but also the face of the Lord Jesus Christ standing beside you with power and glory and never-ending, perfect love. &nbsp;He did not come to leave you out of His blessings. &nbsp;You are who you are because of who He is. &nbsp;You have eternal identity and purpose because Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even if these blessings of identity and purpose seem distant, they are not any less real. &nbsp;In God's eternal plan, there is an eternal companion for every one of you, if you are faithful. &nbsp;You may not know yet who that person is.&nbsp; It may be some time before you meet that person, but your beloved companion is a real person who will one day be sealed to you forever. &nbsp;And every one of you has children that will bless your life. &nbsp;You may not yet know who they all are, but they are real people living in the pre-mortal realm preparing to come into your family. &nbsp;You are husbands and wives, mothers and fathers in God's eternal plan. &nbsp;That is who you really are.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Power of Identity and Purpose</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />A knowledge and testimony of your eternal identity and purpose can be a source of great power and guidance in your life. &nbsp;Let me give you a little example of that power from an experience that I had with Sue not long ago. &nbsp;We were driving together, and I saw ahead a little red sports car with the top down. &nbsp;Immediately my mind was drawn back to days long, long ago when a high school friend of mine and I drove the twisting, turning back roads between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Lake. &nbsp;I said to Sue, "Don't you think it would be really fun to have a little red sports car like that?" &nbsp;She looked at me in shock and said, "That is not who you are!"&nbsp; (Sue knows me really well.&nbsp; Her reaction had nothing to do with the car, but everything to do with my heart.)<br /><br />Now, you may not have a Sue sitting next to you all the time; but you do have the Holy Ghost, and you can have a sure witness of your eternal identity and purpose. &nbsp;Each of us carries around with us an image of who we are and who we want to be. &nbsp;That image has a powerful influence on our attitudes and our actions. &nbsp;Your eternal identity can be that image.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am going to share with you the experience of a young man I will call Luke whose eternal identity and purpose helped him overcome one of the most difficult and pernicious challenges we face.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; I speak of the deadly threat of pornography. &nbsp;For many years the prophets have warned us about the terrible consequences that follow the use of pornography: marriages and families destroyed, loved ones wounded, the soul chained by addiction, the power of the priesthood lost, and spiritual death.&nbsp;<br /><br />Luke foolishly ignored the teachings of the prophets and got involved with pornography. &nbsp;Pornography became like a drug he took to satisfy his appetites and relieve his pain.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through sheer grit and determination and with the support of his bishop, Luke served a mission.&nbsp; But after his return he slipped back into using pornography. &nbsp;One day a young woman he had been dating asked him, "How do you deal with pornography?" &nbsp;In that moment he made a decision to be honest with her. &nbsp;It was one of the hardest things he had ever done. &nbsp;He told her about his past, about how he had overcome pornography, and about his mission. &nbsp;He told her about what had happened to him since his mission and confessed to her that he needed help. &nbsp;She encouraged him to see the bishop and told him that if he did she would support him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Luke met with the bishop.&nbsp; The bishop helped Luke see that sheer grit was not a permanent solution. &nbsp;Luke faced a ruthless and relentless adversary, and he needed the redeeming and strengthening power of Christ to be completely free of the trap he was in. &nbsp;The bishop encouraged him, but Luke continued to struggle. &nbsp;He would do fine for a while, but would then fall back into his old pattern.&nbsp;<br /><br />One evening the bishop was meeting with Luke when he received an impression to ask Luke a question. &nbsp;He said: "Luke, what is it about the gospel that you don't understand? &nbsp;What principle or doctrine are you missing? &nbsp;I want you to go home and find that doctrine. &nbsp;Study the scriptures, pray about it, and come and see me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Luke followed through on the assignment for a few weeks without any success. &nbsp;In fact, he grew even more discouraged. &nbsp;But the bishop asked him to keep searching. &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon Luke walked into the bishop's office smiling.&nbsp; The bishop thought he looked like a new person. &nbsp;Where there had been pain and discouragement, the bishop saw light and hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is what Luke said: "Bishop, I found the doctrine. &nbsp;Wednesday night I was praying for help. &nbsp;As I prayed, a stream of thoughts came into my mind: Your children are preparing to come to earth; you are their father, and you need to be worthy to take their mother to the holy temple and create their eternal family. &nbsp;Bishop, it was almost as if I saw them watching me, hoping I would win this battle. &nbsp;As soon as I had those feelings, the thought of using pornography became abhorrent to me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Luke still had hard things to overcome. &nbsp;But that understanding of his identity and his purpose gave him a powerful bulwark against the wiles of the devil. &nbsp;He realized that Satan had been trying to steal his identity and get him to think that the guy who used pornography was the real Luke. &nbsp;But through the blessings of the Lord, Luke saw through Satan's lies. &nbsp;He said to the bishop, "That is not who I am."&nbsp;<br /><br />Luke turned more powerfully and completely to the Savior. &nbsp;He became far more aware of the subtle ways Satan tried to lure him into the path of pornography. &nbsp;Over time the Lord healed Luke and he escaped completely from the trap of addiction. &nbsp;He experienced this marvelous promise of the Lord given through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><strong>Testimony</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />If you seek to understand and live up to your eternal identity, it will grow in your mind and in your heart. &nbsp;When you face decisions or are tempted to do something that is wrong, when you face adversity and challenges, or when you are blessed with prosperity, the Holy Spirit will remind you who you are and will help you see your true identity and purpose with an eternal perspective. &nbsp;If you are tempted to walk down a wrong path, you, too, will hear that sweet angel voice say to you: "That is not who you are!"&nbsp;<br /><br />I close with this promise: a spiritual understanding and witness of your eternal identity and purpose will encourage you and give you hope. &nbsp;It will help you see the powerful connection between your identity and the Savior Jesus Christ. &nbsp;It will help you feel the never failing love of the Father and His Son and the blessings of light, power, and joy that your Father in Heaven has prepared for you. &nbsp;With that identity and purpose firmly in your heart and mind, you will see yourself and your life the way the Lord does. &nbsp;You will see others, especially your children and your eternal companion, the way the Lord sees them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I pray that you will have spiritual vision; that you will make every decision, face every challenge, and take every action with faith in Jesus Christ fully conscious that you are on His errand, serving in His holy work, following the Father's glorious plan every day of your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear witness of Jesus Christ, of His love and mercy and grace. &nbsp;He died and suffered so that each of us could realize in its fullness our true, eternal identity and purpose now and forever. &nbsp;I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On general conference weekend, we invited our grandson Spenser to attend the priesthood session with President Clark in the Conference Center.&nbsp; That afternoon as we tried to connect with him to let him know where to meet his Papa for his ticket, we discovered he had left his cell phone behind.&nbsp; I experienced a few moments of panic about how they were going to meet up before he finally found us.&nbsp; In those moments, I realized just how much I have come to depend on our cell phone connections.</p>
<p>When I lose or misplace my phone, I feel a bit insecure and a little lost myself.&nbsp; I depend on the security being connected brings.Our family exchanges on Instagram provide a way for us to bond with each other across the miles that separate us.&nbsp; We watch the growth of our grandchildren, even though we don't see them for months at a time, and enjoy with them their adventures.&nbsp; It has become a treasure for all of us, much like the measuring wall in our home where we marked the growth of our children as they grew up. &nbsp;<br /><br />Our children loved seeing their growth.&nbsp; It was fun to make that mark on the wall and see the progress of the growth of their physical bodies.&nbsp; During those years of watching all seven of them grow, none of us would have guessed that our youngest son would end up being the tallest of us all!&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share a poem with you today that President Clark wrote for his mother on Mother's Day several years ago.&nbsp; He was remembering his growth chart on the wall.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Growing Tall</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I was a boy I looked up at my mom<br />And thought of growing tall.<br />I stretched and grew and marked each spot<br />On the chart tacked on the wall.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"See, Mom," I'd say with a wink and a grin,<br />"I'm about as tall as you."<br />And she'd laugh and tell me, "Not quite yet,<br />You're still two inches too few."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Years came and went and I grew tall<br />While Mother stayed the same.<br />I used to look up but now I looked down<br />When we played our little game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Gee, Mom, I'd say, "you're kinda little."<br />Her reply was to the point and quick:<br />"I'm taller than you think," she'd say.<br />"You're just using the wrong measuring stick."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now I'm a dad with little ones<br />Who measure themselves against me.<br />"Hey, Dad," they say, "I'm almost as tall as you.<br />When I get old how tall will I be?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you want it in inches, I have no idea.<br />Whatever will be will be.<br />But how tall inside you finally stand<br />Depends on the life you lead."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For now I know what my mother meant<br />About measures of a different kind.<br />Stature is not measured in inches or feet<br />But is something in Heaven defined.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There's no chart on the wall to<br />Measure the growth of each spiritual inch or two,<br />But, Mom, I just hope that someday<br />I might stand as tall as you.</p>
<p>This poem contains a sweet memory for President Clark.&nbsp; It is a tribute to his mother who taught him that the stature of his physical body, as measured on the wall chart, was only a small part of the measurement of his true growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />We keep measures of progress in our talents as we increase in our abilities and skills.&nbsp; We can see progress in the development of our character as we relate to people around us and gain experience in loving and serving and in being loved and served.&nbsp; By using the measuring stick in heaven that President Clark refers to in his poem, we can measure our progress in becoming who we are eternally.&nbsp;<br /><br />Access to that measuring stick is gained through channels that are always open to us from heaven. &nbsp;Just like making wise use of the tools we acquire to keep us connected with our loved ones by cell phone, we need to be making wise use of the tools we are given to keep us connected to our Father in Heaven and our Savior Jesus Christ. &nbsp;We learn to use those tools as we keep sacred covenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To keep those covenants we must "stand . . . in holy places, and be not moved."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;Partaking of the sacrament and worshipping in the temple keeps the channels of communication clear as we gain access to the Savior and grow in our understanding of His Atonement.&nbsp; In accessing the blessings of the Atonement, we feel the Savior's love and encouragement and receive insight into how we are doing.&nbsp;<br /><br />The companionship of the Holy Spirit brings personal insight and comfort and peace. &nbsp;When we keep the commandments of the Lord and engage in daily prayer and scripture study, we connect to that marvelous channel of spiritual direction. &nbsp;When we express gratitude to our Heavenly Father for His many blessings, when we ask Him what He wants us to do, when we not only speak but listen, answers come.&nbsp; Our spiritual connections to our Father in Heaven and the Savior grow stronger as we act on those promptings to do what the Lord wants done. &nbsp;In following those promptings, we engage in doing the Lord's work.&nbsp; In that work of serving others, sharing the gospel, and building our eternal families, we grow in spiritual stature and in our confidence and security that we are making progress against that measuring stick in heaven.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my prayer that in this semester of school you will gain insight into your personal growth through staying connected with your loved ones and with Heaven.&nbsp; If you do, I know that you will be blessed in all of your endeavors.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Pathway Managing Director</p>
<p>J.D. Griffith has worked at BYU-Idaho since 2003. He started as a 1-year faculty hire in the College of Business and then worked in Continuing Education before accepting his current position as the Managing Director of Pathway. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, he was the Director of Sports Marketing at Utah State University and Washington State University. After earning an associate degree from Ricks College, he went on to earn a bachelor's degree in business management, a master's in business administration and a PhD in business administration. He and his wife, Tasha, are the parents of five children. He currently serves on the High Council.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I appreciate all those who have taken time out of their day to gather in this beautiful building on a campus that I so dearly love. I also appreciate and extend a special greeting to Pathway and online students participating today via the web. Please know that many here on the campus of BYU-Idaho are praying for your success and well-being.</p>
<p>On a recent visit to the dentist as I was situating myself into the chair, the dental hygienist, a young lady, asked me if I had a little girl. With five children, two boys and three girls, I simply assumed that she had met one of my little girls from a previous dentist appointment. So when she asked me if I had a little girl, I replied rather confidently, with a hint of pride as only a father could do, "Yes, I do; do you know one of my little girls?" to which she replied, "No, you have glitter on your face."&nbsp;<br /><br />The hygienist had asked a simple question, one that I did not interpret very well. However, I would like to discuss a response to a simple question that I posed to a priesthood leader just over a year ago, that ultimately lead to my message today being titled, "Conditioning Our Hearts and Minds to Receive Personal Revelation."&nbsp;<br /><br />It all started when a colleague and I were in Tampico, Mexico, preparing to open another BYU-Idaho Pathway site. While in Tampico, we had the opportunity to spend a few days with Brother Aaron Chavez, the Institute Director who had recently returned from serving as a mission president in the Mexico City South Mission.&nbsp;<br /><br />One afternoon we had some unscheduled time, so Brother Chavez took us for a drive around the city. I took this opportunity to ask him a wide variety of questions. One particular question and answer stood out in my mind the most. I asked Brother Chavez, "As a recently returned mission president, what do you teach differently now to pre-missionaries attending institute to help them prepare for their mission?" His answer was fairly short and concise, but I believe it can easily be applied to each of us in any stage of our lives. He said, "I teach them the importance of knowing how to receive personal revelation." Just as quickly as he answered, I followed up with another question, "And how do you do this?" In his reply, he humbly talked about how each individual must condition his or her heart and mind to learn how to recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was fascinated by the word "condition" in his response. I have pondered this word since that time. President Boyd K. Packer speaks of it in this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Each of us must stay in condition to respond to inspiration and the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The Lord has a way of pouring pure intelligence into our minds to prompt us, to guide us, to teach us, and to warn us. Learn to receive and act on inspiration and revelation."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>When I think of the phrase, "stay in condition" used by President Packer, I think of conditioning, training, and exercising. When we try to get into shape, we start an exercise program; we try to stay in condition. At first, it is hard, our muscles are sore, we are tired, but if we stay with it, over time it gets easier. This type of training and conditioning is much like the conditioning needed to receive personal revelation.&nbsp;<br /><br />When it comes to exercising and training our hearts and our minds, we know far too well that there are no shortcuts. I am reminded of a time when my wife had trained for several months prior to running a half marathon here in Rexburg, Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the day of the race, I thought it would be great if I gathered the kids into the car and drove to the course to cheer my wife on. We headed over to Summer's Hill, a long up-hill stretch of the race, through some dry-farms. I stopped the car and we got out and cheered on Mom as she ran past us. We jumped back in the car and I rolled down the windows, and cheered her on as we drove past her. We parked the car again a mile or so down the road and repeated this process.&nbsp;<br /><br />Toward the end of that particular stretch, Lily, my youngest daughter, who was two and a half years old at the time, was apparently tired of getting in and out of the car and watching Mom run passed us. Nearing our last stop, Lily stayed seated in the car with the windows rolled down. As my wife passed the car, Lily screamed out the window "Mom, get in the car!" Lily did not quite understand this process. In her mind, there was an easier way to tackle this long stretch of roadway, and she was apparently frustrated with the approach we were taking.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, just as my wife never would have thought she could jump in the car and ride to the finish line, we too should not think that we can shortcut our approach to conditioning our hearts and minds to receive personal revelation. There are times in each of our lives when we may feel frustrated or even distanced from the Lord, when we are not adequately connected to the whispering of the still small voice. In essence, we have fallen out of shape, or out of practice, and we need to start a conditioning program.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to suggest three specific approaches that I have applied in my life to help me in the conditioning process. When actively seeking personal revelation, we must first, strive for personal worthiness, creating an environment for the Spirit to dwell. Second, act when called upon, building a confidence in our ability to be an instrument in the Lord's hand.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Third, submit to the will of the Lord, realizing that as one's will is increasingly submissive to the will of God, we can receive the inspiration and revelation needed to help us through life's trials.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />First, I believe our conditioning starts with personal worthiness. Elder David A. Bednar reminds us of the importance of personal worthiness when seeking revelation when he stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Because the Spirit whispers to us gently and delicately, it is easy to understand why we should shun inappropriate media, pornography, and harmful, addictive substances and behaviors. These tools of the adversary can impair and eventually destroy our capacity to recognize and respond to the subtle messages from God delivered by the power of His Spirit."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>"If you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in our heart what the Spirit is saying to you."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Sometimes the Spirit, that still small voice, is heard within, but more often, it is felt.&nbsp;<br /><br />As President Packer noted, "that sweet, quiet voice of inspiration comes more as a feeling than it does as a sound. . . . We may&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;the words of spiritual communication more than&nbsp;<em>hear&nbsp;</em>them."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In the Book of Mormon, we learned that the rebellious hearts and minds of Laman and Lemuel caused them to be past feeling. In 1 Nephi 17:45 we read, "Yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Hence, it is no wonder why we are continually counseled to repent and strive for greater personal worthiness so as to not affect negatively our ability to feel the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Second on my list of ways to condition our hearts and minds to receive personal revelation is to act when called upon. Conditioning ourselves to act when called upon builds-up our strength and confidence. This in turn increases our ability to be instrument in the Lord's hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share two personal examples of how the Lord helped me learn the valuable lesson of acting when called upon.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had been serving in the Ireland Dublin Mission for two months when I was transferred to a new area and asked to train a brand new missionary. After being introduced to my new companion, Elder Matthew Whalquist, I was actually a little embarrassed to tell him I had only been in the mission field for a few months. We determined, however, that what we lacked in experience we would make-up for by working hard.&nbsp;<br /><br />One day we were introduced to the mother of a member in our area. This sweet 67-year-old woman asked us to call her Granny Addis. Granny was not a member of the Church. She announced to us right away that all the missionaries had tried to teach her the gospel and she could just as easily turn us away as she had done with the many, many missionaries before us. We would check-in with Granny from time-to-time when we needed a place to rest our feet after hours and hours of tracting.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the next few months our spirits and enthusiasm were beginning to wane as a result of very little success. One Fast Sunday we desperately prayed for an investigator to teach. &nbsp;After prayerful consideration, both my companion and I felt the prompting to ask Granny Addis if she would hear the missionary discussions. However, we were a little nervous to ruin a good thing; she was one of the only people in town feeding us an occasional meal. Nonetheless, wanting to following the prompting, we knocked on her door the next night, unannounced, and asked if we could visit with her.&nbsp;<br /><br />After some awkward moments, highlighted by the fact that we were two young in-experienced missionaries, we finally built up the courage and said, "Granny, we would like to know if we can teach you the missionary discussions?" She looked down at her feet for what seemed like forever and then looked up at us and said, "No" and then she politely excused us from her home.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were devastated. We wondered aloud why the Spirit would prompt us to do such a thing? We went straight to our flat and sat in silence.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next morning as we were reviewing our schedule for the day (there was really not much to review), my companion was very quiet. I said, "Elder, let's say another prayer this morning to see where the Lord wants us to go." As we knelt in prayer and prayed for guidance, I had the strong impression to go back to Granny's home. We concluded our prayer and I said to my companion, "Elder you're not going to believe this, but I think we should go back to Granny's and ask her again." To my surprise, Elder Wahlquist said, "I had the very same impression."&nbsp;<br /><br />So there we were back on Granny's doorstep where just the night before we had been sent away. My heart pounded as we knocked on her door and she answered and invited us in. There was no need for small talk as we jumped straight to the point. "Granny, we are back to ask you again if you would hear the missionary discussions?" Repeating her actions from the night before, she looked down at her feet for a moment, then looked up at us, and said, "Yes."&nbsp;<br /><br />She then went on to explain that the first time she met us, she had the impression that we were going to teach and baptize her. However, she got scared, and in essence, was testing us to see what would happen if she said no. The fact that we came back so soon was an answer to her prayer. We went on to baptize Granny later that month. To this day, I am still grateful to our Heavenly Father for allowing my companion and me the opportunity to struggle through this experience, and then to ultimately enjoy the blessing of witnessing the conversion of this sweet sister.&nbsp;<br /><br />My second example takes us back to a time when my wife and I bought our first home in a brand new subdivision. As I was outside installing the yard and other things associated with owning a new home, I quickly made friends with the head supervisor of the housing development. I later learned this brother was an inactive member of the Church. While his wife and six children were all active in the Church, he had made it very clear to me that he was not active.&nbsp;<br /><br />As our friendship grew, I began to feel whisperings of the spirit regarding my opportunity to share testimony of the importance of being active in the Church as a father of six children. Through prayer, my wife and I determined that we wanted to invite him and his family to one of our Family Home Evenings. The challenge, however, was that it was going to be up to me to find the right time to do so. Based on previous discussions about the Church, I knew this was going to be a delicate subject. I prayed to recognize when I should act.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several months went by, and I began to wonder if I would ever find the right time. Even worse, I began to wonder if I had already missed my opportunity. As I continued to pray for the ability to act in behalf of my friend, the timing finally did present itself.&nbsp;<br /><br />On one particular night, my friend was helping me install a garage door opener. We were putting the finishing touches on the key pad just outside the garage. I was standing inside the garage and he was standing outside. As he entered the code and the garage door began to close, the spirit quietly whispered to me that now was the time. I thought to myself, "Now?" the garage door is closing, and the spirit said, "Now." As the door was closing with me in the garage and him on my driveway, I yelled out, "I'd like to invite you and your family to Family Home Evening next Monday." At this point, as the garage door continued to close, I could only see him from the waist down. I held my breath and waited. About the time the garage door was at his shins, and I could only see his boots, I heard him respond, "Ok."&nbsp;<br /><br />Two days later, he participated in Family Home Evening, and two weeks later, on a Sunday morning, he walked through the chapel doors with his family for the first time in nearly eight years.&nbsp;<br /><br />Both of these personal examples started out the same way, through a prompting, followed by personal prayer seeking additional revelation. Prayer provides a firm foundation for personal revelation. When we begin with prayer, then act when called upon, we are conditioning our hearts and minds to respond more easily to future impressions and thoughts. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Third on my list of ways to condition our hearts and minds to receive personal revelation is to faithfully submit to the will of the Lord. If we are able to condition our&nbsp;<em>minds</em>&nbsp;to succumb to the will of the Lord, our&nbsp;<em>hearts</em>&nbsp;will naturally follow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Early in our marriage, my wife began having strong impressions that we needed to start having children. I had felt similar impressions but had set aside those impressions because of various distractions. At that time, I was finishing my undergraduate degree and applying for graduate school. President Packer warns us that "occasionally, the Spirit will press just firmly enough...for us to pay attention; but...most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling...the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking..."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As described by my wife, her promptings continued to increase. Nonetheless, she submitted her will to the Lord and prayed that if it be the Lord's will, that I would recognize the same whisperings of the Spirit to start our family. She waited for many months with no answer. In a world of instant communication, it is often difficult to wait for answers to our prayers. And when the answer to prayer does come, and they always do come, we may not recognize it as an answer at first, and we will most likely not understand the timetable our Father in Heaven used to answer our prayer. Elder Robert D. Hales reminds us that&nbsp;"revelation comes on the Lord's timetable, which often means we must move forward in faith, even though we haven't received all the answers we desire."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, one Sunday afternoon, my wife received another prompting; this time the prompting was to ask&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;to give&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;a priesthood blessing. As a righteous daughter of God, knowing that the priesthood is intended for the family and that fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners,<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;she acted in faith and approached me for a blessing. I readily agreed, however, something happened during the blessing.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the two of us sat in our small apartment on that Sunday afternoon, I laid my hands upon her head to give her a priesthood blessing. Halfway through the blessing, in my mind, I saw a little girl, with brown curly hair and big blue eyes. The spirit whispered to me that this was our little girl, waiting, not so patiently, to come join our family.&nbsp;<br /><br />To this day, I do not recall any of the words mentioned in the blessing. I do remember ending the blessing quickly so that I could mention to my wife what I had seen while laying my hands upon her head.&nbsp;<br /><br />Within the year, we welcomed our first child, Hanna Rose, to our family. And yes, she was born with lots of brown curly hair and beautiful big blue eyes. When we submit to the will of the Father, "He changes our hearts to want what He wants and to act as He would act."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I love this about my wife: her ability to show forth-tremendous faith, submitting to the will of the Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />I also love the insight offered by Elder Neal A. Maxwell when he stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. The many other things we 'give,' are actually the things He has already given or loaned to us. However, when you and I finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only possession which is truly ours to give!"<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Fast-forward about two years down the road from this experience with my wife. I returned home from work one evening and found a freshly developed stack of pictures on our kitchen counter. This was back in the day when you actually took pictures with a camera, using film. One had to wait to get the film developed. It was always an exciting time to sit down and review freshly developed photos that had been taken over series of weeks, months, or even years. On a side note, there was no such thing as a selfie back then because no one wanted to waste precious film...oh the good ole' days!&nbsp;<br /><br />On this particular evening as I sat down and looked through the new photos with my wife, one specific photo stopped me altogether. As I pulled the photo from the pile, I asked my wife when she had taken this photo of our daughter Hanna. She explained it was simply a few weeks prior, on a day when they were laughing, singing, and dancing together in the kitchen. She asked me why I was so interested in that particular photo, to which I replied, "Because when I saw the vision of a little girl in heaven, with brown curly hair and big blue eyes waiting to join our family, this was the image I saw."&nbsp;<br /><br />My only worry with sharing this personal story is that sometimes we tend to think that personal revelation needs to be an overwhelming experience filled with unmistakable impressions. Elder Bednar stated that he talks, "with many individuals who question the strength of their personal testimony and underestimate their spiritual capacity because they do not receive frequent, miraculous, or strong impressions."&nbsp;<br /><br />He goes on to state that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Immediate and intense manifestations... found in the scriptures, recounted in Church history, and evidenced in our own lives... (tend) to be more rare than common.... Most frequently, revelation comes in small increments over time and is granted according to our desire, worthiness, and preparation. Such communications from Heavenly Father (happen) gradually and gently...This pattern of revelation tends to be more common than rare."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>By seeking spectacular or dramatic spiritual experiences, we may overlook the small and subtle messages of the Holy Ghost. "We may not see angels, hear heavenly voices, or receive overwhelming spiritual impressions."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, our goal should be one of constant personal evaluation to make sure we can feel the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. During this personal evaluation, we may realize a need to re-condition our hearts and minds.&nbsp;<br /><br />Likewise, every few years, my wife trains for another race. She will be the first to admit that each time she commits to a race; she needs a re-conditioning program. We too need re-conditioning from time-to-time regarding our quest for personal revelation. When it comes to a re-conditioning program, I have two suggestions that have worked for me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Document when during the day you have felt the Spirit.</p>
<p>First, you might consider documenting in your journal when during the day you felt the Spirit of the Lord or you followed a prompting. Much like President Henry B. Eyring taught in the October 2007 General Conference when he stated that each night he would ponder this question: "Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have felt this need to re-condition, each night before going to bed, I ponder and write just a few lines in my journal that start out with, "Today I felt the Spirit when..." It does not take much time or effort. Some days it is very easy and other days it takes a while to really stop and consider when, during the day, did I feel the Spirit or follow a prompting?&nbsp;<br /><br />If you will take the time to jot down these moments, I promise you that you will begin to see a pattern. And this is my second suggestion as to how we can re-condition ourselves to receive personal revelation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Look for patterns in your life that reveal a closeness to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Look for patterns in your life that reveal a closeness to the Spirit or look back on a time in your life when you felt a strong connection to the Spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />When re-conditioning, several of my journal entries end like this, "today I felt the Spirit during my personal scripture study" or "when I was sitting in the Temple" or "playing with one of my kids." Looking back on my journal entries and seeing these patterns, I realize that I need to spend more time doing these particular things.&nbsp;<br /><br />What I did not see was, "today I felt the Spirit when I was mindlessly watching TV, or playing video games, or engaged in frivolous social media content". Elder Richard G. Scott put it this way, "It is important that our daily activities do not distract us from listening to the Spirit."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />When you give heed to thoughts and impressions and document them in your journal, you will begin to see patterns in your life that reveal a closeness to the Spirit, and as such, you are in fact conditioning your heart and mind to react to the spirit of revelation.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can put this challenge to the test and begin now. At some time throughout this past hour, you may have felt the whispering of the spirit to do something, to make a change in your life, to contact a loved one, or to move forward on a decision you have been contemplating. If you have felt the spirit of revelation today to do something, show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of the spiritual prompting by courageously following that prompting.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />My hope and prayer is that each of us will exercise our ability to listen to the Spirit and receive personal revelation by conditioning our hearts and minds to feel the promptings of the Holy Ghost. As we strive for personal worthiness, act when called upon, and seek the will of the Lord, I am convinced that the Spirit, our Constant Companion,<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;will continue to do just that, constantly whisper to us. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus Member, First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Brother Spencer J. Condie was born in Preston, Idaho, and his family later moved to Pocatello, Idaho where he graduated from Pocatello High School. He served a mission in southern Germany where he met a lovely German missionary who would later become his eternal companion and the mother of their five children. Brother Condie received a bachelor's degree from BYU-Provo, his master's degree from the University of Utah and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>He served on the BYU faculty for fifteen years prior to being called as president of the Vienna Austria Mission, which also included the countries of Greece, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Hungary. In 1989 he was called to be a General Authority and was released 21 years later in October of 2010. He and Sister Condie have served in Church assignments in the Europe Area, Europe/Mediterranean Area, the Europe North Area, the New Zealand South Pacific Area and in the United States. From 2010 to 2013 they respectively served as temple president and matron of the Nauvoo Temple.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Old Testament prophet Amos declared, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). The Lord provided the children of Israel (and us today) with the test of a true prophet, "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously" (Deuteronomy 18:22; italics added).</p>
<p><br />Today I will discuss a few examples of the prophetic mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, which will hopefully confirm in the mind of every honest seeker of truth that Joseph Smith truly is a prophet, seer and revelator of the Most High God, the Prophet of the dispensation of the fullness of times.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Prophecy of the American Civil War</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On Christmas day 1832 the Prophet Joseph Smith received the following revelation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain . . ." (D&amp;C 87:1,3)</p>
<p>Had the Civil War begun only a few months following this prophecy a skeptic could have discounted the prophecy on the grounds that such a war was inevitable. &nbsp;But the first shots at Fort Sumter were not fired until April 12, 1861, twenty-eight years and four months after the prophecy had been recorded.&nbsp; The specificity of South Carolina as the starting point and the specific mention of British intervention in the Civil War truly confirm the authenticity of this prophecy.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dedicatory Prayer of the Kirtland Temple</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On March 27, 1836 in the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple the Prophet implored the Lord "to have mercy upon the children of Jacob, that&nbsp;<em>Jerusalem, from this hour, may begin to be redeemed</em>" (D&amp;C 109:62; italics added).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Since 1517 Jerusalem had been under the control of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. For many years the Jewish community had repeatedly requested permission to restore four ancient dilapidated synagogues, but all of their requests had been denied. Muhammad Ali was the viceroy of Egypt, and under his direction his son Ibrahim Pasha ruled Erez-Israel and Syria.&nbsp; In 1835 Pasha finally granted permission to restore the Jewish synagogues. The following year Muhammad Ali permitted the immigration of Eastern European Jews to Jerusalem, and the local Jewish population began to construct a new synagogue.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />On January 1, 1837 a devastating earthquake destroyed the northern Jewish cities of Tiberia and Safed.&nbsp; Most of those who survived this tragedy fled to Jerusalem for safety, thus causing the Jewish population to outnumber Christians and Muslims for the first time in centuries.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1838-39 the first European consuls took up residence in the Holy City to facilitate immigration and to assure the protection of their nation's citizens. &nbsp;Since the era of the Crusades, permanent residence permits had not been previously granted to any European infidels.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The rapid growth of the Jewish population following the Prophet Joseph's dedicatory prayer in 1836 is illustrated by the following table of population estimates:<sup>5,6,</sup><sup>7</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong></strong><img alt="Religion Chart" height="197" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/2014/Spring 2014/Graphics Spring 2014/Religion Chart.png" width="500" /><br /><br />In 1836 when the Prophet Joseph prayed that the children of Jacob would&nbsp;<em>from this hour</em>&nbsp;<em>begin to redeem Jerusalem</em>&nbsp;the Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem were the minority among Christians and Muslims. Within the next five years Jewish residents became the&nbsp;<em>predominant&nbsp;</em>religious group in Jerusalem. &nbsp;On August 1, 1840 Elder Orson Hyde dedicated the Holy Land for the return of the Jews. By the end of the Nineteenth Century the Jewish population comprised 64% of the total population of Jerusalem. The physical redemption of Jerusalem had, indeed, begun. The spiritual redemption is&nbsp;<em>yet to come</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 45:48-52; Zech. 12:9-10; 13:6; 14:4-21).&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>A Mighty People in the Midst of the Rocky Mountains</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On August 6, 1842 the Prophet recorded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, . . . and some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The fulfillment of this prophecy devolved upon Joseph's successor, Brigham Young, who, on February 4, 1846 led a vanguard of Saints across the Mississippi River en route to the Great Basin in the Utah Territory. Under Brigham Young's direction 358 colonies, towns and cities were established, comprising the "mighty people" of whom the Prophet Joseph had prophesied nearly four decades earlier.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Prophecy of Stephen A. Douglas's Political Future</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On May 18, 1843, the Prophet dined with Judge Stephen A. Douglas who was presiding at the court in Carthage, Hancock County. The Prophet's scribe on this occasion recorded that "After dinner Judge Douglas requested President Joseph to give him a history of the Missouri persecution, which he did in a very minute manner, for about three hours. . ."&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith then pronounced the following prophecy upon Stephen A. Douglas:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Judge, you will aspire to the presidency of the United States; and if ever you turn your hand against me or the Latter-day Saints, you will feel the weight of the hand of the Almighty upon you; and you will live to see and know that I have testified the truth to you; for the conversation of this day will stick to you through life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He [Judge Douglas] appeared very friendly, and acknowledged the truth and propriety of President Smith's remarks."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>In 1843 Stephen A. Douglas was a young man thirty years of age and was not nationally well known. However, in 1857 he delivered a speech in Springfield, Illinois regarding the rumors, which had been circulated throughout the United States concerning crimes, treason, and rebellion among the Mormons in the Utah territory. The crux of his message was:</p>
<p>"Should such a state of things actually exist as we are led to infer from the reports . . . the knife must be applied to this pestiferous, disgusting cancer which is gnawing into the very vitals of the body politic."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Three years later in June of 1860 at the National Democratic Convention held in Charleston, South Carolina Stephen A. Douglas was nominated for the presidency of the United States, just as Joseph Smith had prophesied seventeen years previously. In the general election later that year Abraham Lincoln carried 18 states; Mr. Breckinridge 11; Mr. Bell 3; and Stephen A. Douglas one. Within a year, with his political aspirations dashed and unfulfilled, Stephen A. Douglas died at his home in Chicago "a disappointed, not to say heart-broken man."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Word of Wisdom</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />As a life-long advocate of the Word of Wisdom, Elder John A. Widtsoe (1872-1952), himself a scientist, eloquently testified that the foresight of the revelation of the Word of Wisdom confirms Joseph's prophetic calling:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is a marvelous thing that a boy of western New York, untaught in the ways of the world, unacquainted with the sciences of this day, unfamiliar with the universities and the learning thereof, should be able to speak in such a manner, at a time when science was in it swaddling clothes, and to be found correct in his teaching and in full harmony with the most recent findings of modern science. &nbsp;We are very grateful that wherever we turn in the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith we find evidences of the divine wisdom and inspiration in all that he did."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Two UCLA professors of epidemiology, James E. Enstrom and Lester Breslow, conducted a longitudinal study of over 9,800 Latter-day Saint couples from 1980 to 2004 and compared their longevity to a large comparative sample of non-LDS males and females. Their findings were published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Preventive Medicine</em>&nbsp;in February of 2008. Their research indicated that Latter-day Saint females have a life expectancy of 86 years, 5.6 years longer than their non-LDS counterparts. Latter-day Saint men had a life expectancy of 84.1 years, 9.8 years longer than those men not of the LDS faith.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Book of Mormon</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />You have often heard it said that if the Book of Mormon is true, then Joseph Smith must be a true prophet, because he was the Lord's instrument in bringing forth the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />With regard to spiritual matters, the Apostle Paul hit the nail on the head when he taught the Corinthians that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley similarly taught us that "The Holy Ghost is the Testifier of truth, who can teach men things they cannot teach one another."<sup>15</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>In sharing his testimony of the Book of Mormon, President Gordon B. Hinckley declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The evidence for its truth, for its validity in a world that is prone to demand evidence, lies not in archaeology or anthropology, though these may be helpful to some. It lies not in word research or historical analysis, though these may be confirmatory. The evidence for its truth and validity lies within the covers of the book itself. The test of its truth lies in reading it. It is a book of God."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Thirty years ago, while I was serving as a mission president in Austria, a bright young man came to see me in the mission office.&nbsp; He had received a few of the missionary discussions and was concerned that the missionaries promised him if he would read the Book of Mormon and pray about it he would know it was true.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Well, Herr President," he said, "I've started to read the Book of Mormon, but to tell you the truth that book is drier than the Vienna telephone directory."&nbsp;<br /><br />I replied, "Michael, perhaps we could try reading a sample from the middle of the Book," and I opened up the Book of Mormon to Third Nephi Chapter 17, the moving account of the Savior's healing of the sick, &nbsp;blessing of the little children, and praying to the Father in their presence.&nbsp; I suggested that I read a verse and then we could alternate and he would read every other verse.&nbsp; As we proceeded to read that chapter, tears began to trickle down his cheeks, and as we concluded the chapter he said, "I'm going home to read the whole book." And he did. A few weeks later he was baptized and he has remained faithful to his covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the very first chapter of the Book of Mormon young Nephi recounts a vision of his father, Lehi, who "saw the heavens open" and "he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day. And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament. And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should read. And it came to pass that&nbsp;<em>as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord</em>" (1 Nephi 8-12).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the promise that young Austrian brother claimed as he read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover.&nbsp; That is also the concluding promise of Moroni in the last chapter of the Book:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"and when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost" (Moroni 10:4).</p>
<p>In the closing verses of the Book of Mormon, Moroni extends an eloquent, divinely inspired invitation to each of us to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God" (Moroni 10:32).</p>
<p>The Spirit has borne witness to me these words are not only true, they are important--a matter of eternal significance, and I have an obligation to strive with all my might to accept Moroni's invitation to undergo a mighty change of heart and to come unto Christ.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee counseled the members of the Church:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Don't be concerned over Book of Mormon geography.&nbsp; Some say the Hill Cumorah was in southern Mexico (and someone pushed it down still farther) and not in western New York. Well, if the Lord wanted us to know where it was or where Zarahemla was, He'd have given us latitude and longitude, don't you think?"<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>My young friends, I read the Book of Mormon for the life-saving doctrine and the inspiring, comforting counsel contained therein and because, like Lehi of old, when I read, I am filled with the Spirit of the Lord (1 Nephi 1:12).&nbsp;<br /><br />A few Latter-day Saints have questioned the Angel Moroni's declaration to Joseph Smith that the golden plates contain "the fullness of the everlasting Gospel" (JSH-1:34).&nbsp; If temple worship is part of the fullness, they reason, why is it not mentioned in the Book of Mormon? The late Hugh Nibley observed that temple doctrines and ordinances "are everywhere in the book if we know where to look for them, and a dozen or so discourses on the Atonement in the Book of Mormon are replete with temple imagery."<sup>18</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Restoration of Holy Temples&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />One evening the Savior received an unexpected visit from "Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."&nbsp; He was a man of good will who addressed the Savior:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:1,2,5).</p>
<p>Therein the Savior established baptism as a universal requirement of all mankind who aspire to regain the presence of God. To underscore this universal commandment the Savior himself sought baptism at the hand of John the Baptist in order to "fulfill all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15).&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon the prophet Nephi explained that the Savior fulfilled all righteousness by humbling himself before the Father and by witnessing "unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments." The baptism of Christ also showed "the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them"&nbsp; (2 Nephi 31:6-9).&nbsp;<br /><br />Baptism would be required of all,&nbsp;<em>but what of those who died without the opportunity of</em>&nbsp;<em>being baptized</em>?&nbsp;<br /><br />In January of 1841 in Nauvoo the Lord revealed that "a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead--For this ordinance belongeth to my house" (D&amp;C 124:29-30). He then commanded the Saints:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"to build a house unto me . . . And . . .let this house be built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people; For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fullness of times" (D&amp;C 124:31, 40-41).</p>
<p>Anxious to obey the Lord's commandment, the Saints began to excavate the site for the Nauvoo Temple. Though the entire temple would not be dedicated for another five years, within ten months of the revelation they had constructed a large, magnificent baptismal font of wood resting upon the backs of twelve beautifully carved life-size oxen representing the twelve tribes of Israel as described in First Kings 7:23-26. The font was dedicated on November 8, 1841 and the wonderful work of baptisms for the dead culminated in the performance of thousands of baptisms in the Nauvoo Temple&gt;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restoration of other temple ordinances through the Prophet Joseph Smith is yet another confirmation of his prophetic role. On May 4, 1842 the Prophet Joseph convened several of the brethren in the upper room of the red brick store. Perhaps sensing that he may not be alive to see the completion of the Nauvoo Temple, Joseph instructed them "in the principles and order of the Priesthood, attending to washings, anointings, [and] endowments" and he "instituted the ancient order of things for the first time in these last days." &nbsp;Furthermore, Joseph explained that "there was nothing made known to these men but what will be made known to all the Saints of the last days, so soon as they are prepared to receive, and a proper place is prepared to communicate them."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the final months of completing the Nauvoo Temple the attic story was dedicated on November 30, 1845 for the performance of the temple endowment, and 5,634 individuals were subsequently endowed before the Saints were driven from Nauvoo two months later.<sup>21</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>The completion and dedication of the entire temple nearly two years after the Prophet's death and the subsequent dedication of another 140 temples in our day further confirm Joseph's prophetic calling under divine direction.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some temples are large with many rooms and others are relatively small with fewer rooms, but the size of the temple or the mode of instruction is of lesser importance than the covenants we make and the promised blessings we receive. There are a few members who get a little nervous when various aspects of the temple endowment are slightly modified. We all believe in prophets, seers and continuous revelation, but, my, how we resist change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Apostle Paul had difficulty convincing the Galatians to let go of their traditions bound up in the law of Moses as he explained to them that "the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" (Galatians 3:24). Paul had a similar challenge with the Hebrews teaching them that Christ "is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises" (Hebrews 8:6). It is in the Holy Temple that we make better covenants established upon better promises. The creation of the earth, the gift of moral agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve and their redemption, and our redemption through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the covenants and promises inherent in temple ordinances are at the heart of the endowment and&nbsp;<em>these will always remain the same.</em>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The First Vision</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />During the unfolding of the Restoration of all things, several priesthood keys were restored. The resurrected John the Baptist restored the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery near the Susquehanna River (D&amp;C 13). Peter, James and John restored the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood to Joseph and Oliver between Harmony, Pennsylvania and Colesville, New York (D&amp;C 128:20). In the Kirtland Temple Moses appeared to Joseph and Oliver and restored "the keys of the gathering of Israel."&nbsp; Elias appeared and restored the keys of "the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham," and Elijah appeared and restored the keys of the sealing power "To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers" (D&amp;C 110:11-16).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As the Book of Mormon came forth, in keeping with a prophecy of the law of witnesses (2 Nephi 27:12), there were three men who were shown the golden plates in the presence of an angel. On another occasion, eight additional men of good character actually hefted and handled the gold plates. A few years later, when Joseph beheld the vision of the three degrees of glory Sydney Rigdon was also privileged to behold the same vision and to serve as a second witness of the content of that glorious vision (D&amp;C 76).&nbsp;<br /><br />But there are some individuals who fail to accept the First Vision in the spring of 1820 on the grounds that we must depend solely on Joseph's word alone, for there were no other witnesses present. To those who doubt, may I share the counsel of a Latter-day Saint lawyer and judge, "If you want to know if Joseph Smith really did see the Father and the Son, just ask God--He was there!"&nbsp; We&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;have witnesses!&nbsp;<br /><br />After living in the City of Joseph for the past three years and worshiping almost daily in the Nauvoo Temple, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, heart or soul that this great work is true--all of it! The scriptures we have received through the Prophet Joseph Smith are all true.&nbsp; He did not write the Book of Mormon or the Doctrine and Covenants, (with the exception of a few epistles), or the Books of Abraham and Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, but he was the Lord's conduit through whom those living waters flowed. The Savior Himself testified of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words" (D&amp;C 18:34-36).</p>
<p>I conclude with an invitation to "Come, listen to a living prophet's voice and hear the word of the Lord" in the name of Jesus Christ amen.</p>

<p>Second Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Carlson was born in Minnesota and is a convert to the Church. He spent most of his youth in northern Minnesota in what was, at the time, a part-member family where opportunities to attend Church were non-existent for most of that period of his life. As a result of his mother's influence, he joined the Church his senior year in High School when his family moved to the central part of the state where a branch of the Church was organized. He met, dated, and baptized his future wife, Vicki, when he was in college and she was a senior in high school.&nbsp; They were married between Bruce's junior and senior year in college and were sealed two years later in the Salt Lake Temple.<br /><br />In 1971, Elder Carlson was commissioned into the Air Force as a distinguished graduate from the ROTC program following graduation from the University of Minnesota, Duluth and reported immediately to Vance AFB, Oklahoma for Flight School. Since that time he has accumulated over 3,500 hours of flying time in several Air Force aircraft to include the F-4, Phantom, OV-10 Bronco, A-10 Warthog, F-16 Fighting Falcon, EF-111 Raven, B-52 Stratofortress, and F-117 Nighthawk, stealth fighter.&nbsp; He has served on the staff's of the Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of Defense and on the Joint Staff and has commanded an Air Force stealth fighter wing, the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico and the Air Force's bomber and Global Strike Numbered Air Force, the Mighty Eighth (8<sup>th</sup> Air Force) at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. &nbsp; <br /><br />In his final Air Force assignment as an Air Force General he commanded Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), headquartered at Wright Patterson AFB, OH.&nbsp; AFMC is an organization of 73,000 people with an annual operating budget of over $7 billion. As its commander, Elder Carlson oversaw the Air Force's technology development, provided acquisition support and advice to AF civilian acquisition executives, managed AF test and evaluation and all AF sustainment and logistics operations. He retired as an Air Force General (4-star) on 1 January 2009. &nbsp; <br /><br />Following his retirement from the Air Force and prior to his call to the Seventy, Elder Carlson owned and operated a small defense consulting business. Following his call to serve as a member of the Seventy in April 2009 the Administration asked that Elder Carlson return to Government service as the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in Washington DC. The Church approved that move and he acted in that position concurrently with his Church service from July 2009 until July 2012 when the Brethren asked him to return to full-time Church service. As the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office headquartered in Washington DC he supervised the development, acquisition, testing, launch, and operation of the Nation's reconnaissance constellation and its associated ground system. Since his return to full-time Church service he has served at Church Headquarters in Salt Lake City where he assists administering the Middle East/Africa North Area and on several general Church committees.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Carlson, Vicki, and their three children moved over twenty time during their more than 37 years of Air Force service. During that time Elder Carlson served in the Young Men's organization, the Church-sponsored Boy Scout program, as an Elder's Quorum President, High Priest Group leader, a Bishop's counselor, a Bishop, as a Stake Missionary, Stake Executive Secretary, and on the Stake High Council. &nbsp; <br /><br />They are the parents of two boys and a girl, all of whom are married. They have eleven grandchildren, six boys and five girls. Their oldest son, Bryan is an Air Force fighter pilot serving in the Texas Air National Guard, their daughter Jani is a homemaker in Houston, Texas, and their youngest son, Scott, is an aircraft structural engineer at Hill Field, Utah. The Carlson's currently reside in Bountiful, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />President and Sister Clark, other distinguished guests and students of this remarkable and growing institution. I hope you continue to enjoy your college experience as much as I did. I felt like it was one of the most enlightening and challenging experiences of my life. My last year as a full-time student and as a newly married man, it provided Vicki and me with some remarkable opportunities to learn to depend on one another and to make important joint decisions. We also had a wonderful time together. I learned that being married was sure a lot more enjoyable than living in the dorm and dating.&nbsp;<br /><br />We made some big decisions during that last year of school together. One of them was that I would follow a career in the United States Air Force and would pursue becoming a fighter pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Just a year after my college graduation, then as a young Air Force pilot recently graduated from flight school, I was assigned to check out in the F-4 Phantom.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Phantom was the topline fighter of its day and it could carry twice the normal bomb-load of a World War II-era B-17 bomber. McDonnell Douglas built over 5,000 F-4s&shy;&shy;--more than 2,600 for the USAF. Even though it originally entered service in 1960, it continued to play a vital combat role up through Operation DESERT STORM until it was retired in 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was big, loud, powerful and very good at doing just about anything you asked it to do. It was predictable, but difficult to land with finesse.&nbsp; However, it made you feel nearly 10 feet tall and bullet-proof when you were going 800 mph close to the ground or nearly Mach 2 at high altitude. I loved every minute I flew that jet.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, it had a quirk called "adverse yaw." This meant at high angles of attack, which were commonplace whenever you aggressively maneuvered the aircraft for a ground or air attack, you had to be very careful or the aircraft could depart controlled flight or go "out-of-control."&nbsp;<br /><br />Adverse yaw in the Phantom meant that if you were trying to turn left at high AoA and the pilot moved the stick to the left, the downward-deflected aileron on the right wing would actually produce more drag than lift, causing the Phantom to yaw back to the right even though the pilot thought he was commanding a left turn. As the yaw increased, the effective sweep on the left wing decreased and it would start to produce more lift and the F-4 would snap-roll to the right and then, if not corrected immediately, go out of control and enter a spin. All this would happen instantly if the aircraft was at a high state of energy (going fast) and not so quickly if the aircraft was at a low energy state (going slow.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To compensate for adverse yaw when rolling at high angles of attack the pilot would center the stick and use the rudder aggressively in the direction of the turn. So a left turn at high angles of attack meant keeping the stick centered and pushing on the left rudder pedal. That action caused the Phantom to yaw to the left decreasing the effective sweep on the right wing creating more lift and the plane would crisply roll to the left as commanded.&nbsp; However, this took a lot of discipline and practice because it was not the common way to fly most airplanes--it wasn't the way we had been taught to fly in Flight School.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of the difficulty in controlling the Phantom at high angles of attack it was suspected that a significant number of F-4 combat losses were actually due to the pilot not recognizing adverse yaw conditions or his failure to use the proper recovery procedures after he encountered adverse yaw, its resultant snap roll or the out of control condition that could ensue very rapidly.&nbsp;So, to counter these aircraft losses the Air Force introduced a very aggressive training program aimed at teaching all of us to use proper control techniques at high angles of attack.&nbsp; Equally important was learning what to do automatically if we ever sensed the aircraft was beginning to do anything we hadn't commanded it to do or if we thought it was going "out-of-control."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We practiced out-of-control procedures almost endlessly on the ground, in the simulator and also in the aircraft.&nbsp; Even though it's been over 40 years since I flew the Phantom I can still remember the out-of-control procedure.&nbsp; It was so important that we called it a b<strong>old face&nbsp;</strong>emergency procedure.&nbsp; That meant you had to know it by memory, you had to be able to execute it blindfolded and you had to demonstrate that you could recognize any out-of-control condition that called for that action. That bold face&nbsp;emergency procedure was this:</p>
<p>It was so important that each week before we flew we had to complete a&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;test perfectly.&nbsp; Even the slightest deviation from the precise procedure would mean the pilot was grounded for a week and would have to undergo considerable extra ground training before being allowed back in the jet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Just like in the Phantom, where I knew exactly what I would do if I ever encountered any out of control situation, I believe that if we make a choice ahead of time and know exactly what we will do with regard to a certain situation, in other words if we have a set of&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;actions set in our mind as the best alternative for a specific situation, we will be able to outperform others who are still thinking about what they are going to do in that setting.&nbsp;<br /><br />We simply need to know that. For instance, when we are confronted with a pornographic image on our TV or computer screen we will immediately flee just as Joseph in Egypt fled from Potiphar's wife. When we are offered alcohol we should know exactly what we are going to say and do. When the crowd says lets go to an R-rated movie we should know precisely what our response is going to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we know exactly what we are going to do, when we have prepared ourselves for action at a time of crisis or temptation then we will be much better able to execute our defenses against evil influences.&nbsp; I guess the Boy Scouts have had it right for over 100 years with their motto: Be Prepared.&nbsp;<br /><br />In today's information age, sometimes, significant damage is done to our minds and spirits simply while some of us are trying to make up our minds about what we should do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan has developed his techniques skillfully. He knows our weaknesses, he knows when we are at our weakest and most vulnerable state, and he knows what we are most susceptible to. I am confident that he has prepared well for the moment that he levels one of his most powerful temptations on us. If we already know what our response is going to be the time to make a choice is cut to zero. Then, we simply implement our&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;procedure and, as it was in my analogy, we aright the aircraft and zoom out of what could have been a very dangerous, critical, or maybe even life-altering situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you haven't already done so make up your mind right now about what you will do on Friday night at midnight when you find yourself out of your comfort zone.&nbsp; If you have a set of actions in mind now and rehearse them; when that tempting moment arrives the Holy Ghost will give you the power to exercise your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then instead of being riddled with guilt you will, alternatively, soon find yourself at home kneeling by your bedside gratefully acknowledging the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost as it gave you the courage you needed to say "no" at a time when temptations were their strongest and your defenses weren't as strong as they might be on Sunday during the Sacrament.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have all learned that during our pre-mortal existence the first and most important principle pertaining to our eternal destiny was that of moral agency. In fact we learn from modern-day scripture that there is an eternal law informing each of us, that through the choices we make, we will shape our own destiny. Our growth or our failure, our happiness or our despair, depends on the choices we make each day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Long ago as we were once considering the remarkable gift of moral agency in a great pre-mortal council in heaven we shouted for joy as the Father's plan to organize and people the earth was explained to us. He explained that each of us, as his spirit children, would go to earth, gain bodies of flesh and blood, and be tried, tested and proven in all things to see if we would keep all of His commandments. We learned that through obedience to the covenants we made we could return back to His eternal presence in a much more glorified state than we were in our pre-mortal condition.&nbsp;<br /><br />That critical first principle, moral agency, began to play a very important part in our activity while we were yet in our pre-mortal life. Lucifer, one of God's spirit children, proposed to alter the Father's Plan. He declared that he would redeem all mankind. In fact he guaranteed that not one soul would be lost, for which he demanded the honor and glory of the Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course Father's plan would allow all men to choose for themselves, and the glory would go to the Father. At that time each of us worked diligently to ensure that Heavenly Father's plan was accepted. All who now have been and those yet to come to earth with bodies of flesh and blood elected in that great council to follow the Father's Plan of Happiness. We each made one of the most important choices of our eternal existence while still in that pre-mortal state, long before we came to this earth, in choosing to support Heavenly Father's eternal Plan of Salvation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />The Plan of Salvation was accepted by a majority of those who were there with us and sadly Satan and a third of the hosts of heaven rebelled forfeiting their opportunity to continue to progress, experience mortality or ever win the reward of Eternal Life.&nbsp;<br /><br />As recorded in Moses, God said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the moral agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;voice" (Moses 4: 3-4.)</p>
<p>Satan and his followers, swore they would destroy our moral agency or power of choice and they would do everything in their power to annihilate Father's Plan. Satan began his work immediately in the Garden of Eden by tempting Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit. Remember Father had commanded Adam and Eve:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3: 16-17.)</p>
<p>In the beginning we learned that with the power to make choices would necessarily come opposition.&nbsp; Nephi knew that as well when he wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, ... righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2: 11, 16.)</p>
<p>While Satan is determined to destroy Father's Plan as well as you and me, Heavenly Father has assured us that "this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus Christ gave His life so that all who left on this mortal journey might enjoy immortality. Additionally, those, who through His gospel, learn and follow His commandments will be given a clear understanding of the purpose of this life and learn how to make proper choices between right and wrong. For those who are successful there is a resultant promise of eternal reward. This, despite Satan's commitment to encircle us with his chains and lead us carefully down to hell.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember the council Lehi gave to his two eldest sons:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, my sons, I would that&nbsp;<em>ye should look to the great Mediator</em>, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and&nbsp;<em>choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit</em>;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And&nbsp;<em>not choose eternal death</em>, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the&nbsp;<em>spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell</em>, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom." (2 Nephi 2: 27-29 italics added.)</p>
<p>Proper choices are enabled by self-discipline. In fact it's critical to making the right choices. My father used to remind me that it is much easier to drift than to row, to slide downhill than to climb back up. Satan knows that and he is continuously at work to drag us down by placing temptations in our way in the form of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, deceit, dishonesty, and flattery. Then he waits to catch us when we yield so that he can belittle us for making a bad choice. The irony of all of this is that after we have sinned and fallen short Satan will attempt to convince us that we are not worthy of God's infinite grace, any further influence of the Holy Ghost or the promises of the Atonement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The disturbing conditions in today's world with it's wars, suffering, sin, poverty, and disease have lead many to question why a loving God would allow such terrible conditions to plague us. We must remember that it is not God but man himself who is responsible for much of the evil that damages lives, destroys families and cripples society. Even though the wicked as well as the innocent suffer together in many cases, much of the abuse, distress, depression, despair, and enslavement in the world would disappear if we all would simply choose to follow the Great and Eternal Gospel Plan of Happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Plato said, "The first and best victory is to conquer self; to be conquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile."&nbsp;<br /><br />And another great philosopher and inventor, Leonardo da Vinci wrote, "You will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself." He continued, "The height of a man's success is gauged by his self-mastery; the depth of his failure by his self-abandonment. ... And this law is the expression of eternal justice. He who cannot establish dominion over himself will have no dominion over others."&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures seem to confirm that these two great thinkers were correct.&nbsp; The great king, poet, and religious philosopher, Solomon said, "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city" (Proverbs 16;32)&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior said it very clearly when He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." (Matthew 7: 13-14)</p>
<p>Some will say, "if I make all of those tough choices now I have, in essence, taken away my own moral agency or you want me to commit to a certain path without ever getting to see what's really ahead." No, all I want you to do is make the tough life threatening choices now, the ones that can potentially derail you from your eternal goals. When I flew the F-4 we didn't have a bold face&nbsp;emergency procedure for a small and inconsequential airborne situation such as low pneumatic pressure or a failed dc electric bus. We had backup systems that would compensate for those minor conditions, but we sure did have a&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;procedure one for 'fire-in-flight' and 'out-of-control.'&nbsp;<br /><br />Some may protest and say that following the straight and narrow path requires limitations, restrictions, overcoming, and doing without things that are fun. However hard the straight and narrow path is, it remains the only path that guarantees victory and accomplishment of our stated goal--the goal we promised Heavenly Father when we left His presence, the goal of returning to Him with honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Narrow" is a very significant word. When you chose this path and then follow it some will accuse you of being parochial or close-minded and I agree it certainly does require self-control and even some self-denial. That one and only path will restrain or limit us in certain areas. But we must also recognize that it does not handcuff or shackle any one of us. On the contrary, it is the way to deliverance, independence, and freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The heights by great men reached and keptWere not attained by sudden flight,But they, while their companions slept,Were toiling upward in the night."</p>
<p>If you want to be successful or outstanding in anything you do, it is critical that you decide while you are young to be a great boy, and not wait to be a man. So then you can decide to be a great man, and then instantly develop the courage, strength, and resolve to discipline yourself.&nbsp; Instead apply self-discipline and the power of moral agency to your actions today--this instant.&nbsp; Decide now, don't wait, simply decide and then follow through.</p>
<p>You know what many of those big decisions are, and many of you have a pretty good idea of when and where you could be placed in a situation where you will be forced to make one of those decisions. While you are in a quiet place, maybe when you are saying your prayers this evening, or when you are studying your scriptures or better yet, while you are sitting right here this afternoon, think about one or two of those temptations or situations that you know you need to deal with. Decide now what you are going to do and then ask your Father in Heaven for His divine assistance as you work hard to correct something that you know displeases Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago when I was serving as a Bishop I worked with a man who had a problem with pornography. As he struggled to rid himself of this evil influence one of his&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;procedures was when he traveled alone on a business trip and stayed in a hotel he would unplug the TV as soon as he got in the room. Now there was simply no way to watch even questionable material. He had made up his mind ahead of time and because he had done that and prayed for Heavenly assistance, a difficult and troubling setting was now behind him.&nbsp;<br /><br />During that same time I counseled with a woman who had a terrible problem with her temper. She would fly off the handle in rage at the slightest provocation. She was a good hearted, loving person but that single flaw made making and keeping friends difficult and of course it meant sustaining any long-term relationship such as engagement to a man absolutely impossible.&nbsp; She developed a great&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>procedure that took months of determined practice to solidify in her mind and behavior.&nbsp; That action was to simply count to 10 before she ever opened her mouth in anger and while doing that recite the words of one of our most well known hymns:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"More holiness give me, More striving within<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More patience in suffering, More sorrow for sin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More faith in my Savior, More sense of his care<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More joy in His service, More purpose in prayer<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More gratitude give me, More trust in the Lord<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More pride in his glory, More hope in his word<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More tears for his sorrows, More pain at his grief,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More meekness in trail, More praise for relief."<br />&nbsp;<br />According to her, after practicing this she usually never made it through the second verse before she was able to control her feelings and respond graciously or even with humor. Her application of a&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;procedure helped her find genuine happiness and fulfillment as a wife and mother.&nbsp;<br /><br />My young friends, I believe that the single power that each of us independently possesses, if used correctly, can practically guarantee our success in our struggle to return back Home is the proper exercise of our moral agency or<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>the power of choice</strong><strong>!</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Think about it. You and I are where we are today because of the choices we have made. Unwise choices repeated over and over lead to failure, frustration and even depression.&nbsp; On the other hand, wise choices repeated regularly lead to success. It's hard but it's not complicated or difficult to understand. Is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But what do we do with the unwise decisions we've made in the past? And more importantly, what do we do with the unwise decisions we might make in the future? Do unwise decisions mean our road back home to Eternal Life is destined to hit a dead end?&nbsp;<br /><br />No. The remarkable Plan of Happiness provides you the opportunity to get back on course. Whatever you do, don't waste time beating yourself up. Instead, execute the right<strong>&nbsp;</strong>bold face&nbsp;procedure, put on your learning cap and do what you know to be right. Use the power of choice! Ask yourself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bottom line, your life is the outcome of the choices you make. If you don't like the outcomes you are currently experiencing, put the power of choice to work for you. Very simply, different choices do produce different results.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When we make the right choices we should be happiest of all people because we have some things that no one else in the world has. Please allow me to mention just a few:</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is true that we don't always walk in the light. But we can consistently walk toward the light because we know about that light and we know what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We have the promise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.&nbsp; For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore&nbsp;<em>the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand</em>" (D&amp;C 58: 3, 4, italics added.)</p>
<p>My young friends, each of us have at least one challenge that could benefit from building, knowing and practicing a&nbsp;<strong>bold face</strong>&nbsp;choice right now. I testify that as we consistently make the right choice the blessings of the Lord will multiply in our individual lives.&nbsp; The Lord is waiting to bless you for your righteous choices.&nbsp; His only Son's Atoning sacrifice is the one and only &nbsp;way to return to that straight and narrow path where consistent right choices will bring us home to Him.&nbsp; It is my prayer that each of you will have the courage to implement this principle into your life in a way that will benefit you and bring you closer to our loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you for taking some time out of your busy schedules to gather here today in this devotional setting wherever you are. &nbsp;What a great privilege it is to be associated with you at this University. I have sought heaven's help in preparing today's message and invite the spirit to be with us. If you are taking notes, I would invite you to write down the thoughts, impressions, and feelings that come into your mind. Those impressions are from the Lord and are intended for you, and are more important than what I might say.<br /><br />In order for you to better understand the message I have prepared, you need to know a little about my past. I grew up on a farm in southern Idaho and there learned not only to work hard, but to play hard as well. I also have a brother that is 15 months older than me. Because of our closeness in age we did everything together, and to keep us busy and out of trouble, my parents encouraged us to be involved in sports. Early on in my upbringing I found that I liked the feeling of accomplishment, the thrill of achieving my goals, and that I was pretty good in sports, especially running. I competed in track and field in high school, then for four years as a Decathlete throughout college, experiencing some success along the way. After graduating, I accepted an invitation to join the university where I have been able to help others achieve their own successes, both as a coach and as an administrator.&nbsp;<br /><br />The sports industry is a big business and seems to always have a large fan base and media presence.&nbsp; Stories fill the air when an athlete or coach has made a mistake or done something wrong. With the media focusing on the bad, it would be easy to overlook and discount the good that can be learned from being involved in sports. While I have enjoyed the good that sports has to offer, I've also learned that, in and of themselves, sports really aren't all that important.&nbsp; But for me they were, because through sports I've learned some valuable life lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter what your major is, what you've chosen as a career, or what extracurricular activities you're involved in, application to the gospel can be found all around us if we choose to see it. Today I'd like to share five lessons I've learned through sports.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Lesson #1 - The Lord loves us and wants us to succeed</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />As a father, I want the very best for my children. I hurt when they hurt, I rejoice in their accomplishments, and I love them unconditionally.&nbsp; Just as I want what is best for my children, I know that as children of a loving Father in Heaven, He too wants what is best for us, and I testify He wants us to succeed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moses 1:39 states: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." We have come to earth to be tried and tested but the Lord will always provide a way when we are faithful.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the Children of Israel were fleeing out of Egypt they were being pursued by the Egyptians who caught up to them on the banks of the Red Sea. In a state of panic and with nowhere to turn, the Children of Israel were complaining to Moses about the situation they found themselves in. Moses responded and taught them a powerful lesson; Said he:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Moses then parted the Red Sea and the Children of Israel crossed on dry ground.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example comes from the Book of Mormon. The Jaradites were instructed to leave their land and go to a "land of promise ... which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;After reaching the sea they set up their camp and spent the next four years there, at last they were instructed to build some barges in which they would cross the sea. These barges were tight and did not have any light in them.&nbsp; The brother of Jared cried unto the Lord asking "wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;To which the Lord responded by asking the brother of Jared some questions, then sent him off to exercise his agency, or to act for himself. The brother of Jared went to a&nbsp;high mountain and "did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones"<sup>5</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>and presented them to the Lord.&nbsp; Said he:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and&nbsp;<em>can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man</em>; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness...that we may have light while we shall cross the sea."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The Lord then touched the stones and made them shine so they would have light in their boats.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In these stories we learn that the Lord will come to our aid in times of need, but not until there is a significant effort on our part or "after all we can do."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Henry Marsh, a member of the Church, was a world class steeple chase athlete in the late 1970's and early 1980's.&nbsp; In an interview about his experiences he acknowledged the Lord in his success. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I definitely feel the Lord cares whether I win or lose, and I feel that He has had an impact on my racing career.&nbsp; I take the philosophy that you work as hard as if everything depended on you, and pray as if everything depended on the Lord.&nbsp; I think the Lord takes care of you if you prepare yourself so that he can and if you put him first in your life.&nbsp; If you do these things, he can enlarge you so that you can do more than you are personally capable of.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I get the feeling that He wants me to excel in this for some reason..."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>There is a reason the Lord wants us to excel, in 3 Nephi 12:14-16 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Therefore let your light so shine before this people,&nbsp;<em>that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven</em>" (emphasis added.)</p>
<p>The Lord will not ask us to do things that are out of our reach or are impossible. He has said that if we keep the commandments he will strengthen us and provide the means necessary to accomplish the things he has commanded us to do.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Brother Marsh had the feelings that the Lord wanted him to excel? The Lord wants us to succeed so that we can help further His purposes, we are on His team and by being on His team, we will not fail.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Lesson #2 - The path to success isn't easy</strong><br /><br />In sports, the difference between success and what some perceive as failure, can be measured by as little as a hundredth of a second or a fraction of an inch. I like to watch sports on TV, and often see athletes celebrating after winning a championship event. Many of them however are not just celebrating the win, they are also celebrating the long journey they traveled in order to reach that crowning moment. Usually a quick google search uncovers there is more to their stories than what meets the eye.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps you can think of an athlete or another individual whose path to success was hindered by injury, illness, or other difficulties. Things didn't go exactly as they had hoped or planned. Those who overcome seemingly insurmountable odds know that trials will, in the end, make them stronger and thus they continue pursuing their goals.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are a few examples:&nbsp;<br /><br />Bethany Hamilton was 13 when she was attacked by a 14 foot tiger shark and lost her left arm. But that didn't stop her from reaching her goal of becoming a professional surfer.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Charlotte Brown developed cataracts when she was 16 weeks old and now, at 16 years old, is blind. But she learned to overcome her physical impairment and is achieving success and some national attention as a pole vaulter.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Noelle Pikus-Pace was among the favorites to medal in skeleton in the 2006 Winter Olympics. A few months prior to the Games she was hit by a runaway bobsled which left her with a broken leg, and was unable to compete. Then, as we saw in the last Olympic Games, eight years later, she won a silver medal.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />You'll notice that the trial in each of these examples is different, but each individual had to face a difficult challenge head on.&nbsp; It would have been easy to give up, but they persevered.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the scriptures we also find examples of individuals who had to work through adversity in order to accomplish what the Lord asked them to do. In 1 Nephi chapters 3-4 we learn that after Lehi and his family left Jerusalem, the Lord commanded Lehi's sons (Laman, Lemuel, Nephi, and Sam) to return to Jerusalem to get the brass plates from Laban. Their first attempt to acquire the plates was to reason with Laban but resulted in Laman being thrown out, accused of being a robber, and threatened to be killed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Their second attempt was to try and trade worldly riches for the plates. When Laban saw how much they had brought with them, he lust after it, then thrust them out, and sent his servants to slay them in order to take possession of it. To save their own lives, Nephi and his brothers fled and hid in the wilderness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Laman and Lemuel were upset and were starting to take it out on Nephi and Sam, when an angel appeared and instructed them to go back to Jerusalem again and that Laban would be delivered into their hands so they could acquire the brass plates. Even after this visitation Laman and Lemuel were not excited about going back. But with some faith, and a little arm twisting, they returned with Nephi as they had been instructed. And as promised, Laban was delivered into their hands and they did obtain the plates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life, we learn about a great and spacious building that was "filled with people... mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come..."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I've learned that there will be many people along your path like those in the great and spacious building.&nbsp; They will try to make you believe that you can't do hard things. They will try to discourage you, try to make you give up so that you will not be disappointed in the end, and they will make it seem as if they are looking out for your best interests. But I can tell you this, you can do hard things and that is when the growth occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our Heavenly Father, ... knows that we learn and grow and become stronger as we face and survive the trials through which we must pass. We know that there are times when we will experience heartbreaking sorrow, when we will grieve, and when we may be tested to our limits. However, such difficulties allow us to change for the better, to rebuild our lives in the way our Heavenly Father teaches us, and to become something different from what we were...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Were it not for challenges to overcome and problems to solve, we would remain much as we are, with little or no progress toward our goal of eternal life."15</p>
<p>It won't be easy. Life is full of disappointments and hardships, but how you deal with them will define who you are.&nbsp; Perhaps you will remember some of the same phrases I was taught while growing up - If you get bucked off, you gotta' get back in the saddle; or If at first you don't succeed, try again. The process of quickly getting back in the saddle, or trying again helps get us back on track before fear, doubt, or other influences can have an impact on us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When our children were younger we read books to them each night before they went to bed.&nbsp; One of our favorite books to read, especially when they had experienced a hard day, was Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst.&nbsp; In the book a young boy named Alexander felt as if the world was against him that day. He woke up with gum in his hair, he didn't get a window seat in the car, and his mom even forgot to put dessert in his lunch. Alexander was having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. Alexander told everyone that he was going to move to Australia, as if that would fix all of his problems. The book concludes with some wise counsel "My mom says some days are like that. Even in Australia."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This is counsel we all need to remember. The path is not easy, but some days are like that.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Lesson #3 - Obedience brings blessings while disobedience brings sorrow and disqualification</strong><strong><br /></strong><br />In sports, as in life, there are rules that govern just about everything we do. Rules apply to everyone equally. None of us are exempt. Some rules simply ensure a level of standardization. For example, in track and field the size of a regulation track is 400 meters, and in basketball the rim is 10 feet from the floor. Whereas other rules ensure fair play and if broken can have severe consequences, even disqualification.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently, I have started playing golf and have learned that there are many, many rules in that game. Shots that go out of bounds, a lost ball, grounding a club in a hazard, among others, all have assigned penalties, which add strokes to your score. But unlike other sports, in golf the golfer keeps their own score. At the end of the game the golfer must sign the scorecard, which verifies the recorded score is accurate. Any attempt to correct a scorecard after it has been signed results in a penalty or even disqualification.<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Golf is a game of honor, and recognizing that a rule was broken and taking responsibility for it is a part of the game. Cheating on your golf score or not counting the correct penalty strokes may make your score look better, but no matter how hard you try, it just won't make you a better golfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As in golf, we too are keeping a scorecard of sorts. When an individual wishes to enter the temple he or she will meet with their bishop and are asked a series of questions, which they are required to answer.&nbsp; At the end of the interview they will be asked to sign the recommend. That signature verifies the answers given were accurate. This too is the honor system. You are the one keeping score. Failing to take responsibility for, or hiding past transgressions, may get you a recommend, but will not bring peace and true happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as athletes must know and understand the rules that govern their sport, we too must learn the rules or commandments we are expected to live by. Failure to do so or claiming ignorance does not eliminate or lessen the penalties associated with breaking them. Knowing the rules, and living by them however will ensure our spiritual safety and qualify us for the blessings of heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The third article of faith states, "We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved,&nbsp;<em>by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel</em>" (emphasis added.)&nbsp;<br /><br />The story of the Sons of Heleman, or two thousand strippling warriors, is a good example of the blessings that come from being obedient. The people of Ammon had been converted unto the Lord and had made an oath that they would not shed any more blood. The Nephites, who had been protecting them, were suffering many afflictions and tribulations and the people of Ammon felt compelled to help. They were about to break their covenant, but Helaman intervened fearing "by doing so they should lose their souls."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;It was then that two thousand young men, who had not entered into the same covenant as their parents, took up arms and made a covenant to fight for their liberty and their lands.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;We learn a little about the character of these young men in Alma 53:20-21:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were&nbsp;<em>true at all times</em>&nbsp;in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been<em>&nbsp;taught to keep the commandments of God</em>&nbsp;and to walk uprightly before him." (emphasis added.)</p>
<p>Later we learn that these two thousand warriors were involved in a hard battle and beat the Lamanites.&nbsp; When the battle was over many of them had been wounded, but not one of them had perished.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />They had been taught and knew the rules. They obeyed the rules with exactness. They were true at all times and they received the blessings and protection from Heaven.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Lesson #4 - Everyone needs a coach and a support team</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In sporting events you will notice that every team has one thing in common--a coach. The coach's role is to develop their players and help them reach their full potential. A coach also helps control the game or individual performance of an athlete. When a game is close, the team needs to regroup, or they simply just need to catch their breath, the coach will call a 'time out'. During this pause in action the coach will give instruction, direction, and encouragement then send the team back to the contest.&nbsp;<br /><br />For some athletes, playing a sport is their livelihood. Athletes who do so are expected to perform at a very high level day in and day out. Those who can endure the rigor do quite well, and not to mention, make a lot of money, while those who can't are usually out of a job. Elite athletes realize that in this harsh environment they cannot achieve success on their own. They hire a team of people--agents, managers, personal trainers, nutritionists, and doctors to help them meet their day to day needs and ultimately achieve their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If elite athletes know they can't succeed in that type of environment on their own, then why should we be fooled into believing that we should try to navigate our way through this life, the biggest game we will ever play in, and one with eternal consequences, on our own?&nbsp;<br /><br />When we look around us we begin to realize that we, as children of God, are the greatest of all His creations. We are in a literal sense, elite. And like elite athletes we too need a coach and a support team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon we learn that Nephi had a coach. When he was commanded to build a ship to carry his family across the sea, he hadn't built a ship before, but the Lord assured him that he would give him instructions or coach him along the way.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;In 1 Nephi 18:1 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that ... we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship."</p>
<p>Now, not all performances or performers are the same and a good coach is not afraid to challenge us or let us know when we are doing something wrong. Let's return back to the story of the brother of Jared for a moment. Remember, he and his people were being directed by the hand of the Lord toward a promised land. During this journey the Lord came and talked to the brother of Jared for three hours and "chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all going to make mistakes and when we do, it's okay to call a time out and call upon the Lord. He knows us, He knows that we will all need help, and He has provided us with a support team. Bishops, spouses, families, roommates, friends, and others are all around us to lift us, encourage us, and help us reach our full potential. We don't have to do it alone. Remember He wants us to succeed.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Lesson #5 - Be the same person at all times</strong><strong><br /></strong><br />I have tried to support my children by attending their sporting events whenever possible and have coached a few of their teams. When children begin playing sports they play because they enjoy being with their friends and because it's fun. If you were to ask a 5 or 6 year old who won the game they probably couldn't tell you. I know this because I've coached little league soccer and watched many of the players who were more interested in picking dandelions, creating a big pile of grass to throw on their teammates during the next break, or talking to a friend instead of paying attention to what was actually happening on the field. As these same children get older and move into more competitive leagues, they become more focused on winning and their attitudes and behaviors begin to change. Without constant reminders and good examples, they may forget what is appropriate and may develop an attitude that it's okay to behave one way while in a competition and another when they are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To demonstrate what I am talking about let me tell you a quick story. On November 5, 2009, BYU was hosting New Mexico in a Mountain West Conference semifinal women's soccer game. During the game a New Mexico defender grabbed the ponytail of a BYU player and yanked her to the ground. Because the game had been filmed it soon grabbed national media attention. Later in an apology she said "My actions were uncalled for. I let my emotions get the best of me in a heated situation. And this is in no way indicative of my character..."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;President Monson stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We live in a world where moral values have, in great measure, been tossed aside...and where temptations to stray from the strait and narrow path surround us. We are faced with persistent pressures and insidious influences tearing down what is decent and attempting to substitute the shallow philosophies and practices of a secular society. Because of these and other challenges, decisions are constantly before us, which can determine our destiny. In order for us to make the correct decisions, courage is needed--the courage to say no when we should, the courage to say yes when that is appropriate, the courage to do the right thing because it is right."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>In an effort to be popular or to fit in, are we willing to change who we are? Will we act like we think others want us to act or say things we will only later regret? Or, will you have the courage to stand up and do the right thing? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Amid all of the bad behaviors we hear about, there are also many instances where people have just done the right thing. These are the type of people who are a light in the world, they help make a difference in their communities, and their actions demonstrate the type of people they truly are. They understand that people are more important than prizes.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1935 Jessie Owens was competing in the Olympic Games and was favored to win the long jump. He fouled his first two jumps and making the final would hinge on his last attempt. Luz Long, a fellow competitor from Germany, was leading the competition. He approached Owens, introduced himself, and offered some advice, which would help his competitor advance to the finals. Owens took the advice, made the final, and went on to win the gold medal. Luz Long ended up in second place.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />During the recent 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Russian cross country skier, Anton Gafarov, broke a ski and crashed in a semifinal race. Wanting to finish the race in front of his home crowd, he got up and started again, but his ski was so severely damaged that he again fell in the snow. Just then Canadian coach Justin Wadsworth ran onto the course with an extra ski in his hand and fastened it to Gafarov's boot.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One final example came from an experience a couple of years ago. My wife, Alisa, and I decided to participate in a Triathlon. After swimming and biking, the final segment of the race was a 10k (6.2 mile) run. In order to reach the finish line, runners had to navigate a short, narrow, downhill path, which was only wide enough for one person. This section of the path was only about 30-40 meters long before it entered onto a golf course for the last 200 meters of the race. Due to the different starting times, I had already finished the race and was waiting for my wife to make it to the finish line. As I waited I started to see some commotion in the trees where the path narrowed. A runner had collapsed in that narrow section. With the finish line in sight a few people started jumping over the downed runner racing to the finish wanting to get a good time. My wife however, was the one who stopped, assisted the runner and gave her the help she so desperately needed.&nbsp;<br /><br />So what type of person are you? Would you have stopped or jumped over the downed runner? Would you have the courage give advice or help a competitor? Are you one person on Sunday and another during the week? Do you allow yourself to get caught up in the ways of the world, or do you "stand as witness of God at all times and in all things, and in all places...?"<sup>27&nbsp;</sup>Are you the "person our Heavenly Father wants you to be and the person you know you should be?"<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And what kind of person is it He wants us to be? The Lord himself answers this question; "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters in my office is a framed quote I cut out of a newspaper many years ago by an anonymous author. It reads "Do your best to make certain you are the sort of person you want your children to become." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the greatest rewards we can have in this life is to have children who act the way the Lord would want them too. This quote reminds me every day that in order to have that reward, it must start with me. I have to educate myself, align my will with the Lords, and model correct behaviors. Brother Randal Ridd, Second Counselor in the Young Men General Presidency, stated:</p>
<p>"...if you are not proactive in educating your desires, the world will do it for you. You have agency. It is the power to not only act on your desires but also to refine, purify, and elevate your desires. Agency is your power to become."<sup>30</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In review, I know the Lord loves us and wants us to succeed, that the path is not easy and there will be bumps along the way, that through obedience we will receive blessings and help from heaven, that we each have a coach and support team to help us reach our full potential, and that by striving to be the same person at all times and by doing the right thing because it is right. We should take courage. The courage to become better individuals, better parents, better friends, and ultimately more like the Savior steadfast and immovable, unchanging, the same at all times, and in all places, yesterday, today, and forever.&nbsp; Is my prayer.&nbsp; In the Name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Chair, Economics Department</p>
<p>Brother Allan Walburger is currently the Chair of the Economics Department.&nbsp; He was born in Cardston, Alberta, Canada, to Mark and Fern Walburger.&nbsp; He grew up on a small farm and has good memories of harvesting hay, feeding sheep, pigs, chickens and turkeys, and working alongside parents and family. After graduating from Cardston High School, Brother Walburger attended the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada where he met his sweetheart, Eva, the daughter of Jaroslav and Vera Klvacek.&nbsp; At that time, he was serving as the LDSSA president, and she was the Forum Coordinator as part the institute program.&nbsp; They have now been married 24 years and have 4 children.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /> Brother Walburger earned a BA in Economics from the University of Lethbridge in 1991 and a PhD in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University in Indiana in 1994.&nbsp; Upon completion of his PhD, Brother Walburger returned to the University of Lethbridge where he was a faculty member in the Department of Economics for 10 years.&nbsp; He was also the Coordinator of the Agricultural Studies program there for 8 of those years.&nbsp; He joined BYU-Idaho in August of 2006. <br /><br />Brother Walburger has had many opportunities to grow and serve in the Church.&nbsp; He served a mission in the Argentina Buenos Aires North mission.&nbsp; He has been a teacher in various classes.&nbsp; He has served as an elder's quorum president, counselor in a stake young men's presidency, scoutmaster, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, and ward young men's president.&nbsp; He currently serves as the Stake President of the Rexburg YSA 5<sup>th</sup> Stake. <br /><br />As a side note, Brother Walburger is an avid hockey fan.&nbsp; Every winter, he and his family make an ice rink in their backyard for some family fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pretty much anyone who has walked along the edge of a lake or stream knows the value of a good skipping rock. You know the kind I am talking about, nice and smooth, flat but not too thin, and just the right weight. Then there is the right rock for throwing at a tin can resting on the top of a post. For this, it needs to be round and fairly smooth, and just the right weight. There is also the right stone for making a big splash. You know what I mean, a nice big one, not too heavy to lift and throw out in a puddle, but large enough to make a big splash that will get your brother or sister wet! At a different time and place, stones are also nicely placed as stepping-stones to cross a creek or stream so that you can get to the other side without taking your shoes off. I hate the ones that look steady and firm, but then give-away under your weight and you end up soaking wet! Other large boulders are firm and great as anchors, even immovable in the face of rushing waters--a safe foundation upon which to stand without worry that they will slide away into the current.<br /><br />We are all familiar with a good rock, "good" being defined differently based upon the purpose. The multi-purpose rock or stone, so simple and familiar to us, is often used in scriptural references and in a variety of contexts to teach about the gospel of Christ. Of course there are the literal examples in the scriptures such as when David, "chose him five smooth stones out of the brook,"<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>probably just the right weight for the purpose at hand. We are also familiar with the scripture, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;These are not the kind of examples that I want to speak about today. Rather, there are numerous examples where stones, objects of which we are most familiar, are used to teach something central about the nature of the Lord and Savior and His Church, the topic I feel to speak on today.&nbsp;<br /><br />My hope is to emphasize the increasing importance of a life centered on Christ and to increase our appreciation for the doctrines contained in "The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles." In April General Conference a year ago, Elder Hales warned that there would be a greater need for us to understand the doctrine contained in this inspired document. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In recent decades the Church has largely been spared the terrible misunderstandings and persecutions experienced by the early Saints. It will not always be so. The world is moving away from the Lord faster and farther than ever before. The adversary has been loosed upon the earth. We watch, hear, read, study, and share the words of prophets to be forewarned and protected. For example, "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" was given long before we experienced the challenges now facing the family. "The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles" was prepared in advance of when we will need it most."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Why is it that the "Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles" will be needed so dearly in the days ahead? What is it about the world moving away from the Lord faster and farther than ever before that will require us to reflect on this proclamation? Perhaps it is in our testimony of the living Christ that we will find the strength and the peace that we will need. Perhaps it is in the testimony of living apostles that we will find assurance. Perhaps in these words, which we can study, read, and share, we will find a foundation and protection from an adversary that has been loosed upon the earth. In it we find our irrefutable claim to be Christians, our claim to living apostles, the testimonies of such that Christ lives, has restored his Church, and all essential doctrines pertaining to our salvation in and through Him as the Only Begotten of the Father. Upon Him and his apostles, we build our foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite you to reflect with me upon the scriptures that we might more fully understand the importance of the doctrines found in this document, "The Living Christ," and more fully appreciate the admonition to, "remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation,"<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and the affirmation that, "The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer,"<sup>5</sup>and the instruction, "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;As we face increasing headwinds and stronger currents of opposition, it might serve us well to see how the proclamation on the "Living Christ" points us toward solid footing.&nbsp;<br /><br />In many scriptural references, the "rock" takes on a symbolic meaning designed to help us understand the nature of the deliverance granted by the Savior to those who follow Him or the destructive consequences for those who reject Him. In particular, they identify:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) The protective and shielding nature of our Lord as He provides shelter and safety from the temptations and storms of world.<br />2) The solid, firm, and steady foundation of Jesus Christ and his Gospel upon which we must build our lives.<br />3) The source, light, and very essence of our temporal and spiritual life.<br />4) The influence and strength granted us to deliver, lift, and build others.<br />5) The sad fate of those who reject Him and stumble in darkness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of these important references throughout the scriptures. If we look for them and apply the imagery, we will find there is great comfort and strength when we seek the Lord, our God, strength that we will need in these troublesome times foretold.&nbsp;First, the scriptures teach us that when we trust in the Savior, He can protect or shelter us. Listen to these comforting words of the Psalmist:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We also read in 2 Samuel, "The God of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;And again in Psalms, we read, "Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou [art] my rock and my fortress."<sup>9</sup>These comforting words remind us of the love that our Savior has for each of his flock. He desires to protect us. But we must come unto him to find the refuge we seek. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In what way does He protect us or provide us refuge? Perhaps the most obvious is with respect to temporal storms and physical harm. In the Book of Mormon, we read that Ammon and his brethren were protected from death, as were the two thousand stripling warriors; and this because of the power of their faith unto deliverance. In Helaman, we read about the protection provided to two brothers, Nephi and Lehi, whom the people were prepared to slay:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This turned into one of the greatest missionary success stories of all time, by the way! They became great examples of the Lord's power to protect those who place their faith in Him. We also know of Daniel in the lion's den and his friends, Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego who were saved from the "fiery furnace," by the power of their God.</p>
<p>In the last General Conference, Elder Rasband gave an account of young school children who were miraculously protected from the destructive power of a tornado in Oklahoma City. He testified that one young girl in particular was protected by angels in the storm. We might be reminded that, the Lord has promised, "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;We are reminded in the "Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles" that "His gospel was a message of peace and goodwill. ... He walked the roads of Palestine, healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Our faith in Christ can yield protection and miraculous blessings as He sees fit to grant in our times of need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the greatest protection that the Rock provides us is protection from temptation and sin. He promises that we will not be "tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This protection is absolutely real.&nbsp; Sister Reeves, Second&nbsp;Counselor of the Relief Society General Presidency reminded us that, "the blessings of daily scripture study and prayer and weekly family home evening ... are the very practices that help take away stress, give direction to our lives, and add protection to our homes," even protection from addictions including pornography.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we live the teachings of the Savior, we will be spared the spiritual destruction that faces so many in our day. There is safety in living the Gospel of Jesus Christ. In "The Living Christ" we are reminded, "He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;It should be clear that we can find shelter in the cavern of&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;Rock, one that is immovable and certain. This shelter is granted through personal righteousness and the atoning and priesthood power granted by the Savior. It is found in temples today and in righteous homes, including your apartments.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures also teach that the Savior represents a sure foundation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Savior taught how to build on the foundation he provides. In Matthew, the account is as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Luke's account is just slightly different:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an house,&nbsp;<em>and digged deep</em>, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, "doing His sayings" is like "digging deep." President Clark, in a devotional address in 2007, taught that we can liken "digging deep" to willing obedience, willingness to sacrifice, consecration of time and resources, hard work, patience, diligence, and a devotion to the Lord and His work.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not easy to dig deep and build a foundation on the Rock, but remember that this Rock is the Rock of our Salvation. "O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the rock of your salvation."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;We can be assured that when we build on the Rock, we will be on stable, firm, and immovable ground. We can have confidence that we can, like the foundation we are built on, stand against sin and persecutions and withstand the winds, even torrential deluges, of trial. Adversity and trial will never be far from us. It is an essential part of our mortal existence. But if the foundation of faith in Christ is embedded in our hearts, the power to endure will not crumble. Our choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us anchors us to the Rock, which provides solid ground under our faith. "Those choices, hundreds in most days, prepare the solid ground on which our edifice of faith is built."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we are to face temporal and spiritual rains, floods, and wind, we should understand that in some cases, the Lord will determine it best not to shelter or shield us, but instead to provide a strong support and an anchor from which we can stand in the face of the storms that beat upon us. That is, He may not remove some challenges from us, but he will provide a solid ground from which we can stand firm in the face of them. Through Him we can overcome any challenge, including the devastating effects of addiction. The world would have us believe that faith in Christ shows weakness, but to the contrary, we have strength found only in Him. There is an assurance that comes with testimony. There is self-confidence that comes in that assurance that we are standing firmly with our God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to the trials of life that all who come to the earth will face, Elder Hales has warned that the misunderstandings and persecutions experienced by the early Saints will return in our day. It will take renewed resolve that will come from hastening our efforts to build the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"The Living Christ" contains a reminder and an assurance to which we can look:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He taught the truths of eternity, the reality of our premortal existence, the purpose of our life on earth, and the potential for the sons and daughters of God in the life to come...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Even more than a foundation to build upon, Christ is the source of the light in us that grants us life itself. Peter identifies Christ as our "living stone," "To whom coming,&nbsp;<em>as unto</em>&nbsp;a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious..." Certainly this is yet another reference to the nature of the deliverance granted by the Savior. It is in and through Him that we have mortal life and through Whom we will be able to gain eternal life. He taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Through His atoning sacrifice we can have eternal life. But we must seek this Living Stone that provides light and life to all who seek him.</p>
<p>Again "The Living Christ" assures this truth:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He gave His life to atone for the sins of all mankind. His was a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We solemnly testify that His life, which is central to all human history, neither began in Bethlehem nor concluded on Calvary. He was the Firstborn of the Father, the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the Redeemer of the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He rose from the grave to 'become the firstfruits of them that slept"<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>As we consider our foundation built upon the Rock, which in fact is a Living Stone who grants us life itself, we might review the words of Paul. He taught that we:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"are built upon the foundation of the&nbsp;apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner&nbsp;<em>stone;</em>&nbsp;In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:&nbsp;In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>The great power of a cornerstone is in its ability to place a reference point that is sturdy and firm from which the rest of the building is built.&nbsp; As we build on him and his foundation of apostles, we cannot be turned either to the right or to the left. Can you see the uniqueness of this living construction? We are also "builded together," small rocks perhaps, being used in the construction of a great edifice--the Church of Christ. We then become firm and others can build on us as well. Now let's return to Peter's words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"To whom coming,&nbsp;<em>as unto</em>&nbsp;a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, Ye also, as&nbsp;<em>lively stones</em>, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Those who build on Christ and the foundation of apostles and prophets, i.e. His holy priesthood, are firm and become part of a spiritual house, or temple. Building on such a foundation allows us to build righteous lives on true principles that will never fail. We build foundations that will last through this life and into the eternities. Building on the testimonies of the apostles contained in "The Living Christ" will hold us firm and give us life, and from this foundation, we invite all to come unto Christ to build with us and to become part with us in the glorious edifice of His Church. With the apostles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We declare in words of solemnity that His priesthood and His Church have been restored upon the earth--'built upon the foundation of ... apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone' (Ephesians 2:20)."<sup>26</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Let me share, one last scriptural use of a rock or stone to symbolize the Living Christ. Peter teaches that Christ becomes a stumbling block to those who reject him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Unto you therefore which believe&nbsp;<em>he is</em>&nbsp;precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: where unto also they were appointed."<sup>27</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>How is this true?&nbsp; Quite simply, without him there is no path back to our heavenly home and Heavenly Parents. Those who pursue another course will wander off into forbidden paths and fall away.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;They will stumble over the very Rock, which could save them because they look for another way. Wickedness never was happiness, and as a result, those who choose such a path will fumble along, stumbling over the very Rock that would be their salvation. In some cases, the scriptures indicate that some not only stumble over the Rock, but that it may even crush them in their wickedness. Perhaps in reference to the role He will play as our Judge or in His effort to protect his saints from those who would oppose his Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."<sup>29</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We also see this imagery in Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream where he saw a stone was "cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear my brothers and sisters, we cannot have it both ways; either we build on the Rock by doing His will, or we stumble over His truth and fall, or worse, we oppose it and get crushed. In "The Living Christ" we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We testify that He will someday return to earth. 'And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together' (Isaiah 40:5). He will rule as King of Kings and reign as Lord of Lords, and every knee shall bend and every tongue shall speak in worship before Him. Each of us will stand to be judged of Him according to our works and the desires of our hearts."<sup>31</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>My brothers and sisters, I invite you to reflect on the truths summarized in "The Living Christ: &nbsp;The Testimony of The Apostles." The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."<sup>32</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Hastening the work of salvation, the charge given by a latter-day prophet, will open us to increased criticism and opposition. The courage we will need in the coming days to stand for Christ can be cultivated through studying the testimony of the living apostles found in this document. Might we stand with them; might we stand on this Rock!</p>
<p>"Of Him the Prophet ... declared: 'And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!&nbsp;</p>
<p>"'For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father'"<sup>33</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>There are rocks fit for skipping; rocks fit for throwing, and rocks or stones fit for stepping. But there is only one Rock fit for a foundation upon which to build our lives. Seek the Rock, even Jesus Christ. He Lives! He is our protector and will provide shelter and safety from the temptations and storms of the world. He is the solid, firm and steady foundation, the Living Stone, upon which we must build our lives through living His Gospel. When we build on Him and his apostles and prophets, we can provide strength, truth, and firmness for others to build on; we even become "lively stones" in Him and can offer light and truth to an ever-darkening world--for He is the source and very essence of our temporal and spiritual life. Through His Atonement we can have everlasting life, and "there is no other way or means whereby [men and women] can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;We must carry His light to all the world. Of all the stones and rocks that we might find in mortality, He is the one that we must "dig deep" and find, and the only one that will truly save. In Him I have hope and of Him I testify, in his sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you for that beautiful music.<br /><br />I am honored and extremely humbled by the invitation to speak to you today. This is a beautiful, yet somewhat overwhelming setting, and so many of you have come today to be spiritually fed. I have fasted, and prayed much that I would be led to share with you today what the Lord would have you hear, and that despite my weakness you may be strengthened by my message to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to begin my remarks today by telling my students, now and ever, how very much I love you. I appreciate all that you teach me. You inspire me to be better each day--to be continually growing and learning. We have been blessed by our Heavenly Father to create and study beautiful music together, and I am honored to be in your presence.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am especially grateful to the Collegiate Singers for presenting today's music. I find great peace and joy through the singing of our beloved hymns. Orson F. Whitney wrote the poem "Savior, Redeemer of My Soul." You can find the text in the hymnbook #112, though to a different melody. I was going to read the words to you, but to me, it's just not quite the same without the music. So here is a summary. The hymn focuses of the Savior's redemptive powers, the gratitude we should express to Him, the joy the gospel brings to our lives, and a plea to help us return to Him--to be worthy and fit for the life above.&nbsp;<br /><br />How do we become fit for the life above? How do we become our best selves? Who is Your Best You?&nbsp;<br /><br />It has been very windy here lately--not an uncommon thing in April and May in Rexburg. On Sunday May 4, it was particularly windy, so much so, that a section of the fence in my back yard was blown down. This happened sometime in the afternoon between my telephone chat with my best friend in Utah, and my nap before working on this talk. As I looked out my kitchen window, I thought, "hmm, wouldn't it be nice if those students playing with their dogs came over and put my fence back up for me!" I knew it would be too heavy for me to do by myself, and so I thought, "Well, I guess I'll probably have to call my home teacher to come help me with that, or I could just go out there now and start to work on it and maybe one or two of those young men playing in the yard will come help. Well, it's Sunday. I probably shouldn't do that today, but if I wait the guy who comes to mow the lawn will be upset. The grass will turn yellow under the fence." A bunch of thoughts crossed my mind, and then, without choosing to do anything about it, I sat down to my computer. About an hour or so later, I got up to get myself a drink, and as I looked out my window, low and behold, the fence was already back up! I don't know the students who live behind me, but thank you for that little act of service that was a great example, and a great help to me. They could have waited for someone to ask them to do it, but they just did it! They chose to serve.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />We learn some wonderful lessons from the experiences of the brother of Jared in the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon. In chapter 2 we read, "And the Lord said:&nbsp;<em>Go to work</em>&nbsp;and build...and the brother of Jared did&nbsp;<em>go to work</em>, and also his brethren, and built barges...according to the instructions of the Lord." This was going to be a very long journey across the sea. These vessels had no light and no air, and so the brother of Jared asked the Lord how they would survive this journey without air. He was instructed to make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom, and when air was needed, they were to unstop the hole and receive air. And if water came in, they were to stop the hole back up to keep from drowning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Still, there was a need for light. Ether 2:22-23:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them.&nbsp; Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness? And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?"</p>
<p>Ether 3:1-5:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that the brother of Jared...went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are&nbsp;unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power..."</p>
<p>We can easily liken this scripture to us, in our earthly sojourn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brother of Jared is a great example to us&nbsp;</p>
<p>How often do we feel that we are going forth across the raging deep in darkness?&nbsp; Do we clearly see the hand of the Lord in our lives? Do we allow Him to light our way? How can we be better at accomplishing that? Do we exercise faith in a fashion that allows us to commune with the Lord on a regular basis? Are we obedient to the degree that we can have His Spirit with us to guide us in everyday decisions--both simple and complex? Do we go to the mountain of the Lord--to the temple--to learn of His ways, and to become more like Him?&nbsp;<br /><br />We have all come here to this earth to work out our own salvation. Each of us is unique, blessed with talents, abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and righteous desires.&nbsp; As unique as we are, we are not alone. We are blessed to have families, friends, and teachers who love us and want the best for us. We are blessed to have the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives. Still, we are each responsible for our own choices and actions, and those actions will lead us either closer to or further away from our Father in Heaven.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us will have our own personal wilderness experiences, designed to teach, test, and sanctify us. Life is hard. It is meant to be that way to help us grow, to stretch us, to challenge us, and to make us uncomfortable because those are the things that will make us stronger. But, we can choose to follow the Savior and receive His blessings.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson taught that "when you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed" (<em>Ensign</em>, November 1985, pg. 5).&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh how we need light to guide us across the raging waters of our lives! Light is stronger than dark and Jesus Christ is the ultimate light. He is the Light of the World.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to suggest a few things we can do to draw more near to the Lord, and allow Him to guide us and teach us as he did the Brother of Jared, that we might have light to guide us, that we might be fit for the life above.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First and Foremost: We Must Understand Who We Are</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />You are a child of God. We are all children of God. As children of God, we have the potential to become like Him. The prophet Brigham Young taught, "When we look upon the human face we look upon the image of our Father and God; there is a divinity in each person male and female; there is the heavenly, there is the divine."&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Sheri Dew, in her book&nbsp;<em>No Doubt About It</em>&nbsp;says this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It seems to be easy here in mortality...to lose sight of who we are and what we're here for, and as a result to become distracted from what is really important. If we don't have a clear sense of our identity and purpose, we are much more vulnerable to Lucifer. He of course knows this and accordingly attempts to blur our vision. He lies. He shades and obliterates truth. He makes evil look good and good look unenlightened and unsophisticated. Make no mistake about it: Lucifer will do&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;to derail, disappoint, dishearten, discourage, and deceive us--and particularly those who have made and are seeking to keep sacred covenants. His motives are self-centered, selfish, destructive, and evil...Our ability to successfully negotiate this spiritual mine field called mortality improves dramatically if we are clear about who we are and what is important. And what is important is eternal life...The more clearly we understand our divine destiny, the more immune we become to Satan." (p. 7-9)</p>
<p><strong>Second: We Must Come to Know the Savior&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe in Him and believe Him. The miracle of His atoning sacrifice is beyond our mortal comprehension, but work to catch glimpses of His godly love for you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Sheri Dew said further:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Lord will do for us exactly what He has said He will do--if we believe in Him and seek His divine direction and intervention in our lives...Do you believe that the Savior will really do for you what He has said He will do? That He will give you strength and insight to deal with the challenges at hand? That He will lighten your burden and turn your weakness into strength? That He will heal your broken heart and fill you with hope? That He will renew your energy and help you forgive? That He will help you deal with disappointment and loneliness, and fill you with the sweet knowledge of how precious you are to Him? That He will respond to your deepest hurt or longing and bless you with a spirit of good cheer, optimism, and faith? That He is the only source of comfort, strength, information, knowledge, and peace that will not change, will not move, will not betray you, and will never let you down?" (<em>No Doubt About It</em>, p.142-143)</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This reliance upon the forgiving, long-suffering, merciful nature of God was taught from before the very foundation of the world. It was always to give us hope and help, a reason to progress and improve, an incentive to lay down our burdens and take up our salvation. May I be bold enough to suggest that it is impossible for anyone who really knows God to doubt his willingness to receive us with open arms in a divine embrace if we will but "come unto him." There certainly can and will be plenty of external difficulties in life. Nevertheless the soul that comes unto Christ dwells within a personal fortress, a veritable palace of perfect peace. "Whoso hearkeneth unto me," Jehovah says, "shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil" (Proverbs 1:33)." (March 02, 1997, Come Unto Me, Jeffrey R. Holland)</p>
<p><strong>Third: Surround Yourself with Good People Who You Would Choose To Be Like</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the words of a familiar and beloved hymn, "Each life that touches ours for good, reflects" the great mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the day we are born we are influenced by others for both good and bad. And, we influence others, also for good and bad. I encourage you to take a few minutes in the coming days to reflect on the people who have had great and positive influence in your life. For most of you, your parents will be at the top of your list. And surely there are others--teachers, coaches, church leaders, friends, and more--who have blessed and influenced your life in indescribable ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps a more challenging task is to think about ways that you have been a blessing in someone else's life. What are the talents with which the Lord has blessed you in order to bless the lives of others? How can you discover those talents? What is it that the Lord would have you do or become in order to bless lives? What are some things you have already done? What are you doing to develop your best you?&nbsp;<br /><br />There are so many great people who have been an influence for good in my life, and who have helped shape and mold me, and have set an example for who I want to become. My gratitude to and for them is immense and truly indescribable. From family members to teachers and friends, there are many, many people in my life who I could choose to use as an example today of service and happiness and grace. I would like to share a few of them with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Soon after I completed my schooling at Utah State, I was working as a Music Therapist in south Louisiana. I was fortunate, and blessed to become well acquainted with my landlords, MaryAnne and Lindy Hoffmann, in the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The Hoffmanns owned the music store in Thibodaux. They had no children of their own, and they treated me like a daughter from the very beginning. Lindy was a drummer, and MaryAnne played the piano and clarinet. They were "my people" immediately. We became fast friends, and my parents back in Utah were very grateful to know that their still quite shy daughter was being looked after. They invited me to join them playing in the community band, which I did, and loved. I taught oboe lessons in the back rooms of the music store, and was invited to an occasional dinner. We spent lovely Sunday afternoons in the upstairs great room. But the thing I enjoyed most were my chats with MaryAnne in the evenings after work on the swing in the back yard of their beautiful southern home. They could see in me the teacher and musician that I had always wanted to be. I was working as a music therapist, but they helped me achieve my true dream of being in front of a band! These wonderful people helped initiate a change in my life that eventually brought me here to BYU-Idaho. When the time was right, I moved back to Utah and began my career as a high school band director.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Hoffmanns are much like my own parents. They are hard workers, they are committed to serving others, they love their family, they are good, and they are honest people. I love being in their company. I always want to be the best I can be when I am in their presence. Lindy and MaryAnne are not members of our church. They have always been supportive of my beliefs and way of life, and the way they live their lives they might as well be members. One of my greatest hopes is that I have been as positive of an influence in their lives as they have been in mine<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>I have visited my sweet friends several times over the years, but not enough. I spoke with them on Mother's Day just a few weeks ago. They are aging, and I think of them often. They are givers. Their influence on me was life changing. They have been, and are, a blessing beyond my description, and I love them so!&nbsp;<br /><br />For nearly three years now I have worn a wristband. I wear it in honor of a great young man who has had a tremendous influence for good in the lives of many people, including my own. This young man's name is Tyler Soelberg. Tyler is one of my 29 nieces and nephews, all of whom I love dearly. When Tyler was just a little guy, my friend and I were working on a small project. Tyler walked into the room with his grandpa, stood there for just a moment and then curiously asked about what we were doing.&nbsp; As I began to explain to this 5 year old that we were building a desk, he quickly picked up a screwdriver and said, "I want to help!" This was our Tyler--the helper--always in the midst of doing something--and usually a good something.&nbsp;<br /><br />As Tyler grew, he was a smart, talented young man, always doing kind things for others. Tyler had lots of friends. This crazy, curly blonde haired boy adored what he called "the beautiful game" of soccer<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;He loved life. He loved his family. He loved the Savior and the gospel, and had a burning testimony of the Savior's great atoning sacrifice. Tyler was a giver. He served an honorable mission in Albania, and was a great leader there, serving as Branch President. Tyler loved to travel, and could get just about anywhere on very little money. He traveled to Peru and Honduras to work on a humanitarian project. To me, Tyler defied gravity--that's what my wristband says--defy gravity.&nbsp;<br /><br />After his mission, Tyler attended the University of Utah, where he majored in both Film &amp; Media Arts and Physics. Did I mention how smart and creative Tyler was? Brilliant in my estimation. When it came time to graduate in the spring of 2011 he was invited to speak at his convocation in the College of Science. In that speech, he encouraged his fellow graduates "to be playful, to take risks and to be creative." He also reminded them that life is very precious.&nbsp;<br /><br />Not many weeks after that graduation speech, Tyler was taken from this earth in a tragic bicycling accident. Oh, how our hearts ached! They still ache. But Tyler's death helped us focus on the great and tender mercies of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Tyler had reminded us that life was very precious. In remembering Tyler, we remember to see the best in others, to serve others, to realize the truth of who we are as children of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Tyler's Facebook page, his friend Daniel Clark, wrote the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My good friend Tyler Soelberg passed away in a bike accident today. I would invite you to tell someone who's close to you how they have changed your life. It's astonishing how quickly you can lose your chance. Tyler helped me understand that excellence happens in the quiet parts of life. He was an example of being accepting of anyone. I'm glad to have known him and I'm grateful for the impression he left on me."</p>
<p>Yes, Tyler was a giver. He had even designated himself as an organ donor, and continues to bless the lives of those who received his precious and healthy organs. Each of us has the ability to reflect the light of our Savior as we live the gospel and serve others. Tyler reflected that light throughout his life, and beyond. Tyler not only defies gravity now--he soars with the angels. He is our guardian angel, along with so many others who have gone before and set such a great example of love and service. He has influenced my life for good. Tyler would have put my fence back up for me, as I'm sure many of you would. Some of you did!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder George Q. Cannon said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, [God] will never desert us.&nbsp; He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character.&nbsp; He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come...We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed.&nbsp; We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments." (Freedom of the Saints, 2:185)</p>
<p>Life is full of challenges.&nbsp; None of us are exempt. Losing Tyler was, I'm sure, the most difficult thing my brother David and his wife Pam had ever gone through. Their example of faith and hope has given me strength. Others in my family have been through incredible challenges as well, including divorce, the death of an infant, the death of a spouse, wayward children, cancer and other health issues, and many other difficult situations. It is all part of experiencing this mortal life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the Savior has taken care of all of that for us. Isaiah 53:4-5, "Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; ...and with His stripes, we are healed." And in John 14:27 we read: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." All that we might be more fit for His kingdom; fit for the life above.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fourth: Be Grateful</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />President Uchtdorf, in our most recent General Conference stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Gratitude brings true joy and great happiness--as a disposition, as a way of life. Not gratitude for things, but it is an act of faith IN God...How blessed we are if we recognize God's handiwork in the marvelous tapestry of our life. Gratitude to our Father in Heaven broadens our perception and clears our vision. It inspires humility and fosters empathy toward our fellowmen and all of God's creation. Gratitude is a catalyst to all Christ-like attributes!&nbsp; A thankful heart is the parent of all virtues."</p>
<p>In the popular musical&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>, Glinda and Elpheba express their gratitude for their friendship by singing "Because I knew you, I have been changed, for good."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for the friends who have changed my life for good.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, in summary, and you don't have to be perfect in all of this right now, but use these as a guide to keep a steady course that will draw you more near to the Lord each day and become your best you:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now, back to the scripture in Ether--personalized:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of [my] weakness before thee; for [I] know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that [I am] unworthy before thee; because of the fall [my]&nbsp;nature [has]&nbsp;become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given me a commandment that [I] must call upon thee, that from thee [I] may receive according to [my] desires.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten [me] because of [my] iniquity, and hast driven [me] forth, and for these many years [I] have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto [me]. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from [me], and suffer not that [I] shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness;"</p>
<p>I often ask myself, and my Heavenly Father if I am learning the things He wants and needs me to learn through my experiences on this earth. I don't know for sure, but I hope I am. What I do know is that I am incredibly blessed. I know that I am His, that He loves me, and that He knows the righteous desires of my heart. And He knows you, and your desires as well. He is our greatest example, He is the Light of the world and He is our salvation.&nbsp;<br /><br />I express to you my testimony of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of my Soul. I am grateful for the miracle of His atoning sacrifice for me, and for each of us. I pray that we may know the Savior when we see Him, because we will be like Him. May we be worthy of His richest blessings, and truly fit for His Kingdom, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Sister Foster and I are so happy to be back at BYU-Idaho today. Thank you for your warm hospitality. I need to establish my credibility. I was born and raised in Rigby, Idaho, and&nbsp;I attended school on this campus. So when you take me on a tour of this place, it is like taking a mother on tour of her own kitchen. Now, you should understand that you are the tourists. So don't laugh at the natives! It is a pleasure to visit this beautiful facility and be on campus again with you and the professors here.&nbsp;<br /><br />Every place I go I hear about the Pathway Program of which 12,000 people are now engaged. I know that this university is an environment of spiritual learning through leadership throughout the world. I see the growth of this campus, and amongst all of that, I'm proud that the spirit of BYU-Idaho, or as we used to call it, the spirit of Ricks College, is still alive and well here.&nbsp;<br /><br />We, as Church leaders, have learned more about you young adults in a recent survey. This is what it told us:</p>
<p>So, I've decided to text you my talk: "U cannot program ppl back 2 heaven!"&nbsp;<br /><br />The title of my talk today is, "So, Where did You Put the Tigers?" You will understand why in a few minutes. I want to speak to you today about leadership and about building people- not products. Edwin Markham, an American poet, has said, "We are all blind until we see that in the human plan nothing is worth the [building] that does not build the man [or woman]."&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's talk about how our Heavenly Father's plan is designed to do that. We may not know everything about you, but this we are sure of:</p>
<p>With that comes a great responsibility to make sure that it is done the Lord's way. Leadership in the home, the Church, and the world is a sacred trust. As a matter of fact, the word&nbsp;<em>leader</em>&nbsp;comes from the latin word&nbsp;<em>educur</em>&nbsp;which is where we get the word&nbsp;<em>educate</em>, which means to lead forth or to draw forth a person's best potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the test of a great leader? "The test is simple: Has a man or woman the talent and the power to evoke from those, who are assigned to follow him, the maximum wholesome realization of their best capacities?"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Think of this in your relationship with your children or your callings in the Church. A great leader takes us places we've never been before, helps us see things we've never seen before, helps us feel things we've never felt before, and helps us to become the people we've only dreamed of becoming.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't think there's a greater story of leadership than the story of President Harold B. Lee before he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. In his professional life he was a banker and served on the board of directors for an international banking company. When the board wanted to hire a new president of the banking company, this is what they did. They looked at their best managers over the divisions and they decided on the top three managers. They invited these three managers to take their wives to Hawaii for the next six months to work on a special project. While they were away, the board of directors watched their divisions. If a division did as well or struggled a little bit, those managers came back and resumed their responsibilities. However, the manager whose division did better while he was away was chosen to be the president of the company. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This story reminds me of what the prophet Joseph said when someone asked him "how do you govern these people?" He said, "I teach them correct prinicples and let them govern themselves." So let's talk about some of those principles. In the pre-existence, our Heavenly Father's plan was to create this earth for us to dwell on. Then, He stated, He would "...Prove us herewith..."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;not to program us, but to give us opportunities to grow.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the scriptures and in the temples those creative periods are represented. After the Lord had formed the earth on the fifth day, the Father sent Christ down to create plants and animals. When Christ returned to the Father, the Father said that it was good. He didn't ask, "So, where did you put the Tigers?" God had given the Savior the responsibility. He wasn't going to micro-manage Him because He trusted Him. He designed this earth experience around His trusting us because He wanted us to grow and return as exalted beings to be with Him and to be like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the plan. In the councils in the pre-mortal life the pros and cons of Heavenly Father's plan was debated. Some rejected the risk, which would go with that trust, was too risky. Do you think we really understood how hard this experience was going to be? Well, the Lord knew that the Father's plan of agency provided eternal growth, even knowing that more would be called than chosen.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;So He organized this earth, and put us in this environment that we could grow and "become as the Gods knowing good and evil."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve chose to partake of the forbidden fruit, thus receiving their agency. And because of the fall it enabled us to come to this earth. Our loving Heavenly Father provided a Savior for us. The blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ free us from our bad choices and actions, which allow us to grow. Therefore, repentance needs to be part of your plan A in life and not plan B.&nbsp;<br /><br />How grateful we must be that Heavenly Father trusts us and has provided us with an environment where trust can operate, because trust leads to growth and growth leads to becoming like Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />"The gr8er the agency, the gr8r the growth."&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me show you an example of the Lord's plan of trust and growth from the scriptures. It's always interesting to me to know that from 1829 - 1831, the Church was organized in 1830, almost all of the sections in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants that were given at that time were given as "thus saith the Lord." These are exact instructions as to how the Church would be administered. When any church member wanted to know anything about where they should go on a mission or what they should do, they asked the prophet Joseph Smith. Joseph asked the Lord and the Lord gave instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These sections are full of His direction. By 1832 to 1835 the Lord instructed Joseph to begin organizing quorums and councils, because the Church is growing and we as individuals needed to as well. So an interesting thing takes place. One of the perfect examples is in the 58th Section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants. Here the Lord has called Edward Partridge and his counselors to be the first presiding bishopric. The Church is in Kirtland and also in Missouri. Zion was going to be built in Missouri, so the Lord instructs the bishopric that they should move their families to Missouri. The newly called leaders realize that Missouri is 900 miles away. How were they going to accomplish this?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />They requested that Joseph ask the Lord how they were supposed to fulfill this taxing assignment. Here is the Lord's response to them in verse 25, "Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall counsel between themselves and me."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the Lord saying here? "Go figure it out," "I trust you," and counsel together and counsel with me, Jesus Christ, through the Holy Ghost, to accomplish this task." This same counsel should be used as a threesome in your marriage or serving as missionary companions. The Lord is beginning to let them grow and develop. The reason I know this is because of what comes next in verse 26. This is still the Savior speaking, "For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the reward He is talking about? It is our ability to receive personal revelation, understanding, and direction as we grow and become like Him. Because He trusted us, we need to be able to learn and trust Him, about that source of true light and knowledge the Holy Ghost, as we make decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now the next two verses come as a charge from God:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness. For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Remember again, that our reward is the ability to receive personal revelation, understanding, and direction as we grow and become like Him. The Lord promises us that as we "do good" we will receive this powerful reward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe, Brothers and Sisters, one of the hardest things you will ever do in life is to learn to identify and receive direction from the Holy Ghost. You have very difficult decisions to make and unanswered questions in your life right now. Who should you marry? What career should you choose? How can you increase your self-worth? Does the Lord love you? You need to understand that He has placed you here on earth for a purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As you struggle through those things, you are experiencing growth and it will be for your good. So don't be impatient with yourself or with this wonderful plan. In your effort to receive revelation as you counsel together as husbands and wives, as families, or as friends, don't exclude Him. Don't take a side door and say that He doesn't answer your prayers. Because He will answer your prayers. Maybe not immediately, but He will answer them-line upon line, precept upon precept, and prayer upon prayer.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He's trying to help you grow and to become what you need to become.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A good example of that is the story of the prophet Joseph Smith. He was in Liberty Jail during four long wintery months. By this time, he's very depressed and discouraged. He pleads with the Lord for help, and the Lord comes back with this response found in Section 121, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How could that be? The Lord looks at Joseph in this situation, blesses him with peace,&nbsp;and promises him exaltation if he endures his trials well. Joseph Smith's experience in Liberty Jail made him a better Joseph. We have a wise Heavenly Father who knows what is best for each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a parent, please don't micro-manage your children. Allow them to grow even when you see them struggle. As a church leader, allow those you have stewardship over to grow as well. The Lord watches over you and knows where you are, and He knows your circumstances just as He knew what Joseph Smith was going through. When the time is right, He will empower you with understanding as you counsel together and follow His directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />An example of that is a story in Section 53 of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants. Sidney Gilbert has just joined the Church. He's a very wealthy and powerful man. He came to the prophet Joseph Smith and asked, "Would you ask the Lord what I should do in this Church about my calling and election?" And the Lord answered him with this reply, I'm paraphrasing. Now Sidney, I want you to do all the basic things-go on a mission, follow and do what the bishop asks you to do, honor your covenants, and in verse 6 He gives this counsel to Sidney, "Behold, these are the first ordinances which you shall receive; and the residue shall be made known in a time to come, according to your labor in my vineyard."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;We see that it's not what you say but what you do that defines who you are.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord watches us, He knows us, and He'll give us things that will help us grow. So don't ever think that you can beat the system. You may know people who might say "but he got away with it." Does anybody ever really get away with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior who knows the thoughts and intents of your heart, watches you, and gives you what you need in His timing. A good example of that is in the Book of Helaman. Nephi, the son of Helaman, was a great prophet and man who worked hard to do what was right. We read that the Lord acknowledged that in the scriptures saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What does "for I have beheld" mean? It means that he watches us. What does unwearyingness mean? It means steadfastness. Are you folks tired of home teaching some days? Are you tired of saying your prayers and in trying to do good continually and to grow? Of course, but from the Lord He says I have watched your unwearyingness, you haven't sought your own life, and you've put me first. Therefore, because you've overcome those things, in verse 5 the Lord says, "I will bless thee forever."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are those things that the natural man has to struggle with? We know we're spirits and born into an earthly body. A natural man is what we have to overcome. Let me make mention of three things that might be practical and personal to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first one we are all familiar with is that intense desire to mate. The Lord has asked us to manage that desire in a way that is appropriate, proper, and virtuous. As we do that, we are entitled to receive counsel from Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Another one of those is this natural and intense desire is for power and dominion. That desire comes from that natural man who wants to control his environment. It's called the pecking order in the animal world out there. This is what the pecking order says: In a group of animals the mightiest pecks the less-mightier one and the less-mightier one pecks the next one down the line until the least mighty is pecked. And that pecking order is reinforced every day as they establish that dominance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We hear about bullying in schools and we hear about power struggles in politics. It's that natural man and the pecking order-the power to be stronger and to control. In the Doctrine &amp; Covenants it states, "We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature of disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Compulsion, control, or dominion when anyone does that to the least degree, in your marriage or in your Church responsibilities, you are out of bounds. It is wrong. So we have to learn to control that. Seeking for power or dominion is seeking your own life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third of those natural and intense desires is our right to survive and that we want more than our neighbor. We want you to be successful. It's not one or the other. It's a balancing act. When this desire controls us, covetousness and greed, this is bad. If you want to see an example of this, take a handful of jelly beans and hold them out to a child that is about three or four years old.&nbsp;Then ask, "Would you like one of these?" Notice how many jelly beans the child takes. Why would the child take more than one? It's that natural right of survival that they need to take more when they can.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have to overcome those natural things or we lose the Spirit of the Holy Ghost to direct us and to become who Heavenly Father wants us to become. So when the Lord said to Nephi, "Thou has not sought thine own life," Nephi had overcome those natural tendancies. The Lord watched Nephi over time making good decisions, seeking to do the Father's will, and keeping the commandments. He knew Nephi wouldn't make any decisions that would be contrary to His will."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So my question to you is: How many decisions do you suppose the Lord watched Nephi make before? This is what happens next. The Lord says to Nephi, "...Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presences of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />He basically gives Nephi power to cause a famine on the land to humble the people to repent.&nbsp; He trusts Nephi to do that with God's power. The Lord tells Nephi, "And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done." Why did God give this power to Nephi? In verse 5 it reads, "Yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How many decisions did God watch Nephi make of his own free will and choice? See the Lord trusted Nephi, and as he grew throughout his life, he became one with God and he became like God. And the Father empowered Nephi with His power.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So, in conclusion, let's summarize my message with one more text message.&nbsp;<br /><br />"When U tell some 1 what to do Ur telling them 2 become like U"&nbsp;<br /><br />If you trust someone to make the correct decisions, then don't ask, "So, where did you put the tigers?" Remember this: Trust leads to growth and growth leads to becoming. May we all allow each other to grow, to become like our Heavenly Father, and to be exalted.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I attended college here it was in the first quarter of my life. Now I'm in the last quarter at best. What I've said today is what I believe, and I believe it is important for you.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Student Support Director at BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Brother Jones currently serves as the Director of Student Support and has worked at BYU-Idaho since 1999 when he was hired to oversee the creation of the Get Connected program. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, he served as the Assistant Director of America's Freedom Festival at Provo. After earning a bachelor's degree from BYU, he went on to earn a master's in student development administration from Seattle University. He and his wife, Jennifer are the parents of four children, two boys and twin girls. He currently is serving as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor in the 72<sup>nd</sup> Young Single Adult Ward.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is great to be with you today. As we begin I invite your prayers on my behalf and for the spirit to be with us that we be taught and edified by the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />Each semester I have the opportunity to address student volunteers who participate in our programs at Student Support. At these trainings I often ask how many of them were led by the spirit to volunteer. Each time I ask this question, more than half of those in the audience raise their hand. The next question I ask is how many of them were there because someone invited them to participate. At this point almost everyone else has raised their hand. To me this is miraculous and speaks to the type of students who come to this campus: Those who are led by the spirit and those who are invited by others to act.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, I wish to ask you these same questions. How many of you, whether you are a student or an employee, were led by the spirit to come to BYU-Idaho?&nbsp; Please raise your hands. Now how many of you came to BYU-Idaho through invitation or by the encouragement of others? Please raise your hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us has been led or invited to be here at this institution at this time for a purpose. I have heard this same statement shared by those who lead this campus and I testify that this is true, you are here at this time for a reason.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have two additional questions for you and I want you to write down the thoughts that come to your mind as you answer them. Why is BYU-Idaho here and why are you here at BYU-Idaho?&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I need to be careful to avoid confusion. I don't want you to ponder on why the BYU-Idaho campus is located in Rexburg, in fact, I'm not sure any of us could come up with a good answer to that question, especially on the cold, freezing, windy days we have here. Instead, please ask yourself why does BYU-Idaho exist?&nbsp;<br /><br />Your answers to these two questions will no doubt be varied and perhaps even humorous. Most of you came here to get an education, earn your degree and obtain a good job. Others of you came here to further develop your talents, to associate with other latter-day saints, to work or teach in a gospel-centered environment, or my personal favorite: to be anxiously engaged in finding your better half! One of the highlights I have enjoyed since I was hired on to create the Get Connected program has been seeing the number of people who have met and got connected eternally through our programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In terms of getting an education, it is important to emphasize that you could have attended a number of other colleges or universities to receive your degree. The same applies to those who work here. There are many other colleges and universities you could have chosen to work at. On a personal note, unlike the rest of my siblings, I did not attend this university. Because I chose not to attend here I was somewhat labeled the black sheep of the family. However, once I was hired on here at BYU-Idaho, my family called it my repentance process, and all was forgiven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You are blessed to be here at one of the Lord's Disciple Preparation Centers. BYU-Idaho is not just a university. You are not merely university students. Studying here involves much more than taking tests and performing well in academic classes--although your academic development and performance truly are important. But there are essential lessons to be learned and preparations to be made at this DPC by the Lord's latter-day disciples."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Coming to this school is not just about our academic development. Much has been given to each of us and much is required. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has invested millions of tithing dollars in this school, which in essence is also an investment in you the students and all who work here. As recipients of these great blessings, you have a stewardship and a sacred responsibility to make the most of your time here and then go forth to build up the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kim B. Clark has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I believe two companion principles define our mission:&nbsp; discipleship and leadership. These principles will help prepare BYU-Idaho students for [their] roles in the Lord's kingdom and in the world. The development of 'disciple-leaders' is the focus of every aspect of BYU-Idaho."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>From this it should be clear that BYU-Idaho is here to help us strengthen our disciple-leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Are We Here?</strong><br />In 2002, when Elder David A. Bednar was serving as the President of BYU-Idaho he spoke at a Student Forum and talked about the miracle of BYU-Idaho and asked those in the audience "why are we here?" I invite you to listen closely to his words and to write down the impressions that come to your heart and mind.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><br />In this video, Elder Bednar repeatedly states that you are to touch for good the lives of people everywhere for as long as the earth shall last. During this time of your life, you are here to develop your skills, learning and leadership, so that you can be a person who can influence others for good.&nbsp;<br /><br />In D&amp;C 58:27-28 it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward."</p>
<p>I testify that each of us has the power within us to become the Lord's disciple leaders who will go out and make a difference in the lives of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the remainder of our time today, I wish to share with you three principles that have strengthened my disciple leadership and trust that these principles will bless your lives as well.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Principle # 1: Serve Others</strong><br />When Christ was upon the earth he spent his life serving others. In Matthew 20:28, it says, "the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister."&nbsp;<br /><br />On the second floor of the Kimball building, there is a quote by President Spencer W. Kimball which says,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>"God does notice us; and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."&nbsp;<br /><br />President Kimball also said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is by serving that we learn how to serve. When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves! In the midst of the miracle of serving, there is the promise of Jesus that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Now, some of you might be thinking "how can I help others, what do I have to offer?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>In John chapter six we read of a boy who had but five loaves of bread and two fishes. He gave all that he had to the Savior who in turn provided a miracle wherein 5,000 were fed. Just like this boy, we too can give what we have to the Savior and he will help us to bring about miracles in the lives of others.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust spoke on this saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It has been said that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great. Many nameless people with gifts equal only to five loaves and two small fishes magnify their callings and serve without attention or recognition feeding literally thousands."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Now, how do we find those who are in need of our help? Elder M. Russell Ballard answered this question when he said the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There is one simple daily practice that can make a difference for every member of the Church, including you boys and girls, you young men and you young women, you single adults, and you fathers and mothers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That simple practice is: In your morning prayer each new day, ask Heavenly Father to guide you to recognize an opportunity to serve one of His precious children. Then go throughout the day with your heart full of faith and love, looking for someone to help.... If you do this, your spiritual sensitivities will be enlarged and you will discover opportunities to serve that you never before realized were possible."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>As we pray and ask Heavenly Father to guide us to those we can serve we must listen to those impressions which come to us and then act upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Act On Impressions<br /></strong>The following is a story that a former student shared with me. She had participated as a volunteer in one of our organizations and had watched the same video with Elder Bednar that we watched a few moments ago. She said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was sitting in the Taylor chapel, and a video was played in which Elder Bednar stated, 'Yours is to touch for good the lives of people everywhere for as long as the earth shall last.' That struck me very vividly, and I felt as Joseph Smith said, 'that it seemed to enter with great force, into every feeling of my heart.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In high school there was a girl in my class that I didn't know particularly well but I always felt prompted to talk to her. I felt like I had never stepped out of my bubble to take the time to be her friend as I had felt in my heart I should. One day I woke up with an incredibly overwhelming feeling. I had the strongest impression that someone needed me at school that day. I had never felt such an impression and it frightened me so much that I pretended to be sick, and stayed home from school. The next morning I awoke with the exact same prompting 'Someone needs you at school today.' This time I decided to listen.&nbsp;"As I was walking in the hall, a friend approached me awkwardly and said, 'Sam committed suicide yesterday.' For two years I blamed myself for that event, condemning myself with thoughts of self-doubt because I didn't feel like I was worthy to make a difference. I didn't feel like I could have a future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But when I sat there and heard those words of Elder Bednar I knew that this was how the Lord saw me. Through Jesus Christ, I could be healed, made whole, and I could touch for good the lives of people everywhere-not just now-but for as long as the earth shall last. Suddenly, I knew I could become the kind of person the Lord wanted me to be, and I could serve in ways that I would never have imagined I would have the capacity to serve in before."</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I invite you to make it your life-long goal to ask in prayer each morning to be guided to recognize an opportunity to serve others, actively look for individuals to help, and listen for and act on the impressions you receive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle # 2: Invite Others</strong><br />Throughout his ministry Christ invited others to follow him, to keep his commandments and become like him. We can seek to bring others closer to Christ by influencing them for good and inviting them to act.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each Tuesday, following devotional, I have the opportunity to gather with student leaders in our area for disciple leadership trainings. At one of these gatherings earlier this semester, I received an impression that I felt needed to be shared with the group. At that time we were wrestling with a shortage of volunteers in our Student Ambassador program. We only had 50 volunteers and needed 200 in a very short amount of time. At the end of the meeting I invited those present to do two things: First, pray daily to find individuals they could invite to participate in this program, and second, pray and ask Heavenly Father to bless others with the desire to serve and lead them to us. The next two weeks were filled with inspiring experiences for our students as they invited others one-by-one to act, or had the experience of others coming up to them and asking them how they could get involved. Our invitations and prayers were answered and our volunteer needs were met. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me emphasize the power of invitation through an experience that took place in the fall of 2001. Elder Bednar spoke to a group of approximately 250 students gathered for a student leadership retreat and invited them to dress up in their Sunday best for the next devotional and to also go out and invite five others to join them and have those five in turn invite four, who would invite three, who would invite two, who would invite one.&nbsp;<br /><br />The power of inviting others was felt by President Eyring who spoke at that very devotional. In his remarks, he talked about students who influence and invite others to do good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The very fact that you dress nicely, I understand, at least is partly true because somebody may have said something to you. One of your friends may have suggested, 'Why don't we go dressed a little better for that meeting today.' Those of you in this room who did that...who said 'Why don't we do a little more so that the Spirit of God . . .'--you may not have used these words, but what you were saying was 'Let's go to that meeting in such a way that we might bring down the powers of heaven,' those of you in the room that had the courage to do that, to try to influence the persons around you, I'll make you a prophecy. I will simply tell you: The day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you're in. They will not quite know why, but you will know that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior would do--learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very well."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>You can influence others for good by inviting them with love to act. Examples of invitations you can extend include: holding apartment prayer, better living of the Honor Code, serving others, inviting others to join you at church, at devotional, and attending the temple.You have the power to influence the spirit of this campus, including the attendance at devotional. You could make it a practice to invite others each week to devotional, and in turn invite them to invite others. Do this for as long as you are here at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that as you use the power of invitation to touch for good the lives of others you will bring down the powers of heaven and become a stronger disciple leader, one whom the Lord can rely on to assist with His work.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Principle # 3 - Trust in the Lord</strong><br />In Proverbs 3:5 - it says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."</p>
<p>Let me share with you a few personal examples of how this has occurred in my life which also answers why I am here at BYU-Idaho.I had a verbal employment agreement before I ever left for graduate school. However, between my first and second year of graduate school the organization in which I would have been hired was restructured and those who wished to hire me were no longer in a position to do so. I started praying more earnestly to know what I should do for employment. The thought kept coming to me that I should return to Provo.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of my graduate school cohort was preparing to travel to Chicago for a national conference and job placement fair for our profession. Through prayer I had the strong impression that I did not need to go to Chicago, as I was to return to Provo upon graduation. However, I chose to ignore that impression and went to Chicago with my cohort.&nbsp;<br /><br />My failing to heed this impression proved nearly fatal to my confidence and pride. I submitted countless resumes and had a number of interviews, but not one single school contacted me back. Later in humble prayer I again felt the impression that I should return to Provo.This time I trusted in the Lord and returned to Provo with no job and very little money. After a few weeks I was able to secure a one year temporary job at BYU.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Eight months later, I still hadn't found anything permanent and was praying to know what I should do. This time I received a distinct impression that I would soon receive a phone call and be offered a job. It sounded crazy, yet I trusted in the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few weeks later the promised phone call came and I was offered a position as the Assistant Director of the Freedom Festival at Provo. I had volunteered with this organization throughout my undergraduate years at BYU and continued to assist them while at graduate school. Little did I know how much this opportunity, which the Lord led me to, would impact my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was through my job at the Freedom Festival that I met a young lady named Jennifer Blake.&nbsp; She was a volunteer with the Festival and we ended up dating for a month or so before it ended.&nbsp;<br /><br />By November it was time to start staffing our volunteer positions once again and I faced a major predicament. Jennifer was the only one who had experience with this particular responsibility and I knew I would need to contact her and ask her to continue to volunteer. I was nervous but to my surprise, she agreed to meet with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />She was working full-time for housing at BYU so I invited her to meet me in the lounge of the Wilkinson Center on the BYU campus for lunch. When she walked into the lounge, I felt like I was suddenly in a movie....it was as if time stood still, there was a bright light, and there may even been angels singing. In that moment I received a spiritual confirmation so strong and clear I could not deny. I knew I was going to marry her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Within one month after getting married we started to receive impressions that we would be leaving Utah. For us it was crazy to think about, we both loved our jobs and couldn't imagine leaving or doing anything else. However, in a short period of time, things changed and we felt we needed to look elsewhere for work. I looked for jobs everywhere but couldn't find anything in my area of expertise until I looked at the employment web site for what was then Ricks College. Sure enough, there was listing for a New Student Orientation position. I submitted my resume by mail, and seven days later received a job offer.&nbsp;<br /><br />I invite you to trust in the Lord, and counsel with him about your choice of major, volunteer opportunities, internship opportunities, and careers and then be willing to go wherever the Lord may direct you to build His kingdom.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that you will be blessed beyond measure as you put your trust in God and work to become what he wants you to become, do what he wants you to do, and go where he wants you to go.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Closing<br /></strong>I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father and for the guidance and direction he has given me. I am grateful for the times that I have placed my trust in Him rather than lean on my own understanding.&nbsp; Being here at BYU-Idaho has been a tremendous blessing in my life and I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I and my family have had to touch for good the lives of others while serving in this capacity and I express my love and appreciation for my wife and my family's support during my time here.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, I testify that the Prophet Joseph Smith saw God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. He restored Christ's true church upon the earth in these latter-days and is still involved in this work. I testify that we are guided by living prophets and apostles in our day and promise that we will be blessed as we hearken to their teachings. Most importantly I testify of the living, resurrected Christ. I have felt the pains of sin and have also felt the cleansing power of the atonement. I invite all to come closer to the Savior and be cleansed and perfected in Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Faculty, Department of Teacher Education</p>
<p>Chris Morley Wilson was born on Christmas Day, 1971.&nbsp; He is the youngest of six children, five brothers and one sister. &nbsp;Huntington, Utah, is his hometown, and he graduated from Emery High School in 1990. Chris enjoyed basketball, football, track, choir, and theater throughout his high school years. During his junior year he fouled out of what has been argued as the most unforgettable basketball game in Utah high school basketball history (Youtube 1989 Utah High School Basketball Unforgettable).&nbsp; His most influential spiritual experience in high school was his two-year assignment from his bishop to take the sacrament to an elderly couple in the ward each Sunday. Sister Powell was blind and Brother Powell suffered from black lung as a result of working in the coal mines.&nbsp; Guiding their hands towards the sacrament emblems each Sunday and hearing their grateful testimonies afterwards changed his world.<br /><br /> He attended Brigham Young University on a track scholarship, competing in the 800 meters.&nbsp; He earned Academic All-Conference honors all four years and was a team captain his senior season. He served his mission in Pusan, Korea.&nbsp; Upon returning from his mission he married his high school track coach's daughter, Rebecca Jean Nelson.&nbsp; She is a former Deseret News Sterling Scholar and Miss Teen of Utah who holds a master's degree in Speech and Language Pathology from BYU (and according to Chris should also get the opportunity to give a devotional). <br /><br />Chris received the Undergraduate Research and Creative Works Award from BYU in 1996 for research regarding school equity and non-traditional funding of schools and more importantly, his first daughter, Bethany, was born.&nbsp; He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Secondary Education as a Social Studies Composite Major in 1997.&nbsp; He taught in Nebo School District for four years while he completed a master's degree in Educational Leadership. During that time Chris and Rebecca welcomed their second daughter, Alissa, into their home.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2000 Chris moved his family to Chicago to pursue doctoral work in the field of Comparative International Education at Loyola University Chicago. <br /><br />In 2001 Chris came to BYU-Idaho for a practice interview and has been here ever since.&nbsp; Since 2001 six more Wilsons have joined the family: Charity (11), Mariah (9), Bryce (8), Brigham (5), Alaya (3) and Celeste (1 &frac12;).&nbsp; He has co-authored two book chapters and currently is working on his major contribution to his field, a comparative study of North and South Korean education from 1950 to the present.&nbsp; He also continues to persuade his MTC companion Brother Mark Bennion of the English Department to co-write a book titled "Ancient Poetic Form and the Lost Art of Teaching."&nbsp; Chris serves as bishop in his ward and as team lead to the Cultural Foundations course, the Developing World.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p>By raising our scriptures in devotional each week we demonstrate we are ready to be taught, and I appreciate you for coming thus prepared, but today I hope you came ready to act, as well. This devotional is going to be distinctive in that you will be doing. In Primary you learned a song called "Do as I'm Doing." This will be the pattern of learning for today. Prepare yourself to reflect and compose along with me. You can do it high or low, you can do it fast or slow, and in the end I invite you to compose.<br /><br />&nbsp;Our focus today is to start considering and preparing the Exodus chapters of our own life's story. We will make as much progress as we can during the remaining twenty-five minutes of this devotional, but that will not be the end. You see, unlike many who visit and speak to us for devotional, I have the home court advantage, and I intend to use it. I will be here tomorrow, and you will see me next semester, or the semester after that, so I plan to capitalize on this opportunity. Before you leave this institution I hope you and I are able to share with each other our experiences. Think of it this way if it helps--you are all now taking an Exodus class. It meets each Thursday during forum time if you aren't busy attending another University Forum, or we can get together by appointment. I have never had the opportunity to teach a religion class here at BYU-Idaho, so now is my chance. I am easy to find in the faculty directory, and I look forward to future experiences beyond the time we share together today.<br /><br /><br />Let's get started. You will need to brainstorm at least two chapter titles for your Exodus story. I'll do mine and then you do yours--remember "Do As I'm Doing." Here are my two chapter titles. I am going to call the first one "Mortality and Leaving our First Estate: From Innocence to Bodily Experience," for now. The title for my second Exodus chapter is currently the title of my devotional today "Personal Exodus: Keeping and Transcending Our Second Estate." &nbsp;Now, when you have a potential title, I invite you to share it with us by tweeting it to "#BYUIexodus." With a working title it is time to explore together the concept of exodus and how it relates to each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a grand scale the settings of our stories are the same. First, a pre-existence followed by an exodus to earth life and finally, an exodus to resurrected life. While the accounts are similar, they are not without personal differences. Our experiences occur in different seasons of time--Moses in the times of the Old Testament, you and I during the time of Restoration. Let's explore in more detail. I will then invite you to begin composing your story while I share mine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moses' story begins in a symbolically interesting way. Recall the story--before Moses is born an angry pharaoh seeks to stop the progress of Heavenly Father's covenant people. This pharaoh seeks to become God and a law unto himself and after his rebellion is afraid that the growing potential of God's children will frustrate his own power, so he seeks to place the Lord's covenant people in eternal bondage to him. I think you might at this point be recognizing a similarity to the period referred to as the pre-existence. Moses is born and is separated from his Jewish parents and raised in the fallen world of Pharaoh until he recognizes and acts against the injustice of that world and chooses to follow his conscience rather than the cultural practices and laws of Pharaoh. This is a key experience in the life of Moses and will be a crucial period in our own stories. Ask yourself these questions: How did Moses recognize the injustice of Pharaoh? When did you and I come to the same conclusion about the world of Pharaoh? How did Moses find the moral courage, faith, and strength to strike out on his own, to find the God he had been separated from? These are the personal questions that as we answer will fill the pages of our Exodus chapters. Using these questions as a guide I will tell you my story as you contemplate and brainstorm your own.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like many of you, and unlike the great Moses, my earthly parents taught me about the pre-existence and who I was before I was born on earth. But even with that knowledge I had to come to know and believe this in my heart as well as my mind. A devotional address given here in 2003 by Brother Matt Geddes helped me to understand my transformation from my first to my second estate, and I hope you will listen to what I share from his devotional and study the rest of it on your own so it can impact your life, as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />On that cold December day Brother Geddes taught us about aesthetics and anesthetics. He instructed that ". . . an anesthetic is something that numbs us and makes it difficult or impossible to feel . . . [while] an aesthetic is something that does the opposite: it enlivens us, and increases our capacity and sensitivity to feeling."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>With this idea I realized that keeping our first estate and following the Savior in the pre-existence allowed us to have these marvelous bodies which in turn grant us the ability to feel in ways that were not possible in our state of innocence in the pre-mortal world. We gained new powers to influence and be influenced by the light of Christ. Let me read to you about this from the Study Helps Section, Guide to the Scriptures from the Church's website regarding this concept.&nbsp;The light of Christ is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />I also realized that while the veil that shrouds earth life from pre-earth life exists for both sight and feeling, in my experience it is easier to feel the influence of my Heavenly Father than to work out His existence and relationship with me through my logical mind. So I encourage you to record in your first chapters of your personal book of Exodus when you first started to feel the influence of your Heavenly Father. When was it that you first felt the stirring of your conscience and made a choice according to this manifestation of the light of Christ? Share the choices that have livened your soul as aesthetic experiences and also offer as a warning to others regarding the anesthetic forces of your earthly life. Consult the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Article of Faith as taught by Brother Geddes. His discussion of virtue and its seven common manifestations, loveliness, and things praiseworthy is highly instructive.&nbsp;<br /><br />One outstanding aesthetic experience of my life was the priesthood assignment from my bishop to take the sacrament to my elderly and dying friends, the Powells. I felt closer to God each time we took the sacrament together. During another moment of my life while on a long training run I became swept up in a dream much like Nephi and Lehi's tree of life experience. Another aesthetic experience that enlivened my understanding of Christ as our good shepherd occurred while tending to our family sheep. There was the realization of eternity I felt as a young boy while laying on my back watching the clouds and then the stars one night. The feelings I had were much more powerful instruction than were the resulting thoughts. My dear brothers and sisters, you and I have made an exodus from our first estate and as part of our grand inheritance were given the ability to feel and know good from evil. By receiving a body that has upgraded feeling capabilities we can continue to progress rather than become stuck in our pre-mortal state.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My first chapter of Exodus consists of the aesthetic feelings and experiences that I have had. Now, as we continue, I invite you to jot down your aesthetic moments that mark your progression and exodus from your first estate to your second. Get some ideas down and we can visit about them in the weeks and months ahead. Once you have ideas recorded there are many different mediums by which you can express the feelings you have. Brother Geddes uses pottery, my brother Evan uses paint, my father uses music, my mom uses flowers, and Brother Bennion uses poetry. I even have students who express feelings as mathematical equations and they are outstanding--you should see them. Once you have explored these feelings you can develop talents by which to express them. Remember the parable of the talents and take advantage of the opportunities outside your daily schoolwork to develop such talents while here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Even giving this address is an opportunity for me to express my feelings and develop my talents through the medium of public speaking.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now it is time to begin considering our experience here in the second estate. Remember the title I have chosen, "Personal Exodus: Keeping and Transcending our Second Estate." Before leaving this estate we have a work to do--we must keep our second estate. We need to make sure not to lose what we gained by keeping our first estate, namely the manifestation of the light of Christ we refer to as our conscience. We read about those in the scriptures who lost their ability to feel, and in my life today I find myself running into more and more of this sad phenomena. Individuals are finding anesthetics to cope with the realities of a fallen world rather than aesthetics from a redeemed one. Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to multiple countries in Africa with our Cultural Foundation's Developing World team. I learned many things, but one of the simplest yet most profound lessons was how not to lose things but to keep and cherish them. Here are seven principles to consider, and with each I invite you to ponder and share with us again through a tweet what you see are the spiritual parallels (#BYUIexodus).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />(By the way, there is a story from our trip to each of these principles, but I don't have the time now to share them.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Along with not losing the important inheritance from our first estate, we must put our agency and conscience to the test and receive the saving ordinances of the gospel, namely baptism, confirmation, and the temple ordinances. In order to keep our second estate we need to be covenant makers and keepers. These covenants will help us not only keep but allow us to transcend this our second estate. Now let's explore this in more detail.&nbsp;<br /><br />In baptism we are invited to take upon ourselves the name of Christ and live according to His gospel. The gospel, faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, is the way of putting off the natural, telestial part of our lives while in a telestial state. It is our exodus ticket to transcending our second estate and receiving additional degrees of glory, even becoming like unto God our Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For the next few minutes I want to talk particularly about the part of the gospel referred to as receiving the Holy Spirit. If we have the light of Christ and its manifestation, the conscience, by virtue of keeping our first estate, why is it necessary to receive the Holy Ghost? Why can't our conscience be sufficient to help us keep and transcend our second estate? Let me hopefully shed some light on this question. The Holy Spirit is the third member of the Godhead and shares with God the Father and God the Son a perfect unity of understanding, purpose, and doctrine. The Holy Spirit doesn't have a body of flesh and bones as we do, but is a personage of Spirit. In being so, the Spirit is capable, when invited, to enter and share with our souls not the telestial feelings of right and wrong we receive from our own conscience but the celestial feelings of right and wrong that exist in the third estate. These are God-like feelings from another higher plane of existence.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is time now to share concepts from an influential devotional address given at BYU-Idaho by Lili Anderson in 2005 entitled "Three Realms of Law, Light, and Life." Pondering this address through the paradigm of Brother Geddes' concepts of aesthetic and anesthetic helped me to see the changes in our hearts and feelings that must occur if we are to keep and transcend this second estate. Put simply, in the pre-existence we had what we called earlier innocent feelings relating to eternal truth; we felt like it would be a good thing for us but really were somewhat clueless and innocent to the actual feelings of the flesh. In this life we have experienced natural man, telestial, or, from the field of psychology, egocentric, immediate gratification feelings relating to eternal truth. In this life we have felt the gamut of what the mortal body can experience. The next step of transcending our second estate is the terrestrial world, which according to Sister Anderson, is governed by obedient hearts, and following that there are the true celestial feelings of a celestial heart governed by charitable feelings. Let me quote from Sister Anderson regarding the celestial law and heart, which is where I am committed to go, and I pray you are as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Celestial law, I believe, can be defined as Christ-like being, as distinct from Christ-like behavior, which can be found at the terrestrial level. If we have self-control and we can delay gratification, we can behave like Christ, but we still are not&nbsp;<em>as He is</em>. In order to truly become as the Savior is, our heart and behavior must be integrated. That is, not only do we&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;the right things, but we&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;the right things. We are not kind because we should be and it works better, but because we see people as God does and it is no longer in us to be&nbsp;<em>un</em>kind. The laws of God are not just observed, they are engraven upon our hearts. Coming to live celestial law is a line-on-line, precept-on-precept experience, a process dependent on our cultivating a sensitivity to the tutorings of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 32:5). The outcomes of living celestial law are the peace that passeth all understanding (see Philippians 4:7), and creation/rebirth. This kind of creation is not only a reference to the future, when celestialized individuals will be able to participate in the same kind of creative work that the Father does, but a reference to the birth of the&nbsp;<em>new creature</em>&nbsp;in each of us (see 2 Corinthians 5:17, Mosiah 27:26), as we are born of the Holy Ghost and sanctified (see Alma 13:12, 3 Nephi 27:20).&nbsp;<br /><br />Now back to the question of why we need to receive the Holy Ghost and not simply rely on conscience to get us through. This third member of the Godhead in its spiritual state knows and feels perfectly the true degree of sorrow for every sin, the true joy of every truth, the true profound comfort that God would give and is willing to share these with our hearts and souls so we can learn and be instructed more perfectly. The Holy Spirit is the teacher of how to move from a telestial conscience to a celestial heart. How can we truly repent and be cleansed from a bad decision unless we know and can experience through the Holy Spirit the anguish of the price paid for that sin by the Savior and the goodness and truthfulness of the law upon which it is predicated and which we have broken?&nbsp; The Spirit will guide you and I to celestial aesthetic or awakening experiences that will inspire us to not be satisfied with a mere telestial second estate life as your end kingdom and glory.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the aspects that distinguishes the type of education we hope to offer our students preparing to be teachers here at BYU-Idaho is that each learning experience needs to be felt along with being thought about. As we study the brain and the way in which a person learns, we are finding in ever-increasing degrees that the affective aspects of learning are as important as the cognitive ones. If students are educated to search the feelings of their souls as well as their minds, we believe they are prone to learn both by study and by faith and truly be taught by the Holy Spirit. In this way, I believe students who prepare to be future teachers here at BYU-Idaho truly are unique, and we will be fulfilling our mission to rethink education. Please seek the Holy Spirit's guidance and receive its celestial aesthetic feelings when it brings them to you as you learn. It doesn't matter the subject or the teacher. This step is a requirement of the learner.Let's continue on with Moses' experience in the book of Exodus.&nbsp; Moses is exiled from Egypt because he refused to fit into the laws and norms of Pharaoh's world. This can be a very lively part of our stories as we come to be exiled and freely leave the symbolic Egypts of this world.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will share one of these experiences from my second book of Exodus with you. Right before leaving on my mission during my second semester of college at BYU-Provo I took an education class. It had no grades, and I was given the opportunity to design my own assignments for learning. At first, I despised the class and attacked the teacher with the laws of Pharaoh that I had become accustomed to. I attacked him like the task master you see whipping the children of Israel in the classic&nbsp;<em>Ten Commandments</em>&nbsp;movie. I jeered that he was a lousy teacher because he wasn't communicating exactly what he expected out of us. I told him that without points, how could I be motivated to learn, let alone the hormone-ridden teenagers I was preparing to teach. No human could ever get through junior high, high school, or college on intrinsic motivation alone. I even exiled myself from the class to avoid being tormented by being freed. I sought to find solace back in Pharaoh's Egypt which I had adopted. Imagine the great Exodus scene in that same&nbsp;<em>Ten Commandments</em>&nbsp;movie as the children of Israel are fleeing through the parted Red Sea and me running back to Egypt as fast as I could.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly after my self-imposed-exile return to Egypt I went to my instructor's office to drive my final, well-rehearsed Pharaoh's nail into his instructionally irrational coffin. He charitably listened and weathered my railings with a smile and said, "You have put great effort into proving my ideas wrong, and I respect and admire that level of effort, but have you given equal effort to proving that these ideas I'm sharing with you might work?" The Holy Ghost pricked my heart--I know it was more than my conscience. I took with me my golden calf for a few more semesters until I had a sincere change of heart. Even in courses that were run like my beloved Egypt I began designing my own assignments and seeing if instructors would accept them, and to my surprise when they were good they frequently did. I started refusing to treat each course I took as a stand-alone learning experience to pass through by merely meeting the criteria of the instructor but began to integrate my learning into much larger wholes. I even stopped saying that I had to do homework and replaced that phrase with "I am going to go learn some more." Guess what? Now, I am privileged to work at a divinely guided but humanly run university that occasionally feels like Egypt, and I get the opportunity to bring out of bondage those who want to learn intrinsically. What a journey! What has yours been like? Get some ideas down and bring them to our Exodus class sometime in the future. Perhaps next Thursday in class we will see a sketch of someone's second chapter of Exodus experience, listen to an inspired melody being developed, or read a great and profound couplet that has been composed. I can't wait.&nbsp;<br /><br />Back to Moses' story, he eventually finds and joins God's humble followers in Midian and diligently strives to put off the natural man of this world. He goes to the mountain of the Lord and sees the fire of the Lord and seeks to know more. It is at this point, through a prophet of God, we receive additional revelation for our day.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have pondered the meaning of the book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, and I have come to see deeper meaning and application of this profound record in my life as I have likened it unto myself. Let me show you something interesting. Consider with me the beginning of the third chapter of Exodus as if you were the prophet Joseph Smith, in the spirit of restoring precious truths of the Plan that were lost. At verse four imagine being shown and translating the entire book of Moses as if it was given by the Lord from the burning bush.&nbsp; Then finish Moses' earthly story as he leads the children of Israel through the trek to the Promised Land. Please consider why this is given to us in our season of the Restoration.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moses learns the truth of who he is and the calling God has for him in helping to deliver God's covenant people from their captivity. What does the Law of Consecration mean? Have you felt it yet? What does Zion feel like? These experiences will be great for the Transcending Our Second Estate section of Personal Exodus chapter two. If you haven't experienced this yet go back to the gospel and exercise faith, repent, seek and receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you will is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair, Department of Geology</p>
<p>Sister Willis currently serves as the chair of the Geology Department.<br /><br />She earned a bachelor and master degree in geology from BYU and a Ph. D. in geology from the University of Utah. &nbsp; <br /><br />Before coming to teach at BYU-Idaho, Sister Willis worked from home for 10 years as an instructional designer and consultant on math and science educational software courses. &nbsp; <br /><br />In her free time, Sister Willis enjoys hiking, cross country and downhill skiing, playing the piano, reading the classics, gardening, and walking her dog. &nbsp; <br /><br />She and her husband, Grant, are the parents of three children and one grandchild.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Like many of you, I collected pretty rocks as a child. I not only collected them but I asked questions about each one--What kind is it? How did it get those colors? Why isn't it sparkly? My questions must have nearly driven my parents crazy because my Christmas gifts soon evolved from dolls to a rock identification kit and books about the earth.</p>
<p>This beautiful picture of Mt. Moran in the Tetons, photographed by my brother John, reflects a fundamental question that helped shape my academic studies. The actual question is immaterial, what's important is that I left the serenity of the landscape, and asked a question. What question would you ask about this scene? It likely depends on your background and interests. An outdoor enthusiast may ask about climbing routes, a botanist may wonder about the effects of glaciation on conifers, an artist might want to know how to best capture the reflections in the lake, and a geologist may ask about the tectonic forces that built the mountains. The variety and depth of questions that can be asked about a simple mountain scene can be as numerous as the people who view it.&nbsp;<br /><br />The ability and desire to ask questions and search for answers is a uniquely human attribute that is vital to the scientific, artistic, and religious advancements of humanity. We start asking questions at a very young age, as any parent of a precocious 3-year old knows. This suggests that we bring a questioning spirit with us to earth, and that learning by asking and seeking is one reason that our Heavenly Parents have given us the gift of mortal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brother Michael Otterson stated in a BYU-Idaho devotional that "questioning, probing, searching and exploring when accompanied by an attitude of personal growth and spiritual enrichment is not only one of the joys in life ... it is absolutely essential to our continued progression."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In other words, questions are the key to progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The role of asking questions in the Church has received recent media attention which may make you wonder why I would choose a topic that some might view as controversial. Let me explain. Several months ago, when I was asked to speak in devotional, I generated a long list of topics, which I gradually narrowed to two. Just before my deadline to submit the title of my talk--yes, devotional speakers have deadlines too--I knelt in prayer, and asked which topic would be most useful to you. I fully expected the answer to be "just pick one, they are both great." But I woke with the distinct impression that neither topic was right. &nbsp;I was to speak about questions. The recent controversy over questioning may have left some of you with unanswered questions; I believe this is one reason I was prompted to speak on this timely topic.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are three primary points about questions and questioning that I would like to establish today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Asking questions is part of our religious heritage<br />2) Questions of different types can be sources of intellectual stimulation and light<br />3) Challenging questions are not forbidden and can be embraced with faith and light.</p>
<p>My prayer is that you will leave today with an increased desire and confidence to actively engage in asking questions and seeking answers in your own life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>History suggests that questions have been, and continues to be, important in the Church of Jesus Christ. The scriptures as well as early and current Church leaders assert that we should be actively engaged in asking questions. Nephi points out that if we don't ask questions about matters we don't understand, then we will be left in the dark:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Nephi's words suggest that asking questions is vital to letting in spiritual light, and is the first step to opening the shutters of our mind to the possibility of an answer. If we never open the shutters, we reject the opportunity to experience learning and light.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, prompted by what he read in James Chapter 1, moved into the light spoken of by Nephi when he asked the pivotal question: "Which of all the [churches] ... should I join?"3 And significantly, after he received the answer to that question, Joseph continued to actively ask and seek. Had he stopped with the answer to his first question, we would know little of such truths as the power of the atonement, the need for temples and the purpose of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your testimony, like the prophet Joseph's, likely started by seeking the answer to a question; and like him you can continue to receive light and knowledge by asking questions about gospel topics.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph's pattern of asking and seeking was foundational to restoring the Church of Jesus Christ and continues to be encouraged by Church leaders today. As an example, I was in the BYU-Idaho Center a few years ago when Sister Julie B. Beck, former General Relief Society President, conducted a meeting in which she encouraged us to formulate questions about life and the gospel. She then invited a few to share their questions. Rather than just answering them, Sister Beck opened her scriptures and helped us discover the answers together. At first I wondered why she didn't just give a general-conference-type address, but as I became engaged in actively seeking answers with her, I saw her wisdom. She was helping individuals learn to move from the darkness of ignorance into the light of understanding, just as Nephi suggested.&nbsp;Elder David A. Bednar taught that parents can replicate that experience in their homes. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Imagine, a family home evening in which children are invited and expected to come prepared to ask questions about what they are reading and learning in the Book of Mormon--or about an issue that recently was emphasized in a gospel discussion... And imagine further that the children ask questions the parents are not prepared adequately to answer... What a glorious opportunity for family members to search the scriptures together and to be tutored by the Holy Ghost."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The process of asking and searching isn't limited to a home with children. Any individual can do as Elder Bednar suggests and ask questions about the scriptures they read or a gospel discussion they heard; any individual can then search for answers and request tutoring by the Holy Ghost. That's a powerful concept. Are you applying it in your life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your questions about spiritual matters? They likely will differ from the questions of your friends and family because your interests, depth of spiritual understanding, and life experiences vary. As an example, Nephi's spiritual maturity was greater than that of his brothers; he had the faith to ask deep gospel questions, and the knowledge base to understand the answers, while his brothers had neither. But according to Nephi, all was not lost; his brothers could develop their abilities if they would keep the commandments, believe they could receive, and not harden their hearts.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The choice to ask and receive was in their control.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I'd like to discuss four categories of questions that can bring light and understanding:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Questions on gospel doctrine<br />2) Questions that require personal reflection<br />3) Requests for guidance<br />4) Questions about human suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Questions on Gospel Doctrine<br /></strong>These questions focus on doctrine of the Church and answering them is facilitated by purposeful scriptural analysis. Doctrinal questions range from a simple search to understand a single word to complex, lifelong searches on deeper doctrinal topics. And one can lead to the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Bro. Wilson defined light in devotional last week, but a quest to understand the power of spiritual light can lead to insights whenever the scriptures are read. I have learned that when a doctrinal question reflects a sincere desire to know, seeking its answer can be intellectually as well as spiritually engaging, and can transform gospel study from passive reading to active seeking; from a chore on a to-do-list to a compelling, anticipated pursuit; from repetition to revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Hugh Nibley, one of the most prolific researchers of LDS Church doctrine and a deeply spiritual man wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If I went to the temple five times and nothing happened, I would [have] stop[ped] going. But I've gone hundreds of times, and the high hopes of new knowledge with which I go up the hill every week are never disappointed."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When I first read Bro. Nibley's words, I questioned how he was able to do this, because to be honest, my temple experiences, though enjoyable, were not usually a time of spiritual tutoring. One day while contemplating this in the temple, I had a flash of inspiration. Bro. Nibley came to the temple with a specific gospel question, while I usually came seeking peace or direction on a decision. If I want to be tutored, I must bring a question, for as Nephi taught, the mysteries of God are unfolded only to those who diligently seek.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that if we don't ask doctrinal questions in our temple attendance and scripture study, we miss an essential key to progress and the joy of receiving revelatory light.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Questions That Require Personal Reflection</strong><br />A second type of question that can help increase spiritual light is that which triggers personal reflection. Our son, Elder Jacob Willis, who is currently serving in the Virginia Chesapeake mission, is very good at asking our family reflective questions in his weekly emails home. These questions require us to evaluate our testimonies, deepen our faith and sometimes make changes in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently Elder Willis asked, "Which passage in the Book of Mormon has helped you the most in your life?" This simple question guided my scripture study for several days. It caused me to think deeply about both the Book of Mormon and my life, as I re-read marked scriptures and pondered their influence. One such passage is one of my favorite reflective questions; it is directed by Alma to members of the church, "And now behold, I say unto you ... if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Essentially Alma is asking, are you in the light or in the dark?&nbsp;<br /><br />Personal reflection such as that prompted by Alma can help us make difficult, but necessary changes in direction in our lives. To illustrate, I would like to share a story about our oldest son, Tyler, who recently climbed Mt. Orizaba, the highest mountain in Mexico and the third highest in North America.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tyler and a friend started their grueling climb at 2:00 a.m. on a cold, clear April night. Navigating huge, unanticipated ice crystals growing on the glacier slowed their progress enough that they were climbing at a time of day when dangerous lightning storms might develop. As Tyler neared the summit he learned of a threatening, massive thunderhead that had been hidden from view by the mountain. So 100 yards from the top, he had to make a decision ... "do I finish the climb and risk the storm, or do I turn back now?"&nbsp; He later shared the self-reflection that helped him make the difficult decision to turn around, "If I die on this mountain," he thought, "someone else will raise my daughter." As you ponder this story, you may want to reflect on your path. Will it lead to spiritual security? Are you willing to make the hard decision to turn around if a friend warns that you are headed towards a spiritual storm?&nbsp;<br /><br />Requests for guidance from Heavenly Father represent my third category of questions. Guidance questions vary significantly by your stage in life and can include: "Where should I live?", "What should I major in?", or, for married students, "How can we both finish college?" You likely have heard about people who receive a direct answer to such questions, and simply need to follow the well-lit path. While faith-promoting, I have observed that this level of guidance is more rare than common; a more typical answer is silence.&nbsp;<br /><br />This silence can be daunting, and can lead to bitterness or a fear that Heavenly Father doesn't care for you as much as He cares for someone who received a direct answer. I testify that this is not so, and I'd like to suggest a different perspective. Silence is actually a strong vote of confidence. It is Heavenly Father's way of saying, "I know you can make this decision on your own, you really can, and you will grow more Godlike in the process."&nbsp;<br /><br />Our daughter, Emily, describes the darkness of an unanswered request for guidance as being in the middle of a room where there is no glimmer of light. She knows there is a light switch, but its whereabouts are a mystery. She is tempted to stay safely rooted where she is, but choosing safety means never finding the light. So she moves tentatively forward feeling carefully for each step determined to find a wall, because light switches are usually on walls.&nbsp;<br /><br />I watched Emily apply this metaphor when she neared college graduation; interestingly as she felt her way in the dark, she seemed to develop an internal flashlight whose beam was just bright enough to illuminate her next step. She learned to trust, not just in Heavenly Father, but in her own tuition. This type of strength could not occur if Heavenly Father had laid out her steps in bright LED lights.&nbsp;<br /><br />The process of seeking answers is no more poignant than when asking questions about human suffering, the last category I will discuss before moving to the topic of embracing challenging questions. Questions about human suffering often start with the word "why." Some focus on world tragedies: "Why are there tsunamis and typhoons that kill tens of thousands of people?" Others focus on the misfortune of those close to you: "Why did that car hit and kill my niece?" And yet others focus on personal hardship "Why was my prayer to find my lost car keys answered, but my prayers to find a spouse are not?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Such questions often arise from heart-wrenching situations that result from sharing earth with natural disasters, disease, and other people. In other words, trials are part of life and their presence is not a litmus test for personal righteousness. President James E. Faust stated:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Into every life there come the painful, despairing days of adversity and buffeting. There seems to be a full measure of anguish, sorrow, and often heartbreak for everyone, including those who earnestly seek to do right and be faithful."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Finding an answer to a personal "why" question can be a difficult and lengthy process. Jessica George, my nephew's wife who suffers from a debilitating illness that leaves her mostly bedridden, relates in the current&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, "Through the years, I began to see that while this was not the future I had anticipated, it was exactly the life God had planned for me."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Her answer rings true. Because it was revealed to her for her life. It was not stated by a well-meaning friend who does not have revelatory stewardship. My dad, a physician who saw the suffering of many, thought it was best not to tell others that their particular trial was part of God's plan for them. Why? Because it may not be true, it may "just be life." The best answer to a "why" question is sometimes a simple "I don't know." I testify that God will comfort us in life, even when He doesn't protect us from life; and that His comfort can bring light to the darkness of tragedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I have briefly suggested ways that four categories of questions can bring light into your life. Some questions, like unanswered requests for guidance and questions about human suffering, may require time, faith, and a willingness to accept silence or "I don't know" as an answer. This is not easy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Similarly, seeking answers to tough doctrinal questions may be a prolonged, difficult process that feels devoid of light. In fact, some of you might be thinking right now, "I, or a friend, have gospel questions that don't feel like they bring light - in fact they seem to bring just the opposite." Asking and seeking answers to these difficult questions can be an important part of some, though not all, people's spiritual development. For those who have such questions, not seeking an answer is akin to perishing in darkness, while embracing the question can bring the joy of searching and the possibility of resolution.&nbsp;<br /><br />When faced with a troubling doctrinal question, you may feel that darkness and confusion dominate your life and that you are alone in your struggles. President Uchtdorf implied that many faithful members of the Church can relate with these feelings, when he stated, "There are few members of the Church who, at one time or another, have not wrestled with serious or sensitive questions."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>I want to share a few insights that have helped me deal with difficult questions; these insights are not meant to answer your questions, nor are they meant to diminish the complexity of your struggles; they are shared to help you maintain light as you seek resolution.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will start with a story related by M. Sue Bergin in a recent BYU Magazine; I quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When Tom Puzey was a teenager, he became perplexed by arguments challenging his religious beliefs. He went to his dad ... in emotional anguish, doubting all he had been taught. His father smiled, hugged him, and said, 'This is wonderful.' Then his father told him, 'It's okay to question ... You'll figure it out. And Tommy ... you're going to be okay."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Tom later noted that he believed his father, which gave him added confidence to resolve his doubts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story contains three key points: First, it's okay to ask the questions; questioning does not a rebel make. Second, if someone comes to you with doubts, try not to react in shock or dismay; rather, do as Tom's dad did, and let them know that you have confidence in their ability to work through their questions. Encourage open heartfelt conversation and inquiry, as actively supported by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in an official statement made on June 11, 2014: "The Church is a family made up of millions of individuals with diverse backgrounds and opinions. There is room for questions and we welcome sincere conversations."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Third, if you struggle with difficult questions, have confidence in yourself, like Tom did, that you can, if you choose, maintain your spiritual base. I take comfort in knowing that&nbsp;<br /><br />Brother Michael Otterson, a convert to the Church and the current Managing Director of Church Public Affairs, has unanswered questions:&nbsp;<br /><br />"... there were two big questions with which I had greatly wrestled and which the missionaries had not been able to answer satisfactorily. Neither could I find answers in Church literature. ...&nbsp; Since I could not resolve them, I decided to put them on the shelf for some future resolution."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Despite his unresolved questions, Bro. Otterson was baptized and has served in the Church for many years. His example suggests that you can continue to attend Church meetings and fulfill your Church callings, even as you seek answers to your questions. Doing so does not make you a hypocrite or devalue your service. In fact, President Uchtdorf suggests that one purpose of the Church is to provide a safe place where all, even those with challenges, can "nurture and cultivate the seed of faith."<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />One principle that I have learned about asking difficult questions is found in the poem, "All that is Gold does not Glitter" from J.R.R. Tolkien's book, The Lord of the Rings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"All that is gold does not glitter,<br />Not all those who wander are lost;<br />The old that is strong does not wither,<br />Deep roots are not reached by the frost"<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read this poem first as a young adult and the last line "Deep roots are not reached by the frost," helped me realize early in life that if I want to maintain my spiritual light, then I need to develop a deep root that is protected from the frost of doubt. My root is my love for and belief in the Savior. I believe in the wonder of His birth and miracles; I feel of His love as I study His words; I anguish with Mary at His tomb; and I rejoice in His ultimate triumph over death and sin. I declare with Peter that "[He] is the Christ, the Son of the Living God"<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and with Joseph Smith "that He lives!"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />My testimony of the Savior has helped me through many difficult experiences including resolving questions about sensitive issues. I would like to share one such experience; I will not share the specifics of my question or my answer, because I want you to feel the joy of discovering and resolving your own questions. As I share my experience, listen for when I learned or applied these principles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was a teenager I was troubled with questions about a particular gospel issue. Early in my questioning I ranted to myself in a demanding voice, wanting to know the answer "why, why is it this way; I just don't get it." Not surprisingly, no answers came while I was in that stage. Just as a parent may let a child storm in private about a family issue; Heavenly Father let me storm alone. He was not going to try to communicate with me, because I was not ready to hear or understand the answers. Rather than abandon my faith over an unresolved issue, I set my question aside for a few years. In the meantime I served a mission, read and studied my scriptures, and spiritually matured. The question never really went away, but I chose to be temporarily satisfied with "I don't know."&nbsp;<br />Later, when I took the question off the shelf, I was more receptive. I no longer demanded an answer, and I didn't limit the timeframe, or how or where I would receive insights. The answer didn't come all at once. Insights came at odd times and in odd places: while reading an article in a non-LDS magazine, left on an airplane; evaluating a statistical analysis in a newspaper; listening to a discussion in ward council; or doing the dishes. I found it surprising that many of my insights did not come while listening to general conference or during scripture study; but when I received an insight I could see how it fit directly with those sources.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over a period of several years, my answer was built "line upon line."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;It was as if a dimmer switch in my brain was gradually increasing the light. A few years ago I thought I had received all the answers that I would get on this issue even though there was still one unresolved aspect. But I am happy to report, that while I was preparing this talk, my daughter shared with me an article written by a faithful LDS scholar that provided a new perspective. I am now analyzing how it fits with my earlier insights and with Church doctrine. And the light has grown brighter yet, in fact it is brilliant.&nbsp;<br /><br />What if I never had asked the question, or what if I had asked and not sought to resolve it beyond that which I could find on Google or in the first few pages of the Book of Mormon? My life probably would still be okay, but I believe it is richer because I asked and I patiently struggled for years to be brought, as Nephi suggests, "into the light."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior, speaking to Joseph Smith verifies that questioning is one way to find joy and light in the gospel:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; And then shall ye know ... all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I affirm that questioning is part of our religious heritage, that there are many types of questions that can bring light into our lives, and that asking questions--even about difficult subjects is not taboo. Open dialogue and sharing insights on similar struggles are part of building a community of saints. As you leave today, I hope you will have the courage and insight to ask the questions that will best help you gain spiritual light. Perhaps you can start with one of these:</p>
<p>In closing I would like to express my love to those who struggle and whose questions have not yet been answered. I pray that you will find peace and feel of the Savior's love. I express thanks to those who made this devotional possible especially my family for sharing their insights and stories. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Internal Audit Director</p>
<p>Brother Kevin Allred currently serves as the Internal Audit Director here at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />He graduated from Ricks College and then attended BYU where he earned a bachelor's and master's degrees in Accounting. &nbsp; <br /><br />Before coming to BYU-Idaho, Brother Allred worked for a school district in Texas and in public accounting in Texas and Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />In his free time, Brother Allred enjoys spending time with his family, gardening, and playing basketball. &nbsp; <br /><br />He met his wife, Tamina, at Ricks College. They are the parents of seven children, and currently they have three grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As was mentioned, I am the Internal Audit Director here on campus. I'm pretty sure I know what you are thinking. You are probably thinking, "Wow! That really sounds exciting! I hope he tells me more about how I can have a career in internal auditing." By a show of hands, how many of you were thinking that? Well, I hope to convince you that not only do we need to be internal auditors but that it is a lifelong endeavor. My desire today is to help us all become better internal auditors as we apply the Atonement in our lives, anchor ourselves to Christ, and are examples for our families to do so as well.<br /><br />I would like to explore two words or phrases that accountants will readily recognize and that everyone who has a debit or credit card should recognize. The first is the word "reconciliation." In accounting, when we reconcile an account, we determine what items are causing the account balance to be different from the standard (or what it should be) and then make adjustments to get the balance to that standard. However, this principle is not limited to accounting. Several years ago, a co-worker who was a project manager in the Facilities, Design, and Construction area often kidded me about being a "bean counter" and called me an "auditor" (not as a term of respect or admiration). I reminded him that his job required him to monitor what the construction contractor was doing and make sure that the construction was done according to the plans or standards. I told him, "You're an auditor." Needless to say, he wasn't thrilled with that assessment. Any time we have a standard, we can review how close the actual behavior is to the standard and then reconcile back to the standard.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's see how we can use this principle in the gospel. In the Book of Mormon, Jacob implores us to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...be&nbsp;<em>reconciled</em>&nbsp;unto him through the&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;of Christ, his&nbsp;Only Begotten Son, ... and be presented as the&nbsp;first-fruits&nbsp;of Christ unto God..."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In his epistle to the Romans, Paul tells us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For if, when we were enemies, we were&nbsp;<em>reconciled</em>&nbsp;to God by the&nbsp;death&nbsp;of his Son, much more, being&nbsp;<em>reconciled</em>, we shall be saved by his life. And not only&nbsp;so,&nbsp;but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the&nbsp;atonement."&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in the footnote to verse 11, the word atonement in Greek means reconciliation or restoration to favor.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Preach My Gospel, the Atonement is defined this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinners and allowing them to be reconciled to God."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Later, we are told that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We can use the Atonement to see where our lives are different from the standard or commandments and then make the necessary adjustments to reconcile our lives to God. This is why all of us should become better internal auditors--auditors of our own lives in reconciling ourselves to God through the Atonement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second term is "internal controls." As internal auditors, we look at processes and activities to ensure that proper internal controls are in place to mitigate the risk of errors or theft. Sometimes, the controls may seem unnecessary or may seem to imply that the person isn't trusted. That is not the case. Controls help honest people stay honest, much like having lockers that lock in the temple. Those who understand the nature of man set up controls for themselves. It is interesting to note that in our interactions with the Church Educational System Audit Committee members, their concern is that we help ensure that proper controls are in place to save souls. It is important that we safeguard physical assets, but the integrity of employees and students is critical.&nbsp;<br /><br />King Mosiah had an excellent grasp on the nature of man and the nature of our weakness and why internal controls are necessary. He describes how we can put internal controls in place to guard against that weakness.&nbsp;<br /><br />As described in Mosiah 29, recall that Mosiah knew that he would soon die and asked the people who should be their king. The people wanted his son, Aaron, to be king but Aaron was gone on a mission to the Lamanites. Mosiah was afraid that if another was appointed, there would arise contentions. Also, what if Aaron came back and was angry?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Aaron was serving a mission but Mosiah knew that the natural man can rise up if proper controls are not in place. So, he set up a system of checks and balances for the government. What checks and balances will we set up in our lives to guard against pride? Mosiah then describes the blessings of having a righteous king but that isn't always possible. He reminded them of wicked king Noah and the wickedness and abominations of his people which caused them to be brought into bondage just as we are brought into bondage when we sin. They remained in bondage until they repented and humbled themselves before God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mosiah also describes how hard it is to get rid of a wicked king because he has "friends in iniquity."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;When we have an addiction or other sin we are trying to overcome, it is hard because we keep going back to our friends in iniquity. Thus, the internal control Mosiah describes is to remove ourselves from those friends in iniquity. These so-called friends aren't necessarily people, but may be access to inappropriate websites or harmful substances left in our homes or many other things. That is why we need to set up internal controls that will help us resist temptation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next, I would like to address our responsibility to our families. This reconciliation process that anchors us to Christ through the Atonement<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and the setting of good internal controls is a lifelong process, made stronger as we teach and testify to our families.In the book of Alma, we learn what Alma the Younger did after being rejected by so many of the Zoramites when he was "grieved for the iniquity of his people."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Since he couldn't have the desired impact on everyone, he went to where he could have a lasting impact."Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Is it any wonder that his sons would go on to have a tremendous impact on thousands of people?&nbsp;<br /><br />We have the great example of Jacob in the Book of Mormon who taught and testified to his son Enos. Enos tells us that as he went to hunt, "the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart."<sup>11</sup>In the January 1975 First Presidency Message, President Kimball's message was titled "Home: The Place to Save Society." After describing the evil that was going on in the world and the trends, he asked two questions and then answered those questions."Can it be arrested? Can we turn the tide and bring back decency and order out of chaos? The answer is yes--a positive, stentorian YES. But the solution is not easy. If it could be solved with money, people would tax themselves to curb it. If penal or correctional institutions would suffice, a great building program would be initiated. If additional social workers could prevail, universities would add courses in social work. If courts and judges, attorneys and policemen, prisons and penitentiaries could stop the onrush of delinquency, such institutions would be dotted over all the land. But such means only salve it over temporarily, effecting no permanent cure."<sup>12</sup>If the answer is that we can turn the tide, how do we do it? Quoting again from President Kimball:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"However, the Lord has given us a plan, within our capacity to follow, but ignored by the masses because it requires that sacrifice and dedication that men are reluctant to give.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The scriptures outline this effective program:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.' (Abr. 5:18.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">'... attend to all&nbsp;family&nbsp;duties.' (D&amp;C 20:47.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Bring up your children '... in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.' (Eph. 6:4.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In 1833 the Lord warned through his prophet, 'And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.' (D&amp;C 93:39.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">And then he offered the solution, 'But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.' (D&amp;C 93:40.)"<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;So, what do we teach and testify of to our families? I would like to explore the lessons we can learn from Deuteronomy 4-6. Please turn with me to Deuteronomy 4. We're going to look at several verses starting in verse 5. Moses is speaking to the Israelites and explaining to them the blessings of being a covenant people who keep the commandments:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Doesn't that sound like what President Kimball was saying? Keeping the commandments will make us a great people. Next, we learn about the counsel Moses gave about our responsibility to be internal auditors for ourselves and examples to our families. Continuing in verse 9:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Only&nbsp;<em>take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently</em>, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but&nbsp;<em>teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons</em>;"<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I believe that teaching and testifying to our family not only blesses them, but helps us in our own reconciliation process. Can you picture yourselves gathering your family for family home evening, teaching them about a commandment or something you have learned in the scriptures and then testifying how that has blessed your life? Will that help your words sink deep into the hearts of your children as Jacob's did with his son Enos? Will that help you in your desire to follow Christ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In verse 10, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may<em>teach their children</em>."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Where can we stand before the Lord and hear His words that we can learn to reverence Him and teach that same love for the Lord to our children? Does this not remind us of temple worship? Let me pause for a minute to share my testimony of the great power to reconcile ourselves to God and to learn what internal controls are truly important that comes through regular and frequent temple worship. One of my callings in my ward is to teach and coordinate the temple preparation classes. It is one of my favorite things to do. Recently, I had the opportunity to teach the lessons to my daughter. I testified to her, as I do to you, that every time I am in the temple, I know that God knows and loves me as an individual and cares for me and about me. A few years ago, I had an experience in the temple that changed my temple worship. When entering the temple, and after presenting a temple recommend, there is always a sister just beyond the recommend desk to direct you if you need it. Usually, the sister says, "hello", or "welcome." However, this time, the sister said, "Welcome home." What a beautiful thought. We can teach that to our children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my daughter went to the temple, she sent an email to everyone in the family:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I had the most incredible opportunity to go through the temple for myself this last Saturday. Mom, Dad, and I woke early and drove to Billings, and drove back the same day. We were gone from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. but it was definitely worth it. ... I have never felt more blessed than to have this opportunity.&nbsp;... The Temple truly is the House of the Lord. It is there that we can learn what we need to know to return back to live with Him. It is how we can become and reach our Divine Potential. I was blessed with peace all throughout the day, and once inside, even though I didn't understand everything, it just made sense. There have been a few times in my life when the Spirit has talked to me in a different way than with my emotions overflowing.&nbsp;I call these moments my "smiley moments" when I feel my smile getting bigger and bigger and I can't stop for anything.&nbsp;I love that feeling of happiness.&nbsp;In the Temple, I had one of those "smiley moments." This truly is the Plan of Happiness, and I am so grateful for the blessings of the Temple, especially in regards to&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;family. I am so excited that we all get to be together this weekend, and into the eternities! It will be an absolutely incredible day when we can all be inside the temple together, and I am so grateful for each one of you! Thanks ... for your examples and for choosing to be a part of this family! I love you all!"<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Back in our review of Deuteronomy, as recorded in the remainder of Chapter 4 and also in Chapter 5, Moses reminds the Israelites about the commandments, their importance, and some consequences of not following them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will take the time to address just one of the commandments. In Chapter 5, Moses talks about keeping the Sabbath day holy by not doing work, not us, not strangers staying with us, and not even servants. Then, he tells us why in verse 15:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm:&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>&nbsp;<em>the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day</em>."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The message to us is to use the Sabbath to remember that we have been in bondage because of sin and to remember the reconciling power of the Atonement. At a recent stake conference, our stake patriarch was asked to describe generally some of the recurring impressions from patriarchal blessings. He mentioned several positive things but also mentioned that a common concern expressed in many blessings was to keep the Sabbath day holy. I encourage all of us to compare our observance of the Sabbath to the standard and set appropriate internal controls to help us improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let's finish our review of Deuteronomy by moving to Chapter 6 and discuss several types of internal controls we can set for ourselves and for our families. These will help us anchor ourselves to the sure foundation of Christ and help us understand and utilize the Atonement better. They will help us and our son's daughter and our son's son to know where to look: scripture study, personal and family prayer, and gospel living&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of the commandments and statutes he has just discussed, Moses instructs the Israelites about this control, starting in verse 7:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Are we setting the pattern of regular scripture study, of personal and family prayers, of gospel living, and of gospel discussions in our homes? When our children see actions consistent with the commandments, the message can sink deeply into their hearts. Let me share a personal example. My parents regularly lived and taught the gospel in our home. I knew that they would stand for the Lord in any situation. I knew that my mother was comfortable with talking to our Heavenly Father through prayer and in listening to promptings from the Holy Ghost. I knew that my dad was a righteous priesthood holder. In addition to him leading family gospel discussions and teaching important lessons, I often saw him as he took time for his personal scripture study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up on a farm that was just large enough to teach us how to work hard but small enough that my dad didn't farm full time, even though, at times, it seemed as though we did. One summer, when I was in my early teens, we were having a problem with some of our cows crossing the river to a neighbor's field. My dad decided to build a fence in the river bottoms. He borrowed a small bulldozer from a neighbor. My brother and I took our tractor and we all went across one channel of the river to clear a path for the fence.&nbsp;<br /><br />At one point, the tractor had been left behind and my brother and I were both standing on a little platform on the back of the bulldozer as my dad was operating it. We would periodically jump off the bulldozer and clear off what remained on the fence path. As my dad was backing up to go at a tree at a different angle, I swung around to look back. As I did, the bulldozer track caught my leg and flipped me to the ground with the track rolling up my leg. Fortunately, my dad stopped the bulldozer quickly and moved it forward. He quickly sent my brother for the tractor and came down to pick me up. Now, can you imagine what must have been his thoughts? It wasn't his fault, but I can imagine him feeling terrible. He asked me how I was and I immediately asked, "Dad, can you give me a blessing?" My dad immediately put his hands on my head and gave me a priesthood blessing.&nbsp;<br /><br />My brother got there shortly thereafter with the tractor. My dad cradled me in his arms and drove the tractor back across the channel. Back home, my mother had been working on things around the house. She felt something had gone wrong and immediately jumped in a vehicle to drive to the edge of the river bottom and was there when we got out of the trees. I won't take the time to talk about the broken bones, the skin graft, etc. but the point is that I saw and knew from my parents' example to call upon the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we teach the commandments and the gospel diligently to our children and talk of them when we sit and at all times, they (and we) learn to develop the righteous reflexes Elder Neal A. Maxwell described. In a fireside at BYU, he stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now, since we are not always free to choose just when and how all of life's interactions will occur, we are nevertheless free to choose our responses to these moments. Since we can't compute beforehand all our responses, it becomes vital to set our course as immortals on the basis of immortal principles to be applied as reflexively as possible. Besides, there may be no time in which to ponder how we will respond anyway. If, for example, one determines that he will keep the seventh commandment, then his applying this fixed principle will result in temptations either being deliberately avoided in the first place or in being quickly deflected. All of this can be achieved without great thought, risk, or needless anxiety. In fact, I would go so far as to say to you tonight, my brothers and sisters, that if we are truly attached to immortal principles, some decisions need to be made only once, really, and then righteous reflexes can do the rest. Absent such fixed determinations, however, one can be tossed to and fro by temptations that then require case-by-case agonizing."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Show Gratitude for Blessings and for the Atonement</strong></p>
<p>Continuing in verse 10, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I have a daughter who is serving a mission. The day after we talked to my daughter on Mother's Day, she was hiking with other missionaries and hurt her leg. During our initial conversations with the mission president's wife, we were told that she would be sent home to recuperate. In a journal entry, my daughter wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The very first thing I remember saying after the accident and blessing was, "I just want to stay on my mission. ...I have not yet finished the work God has given me to do here in Arizona as a missionary. There are people to meet, souls to save, others to serve, and many to learn from." Later, when I got the ok to stay on my mission, I was filled with such joy; even greater than when I received my call. At this point for me, there is no greater call than to serve as a full-time missionary. MY HEART IS FULL."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>She also used the experience to get additional teaching opportunities. Of her rescue, she said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"They hooked me up in a harness and sent me up 60 feet. I had had only one dose of ibuprofen right after the blessing, but I was so alert and pain free that the paramedics decided not to drug me up for the ride as they ordinarily would have done, so I got to enjoy it! From there they rearranged the system to make it a zipline down off the mountain to the cars. News travels fast in such a small town and by this time, I had quite the audience. The most exhilarating part was the initial push they gave me from a sit down position off the edge of the cliff. In that moment, I felt the seat of my shorts catch on something and could have sworn I heard a rip. So, it was rather embarrassing to think that my shorts were ripped open as I was flying over half of Safford, all of whom were taking lots of pictures. However, as I had seen countless times that day, God takes care of His missionaries and when I got to where I could look at them [the shorts], I couldn't even find a snag. As I watched them all take pictures, I called down to them that pictures of me came with a fee of inviting a friend to listen to the missionary lessons. My story of an LDS missionary [having to get rescued] had made it to the local newspaper, radio, and news channels. I hope at least one companionship finds someone new to teach because of it."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Develop Christlike Attributes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing our reading in chapter 6 in verse 18:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath spoken."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As we get ready to audit a department here on campus, we send an internal control questionnaire that is designed to help the department assess how well it is doing. It also serves as a reminder as to what the standards or policies are. Preach My Gospel has a similar tool for personal use at the end of chapter six.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;This attribute activity helps us to see how we are doing in comparison to the standard and to measure our progress over time in developing Christlike attributes. I encourage all of us to use this tool in reconciling ourselves to the standard through the Atonement. One of my wife's strengths is in the area of charity and love. She has a sincere desire for the eternal welfare and happiness of others and spends countless hours serving and is a great example to me. Concern for and service toward others can be a strong internal control in the reconciliation process.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Testimony of the Atonement</strong></p>
<p>Let us conclude with verses 20-21:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statues, and the judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;"<sup>26</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, I have testified to my family as I do to you of the wondrous gift and blessing the Atonement has been in my life. I have been delivered out of bondage many times. As I use the Atonement to learn how to set internal controls to help me reconcile myself (not someone else) to God, I am strengthened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that we will all be able to use the Atonement to set appropriate internal controls as we reconcile ourselves to God, anchor ourselves to Christ, and are examples for our families to do so as well. As my wife often says, this life is about learning to repent and to forgive. Each is crucial in the reconciliation process. The Atonement helps us do both. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Faculty, Department of Teacher Education</p>
<p>Dana Abercrombie Johnson is a member of the faculty in Teacher Education and is currently serving as Elementary Education's Program Director.&nbsp; She holds a bachelors degree in elementary education and masters and PH.D. degrees in Educational Leadership and Administration. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Robert and one week from today (July 22) they will celebrate their 26th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; They are the parents of 3 sons, one of whom is currently serving in the California, Sacramento mission and&nbsp;one daughter-in -law.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been a mother and educator now for longer than I haven't been. When I was invited to address you at devotional, I reflected on what I would say if I had the chance to say one more thing to my sons and the thousands of students I have taught. I knew what I would ask each one if given the chance, &nbsp;Do you know how great you are? Do you realize your limitless potential?<br /><br />A couple of semesters ago, in a course evaluation, a student comment read, "she's not as funny as she thinks she is." &nbsp;This student probably also posted that evaluation of me on Rate My Professor and for all I know it was posted on his/her facebook page with an additional 100 likes. When I shared my experience with my family, my youngest son reassured me that it is unlikely the student posted it on facebook and just when I thought I could feel reassured he said, "she probably tweeted it and got 100 favorites." No I don't want you to check.<br /><br />In the days, weeks and even months following, I found myself consumed by this comment. &nbsp;I didn't view the advice as a suggestion of improvement, but rather as a criticism that led to doubt in myself. &nbsp;I wondered if I should forewarn students so they wouldn't expect me to be funny.&nbsp; I also considered disclosing the fact on each syllabus explaining that when I laughed at my own jokes it was because I thought I was funny when I wasn't. &nbsp;I was especially distressed when I read an article where 3,000 students had been surveyed as to the top three characteristics needed by effective teachers: number 2 humor.&nbsp; I began to wonder if I should find a desk job. Seriously.&nbsp; Eventually I arrived at a point where I wondered why I had become so preoccupied by this perceived weakness.&nbsp; I didn't focus on any of the positive comments, but rather became fixated with this one negative.<br /><br />Why did I allow this one comment to negatively impact me?&nbsp; The answer: for a moment I lost focus. &nbsp;Elder Cree-L Kofford in a 2002 Brigham Young University-Idaho devotional stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Since the beginning, Lucifer has been there tempting and teaching through deceit and deception, in an effort to draw every one of God's children from the paths of righteousness. You are no exception."</p>
<p>Elder Kofford explained strategies used by Lucifer to do this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He determined that he would try to destroy our individual self-worth.&nbsp; If he can make each of us feel like we are not as good as others or that we have limited worth, and if he could sow seeds of self-doubt and worthlessness, he could gain tremendous power over us."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Lucifer wants to not only keep us "from the paths of righteousness" he hopes to keep us from reaching our full divine potential and no one is exempt from the temptations of self-doubt and worthlessness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Moses, chapter one, God reveals himself to Moses.&nbsp; The first lesson God wants to teach Moses is who he is, as God and who Moses is,&nbsp;"Behold I am the Lord God&nbsp; Almighty and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years . . . and behold, thou art&nbsp; my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands."&nbsp; So great is the need that Moses understand who he is, God repeats this principle twice more in verses six and seven, calling him "Moses, my son." &nbsp;Shortly after God leaves, Satan visits Moses and contradicts the lessons learned by referring to him as "Moses, son of Man." The first temptation towards Moses was to confuse him as to his divine heritage.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, we know who we are. One of the first Primary songs we learn to sing is one that reminds us of this heritage, "I am a child of God" written by Naomi Randall. This doctrine is not only taught through music, it is taught explicitly in words.&nbsp; The first lesson in the nursery manual for children ages 18 - 36 months is titled "I am a child of God." The first lesson taught by missionaries using Preach My Gospel is the principle that God is our Loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; This most basic, foundational doctrine is what is first taught to our children and our investigators. Why? &nbsp;Because it is upon this foundation all other principles are built. Therefore, it is imperative that we know, understand, and believe this doctrine.</p>
<p>What do these words really mean?&nbsp; Let me summarize what the words "I am a child of God" mean to me using a Disney movie. In the Walt Disney movie, "Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin"&nbsp; there is an interchange between Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh.&nbsp; Christopher is trying to help the bear consider how life might be if they are apart. Winnie the Pooh doesn't want to consider the idea, but Christopher Robin teaches him "If ever there's a tomorrow when we're not together, there's something you must remember . . . .&nbsp; You're braver than you believe and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;To me, this is what it means when I believe in the words, "I am a child of God." &nbsp;I am braver than I believe, stronger than I seem, smarter than I think, in addition better than I realize, loved more than I know and therefore, I am capable of overcoming and accomplishing great things.&nbsp;The words are easy to say and yet often times quickly forgotten and therefore difficult to implement. Let me share with you a few examples from my life.<br /><br />I was concluding my third year as an elementary teacher, when my principal Max Wilson, approached me and said, "Dana, you really should consider going back to school to earn your Master's Degree in administration." &nbsp;I scoffed at the idea. I was a full time teacher, a wife, and mother of two young sons.&nbsp; Besides, I wasn't graduate school material.&nbsp; He responded with "please don't give up on the idea." When I told my husband of Mr. Wilson's idea I laughed and remarked how funny and ridiculous of an idea it was.&nbsp; Instead of laughing with me, he responded with "You should. The boys and I will support you." &nbsp;I listened to those around me and although doubting my abilities, I began attending graduate school in the evening.&nbsp; As I was working on my Masters Degree, I was teaching full time, served as ward Primary President, and had my third son.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was the first to admit that this was accomplished through the help of my husband and sons.&nbsp; Let me give you an example of how much they supported me as I was going to school.&nbsp; As I was approaching the conclusion of my program, I gathered my young sons together to tell them I was almost finished with going to school at night.&nbsp; As soon as I said the words, my middle son, Jacob, started crying and exclaimed "Does this mean no more men's night?"&nbsp; When I elatedly said "yes" he cried even harder.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, it was at about this time, when I reached my breaking point. I felt I could do no more at home, at my job, at church, and at school.&nbsp; One night I had a dream.&nbsp; In this dream I was made of glass and trying to walk on a slick surface. I was slipping and sliding when I finally fell and shattered into, what seemed to me, a thousand pieces.&nbsp; I cried out for my husband to come and help me by putting me back together.&nbsp; I saw him come and stand beside the pieces that were me and gently he responded "I can't put you back together." &nbsp;I cried over and over, "If not you, who?"&nbsp; I awoke with those words in my mind.&nbsp; If not you, then who? Who could make me whole?<br /><br />As I layed awake pondering the question and feeling very alone, a story my grandmother frequently told came to my mind.&nbsp;The experience happened to my grandmother when she was 52 years old and for the next 40 years of her life, my grandmother, Loa Cammack Nelson made sure that her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all knew this story. Before I begin the story, l need to tell you a little about my grandmother.&nbsp; She was a small woman about 5' 3'' who worked alongside her husband farming and ranching while raising her seven children.&nbsp; These are her words as recorded in her life history:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was swathing hay [and] I had broken some sections in the swather knife. I went to the house to have Lyle (her husband) fix the blade.&nbsp; He went to fix it and then was going on out [to the other place].&nbsp; They talked me into riding the little Honda motor bike because they all wanted the other [vehicles].&nbsp; I decided to ride the bike instead of walking out there.&nbsp; The wind was blowing really hard from the west.&nbsp; I had to cross the bridge on the big canal.&nbsp; The bridge didn't have any sides on it and you had to turn to go on the bridge and also turn to go off.&nbsp; I slowed down to go on the bridge and was just turning on the bridge when the wind blew me into the canal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It was about 10 or 12 feet deep and I went down to the bottom and came up to the top in a few seconds.&nbsp;The current took me under the bridge before I had a chance to do anything or realize what had happened.&nbsp; Just a week before the water was so high it touched the bottom of the bridge.&nbsp; It had dropped some because they had turned a little water out.&nbsp; I had just enough to have my head above the water.&nbsp; When I got on the other side of the bridge I couldn't get out of the center of the canal because of the current and the wind.&nbsp; The wind was blowing white caps over my head from one direction and the current was pushing&nbsp; from the other.&nbsp; It seemed to just whirl me around in the center.&nbsp; I fought and fought and couldn't seem to get anywhere.&nbsp; I finally realized I was going to drown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was getting so tired and my clothes were weighing me down.&nbsp; I started praying to the Lord for help, and I promised the Lord I would do all he asked me in the church and teach my family the right way the best I could if he would help me out of the canal.&nbsp; As soon as I started praying I heard a voice just as plain as could be say, 'I wondered when you were going to ask.' &nbsp;I immediately floated over to the side of the canal without any effort at all.&nbsp; I was so tired I couldn't pull myself out of the canal because the bank was so steep.&nbsp; I just laid my head on the bank and dug my hands into the grass until I got enough strength to get out&nbsp; onto the bank.&nbsp; That is where Lyle found me when he came looking. He had seen that the swather wasn't running.&nbsp; I really know that God lives and does hear and answer our prayers if we have faith and will call on him. . . The Lord really blessed me . I owe my life to him."</p>
<p>Taking the advice from my grandmother, and realizing I couldn't do anymore on my own, I called upon the Lord to help me.&nbsp; And I began to feel as Nephi when he stated,&nbsp;"Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; He also has become my salvation."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Now, with greater strength than my own, I finished my Masters Degree in educational administration. My focus became pursing a position as a public school administrator.&nbsp; One day, my husband said, "you know, Ricks College is changing to a 4-year university and they are in need of professors in the department of teacher education. Minimum requirements are a masters degree and teaching experience. You have both. You should apply."<br /><br />I quickly rejected the idea and provided him with a series of reasons.&nbsp; First, I was not professor material and second&nbsp; who was I to think I could be hired at Brigham Young University- Idaho? I am a farm girl from Southeast Idaho. &nbsp;He replied, "Dana, you're better than you think you are.&nbsp; Just apply." &nbsp;To appease him, I applied and to my amazement was asked to interview.&nbsp; When I was offered the position as faculty, every doubt in my ability consumed me.&nbsp; My fear and lack of confidence overwhelmed me to the point I had decided I couldn't accept the job. Then the thought came to me: "You are right. You can't do this on your own. Especially if you don't ask for help."&nbsp; When would I learn&nbsp; to "lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help?" When would I realize that "my help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth?"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; With that reminder, and turning to the Lord, I accepted the position as faculty at Brigham Young University Idaho.<br /><br />I share those experiences with you not to show you my accomplishments, but rather to show you that we are the same. You have the same resource I do and we are both children of God who have the assistance of a loving Heavenly Father.<br /><br />I often reflect on how different my life would be if I had let my fears and doubts&nbsp; hold me back.&nbsp; I also reflect on how my fears and doubts may still be holding me back today from reaching my full potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Author Marianne Williamson wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our deepest fear, is not that we are inadequate.&nbsp; Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.&nbsp; It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.&nbsp; We ask ourselves, 'who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?' Actually who are you NOT to be. You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.&nbsp; There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.&nbsp; We are all meant to shine, as children do. &nbsp;We were born, to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.&nbsp; It is not just in some of us; it's in everyone."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In July 1914, as a new faculty member, Hyrum Manwaring arrived in Rexburg, Idaho.&nbsp; The sight of a ragged frontier town and a spartan campus, made him question his decision to join the academy. Climbing up a rugged sage brush hill, looking over the town of Rexburg, he records in his memoirs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I stood lonely and very depressed and silently shed tears to think I was bringing my dear wife and children to this place to try to make a home.&nbsp; I climbed further up the slope and looked farther over the great valley. I suddenly seemed to catch the spirit of the pioneers and to dream of the great potentials that lay before me. I thought I saw the future of a fine residential city, and a great college.&nbsp; I also felt I could make a real contribution to the future of both."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>His heart changed with a vision of what the school would become and how he could contribute.&nbsp; Sixteen years later, in 1930, Hyrum Manwaring became the 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;president of this school during a time of great uncertainty and financial struggles.&nbsp; Look around you today.&nbsp; He obviously held tight to his vision and "the great potentials" that lay before him.</p>
<p>At times we may each feel like the ragged frontier town, President Manwaring saw when he arrived to Rexburg, wondering about our potential, wanting to see the future. Wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to look in a mirror and instantly see how great we are-to have a snapshot view of our potential?&nbsp; What would it take to see ourselves as our Father in Heaven does? What would it take to believe and remember "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" which includes you and me.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>In the opening devotional for this Spring Semester 2014, President Kim B. Clark gave us the tools to be able to see our divine potential and challenged us that if we don't see it in ourselves the first time, it required a second look. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I want you to take another look. Look into the mirror with the eye of faith and see in the mirror not only your face but also the face of the Lord Jesus Christ standing beside you with power and glory and never-ending, perfect love.&nbsp; He did not come to leave you out of His blessings.&nbsp; You are who you are because of who He is. You have eternal identity and purpose because Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So when you look in the mirror and all you see is who you are today with all your weaknesses, faults, and failures, I suggest you take a second look, or find someone with a better view. When you don't know or have forgotten how great you are, just ask. As in my grandmother's example, there is one saying, "I was wondering when you were going to ask." &nbsp;Offer a prayer, seek a blessing, visit with a leader, parent, friend, or teacher.&nbsp; Trust in the view someone else has. I see it in you.&nbsp; In my interactions with students over the course of 22 years, I have seen the great potential that rests in each one of you. My desire has been that each might realize how great they are.</p>
<p>Turn to the scriptures to know firsthand of your divine heritage. If you question, "who am I and what does God think of me?" grab any book of scripture you choose and there you will find the answer. &nbsp;You will find his love of you in the Old Testament, read Jeremiah, or the New Testament in First John. Search the Book of Mormon by reading Mosiah, or the Doctrine and covenants where we are called his friends.&nbsp; Turn to the Pearl of Great Price and read from Moses, or from the Prophet Joseph Smith's history. &nbsp;Let the Holy Ghost teach and remind you of who you really are and what your true potential is.<br /><br />Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught, "We see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today.&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever.&nbsp; Although we might settle for less, Heavenly Father won't.&nbsp; For he sees us as the glorious beings we are capable of becoming."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When feelings of doubt, fear or worthlessness begin to take over, go back to your beginnings. Go back to what you learned in Primary.</p>
<p>"I am a child of God and he has sent me here." &nbsp;We have been sent to earth to learn and to grow, and to show our love to our Heavenly Father through our obedience.&nbsp; We are here to be tested and to develop the attributes of godliness and to maybe prove to ourselves &nbsp;our divine potential as a child of God<br /><br />"I am a child of God and so my needs are great." The needs we have here can be met by turning to our Heavenly Father: our need &nbsp;to know of our purpose on earth and &nbsp;who we are and why we are here; our need to be loved and to know him.<br /><br />"I am a child of God rich blessings are in store." We &nbsp;have a Heavenly Father who loves us, cares about us, and wants to bless us and can receive witness of his love for us. He will bless us with peace and confidence.<br /><br />"I am a child of God his promises are sure." The greatest promise being eternal life if we can but endure times of doubt, uncertainty, times of struggles and hardships.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>The nursery manual suggests that the children repeat multiple times the words Naomi Randall wrote: I am a child of God and he has sent me here.&nbsp; It is important for us remember and to repeat these words in order for us to stay on the path of righteousness&nbsp; and to receive all the blessings the Lord has in store for us. Elder Boyd K. Packer said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You are a child of God.&nbsp; He is the father of your spirit.&nbsp; Spiritually you are of noble birth, the offspring of the King of Heaven.&nbsp; Fix that truth in your mind and hold to it. However many generations in your mortal ancestry,&nbsp; no matter what race or people you represent, the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line.&nbsp; You are a child of God!"<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Engrain these words into your thoughts and actions.These words will help us face any challenge or struggle that stands before us.&nbsp; When Christ stood before the Sanhedrin on trial, Caiapus the high priest, rose to his feet demanding and answer "tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God"<sup>13 &nbsp;</sup>In Mark chapter 14 verse 62 we read his response, "And Jesus said, I am" in what I believe to be in a strong, clear confident voice with head held high. "I AM." &nbsp; Insert your name in this scripture found in Matthew 26, "Dana, tell us whether thou be the daughter of God" and Dana said "I AM." &nbsp;I am a daughter of God.</p>
<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin explained:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"it is essential that you know and understand that our Heavenly Father loves you like a son [or daughter] because He is the Father of your spirit.&nbsp; That makes you His literal son [or daughter], spiritually begotten of Him.&nbsp; As such, you have inherited the potential to become like Him. . .&nbsp; God's love is complete and without limit for you and for all mankind.&nbsp; He is perfectly just and merciful.&nbsp; He is perfectly kind and understands your circumstances and condition. He knows you better than you know yourself."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Life is difficult and it seems we are frequently confronted with situations that could quickly lead to us having feelings of inadequacies, doubt and loss of self-confidence.&nbsp; However, if we are to achieve our divine potential it requires us to now reach our earthly potential through faith, trust and reliance upon our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As taught by Elder Gerald N. Lund:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"To strengthen our faith and deepen our testimony to the point that we can successfully endure to the end, we must know for ourselves with a surety that:<br />God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His literal children.<br />He and His Beloved Son want us to be happy and eventually come to a fullness of joy.<br />They know us intimately and love us infinitely.<br />They want to bless us, and they actually take great joy in doing so.<br />. . . This is the bedrock of which Christ spoke. And if we build our house on this rock, we can withstand the rains, the storms, and the floods that may come our way. With this testimony, we will endure. Without it, we are vulnerable."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I want you to know that I know our Heavenly Father knows you personally and loves you deeply.&nbsp; He knows of your potential and knows you can accomplish great things. And may we be as the unknown Englishman of early days who offered this prayer: '"O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself. That," said President Harold B. Lee of the Englishman's plea, "should be the prayer of every soul; not an abnormally developed self-esteem that becomes haughtiness, conceit, or arrogance, but a righteous self-respect that might be defined as 'belief in one's own worth, worth to God, and worth to man.'<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Remember, you are a child of God and that means you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, loved more than you know, better than&nbsp; you realize and therefore, capable of overcoming and accomplishing great things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Their youngest son recently returned from a mission in Brazil and will begin school again at BYU-ID in the fall; their oldest son graduated from BYU-ID and Univ. of ID law school and is an Idaho Prosecuting Attorney; and, their middle son also graduated from BYU-ID and is currently attending medical school in Missouri.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you just heard, I have three sons and one husband so for the last 35 years, I have been the only female in an all-male home. This has made me become an advocate and somewhat expert on men. I love, appreciate, honor and sustain the men in my life. I have also been teaching young adults for about the same amount of years and I have observed some trends and attitudes that I feel need to be addressed.<br /><br />The data is very clear about boys: They are doing worse in school and are more likely to suffer depression or--between ages 15 and 19--commit suicide. Last year according to the U.S. Department of Education, 140 women graduated with some kind of college degree for every 100 men. And the National Center for Education Statistics projected female college enrollment would grow 16 percent by 2021&nbsp; while male college enrollment would increase by only 7 percent.<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We all know the importance of fathers in the home and the impact it has on children. Yet, over half of the children born in the U.S. are to single women. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, children who live with their fathers are more likely to have good physical and emotional health, to achieve academically, and to avoid drugs, violence, and delinquent behavior.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The correlation is very apparent between having a father in the home and the wellbeing of children, especially the impact it has on boys. But the U.S. Government has to spend 100 Billion Dollars every year on programs-such as child support enforcement and anti-poverty efforts-to support father-absent homes.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;That 100 Billion Dollar figure is conservative and does not include secondary costs such as poor outcomes of children from father-absent homes.<br /><br />Why has it gotten to the point where our current President of the United States, the leader of the free world, is quoted as saying to young men, "Take responsibility for your children."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our prophets and apostles have made it clear how to make our families secure and help our children return to live with our Heavenly Father, especially with the issuance of the Proclamation on the Family. I would like to suggest what we, as women and as members of this Church, can do to help our men.<br /><br />Several young women have told me, "If the bishop or stake president comes to my husband and calls him to a demanding church job, I will just have to be selfish and tell him that I had my husband first and he can't accept any demanding church callings, especially if we have small children."<br /><br />Sisters, here is the truth: the most selfish thing you can do for yourself and your children is to support your husbands, fathers, sons and brothers in their righteous endeavors. Yes, you heard, me. I said the most selfish thing you can do is support the men in your life in their righteous endeavors.<br /><br />Now some of you may be saying, "But females have worked so hard to gain our rights, to not be dominated by men and to be equal." Don't get me wrong, I am all for equal rights in the workplace, such as equal pay for equal work. No one has felt the sting of discrimination and bias toward women more than I have, but it seems that our battle to be equal in the workforce has moved to our homes and many women now feel that men aren't needed to father, nurture, or even have contact with their children. When it comes to your family, supporting the men in your life instead of thinking about inequality has far more personal and spiritual consequences.<br /><br />Let me begin by telling you about my grandmother and how she helped shape my attitude toward this subject. Harriett,&nbsp;everyone called her Hattie, Rigby was barely five feet tall. She married my Grandfather when she was only 18. The day after they were married, my Grandfather left for the Samoan Islands for a three-year mission. Hattie planned on finishing school at Ricks Academy while my Grandfather was on his mission. Grandpa was assigned to the Apollo Island, owned at that time by Germany. He told his German professor that he wished his wife were there because she had studied two years of German. Hattie was called to be a missionary with her husband, which she gladly accepted in 1913. Her father and sister took her to Salt Lake to be set apart as a missionary. She told her father, "They will surely send another lady so I won't have to go alone," but when they assembled in the room where they were to be set apart and receive their instructions, Hattie was the only woman. She wrote, "I felt like going back home with Father, but he assured me I would be all right, which I was, and happy to be the only girl as I got all the attention."<br /><br />She traveled to Samoa by ship but the letter notifying my Grandfather that she was coming was on the same ship as she was traveling on. This little 18-year-old got off the ship and no one was there to meet her. After&nbsp;five days, she finally met my Grandpa as he was traveling in a buggy toward town. This was only the beginning of a very difficult two and one-half years but even with the struggles, my grandparents loved their mission and the Samoan people.<br /><br />A defining experience for Hattie was when her first son, who was born in Samoa, contracted elephantiasis, which is usually fatal to babies. He was covered with oozing sores all over his body and had to be bathed with a disinfectant. Around this same time, my Grandfather's appendix burst sending toxins throughout his body. Hattie was advised to go home to America to receive medical care or her baby would die.<br /><br />My grandparents were in charge of a church cemetery where there were six elders, a mother and a baby and four small children buried. Hatti went to this cemetery and prayed that if the Lord would spare the lives of her husband and child and she would not have to leave their bodies in this distant land, she would dedicate her life faithfully serving Him. The Lord was good to her and both her husband and son were spared. I can tell you, having lived only one mile from my grandparents, that my Grandmother absolutely spent the rest of her life supporting her husband's righteous endeavors and serving the Lord. Her "selfish support" earned her the love and devotion of seven very righteous sons and daughters and legions of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She also earned the respect and love of many community members. Interestingly, her church callings and civic responsibilities throughout her life were more demanding than her husband's but my grandfather supported her 100 percent. He would hitch up the wagon and take her to her many assignments with no resentment.<br /><br />The other example in my life was my mother. By&nbsp;the time my father graduated from law school, my parents had three children. During law school, they lived in a small two-bedroom apartment and at times, their bathroom was a communal bathroom with other law school families. Before my father had even taken the bar, he was asked to be Madison County's prosecuting attorney. This began a lifetime of civil service. While I was a teenager, my father served as state senator. He would go to Boise during the legislature, come home to Rexburg Friday night, work all day Saturday at his law office and then work all day Sunday as the bishop of our home ward where he served for nine years.&nbsp; He was also a counselor in a bishopric for five years, a Ricks College Stake President and in the presidency of two different Mission Presidencies. During all of this time, my Mother would go alone to church and sit with us, her seven children.<br /><br />Now most of you are probably saying, "Wow, didn't having your father gone so much and being so busy cause great damage to his children?" Here is my response: First, we, his children, knew without a doubt that our father loved us unconditionally. Secondly, my mother never complained. Yes, I get that response a lot--surely she had to complain about being left with seven children so much, but I can honestly say that I never heard her complain. She was a saint.<br /><br />What happened because my mother was selfish and supported my father? She had seven righteous and pretty terrific children who absolutely loved her. Because of her support while my father was in school, he loved his job so much that he still goes to work at 92 years of age. This is especially poignant considering a 2013 Gallup State of the American Workplace Report that shows that 70 percent of American workers either hate their jobs or are completely disengaged. I never heard my father complain about going to work.<br /><br />But more importantly to me was when my mother was diagnosed with cancer and the devotion my father showed her in her illness. As her health deteriorated, I watched my father care for her with the greatest of tenderness and love, he even applied moisturizer to her face daily, something she would always do when she was well. I was with her when she took her last breath and I had this well of gratitude and respect fill my whole soul for the woman she was and the support she gave to all of us.<br /><br />Now, I am no angel like my grandmother or saint like my mother but because of their example, I have tried to support my own husband's righteous endeavors. I was awarded a teaching assistantship at BYU but gave it up to move to Salt Lake to help my husband complete his degrees at the University of Utah. The other day we were talking to an advisor about our retirement and my husband told him that he would like to work for as long as he can because he really enjoys his job. If you would have known him in his youth, you would have been shocked at his statement because he considered work as a way to make payments-not something rewarding and enjoyable. He will admit that obtaining a degree was very difficult for him, it wasn't in his genetic makeup to go to school so we had to work together to get him through. In fact, he would dictate all of his papers to me and I would type them--on a typewriter. Wow, how selfish of me to support him in his educational pursuits. As a side note, after he completed his degrees and we moved back to Idaho and he began his career, I told him I would like to go back and complete the degree I gave up at BYU. He was 100 percent supportive of me and it actually proved to be a great bonding experience for him with our boys. My classes were mostly at night so on the nights I would be gone, it was a party at our house.<br /><br />When my youngest was 18 months, my husband was called to serve with a wonderful Stake President, President Stanley, in one of BYU-ID's stakes. I would sit by myself in our home ward with my three rambunctious boys in the pew right next to the exit door. In fact, no one would ever try to sit on that bench because the ward knew this was my bench. Many times sacrament meeting ended with me having vomit in my hair and smashed Cheerios on the floor. In fact, after my husband served here on campus for four years, he came back to the home ward and the Sunday School president asked me to introduce my "guest." She must have thought I was a single mother because I was always alone with my boys. The stake president would call me about every six months and ask how I was doing. I would tell him to "just leave my husband where he" was, he was a better man, husband and father because of his service and the association he had with the President and the other men in the stake.<br /><br />I marvel at women like Emma&nbsp;and Lucy Mack Smith and their level of support for the Prophet Joseph Smith. He and Emma had eleven children, two were adopted, but six children died in infancy--five biological children and one adopted son. The adopted son died of exposure after a mob attacked the family. Emma gave birth to their last child five months after the Prophet's death.&nbsp;<strong>Lucy Mack Smith, Mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith&nbsp;wrote this about Emma:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>"I have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with that unflinching courage, zeal, and patience, which [Emma Smith] has ever done . . . she has been tossed upon the ocean of uncertainty--she has breasted the storms of persecution, and buffeted the rage of men and devils, which would have borne down almost any other woman."</p>
<p>You wouldn't be sitting on this beautiful campus and in this building today if it weren't for Joseph Smith. Do you ever consider the part Emma played in the restoration? What if she had not supported Joseph in his efforts to organize the Church or translate the Book of Mormon? What if she had made demands on Joseph so that her life would have been easier and without the turmoil caused by the persecutions? Sitting in church by yourself while your husband serves in a church position pales to the level of support shown by women like Emma.</p>
<p>Well sisters, if you aren't convinced by my examples, turn with me to the scriptures and let's read what has happened historically about supporting our men in their righteous endeavors and how it will make them better men--better fathers, husbands, sons and members of His church and kingdom.<br /><br />In&nbsp;Alma 44:5, remember that Moroni is demanding the Lamanites to make a covenant of peace or be destroyed. Notice what Moroni says about the source of his army's strength and power:</p>
<p>"And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us."</p>
<p>Notice too the phrase Moroni uses about gaining power "by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children." It doesn't sound like Moroni would be costing the government any part of the 100 Billion dollars we spend today for father-absent homes. He sounds like he and his army felt it to be sacred, a source of happiness and almost a privilege to support their wives and children, but how did Captain Moroni and his army get to this level of commitment? Did their wives and children have anything to do with it? We don't know anything about Mrs. Captain Mornoni but could we assume that she supported her husband in all of his righteous endeavors?</p>
<p>I had a young man in my class, we will call him Johnny to protect his identity. Johnny was failing my class. Yet, it was almost weekly that he would come to me and say that he needed to miss my class because of something to do with his wife. Finally, one day I said to him. "Johnny you are failing my class. Is your wife in the hospital?" He replied, "No." "Is she sick or are your children sick?" "No, we don't have any children yet and no she isn't sick." "Well, then why are you missing class?" "Because she thinks she is going to get sick." I never saw Johnny's name on our graduation list, I'm not sure he ever graduated but I don't know how he could have because his wife wasn't selfish enough to support his efforts in school.<br /><br />We had another young man come to our home to help with some work we needed done. He had a young family and had just bought a home and needed some extra cash to buy items for the home. As we were working, however, he would have to stop every 20 to 30 minutes to answer his phone because his wife would call and ask him the same questions, "Yes, we are still working," and "Yes, we will be done about 4:30 and then I will be home."&nbsp; I wanted to take his phone and talk to this young woman but you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;want to know what I would have said to her. We finally had to tell this young man to just go home because it was too difficult for him to work without being interrupted. Now if there had been a crisis or some special circumstances at home then it would have been understandable but there wasn't a crisis and there weren't any special circumstances. Again, how sad that this young woman wasn't more selfish and didn't support her ambitious husband's efforts to earn some extra money to help buy necessities for their home.</p>
<p>Most of you are probably thinking, "Oh that Sister Hendricks. She is so old-fashioned. She doesn't understand that these are different times and things have changed," but let me ask you, "Do you think that Mrs. Captain Moroni would be calling or texting her husband every 20 minutes to see when he would be home? Or telling him she needed him because she thinks she may become sick? From the scripture we just read, would Captain Moroni feel the sacred responsibility for his wife and children if they had not shown him the same sacred responsibility to support him and his righteous endeavors? I know this for a fact: The Captain Moroni's of the world never go out of style and will never be considered old fashioned.<br /><br />This doesn't mean, however, that you young men can do as you please without recognizing the support of the women in your life. I am not suggesting that you have unlimited time playing video games.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In a Conference address entitled, "Let Us Be Men", Elder D. Todd Christofferson challenged men to emulate the Savior. "He gave His life to redeem mankind. Surely we can accept responsibility for those He entrusts to our care. Brethren, let us be men, even as He is. We who hold the priesthood of God ... must arise from the dust of self-indulgence and be men!"<br /><br />In the October 2008 Priesthood session, Elder Richard G. Scott said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">". . . as a husband or son, express gratitude for what your wife and mother do for you. Express your love and gratitude often. That will make life far richer, more pleasant and purposeful for many of the daughters of Father in Heaven who seldom hear a complimentary comment and are not thanked for the multitude of things they do. As a husband, when you sense that your wife needs lifting, hold her in your arms and tell her how much you love her. May each of us ever be tender and appreciative of the special women who enrich our lives. God will hold us accountable for how we treat His precious daughters. . . . I pray that the Lord will guide us to be more inspired, sensitive, and productive with the priesthood we hold, especially with His daughters."</p>
<p>Now, I left my last example for the end of my talk because it is very difficult for me to tell.</p>
<p>About two and a half years ago, our middle son became very ill. He couldn't climb up the stairs in our home without being completely winded. He would pass out when he would try to physically exert himself. By the time we got him to specialists in San Diego, who were among only a few doctors in the world who could perform a specialized operation on lungs, our son Burke was in heart failure. My husband was with him for a week of tests while I was here teaching classes. I kept hoping that the doctors would be able to just give him some kind of pill or breathing therapy that would heal his condition but my husband called me and told me that I should come quickly because they would be operating the next day. Burke had blood clots that hit his lungs and caused so much scar tissue to build up in his lungs that he only had 10 percent lung capacity. Because he couldn't breath, his heart was working so hard that it had enlarged and he was in heart failure. The procedure the doctors would perform on him was more invasive than open-heart surgery because the doctor would have to cool Burke's body to the lowest point a human body can go and still be revived, move his heart to get to his lungs, then slowly remove the scar tissue from his lungs. After his body is cooled, the doctor only has 20 minutes to clear the scar tissue before they would have to revive Burke, stabilize his vitals and then start over again. The doctor did this three times over the course of ten hours.<br /><br />Here was one of our precious sons looking literally at the chance of death. I was having a difficult time grappling with the idea that such a great young man who had faithfully and fully served a mission, fulfilled his church callings, and obeyed the word of wisdom would have these health problems. Why would Heavenly Father allow this to happen?<br /><br />&nbsp;When I arrived at the hospital, the attendants were prepping Burke for surgery. There was a short lull in the flurry of activity and my husband suggested we pull the curtains closed around Burke and he would give him a blessing. I can tell you that never before in my life have I so appreciated that my husband was worthy enough to give our son a priesthood blessing. Never before have I been so grateful that my husband's faith had grown because of all of his past callings and experiences in the Church. Never before was I in such need to have a priesthood holder lay his hands upon my son and call upon the powers of heaven to bless him and give him comfort.&nbsp; I know Burke was the benefactor of many healing gifts because of the faith of his father.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sisters, let's show the nation and even the world how to heal so many of its social ills by being selfish and supporting the men in our lives. Young men, be men and honor your priesthood and honor the women who support you. Gain power through God and faith and reverse the current trends we are seeing in young men. Gain power with a shovel instead of a TV remote. Gain power by righteously nurturing a child instead of a video game. Gain power through a textbook and a formal education instead of some type of pornographic or mind-wasting media.

<p>Advisor, Student Activities Program </p>
<p>Leon Anderson was raised in Gooding, Idaho.&nbsp; He graduated from Ricks College and then earned a bachelor's degree from Utah State University and a Master's degree from Boise State University in Exercise and Sports Science.&nbsp; He served a mission in New York City and Houston, TX serving in the deaf program.&nbsp; Before coming to BYU-I in 2002 he worked in the corporate fitness industry in Boise, Idaho.&nbsp; Church callings have included working in the young men's organization, Elder's Quorum, and he is currently serving in the Rexburg YSA 78<sup>th</sup> ward bishopric.&nbsp; Leon is currently an advisor in the Service and Life Skills areas of the Activities program at BYU-I.&nbsp; Leon and his wife Marilyn are the parents of four sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters:&nbsp; Many of you are probably wondering, why would they ask Brother Anderson to speak at devotional? After considering this question I think I have found the answer. Many years ago in our ward in Nampa, Idaho I was asked to speak in church. As I began my talk I made the simple comment that I had never won any motivational speaking awards and so I warned the audience that this might be a less than exciting talk.&nbsp; As I finished my talk and sat down a member of the bishopric leaned over and handed me a hand written note that said, "This certificate recognizes Leon Anderson as being a Motivation Speaker." So, aren't you lucky? You are in the presence of a certified motivational speaker. A few minutes into this talk you will soon realize this certificate was probably given in error but I do hope that with the help of the Holy Ghost you will benefit in some small way from attending devotional today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the refreshing things about working on this campus is the chance I have to observe you students on a daily basis at this exciting and pivotal stage in your life. Your enthusiasm and optimism as it pertains to your future is a pleasure to observe. Many important decisions take place at this time of your life that will help you continue to learn, grow, and progress. All of you up to this point in your life have experienced the feeling of true happiness in varying degrees. It is my suggestion to you today that your best days are still ahead of you.&nbsp;Will life get easier after you graduate? No. Will your life get easier after you get married?&nbsp; No. Will all your troubles disappear after you get what you feel is a good job?&nbsp; No. Will you have challenges and trials in the future? Plan on it. Regardless of your personal circumstances, at each stage of your life, you will have the opportunity to experience during your time on this earth what many refer to as "An Abundant Life" which is my topic for this afternoon.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The abundant life, of course, has little to do with the acquisition of material things, though there are many wonderful individuals who have been blessed materially and who use their wealth to help their fellowmen--and this is most commendable. The abundant life noted in the scriptures is the spiritual sum that is arrived at by the multiplying of our service to others and by investing our talents in service to God and to man. Jesus said, you will recall, that on the first two commandments hang all the law and the prophets, and those two commandments involve developing our love of God, of self, of our neighbors, and of all men. There can be no real abundance in life that is not connected with the keeping and the carrying out of those two great commandments."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Last fall I helped my Aunt pick apples from her one average sized apple tree. When we were done we had two bushel baskets full of apples from just one tree. This is a simple example of abundance. The heaping baskets were not a result of one large apple filling each of the baskets of course, but it was a result of picking one apple at a time each apple varying in size until each basket was full.&nbsp; In comparison the spiritual feelings and experiences of abundance in our lives does not happen as a result of just two or three monumental experiences. Just like the basket of apples, this overall feeling of abundance comes as a result of individual feelings and experiences that we will have throughout our lives. These experiences may include the feelings you have from positive personal interaction with good friends and acquaintances, how you feel when performing one act of service at a time, receiving acts of service one act at a time, positive experiences and relationships with your immediate and extended family, and the blessings that come from being an active and contributing member of the church.&nbsp; Each of you will have your own version of this feeling of abundance but it is a blessing we all can and should enjoy during our time here on earth.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest five principles to help each of us experience the abundant life described by President Kimball.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Principle 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Feelings of an abundant life come when we look outside ourselves and focus on the needs of others.</strong><strong><br /></strong>Many think that in order to personally experience an abundant life that the best way to do this is to put their own personal wants, desires, and interests ahead of others. It is my testimony that the opposite is true. We begin to recognize and experience great blessings when we look outside ourselves and focus on the needs of others. When you visit with someone who has served a mission, with few exceptions, they will tell you that one of the happiest and most fulfilling times of their life was during their mission. We all know the reason why. Prior to their missions it is quite possible that most of their attention was focused on themselves. During their missions, their focus was no longer on themselves but on the people they were called to serve. Their self-interests were of little concern but they would do anything to serve their fellow men and help bring them closer to Christ and become members of His church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A good example of someone experiencing an abundant life as a result of looking outside themselves and focusing on the needs of others are my parents. Their second child and my older brother Ken was born deaf. Years ago it was common for young deaf children to begin their formal education when they were around 4 years old. As a result my parents would drive Sunday evenings for 2 1/2 /hours from their home in Mackay, Idaho and drop their young son off for the week at the State School for the Deaf and Blind in Gooding, Idaho. They would then pick him up that Friday afternoon and drive back home to Mackay for the short weekend and then repeat the process weekly.&nbsp;<br /><br />It did not take long for my parents to realize that in their minds this was not the best way to raise a family so they made the decision to move from their home in Mackay and the area they loved and moved to Gooding. They put aside their personal interests and focused on what was best for their family. Little did they know that a few years later another daughter and son would later join the family that were also deaf. I do not ever recall my parents ever saying "Why us?" All I remember was my parents being actively involved in the lives of each of their children. They raised us in a gospel centered home and were great examples to us of serving others. They made the most of a difficult situation and proceeded to live their own version of an abundant life. They did this by always putting the needs and interests of their family and others ahead of their own. For the last several years they have served faithfully in their church callings, served a mission together in Nauvoo, served countless hours in the temple, and provided countless hours of service to their children and grandchildren. The key component in my opinion that allowed my parents to experience their abundant life is the fact that they forgot about themselves and instead have always looked for ways to serve others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Principle 2:&nbsp;An abundant life comes when we make the most of our individual circumstances - not excuses.</strong>&nbsp;<br />As I associate with many students on this campus one thing I have learned is that students come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have grown up in the church while some are recent converts. Some attended a high school where they were the only member of the church while others attended a high school where almost everyone was a member of the church. Some have their own unique physical limitations or challenges while others do not. Each one of you have circumstances in your life that are a challenge to you to some degree. At times you may compare your circumstances with those of others and conclude that you have all the strikes against you and someone else has a clean slate. Please remember every one of us have and will yet have our own unique challenges. What matters is how we accept and then deal with these personal challenges and trials. Don't let these challenges, large and small, prevent you from experiencing an abundant life.<br /><br />In&nbsp;D&amp;C 122: 5, 7 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; .....&nbsp;&nbsp; if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I am aware of relatives, friends, BYU-Idaho students and BYU-Idaho&nbsp;employees who have experienced life changing illnesses or life changing injuries that would, in some people's minds, give them the perfect excuse to become negative and think that they can no longer experience as much happiness as they once did. Instead, it has been my observation that these individuals with these unexpected challenges are often the greatest examples of optimism and happiness and are great examples of pursuing the feeling of an abundant life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The example I have of someone making the most of a perceived bad situation is my older brother Ken. I could share similar stories of each of my siblings but today I'll pick on Ken. As I mentioned earlier Ken was born deaf. Ken was my best friend growing up and we did everything together. We went to the same scout and basketball camps, graduated from High School together, began college the same day and served our missions at the same time.&nbsp;Someone forgot to tell Ken that his deafness would be an inconvenience to him. Instead he learned and developed many talents that were of benefit to him and others. Ken was a very good athlete,&nbsp;standing 6'9" didn't hurt either. In high school he was a very good punter, basketball player, and track athlete, which included setting the overall state high jump record for Idaho his senior year. After high school he played basketball at Ricks College and was also on the track team. He went on to play basketball and attend school at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC.<br /><br />Everyone loved associating with Ken.&nbsp; During his time at Ricks, if there was ever a large gathering of students enjoying their interaction with each other, Ken was probably in the middle of it. Ken had the ability to communicate with those who could hear so he was able to interact quite well with everyone. He served a sign language mission in Chicago and Oakland and currently serves in the Deaf Branch presidency in Gooding. Today, if you need something welded, an engine repaired, something fixed or something built or if you want to watch someone catch the biggest fish, whatever you do don't come see me, go see Ken. If you want to see someone serving his fellowmen in his community go see Ken. Never once do I remember Ken saying "Why me?" All I remember observing him doing was basically saying "watch out" and he has proceeded to move forward in his life with confidence and happiness and has been able to accomplish and do great things in his life. Ken hasn't let his circumstance stop him from pursuing and living an abundant life.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3:&nbsp;An abundant life comes when we develop an attitude of Lifelong Christ-like service.<br /></strong>My current responsibilities at BYU-Idaho include being the advisor in the Service area of our Activities program. I have the blessing of working with students who already know the importance of service and are finding time to serve even though they have busy lives as college students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Service Activities Stewardship Statement says, "Service Activities invites students to learn the doctrines of Christ-like service, render service to others, and cultivate a desire for lifelong service."&nbsp;It is not uncommon for students to come to my office and simply ask, "I just need to serve. What options are there for me at BYU-Idaho?"<br /><br />The students that I work with in Service Activities on a daily basis are great examples to me of the joy that comes from serving others.&nbsp; It has been my observation that these students are happier and more fulfilled and are adding to their overall student experience by putting the needs of others first before their own. This mentality will serve them well throughout their lives. The students who come to me and ask for my help are directed to student leaders who oversee organized service groups in areas such as adopt a grandparent, the blood drive, special needs activities, various humanitarian service projects, and more.<br /><br />Being involved in a service organization is a great way to provide meaningful service but it is not the only way. There are many ways to provide small acts of kindness throughout the day to your friends and to complete strangers. A smile, saying hello, or initiating a small conversation with someone you don't know are examples of small acts of kindness that we can do continually. Magnifying our church callings including that of a home or visiting teacher are great ways to provide service.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Kimball taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I have learned that it is by serving that we learn how to serve. When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves. ... So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds! ... God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom"</p>
<p>President Kimball continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Unless the way we live draws us closer to our Heavenly Father and to our fellowmen, there will be an enormous emptiness in our lives. It is frightening for me to see, for instance, how the life-style of so many today causes them to disengage from their families and their friends and their peers toward a heedless pursuit of pleasure or materialism. So often loyalty to&nbsp;<a href="http://mormon.org/family" target="_self">family</a>, to community, and to country is pushed aside in favor of other pursuits which are wrongly thought to be productive of happiness when, in fact, selfishness is so often the pursuit of questionable pleasure which passes so quickly. &nbsp;One of the differences between true joy and mere pleasure is that certain pleasures are realized only at the cost of someone else's pain. Joy, on the other hand, springs out of selflessness and service, and it benefits rather than hurts others."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In Mosiah 2:17 we read, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>In Matthew 10:39 we read, "He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>President Hinckley has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who reach out to lift others will come to know a happiness ... never known before ... Heaven knows there are so very, very, very many people in this world who need help. Oh, so very ... many. Let's get the cankering, selfish attitude out of our lives, my brothers and sisters, and stand a little taller and reach a little higher in the service of others."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Monson taught students at BYU that their student days should include "the matter of spiritual preparation," including service to others:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"An attitude of love characterized the mission of the Master," President Monson said. "He gave sight to the blind, legs to the lame, and life to the dead. Perhaps when we [face] our Maker, we will not be asked, 'How many positions did you hold?' but rather, 'How many people did you help?' In reality," President Monson concluded, "you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>President Monson also taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"To find real happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves. &nbsp;No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man. Service to others is akin to duty, the fulfillment of which brings true joy. We do not live alone--in our city, our nation, or our world. There is no dividing line between our prosperity and our neighbor's wretchedness. 'Love thy neighbor' is more than a divine truth. It is a pattern for perfection."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As President Kimball mentioned earlier, when we receive blessings from our Heavenly Father it is often through the actions of others.&nbsp;&nbsp; May I make the simple suggestion, one that has been made by others before, to pray for opportunities to serve?&nbsp; If that is truly your desire and you make finding opportunities to serve a regular topic in your prayers, people and circumstances will be placed in your path for you to assist and serve and as a result you will bless the lives of others and experience the joy that comes from serving. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4:&nbsp;An abundant life comes when we have an attitude of gratitude. &nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong>In Alma 34:38 we read that we should live in thanksgiving daily.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;In Alma 37:37 we read When thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;In D&amp;C 46:7 we learn that Ye should do all things with prayer and thanksgiving.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>It is when we have this attitude of gratitude that we are more likely to recognize the abundance&nbsp; in our lives. The chances of us having the feelings of an abundant life will be lessened unless we take the time to count our many blessings. We all have a lot to be thankful for and should give our Heavenly Father the credit for all that we have and enjoy.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/search?q=attitude of gratitude&amp;lang=eng&amp;domains=general-conference" target="_self"></a>I would encourage all of us to find quiet times when we can stop and think of how we have been blessed and then spend time on our knees expressing our gratitude to our Heavenly Father. I would encourage each of us on a regular basis to take the time to evaluate our lives and identify the thoughts, feelings and experiences that contribute to our version of an abundant life.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 5:&nbsp;A stronger sense of an abundant life comes when we make, pursue and achieve goals that have eternal significance. &nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong>It is my testimony that if we set goals with eternal significance and then pursue and reach those goals, we will have an increased desire and determination to live more righteous lives.&nbsp; As a result of this obedience, our chances of experiencing an abundant life increase.&nbsp; Goals with eternal significance include but are not limited to:&nbsp; living worthy of a temple recommend and attending the temple on a regular basis, serving a mission, being married and sealed in the temple, and raising a gospel centered family.&nbsp;<br /><br />To illustrate this point I would like to share an experience that involves a great group of young men.&nbsp; This experience began two years ago and is still ongoing. This unique experience and transition has been witnessed and enjoyed by many and has left a lasting impression on me and many others.&nbsp; This is an example of a group of young men who set personal goals at an early age including goals with eternal significance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two years ago our twin sons were members of our local High School football team in Rexburg and they were excited to play their senior year. All the young men on this team made it their goal during their youth football days to win a high school state championship in football. During the prior high school season their team won four games and lost five. It made sense at the time why no one picked this team do be anything but average their senior season. Fortunately, someone forgot to tell that to this team. This team was a close knit group, all with a common goal.&nbsp; In my opinion this team had three attributes that exceeded that of their opponents this particular season.&nbsp;Their desire to do their best and win was greater and their team unity and unselfishness exceeded that of their opponents.&nbsp;<br /><br />During this pre-season the boys would continually refer to their goal of winning a state championship and they were determined that nothing would stand in their way of accomplishing this goal.&nbsp; The season began and this team practiced and played their games with one goal in mind: a State championship. I'll give you the condensed version of this very exciting season and simply say, they ended up having pretty good year winning all nine of their regular season games.&nbsp; Not bad. They then went on to win their first two state playoff games. Finally, as a result of every coach and player's desire to win and the best efforts of everyone on the team they held on to win the 5A state championship and end the season undefeated with 12 wins and no losses. You would be hard pressed to find a group of young men and coaches that were happier that evening than this group not to mention the entire community.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next morning the front page of the local newspaper read:&nbsp; "PERFECT!" On the back page it read "CHAMPS!" What a great experience for these young men. Those were truly great times and an experience they will remember for a lifetime.&nbsp;<br /><br />Did this experience contribute to these young men experiencing an abundant life? Absolutely. Many probably thought that few things, if any could ever surpass the excitement, satisfaction, and happiness that this experience had brought them, but this overall experience gets even better.&nbsp;<br /><br />Midway through this particular football season, President Monson made the announcement that young men could begin their missionary service when they turn 18. Many of these young men at an early age made it a goal to win a state championship in football but they also made a personal goal to serve a mission. As a result, midway through this football season, winning a championship and leaving on a mission right after high school became the conversation piece for many. The following spring, mission call after mission call started arriving in the mailboxes of many of these young men. All the sudden this large group of teammates began to decrease in number as they saw their lifelong friends leave, one at a time, week by week to their respective missions throughout the world. What a blessing it was for these boys to have such a large group of friends and teammates with similar values and with the same goal of serving a mission. There are certainly other high school football teams who go undefeated and win championships, but few teams can say they have over 30 young men from their championship team currently serving missions. I don't give you that number to brag or set this group of young men apart from anyone else.&nbsp; I give you that number in the spirit of excitement, humility and gratitude. Watching them work together on the football field was certainly enjoyable but watching this group transition into the lives of Elders has been equally enjoyable and fulfilling.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Mondays are currently my favorite day of the week. Around 10 a.m. each Monday morning I get to read the weekly letter from our son serving his mission in Farmington, New Mexico. Later that afternoon I get to read another missionary letter from our son serving in Mesa, Arizona. I love reading their missionary experiences, reading how their testimony of the gospel is growing, and of course seeing their most recent pictures. Our sons express how they are loving their respective areas and more importantly that they are loving the people they have been called to serve. They often write how happy they are as a result of serving the Lord every hour of every day.&nbsp; The feelings I get when I read their letters contribute to my own abundant life experience. It is apparent that their experiences are bringing great blessings to them as well. The weekly letters we receive from our boys and their unique life-changing experiences are duplicated in the missionary e-mails we read from their teammates. Some mention providing many acts of service including giving priesthood blessings. They are all instruments in the Lord's hands, helping individuals come unto Christ, helping individuals become converted and being baptized. Many are involved in helping couples move closer to their goal of attending the temple and being sealed together as a couple and as families. &nbsp;<br /><br />My wife and I often comment on the letters we read from our boys and their teammates and ask the question "Is this the same young man we knew a few months ago?" We know the answer to this question. The answer is: yes and No. The experience they had on the football team was one they will always remember and cherish but the experiences they are having on their missions have so much more significance experiences they will reflect upon for years to come. These young men are experiencing the blessings that come from achieving their goal of serving a mission and then faithfully serving. They are currently experiencing their own abundant lives and are helping many others do the same. They are experiencing the abundant life that comes from setting goals with eternal significance and focusing on things that matter most.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, we all have a lot to be thankful for. Life offers its fair share of challenges but it is all worth it when we experience the feelings we have discussed this afternoon. These feelings that we can have during our time on earth are just a glimpse of how we will feel after this earth life if we endure to the end and qualify for exaltation. Our Heavenly Father wants nothing more than for us to have these feelings and experiences while on this earth. May we remember to focus on the needs of others more than our own, make the most of our personal circumstances, develop the attitude of lifelong Christ-like service, maintain an attitude of gratitude and pursue goals with eternal significance. As we do, we will experience the joy that our Heavenly Father is eager to bless us with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>What a year of preparation for this talk I have had! Oh my goodness I've have apparently needed refining. Two near life ending experiences have taken place.&nbsp; The last was only two months ago.&nbsp; Many nights I have spent uncomfortably lying in a hospital bed, searching and praying for the words to come that I might share. I pray the Lords blessing on us all that what I share maybe what he would have me say.<br /><br />This campus is very important to me. I have spent close to half my life here employed, and prior to that this is where I came to meet my little sweetheart and Eternal companion, after serving the Lord as a missionary in Australia. I have worked side by side with good men and women as we have served the campus community. In addition to the full time men and women I have been blessed to have the association of great young men and women who go about the University delivering and keeping the wheels moving so that the Lord's work may continue.<br /><br />I was amused last conference when Elder Ballard shared his meeting and determination to win over the heart of his future wife. When he said,<em>"Somehow during those dates I was able to convince her that he was the only true and living returned missionary-at least as far as she was concerned."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly how I felt with my little bride to be. It was a blind date for me, something which I had never done before, but turned out to be the best night of my dating experience. Of course, thankfully with the skills that I also learned in the mission field of contacting and committing people, a few months went by and the commitment was made. We became husband and wife in June of 1976, only nineteen days after the devastating flood that hit this area when the Teton Dam collapsed. Ours was a whirlwind romance to me, but I knew the moment I met her that she was truly the one that Heavenly Father had chosen for me.&nbsp; Now 38 years later with four children and four amazing spouses to them and seven grandchildren with one more due in February our joy continues to grow. We have been a fortunate couple who dearly love each other and we look forward to our years ahead.<br /><br />Three and one half weeks of this summer I spent in the hospital. As I was under the care of angel nurses, many who were students or graduates from our University here and they were so caring and compassionate. They ministered to my medical needs at every opportunity. They took vitals, administered medication and watched ever so vigilantly over me night and day to be sure that I received the best they had to offer. I am here today because of their faithful service to me.<br /><br />Daily serving the sick and afflicted. I wonder if they really know what that means to we who occupy those beds in uncomfortable situations and crisis.<br /><br />I have thought of savior's role as the greatest mentor and minister ever to live, who gave the perfect example of how this should be done.&nbsp; He gave a parable to the people of how to minister:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise." (Luke 10:30-37)</p>
<p>How can we serve? Just as the Savior said, "Go, and do thou likewise."</p>
<p>Daily we have opportunity to be of service.&nbsp; I think sometimes we think it must be something large or it doesn't count.&nbsp; I assure you that it does not take large things to be huge to the recipient of your kindness and compassion.&nbsp; It just takes you.... A look, a touch, a kind word.&nbsp; A smile to lift the clouds of discouragement for even just a vitally crucial moment in a day of need.&nbsp; We all, every one of us is our brother's keeper and we have the ability to help make a difference.<br /><br />I think of the beautiful poignant description by Alma after he listened to a prophet's voice and felt he had to do something and so he did.<br /><br />We read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold here, are the waters of Mormon (for thus they were called) and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all places that ye may be in, even unto death, that ye may be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him that ye will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?" (Mosiah 18: 8-10)</p>
<p>As you go about the University, what is your approach to those around you? Who is your brother or Sister?&nbsp; Aren't we all brothers and sisters in God's eyes?&nbsp; Yes we are!</p>
<p>I have loved associating with President Clark.&nbsp; His example of being kind and happy and smiling is infectious.&nbsp; He asked us to look people in the eyes at one of his many devotionals.&nbsp; To make the contact even if it was only to smile at each other.&nbsp; What a boost to each other this is!&nbsp; Look at each other right now and smile.&nbsp; DO IT!&nbsp; (<strong>Pause</strong>) Didn't and doesn't that feel good?&nbsp; We need to do more of that every day and it will make a difference!<br /><br /><strong>How do you minister to the one?</strong><strong><br /></strong>I have had the blessed experience of associating with the most wonderful men and women the past eight years by being involved in Wood Badge.&nbsp; This is a Scouting program where Scout leaders throughout the Regional Council of the Boy Scouts of America come together for Leadership Training which helps them to develop goals and ideas.&nbsp; This training helps them return to their home units ready and willing to assist and bless the lives of the young men and women they are called to serve and associate with.<br /><br />I have never associated with so many likeminded people who are helpful, friendly, courteous kind, and willingly ready to give of themselves in a way which is inspiring, not only to the boys, but to those they come in contact with.&nbsp; The staff of these many Wood Badge courses meet complete strangers and for six days teach, train, love, and mentor those in their charge so that they may return home lifted and loved and ready to serve others.&nbsp; There are many in this audience that have had this experience and by their smiling recognition and encouragement I know they remember and know just what I speak of to be true.&nbsp; Look around and you can tell who they are.&nbsp; They radiate a love and caring which is infectious and profound.&nbsp; I had the cherished experience of being the Course Director for the June 2013 Wood Badge Course here in this area. Forty five of the most amazing people attended as participants, one of which is my own little sweetheart.&nbsp; We shared, loved and grew together in an environment which is rich in kindness, charity and love.&nbsp; My staff of 20 people, complete strangers to all of these participants came together in an attitude of love and service which I know is inspired by The Lord above, and gave of themselves unconditionally!&nbsp; My life has been forever blessed by my association with these and the other Wood Badge Staff's that I have served with the past eight years.&nbsp; Literally hundreds of men and women have come together in this cause of the boy.&nbsp; The byproduct of this is their compassion and service to all mankind. &nbsp;I am forever changed by their service.<br /><br />The last week of June, 2013 there was a kick off in our area for Boys by the church and many other areas are following the same pattern.&nbsp; It was called "Rise Up".&nbsp; It was a gathering of over 10,500 Scouts and leaders.&nbsp; Of course there were games, fun, food, and typical Scouting fair, but more than that there was challenge and encouragement not only for the Boys but leaders to Rise up and do their duty, not only now but for our lifetime and serve those who we come in contact &nbsp;with daily.<br /><br />We were given the opportunity to earn the new and coveted Thomas S Monson award which I wear with pride and duty around my neck.&nbsp; The award is a promise and a reminder that we will serve and help not only the boys but all of our fellowman as well.&nbsp; I and two other men from our Ward were put under a charge by a dear friend, who is a Stake President in this area.&nbsp; He challenged us to do our duty and serve with love and dedication all the days of our lives and asked us as he looked us straight in the eye one by one, "will you do this?"&nbsp; And unanimously we said we will.&nbsp; That charge given and accepted was an opportunity and commitment to serve the rest of my days in so great a call.&nbsp; Literally thousands of leaders and boys accepted this charge and commitment to serve all those we come in contact with.<br /><br />I remember years ago of a night when&nbsp; I was driving home from work in late October and the air was crisp and cold as it gets in this area during the Fall. &nbsp;One of the draws that make it wonderful to live and be here.&nbsp; As I drive home, I get into this mode of what will I have to do when I get home, and I wonder what will be for supper?&nbsp; I have animals to take care of and farming needs to complete, running through my mind.&nbsp; As I drove along musing over the next events of the night, I noticed walking south away from Rexburg and in my direction of travel, a young female co-ed.&nbsp; Now this is not unusual for this area, with joggers, bicyclist, and exercise enthusiasts. But tonight the Spirit told me that there seemed to be something a little amiss with this situation.&nbsp; I stopped across the road from her and asked, "Are you okay?" she didn't respond immediately and only walked on slowly looking at the ground.&nbsp; In my mind I knew that on this night I couldn't just drive on.&nbsp; As I continued to seek a response, I encouraged her to cross over to my side of the road and to at least get into my vehicle and warm up.&nbsp; I noticed she had no shoes on and she had no coat.&nbsp; This young co-ed was miles from the campus.&nbsp; At best even if she returned to town that moment she would be freezing before arriving home.&nbsp; In looking into her eyes finally, I saw hurt and sadness which melted my heart.&nbsp; I knew that tonight I would not leave this daughter of God on this road alone.&nbsp; She was on the driver's side of my car and was standing back away from my vehicle but at least close enough to talk.&nbsp; The steam from her breath was an indication of the temperature outside.&nbsp; I asked where she was from, what she was doing out in this remote area, where her roommates were and if I could give her a ride? Our conversation seemed like it was lasting for many uncomfortable minutes with me doing most of the talking.&nbsp; Picture a big guy in an older vehicle talking to a young woman, and encouraging her to get into my vehicle to go who knows where?&nbsp; I wasn't having a lot of success.&nbsp; I assured her I would take here where ever she needed to go,&nbsp; just get into my car and at least get out of the cold.&nbsp; She got closer to my vehicle and I know was analyzing just what kind of man I must be.&nbsp; Had she been told as a youth, "Don't talk with strangers?"&nbsp; And I will admit I am as strange as they get!&nbsp; I shared with her that I worked at the College and was in a campus Bishopric. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She said she needed to go south to an area which I knew was no place for her to be at that time of night.&nbsp; I said I'll take you there, just hop in.&nbsp; Reluctantly she finally got into my car.&nbsp; Noticeably she was appreciating the warmth of the heater and the fact that she was out of the cold.&nbsp; I drove toward her intended destination and continued to share with her all of the wonderfully redeeming qualities which I possess to help her feel safe.&nbsp; I shared with her the fact that I have four children, and there ages and that I am married and had been for many years.&nbsp; I shared everything I could think of to help her feel safe.&nbsp; I think I even shared some of my favorite Kindergarten memories.<br /><br />When we arrived at the location she said she wanted to be dropped off at I stopped the car and asked, "Well, where you would like to go?"&nbsp; She again hesitated with her determination to get out.&nbsp; I was born in the night, but not last night.&nbsp; I knew with everything that was in me that my duty and my honor was to protect this young lady and help her in her hour of need.&nbsp; I would not leave her here!<br /><br />I asked her what was wrong.&nbsp; What could I do to assist her?&nbsp; What would she like of me? How could I serve her? She sat quietly looking into her hands as she was rubbing them back and forth warming them up.&nbsp; I said, "You really don't want to be here tonight, do you?&nbsp; She reluctantly said no.&nbsp; I determined she was coming home with me, and when I asked her if that would be okay after a long pause; she said that would be fine.&nbsp; I assured her we would have a warm meal and she could meet my family and enjoy some family time with us.&nbsp; She agreed and off we went toward my home.<br /><br />Now this seems a good story to this point, but now what was I going to do when I walk in the back door of my house look at my wife and proclaim, "Hi Honey I'm home, look what I found on the road.....can I keep her?" My dear bride, read my eyes, and knew of my pleading for help in assisting this young woman in her hour of need.&nbsp; My wife leapt to her side and enveloped her in the love of our family.&nbsp; I stood back and watched her minister and love this complete stranger into the fold of our family.&nbsp;<br /><br />We fed her and talked with her and learned about her family and of what she liked and what was important to her.&nbsp; She met my youngest child who is a daughter, who was blond haired, blue eyed and about 1 1/2 years old at the time.&nbsp; This young woman had a sister who was 1 1/2 years old, blond haired and blue eyed and her name was also Meagan.&nbsp; She was missing her as well as the rest of the family and wanted so much to have a moment with her own sister, and God arranged for my little girl to fill the need.<br /><br />We made contact with her roommates and they drove to our home hurriedly and thankfully. The concern they had in their eyes was notable. Where had she been and what would they do to find her?&nbsp; These are days before cell phones and texting, and to them she was lost! We invited them all in and talked and laughed and enjoyed an evening together. They got ready to leave and we hugged this young woman with all the love we could muster. We invited them to come again any time and we would have a bar-b-q and a meal soon.<br /><br />We spent a lot of time with this dear little friend.&nbsp; She would come out on weekends, ride the horses have some home cooking, love our children as a big sister and still does.&nbsp; She has attended weddings, mission fare wells and every other activity that families share. We stayed in touch while she was serving a mission and then when she returned to finish her degree at BYU-Provo.&nbsp; We attended her wedding and have been accepted as adopted grandparents to her children, and have loved her and had her as a part of our family ever since that night.&nbsp; We have met her family and as a matter of interest her younger sister worked for me here on campus and is now serving a mission as well.<br /><br />I do not know what the cause of our paths crossing was to this day, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; What matters is that we were there for her and continue to be there loving her and ever thankful for her and her family.<br /><br />There is more to the story that has so touched me with my recent illness.&nbsp; As I opened my groggy pain filled and discouraged eyes, who stood at my bedside but this sweet little girl that I had stopped to help many years ago.&nbsp; She heard there was a need and she came to my rescue.&nbsp; Quietly serving and helping me and my poor little oh so exhausted sweetheart, and then without fanfare left having ministered to us for days with no thought of re-numeration for her efforts.&nbsp; She may never know what she has come to mean with her family to our family!&nbsp; And to think those many years ago........."I could have driven on to my house and never made that lifetime connection!"<br /><br />What is the take away for all of us today?&nbsp; I submit that there are those that need us.&nbsp; They are struggling and need our time, our touch, our look and our love.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you walk around this amazing campus and enjoy the beauty and peace of the well cared for grounds and gardens and buildings, don't hesitate to look into the eyes of those who pass you by.&nbsp; It is said the eyes are the windows of the soul, and into those eyes you can make a difference in their world.<br /><br />Please take time to love and show compassion and just "Smile!"&nbsp;<br /><br />All of us are carrying burdens, every one of us.&nbsp; Can we not help each other?&nbsp; I submit we can and should!&nbsp; Every person, regardless of age or ability can and should make a difference in someone's life.&nbsp; We are impressed and inspired to do something, the real question is will we do it?&nbsp; We can and we must! And why would we do this?&nbsp; What is in it for me?&nbsp; How will this be of value to me in my life?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br />"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br />"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br />"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink?<br />"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee?<br />"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<br />"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." (Matt: 25:34-40)</p>
<p>I think of the scripture which is so beautiful to me depicting the life of the Lords servants as they continued to minister and help those they came in contact with after the Saviors resurrection.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.<br />"And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;<br />"Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.<br />"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.<br />"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.<br />"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.<br />"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength." (Acts 3: 1-7)</p>
<p>I testify we can assist those around us and it doesn't cost us anything.&nbsp; Ours is just to do and the blessings will be forever!&nbsp; We can all make a difference; this is Gods kingdom on earth and it is up to each of us to be his ministers. He lives I know it!In the name of Jesus Christ, amen</p>

<p></p>
<p>Some years ago, while living in Arizona, the company that I worked for gave me the responsibility to organize and direct a week-long high school youth tour of Washington, D.C. This became an annual event that required months of planning and organization. It was no small task to bring 30 to 40 students and chaperones to our nation's capital for a week-long tour.<br /><br />The hard part was to make all the preliminary arrangements for flights, hotel rooms, tour busses and other accommodations.&nbsp; Once that was accomplished, the actual trip itself was always enjoyable and rewarding. Many of the students had never been to Washington, D.C. before and it was a real pleasure to take them there and enjoy the wonderful and interesting sights the capital city has to offer.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the tour was to visit the impressive monuments located along the National Mall. It was always an inspiring sight to see the Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials and to reflect on the remarkable accomplishments of these men. There were many other monuments to visit. All of them brought deep feelings of gratitude and veneration for the founders and protectors of our nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Out of all the monuments, one in particular stood out to me. This was the Vietnam Veteran's memorial which honors the men and women who served in the Vietnam War. The Memorial is made up of two massive rock walls more than 200 feet long. The smooth, black, stone walls have been polished to the point that they appear as giant mirrors sunk into the ground with the earth behind them. Engraved on these reflective walls are the names of fellow Americans who gave their lives in service to their country. More than 58,200 names are permanently chiseled in the gleaming stone.<br /><br />When I visited this memorial for the first time, I noticed a distinctive change in the way the tourists approached it and viewed it.&nbsp; The normal chatter from visitors diminished and the whole area seemed to invoke a quiet reverence as each visitor began to move down the slightly sloping path along this wall.<br /><br />Some of the visitors left notes, flowers and other sentimental items near this wall. Others placed small pieces of paper over specific names and with the use of pencils carefully produced rubbings of the names of loved ones and friends. Although the wall was designed in a simplistic style, it seemed to have a remarkable capacity to beckoned each visitor to stop, reflect&nbsp; and examine it closely. I have never forgotten my first visit to the Vietnam Memorial. I have been privileged to return many times over the years. Each time I visit, it always invokes the same attitude of reverence, honor and gratitude.<br /><br />A question came to my mind. Why? Why did this particular memorial invoke such powerful feelings of respect and veneration from the visitors? &nbsp;Certainly it was because these were common ordinary people who were willing to do uncommon things and lay down their lives in valor and service for their country. But perhaps it was something else. The Wall gives tribute to each name individually. For me the names became more powerful than the artwork or canvas they were written on.&nbsp; There is a reverence that comes when each individual name is distinguished, respected and valued.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even when a name a name is not known, a person can still be honored. Not far from this wall in Virginia is the Arlington Cemetery. At this cemetery is the Tomb of the Unknowns, commonly referred to as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Inscribed on the massive monument and guarded 24 hours a day, 365 days per year by fellow soldiers is the simple statement: "Here rests in Honored Glory, An American Soldier known but to God."&nbsp;<br /><br />Names really are sacred.&nbsp;Having a specific name that identifies us makes each of us distinctive and unique.&nbsp; In Doctrine and Covenants Section 20 verse 70 the Lord says, "Every member of the church of Christ having children is to bring them unto the elders before the church, who are to lay their hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them in his name."&nbsp;The naming and blessing of children is an ordinance performed by the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.&nbsp;<br /><br />A good name is desirable. In Proverbs it says, "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold."&nbsp;<br /><br />Where your name is listed on certain documents can be extremely important. As a teacher at BYU-Idaho I always have several students ask this question at the beginning of each semester:&nbsp; "Is my name on your roll?"&nbsp; For that person, the verification that their name is indeed on the class roll provides reassurance that they can get proper credit for the class.<br /><br />But there is another roll that we should be even more concerned about. This roll or record &nbsp;is essential to our salvation. In the Book of Mormon &nbsp;the Lord says "the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand" (Alma 5:58).<br /><br />Christ knows us by name. Referring to himself as the great shepherd and to those who know and follow him, he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers." (John 10:2-5)</p>
<p>The prophet Alma gave also said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people." (Alma 5:57)</p>
<p>These scriptures teach us why our ward clerks work so diligently to accurately identify ward members and record essential ordinances for each one. Ward and stake clerks are remarkable servants of the Lord who keep track of addresses and contact information and do all they can to ensure that the sheep of the Shepherd are not lost.</p>
<p>In reference to names, we often hear the term, "name calling." This is usually in reference to derogatory&nbsp; identifiers placed on others in a futile attempt to belittle or put down a person's sacred identity. Is it any wonder that name-calling is not only offensive to the person offended, but it is also a grievous offense to God Himself who gave that person his or her individuality.<br /><br />Many people today are concerned about "identity theft." This refers to unscrupulous people who steal our identities and use our personal information in devious ways. However, the most&nbsp; diabolical thief of all who truly wants to practice identity theft, is Satan. He is constantly working day and night to strip us of any identity. He does not want us to know who we are, where we came from or what our purpose is.He wants to erode our confidence in what we can do and what we can become. &nbsp;In other words, he wants to dissolve us from any connection with deity and then damn us with doubt, despair and distain for ourselves.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our unique individuality is essential to God's great plan of happiness.&nbsp;We might think our role in God's great work is minor, small or insignificant. We might even think we don't fit in because we may be different. Satan would have us think that we are not needed. &nbsp;Some of God's children actually go astray or just leave because they feel they don't belong.<br /><br />Elder Joseph Wirthlin of the Quorum of the Twelve taught that these people may, "look, act, think, and speak differently than those around them and that sometimes causes them to assume they don't fit in. They conclude that they are not needed."<br /><br />Elder Wirthlin continues with this statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Tied to this misconception is the erroneous belief that all members of the Church should look, talk, and be alike. The Lord did not people the earth with a vibrant orchestra of personalities only to value the piccolos of the world. Every instrument is precious and adds to the complex beauty of the symphony. All of Heavenly Father's children are different in some degree, yet each has his own beautiful sound that adds depth and richness to the whole." (April 2008 Conference Report, "Concern for the One")</p>
<p>Every person born into this world is singular and unique and has a distinctive role in helping God perform His work and glory. Even those who may think they are feeble or unsuitable are important.&nbsp;The Apostle Paul compared each person as if they were a part of the body. Each part of the body has important and distinctive functions and characteristics. For instance the ear can do things that the eye cannot do and the eye cannot do things that the ear can do. Paul said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"God set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him. Those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: And those members of the body which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour: and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness." (1 Corinthians 12:18 and 23)</p>
<p>Every person is important, needed and wanted. The Lord wants variety in his kingdom and not just duplicates of everybody. &nbsp;If you don't believe that, just look around at all of his creations. The Lord knows the names of all of his creations. The Psalmist says, "He telleth the number of the stars and he calleth them all by their names" (Psalms 147:4). Isn't this wonderful? Isn't this great news?</p>
<p>I have two sisters in my family and I love them both. Even though all three of us come from the same parents, we all have very different personalities, interests and traits. My sister Sherlyn has many talents. She loves to paint. She loves to paint portraits, landscapes and many other things with oil paint. She takes classes and continues to learn all she can about painting.<br /><br />Here is one of her paintings. It depicts a pioneer girl gazing across the plains as she makes her journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Sherlyn's daughter Ashleigh posed for this painting. This painting actually won an award in an art contest and was displayed for a time in the Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.&nbsp;Sherlyn's husband and her two sons love to fish. Sherlyn decided to paint the three of them fishing in a river. Here is another painting, depicting the three of them holding on to each other and bracing against the current while working their fishing rods.&nbsp;<br /><br />My other sister, Janilee, just loves horses. Since she was very little, she has always had an interest in them. She has raised, trained, sold and has shown horses for many events. Today she works with 4-H youth programs helping younger people gain appreciation for equestrian activities.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of my hobbies, which I find very fascinating, is to keep bees and produce honey. I have been involved in beekeeping since I was a teenager. In this photo I am standing next to one of my hives that I tend. This hive, by the way holds about 50 to 60 thousand bees.<br /><br />Honey bees are amazing creatures. They are a principle source for pollinating most of our world's food crops. They all work together for a common cause-to produce honey and sustain themselves. Yet they are not the same when it comes in their roles and responsibilities in the hive. Some are designated as nurse bees to take care of the young. Others are wax workers that produce the beautiful intricate and distinctive honeycomb designs for storing honey. Certain bees are field workers who have the responsibility to gather nectar and bring it back to the hive. This division of labor within the hive creates an amazing system of cooperation that has the potential to produce an incredible harvest of delicious honey-sometimes as much as 60 pounds or more per hive.<br /><br />Whenever I hear the phrase, "You Mormons are all alike," I cringe. My response is, "Nothing could be further from the truth." Yes, we as members of the Church have many things in common. We profess and practice our faith together. We all strive to keep the same covenants and standards. We even strive to all be one with each other and with God. The Lord commanded us to be united with each other and with Him.&nbsp; He said, "If ye are not one, ye are not mine" (D&amp;C 38; 27). However, we are still separate individuals with individual thoughts, traits, gifts, talents and personalities that are essential to the work of God.&nbsp;Each of us was meant to be a&nbsp; ship of curious workmanship, not to be built after the manner of men, but to be built by the designs of God.<br /><br />All of us are given different gifts and talents. In the Doctrine and Covenants section 46 verse 11 it states, "For all have not every gift given unto them: for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God." Our responsibility is to discover, enlarge and implement the gifts we have been given. Perhaps some may ask if they have any gifts at all. Too often we associate gifts with some sort of creative talent such as music, art, writing, science or some other ingenious skill to do something different such as mechanical work or fixing someone's computer.<br /><br />Although these things are gifts, there are many others that may not be so obvious. They can be so subtle that we may not even realize we have them. Perhaps it is the ability to have compassion for others. Perhaps it could be a believing heart. Or it could be the capacity to recognize the good in other people.<br /><br />I'm sure we can all think of people that we know that have demonstrated these gifts.&nbsp;One person in particular that I remember was Judy White. I became acquainted with her while we lived in Arizona. Both of us were employees for the electric utilities that sponsored the Washington Youth Tour.&nbsp; She and others helped me to organize our annual trip to Washington, D.C. She lived in a small home in a very small rural town in Duncan, Arizona. Although she was older and never married, she had a remarkable influence in her community.&nbsp;<br /><br />She was an avid fan of all the local high school sports teams. She attended almost every sporting event and provided encouragement to all of the students involved. Although she had no children of her own, she treated nearly every student at that small school as if he or she was her very own. She volunteered her time for many school and civic projects. She gave freely of her time with the students for many years and became their dear friend.<br /><br />She served faithfully in the callings she was given in the Church. She gave her best efforts to her employer at the local electric utility. When she attended several of our meetings in her employment capacity, it was if a breeze of fresh air entered into the room. She was always genuine, happy, friendly and humorous with everyone who was there. I was amazed at how she remembered not only the names of the people in our group, but she remembered the names of each group member's family and even the names of their pets. I was astonished at times by the way she simply loved and really cared about other people. She was like a magnet that drew people in around her.<br /><br />She was never afraid to express her opinions even when they differed from others. Many people admired and respected her for that.<br /><br />It was a sad day, when we learned that Judy passed away of a sudden heart attack. I remember attending her funeral at the Duncan Stake Center. When I walked in I was stunned by the throngs of people that were there. Every seat was filled. The overflow area and the cultural hall were filled to capacity.&nbsp; Although she had few family members, &nbsp;I said to myself, "Look at the impact just one woman had on her community."<br /><br />Regarding gifts given to people, the Lord said, "To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby" (D&amp;C 46:12). Here was a woman who was given a gift and many were certainly "profited thereby."&nbsp;There are many gifts and we are commanded to seek earnestly the best gifts, "always remembering for what they are given" (D&amp;C 46: 8). The variety of gifts bestowed upon us are essential for God to do his great work in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.<br /><br />As we look at the gifts and talents the Lord has given each of us, there is the temptation to compare ourselves with others. We may see certain gifts and talents in others that we envy or wish we had. When we begin comparing ourselves with others to determine our own value and self-worth, we are treading a dangerous path. This is an element of pride. President Ezra Taft Benson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success. They feel worthwhile as individuals if the numbers beneath them in achievement, talent, beauty or intellect are large enough. Pride is ugly. It says, 'if you succeed, I am a failure.'" (April 1989 "Beware of Pride" by Ezra Taft Benson)</p>
<p>We cannot compare ourselves with others.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I served my mission in Norway. As missionaries we heard rumors about the great success the missionaries were having in Mexico. Hundreds of people were being baptized in Mexico and very few people were being baptized in Norway. It was hard for us to understand why there was so much apparent success in Mexico and so little of it in Norway. &nbsp;Some of the missionaries in Norway began to speculate it was because we did not have as much faith as the missionaries in Mexico and that it was our fault that we could not baptize as many people.<br /><br />During this time President Monson, who was then a member of the Quorum of Twelve came to visit our mission. I remember him clearly telling us not to compare ourselves with Mexico. He said, "Compare Norway with Norway and Mexico with Mexico." He further told us that there were times he wished he could speak as well as Elder LeGrand Richards, who was also a member of the Twelve at the time. But he said that he learned that he should not do this, but simply try the best he could to be a good speaker with the simple talents that the Lord had given him.<br /><br />I don't think anyone today who sincerely listens to President Monson will doubt his ability to reach our hearts. He truly is a great speaker in his own special way.<br /><br />The Savior said, we should be careful about judging others. Many times we look at this as placing people in the negative, but we should also be careful about our possible faulty perceptions of elevating others at unrealistically high levels. Nobody is perfect even if they appear to be perfect. Comparing ourselves to other mortals to determine our self-worth is deadly and is not pleasing to our Father in Heaven. We should also be careful about comparing ourselves with the spiritual qualities of others. There is only one whom we should really try to emulate and that is our Saviour Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Working out our salvation is process that involves each of us at different levels and in different situations and circumstances. The Lord is mindful of this and He will not fail us, if we reach out to him and ask his help .<br /><br />Much of the work of the Lord is done on an individual basis. One person helping another. One person being baptized. One person being confirmed a member of the Church. One person praying to God seeking guidance. One by one, we all partake of the sacrament. Temple ordinances are done one person at a time. Doing things one person at a time may be slow and not very efficient in the eyes of man, but it is the way God intended it to be.<br /><br />Some questions we might ponder are these: Why are there three members of the Godhead and not just one? Why do we have a Quorum of Twelve Apostles and not a quorum of one?&nbsp; Why are there three members of a bishopric and not just one?&nbsp;<br /><br />The Nicene Creed, a false doctrine established in AD 325, was an attempt to erase the individuality of each member of the Godhead. When the God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared (as separate glorified beings) to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said the religious creeds of the day were, "an abomination in his sight" (Joseph Smith History 1:19). In other words, God was displeased when man obliterated the true knowledge of His individuality.<br /><br />The Lord knows us individually and he wants us to know him in the same way and to become acquainted with him on a very personal level. &nbsp;The visit of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ to the young Joseph Smith in the spring of 1820 was one of the most singular events to happen in the history of mankind. It is interesting to note that the very first word spoken by the voice of God the Father was simply "Joseph" (Joseph Smith History 1:17). God knew his name and addressed him personally.&nbsp;<br /><br />This was not the only time Joseph was personally addressed by a heavenly being. Recounting the visit of the Angel Moroni, Joseph said, "He called me by name" (Joseph Smith history 1:33).<br /><br />Today, Joseph Smith's name continues to be spoken throughout the earth as prophesied in Doctrine and Covenants section 122:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee: While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous shall seek counsel and authority and blessings constantly from under thy hand." (D&amp;C 122:1-2)</p>
<p>We too can be an influence. Maybe not as big as Joseph Smith or Judy White. But we can be an influence in our own special way. We can reach others that perhaps no one else can. We can do God's work with the abilities and circumstances He has given us.</p>
<p>He who notes the sparrow's fall, also knows our names. He is well aware of our circumstances. He knows our hearts. He knows our weaknesses and our mistakes. He is just. He is merciful. He is kind. He is so willing to bring us home that He sent his only begotten Son to redeem us. And it is through the name of Jesus Christ that we can indeed come home to live again with our Eternal Father. I bear testimony of this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is good to be with you today at the beginning of a new semester. It is another great day at BYU-Idaho. I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak to you and pray that the Holy Spirit will be with us.<br /><br />One of the wonderful blessings of the Restoration is the presence among us of living prophets, seers, and revelators who lead and guide the Lord's true and living Church. In the beloved hymn, "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet," we sing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We thank thee, O God, for a prophet<br />To guide us in these latter days.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The scriptures teach us that whenever the Lord's people follow the prophets and heed the words of the Lord, they are protected and greatly blessed. When they do not, they fall into spiritual darkness and do not prosper in the land.</p>
<p>I would love to sit with you in a small group, or perhaps even one-on-one, and discuss the critical importance of following the Lord's living prophets. We could go back and look at what the prophets have been teaching us and reflect together to see if we have heard them and acted with faith in Christ to do what they have taught.<br /><br />Today, I want to create that experience with you as much as I possibly can. I invite you to listen with your minds and your hearts as I speak. I hope you will engage what I say by writing down impressions and questions that come to you.<br /><br />I will begin with a brief look at the blessings of living prophets. We sustain all of the Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators; but I will concentrate today on the messages that President Thomas S. Monson, the Lord's prophet on the earth, has delivered to us in general conference. In order to give our discussion focus, I will highlight four themes in President Monson's talks that constitute a call to action from the Lord. The themes are: 1) keep the world out of your heart; 2) reach out to rescue; 3) be of good cheer; and 4) stand for truth with courage.<br /><br />I will conclude with some thoughts on how we all might more consistently hear and feel the words of the prophets and act with faith in Christ to do what they call us to do.<br /><br /><strong></strong><strong>The Blessing of Living Prophets, Seers, and Revelators</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When the Lord called Joseph Smith to lead the dispensation of the fullness of times, He called Joseph to be a prophet, seer, and revelator and bestowed upon him "the keys of the kingdom of God . . . committed [to] man on the earth."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Lord's prophet bears special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in and to all of the world. He teaches existing truth and receives revelation for the whole Church and the whole world. He directs the Lord's work. He speaks for the Lord.<br /><br />The living prophet is a seer and a revelator. He sees beyond the horizon, both into the past and into the future. He sees below the surface and behind the fa&ccedil;ade. As Ammon said of seers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By them . . . shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This is the great blessing that the Lord has promised us if we will heed the prophet's voice:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, in God's eternal plan there is no substitute for a living prophet who speaks the word of the Lord by the power of the Holy Ghost. And there is no substitute for the Lord's covenant people to hear that word by the power of the Spirit. In this way we receive both the Lord's messages for all of His children and very personal, specific impressions and feelings about what we individually need to do. These impressions are personal assignments, or commandments, from the Lord.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Following the prophet, therefore, is an act of faith in Jesus Christ, and it always comes with His promised blessings.</p>
<p>The promise that the Lord will "disperse the powers of darkness from before [us]"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;has great relevance. We live in a time when the powers of darkness seem to be all around us in a swirling, shifting, changing mix of temptations and deceptive ideas which seek to lure us away from the true path and blind our minds.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;If we act with faith in Him to obey His assignments and commandments, the Lord will bless us with guidance, protection, and power.<br /><br />I turn now to four themes in President Monson's teachings since he became the prophet of the Lord. As we consider each one, I invite you to ponder what you have done with what the Prophet has taught. You may remember things you have already done, and you may receive new impressions, new assignments from the Lord this very day.<br /><br /><strong>The Teachings of the Living Prophet 2008-2014</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Theme #1: Keep the World Out of Your Heart</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>From the very beginning of his ministry as the Lord's prophet, President Monson has lifted the voice of warning about the nature of the world in which we live. In the language of the revelations, he is a "watchman on the tower" who has "seen the enemy" afar off while there is yet time.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He has sounded the trumpet warning us of the dangers of moral decay, secularism, materialism, and sin:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We live in a world where moral values have, in great measure, been tossed aside, where sin is flagrantly on display, and where temptations to stray from the strait and narrow path surround us. We are faced with persistent pressures and insidious influences tearing down what is decent and attempting to substitute the shallow philosophies and practices of a secular society.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>The world seems to have slipped from the moorings of safety and drifted from the harbor of peace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Permissiveness, immorality, pornography, dishonesty, and a host of other ills cause many to be tossed about on a sea of sin and crushed on the jagged reefs of lost opportunities, forfeited blessings, and shattered dreams.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Prophet's persistent warning about moral decay in society is clear: we must be on our guard against the temptations and the shallow philosophies abroad in the world. He has warned us to keep the world out of our hearts.</p>
<p>Like the prophets down through the ages, President Monson's warning voice has come with a companion message of love, hope, and power centered in the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our code of conduct is definitive; it is not negotiable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It may appear to you at times that those out in the world are having much more fun than you are. . . . I declare to you, however, that there is&nbsp;<em>nothing</em>&nbsp;which can bring more joy into our lives or more peace to our souls than the Spirit which can come to us as we follow the Savior and keep the commandments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We must be vigilant in a world which has moved so far from that which is spiritual. . . . We . . . will be far better equipped to deal with [the storms of life], to learn from them, and to overcome them if we have the gospel at our core and the love of the Savior in our hearts.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Theme #2: Reach out and Rescue</strong></p>
<p>In his very first address to the Church as the prophet, President Monson laid out a theme he would return to over and over again. It is the great work of rescuing our brothers and sisters:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Over the years we have issued appeals to the less active, the offended, the critical, the transgressor--to come back. "Come back and feast at the table of the Lord, and taste again the sweet and satisfying fruits of fellowship with the Saints."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this spirit, we again issue that heartfelt invitation: Come back. We reach out to you in the pure love of Christ and express our desire to assist you and to welcome you into full fellowship. To those who are wounded in spirit or who are struggling and fearful, we say, Let us lift you and cheer you and calm your fears.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The work of the rescue embraces all the work of salvation. The prophet's call to help rescue our brothers and sisters is a call to follow the Savior. Through wonderful stories and stirring calls to serve, the Prophet has inspired us to reach out to the less active, to those who have fallen away, to those who are not yet members of the Church,<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;to those in the throes of sin, and to those who are suffering or spiritually wounded in any way.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>In his memorable words, "There are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save."<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I know that many of you have responded to the prophet's call. It is inspiring to see you reach out to lift and strengthen your roommates, classmates, friends, and family. This is especially true when you love your roommates and friends enough to help them come back to the light when they have wandered into darkness. Over the years we have seen thousands of souls saved on this campus because someone like you had enough trust in the Lord to say to a roommate in trouble, "We need to talk." As President Monson has taught:</p>
<p>[M]ay we remember the Lord's precious promise to those who trust in Him: "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Theme #3: Be of Good Cheer</strong></p>
<p>President Monson always has been sensitive to the needs of people who struggle with the afflictions and troubles of mortal life. Sister Clark and I know that troubles are part of your lives. Every Monday night we hold a home evening with 150-200 students. In your questions and discussions with us, we have heard about and felt the pain and sorrow that comes from sin, mental and physical illness, divorce, death of a loved one, a wayward family member, difficulties in learning, disappointment in dating and marriage, and the weakness of the natural man.<br /><br />President Monson's message is a message for you. Many times during his ministry he has spoken with love and empathy to encourage and inspire us when the storms of life strike. His basic message is the message of the Master: Fear not, be of good cheer.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>I testify to you that our promised blessings are beyond measure. Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep the commandments. There will be nothing in this world that can defeat us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, please note that the Prophet's message is a message of protection against the forces of evil. The storms of life make us vulnerable to temptation and to the voices of the world that would make us doubt and fear and fall away. If we are not resolute in our faith and in our commitment to be of good cheer, adversity can lead to cynicism, bitterness, and anger. It can lead us to turn away from the Lord and His church.</p>
<p>It is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that sustains us through the storms of life. Jesus descended below all things. He has felt and overcome everything we feel and face. He has all power over all things. That is why He said to His apostles, "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."<sup>19&nbsp;</sup>He has that power, and He will use it to bless and sustain us if we turn to Him and act with faith in Him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The history of the Church in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, is replete with the experiences of those who have struggled and yet who have remained steadfast and of good cheer. The reason? They have made the gospel of Jesus Christ the center of their lives. This is what will pull us through whatever comes our way. We will still experience difficult challenges, but we will be able to face them, to meet them head-on, and to emerge victorious.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From the bed of pain, from the pillow wet with tears, we are lifted heavenward by that divine assurance and precious promise: "I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>One of the sweetest blessings of serving at BYU-Idaho is to experience the good cheer that is on this campus. Sister Clark and I have often been inspired to see the good cheer and faith in your attitudes and in your lives, even when you have faced difficult challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Theme #4: Stand for Truth with Courage</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Echoing a theme he has emphasized all through his service as an apostle of the Lord, President Monson has called us to stand for truth with courage.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The Prophet has taught us that we stand for truth in two ways, both of which take courage.<br /><br />First, we stand for truth by keeping the commandments of God and thus living according to truth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Although the world has changed, the laws of God remain constant. They have not changed; they will not change. The Ten Commandments are just that--commandments. They are not suggestions.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>The face of sin today often wears the mask of tolerance. Do not be deceived; behind that facade is heartache, unhappiness, and pain. You know what is right and what is wrong, and no disguise, however appealing, can change that. The character of transgression remains the same. If your so-called friends urge you to do anything you know to be wrong, you be the one to make a stand for right, even if you stand alone. Have the moral courage to be a light for others to follow.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We stand for truth foremost in our own homes with our own families and children. There, too, we may need courage and faith to hold home evening every week, to set high standards, to teach the truth with clarity and power, and to not let the world run our lives.</p>
<p>Second, we stand for truth by bearing witness of and defending the truth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will [all] face fear, experience ridicule, and meet opposition. Let us have the courage to defy the consensus, the courage to stand for principle. Courage, not compromise, brings the smile of God's approval.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>As we go about living from day to day, it is almost inevitable that our faith will be challenged. We may at times find ourselves surrounded by others and yet standing in the minority or even standing alone concerning what is acceptable and what is not. Do we have the moral courage to stand firm for our beliefs, even if by so doing we must stand alone?<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In many ways the temptations and opposition we face today look like the temptations and opposition we have always faced: sexual immorality, dishonesty, violating the Word of Wisdom, anger, abuse, complacency, attacks on Joseph Smith, and claims that we are not Christian. However, the Prophet has warned us of challenges to our faith that are "unique to our time."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Foremost among these are social and governmental promotion of same gender attraction and same sex marriage, the rampant portrayal of sexual immorality in digital media, the devaluing of motherhood and fathers, and attacks on the proclamation on the family and the doctrine of the priesthood. All of these are fundamentally attacks on the family and thus on God's eternal plan.</p>
<p>President Monson is the Lord's prophet, seer, and revelator. He sees the hidden danger, the unseen purpose, the catastrophe beyond the horizon, the wickedness behind the fa&ccedil;ade and the disguise. For example, there are some who promote social change in the name of tolerance, fairness, and personal fulfillment, but whose real objective is to destroy the institution of the divinely ordained family<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;where "children are . . . [born] within the bonds of matrimony . . . to . . . a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity."<sup>28</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In contrast, the Prophet of the Lord has called us to stand up and defend the truth about marriage and the family, about mothers and fathers, and about the priesthood of God, even if we face disapproval, ridicule, and persecution. President Monson has taught that when we stand for truth with courage, we always stand with the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As we move forward, striving to live as we should, we will surely receive help from the Lord and can find comfort in His words. I love His promise recorded in the book of Joshua:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<sup>29</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I know that President Monson has taught us the word of the Lord for our times. These four themes constitute a call to action from the Lord. As we have counseled together today, I hope you have reflected on what you have done with what the Lord has commanded you to do through His living prophet. I know that kind of assessment can open your heart to the whisperings of the Spirit.<br /><br />You may have felt impressed to make a change in some aspect of your life in order to more effectively keep the world out of your heart. The name of someone whom you can help to rescue may have come to your mind. You may have felt an impression to defend the truth about marriage and the family to your friends on Facebook because you know deep in your heart that only marriage and a family so ordained of God can qualify us for exaltation and eternal life.<br /><br />Whatever has come to you from the Lord today, I invite you to decide right now, this very minute, to do what you have been impressed to do. I promise you that if you will make that resolve and act on it with faith in Christ, great blessings will flow into your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />What we have experienced together today can become part of a pattern of faith and action that will open your hearts and your minds to the Spirit of the Lord. If you follow that pattern consistently, you will always hear the voice of the Lord in the voice of His prophets and you will always express your love for the Lord and your faith in Him by doing what He commands you to&nbsp;do.<br /><br />Here is the pattern I invite you to put into practice in your life:<br /><br />First, listen to the word of the Lord through His living prophets and record impressions that come to you about things you need to do. These impressions are personal commandments or assignments from the Lord.<br /><br />Second, use the notes of your impressions to create a personal agenda for action. Make your agenda a matter of prayer and study of the scriptures and the conference talks. Seek the power of the Atonement of Christ for the strength to act and to change.<br /><br />Third, as you partake of the sacrament each Sunday, reflect on the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and the evidence of His mercy, grace, and love in your work to fulfill His commandments and assignments. Let your heart be full of love and gratitude for Him. As you renew your covenants, give thanks to the Lord that the Holy Ghost will "bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever [the Lord has] said to you."<sup>30</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>My beloved brothers and sisters, I bear witness of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. I know He leads and guides His true and living church through His living prophets. President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's prophet on the earth today.<br /><br />I know if you will establish the pattern we have discussed today, you will receive the words of the prophets as if from the mouth of the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ "will disperse the powers of darkness from before you"<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;and bless you with a mighty blessing of guidance, protection, strength, and redemption. You will hear His voice in the voice of His prophets. You will know His voice, and you will know Him. All through your life you will cherish these sacred words: "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet, to guide us in these latter-days."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,&nbsp;<em>Hymns</em>, 19.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 65:2; All those ordained to the office of Apostle likewise receive all of the keys of the priesthood that have been given to men on the earth. We sustain all of these brethren as prophets, seers and revelators.<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Mosiah 8:17<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 21:5-6; President Harold B, Lee commented on this passage in describing the power and protection that is in listening to the prophets: "Now the only safety we have as members of this church is to do exactly what the Lord said to the Church in that day when the Church was organized. We must learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through His prophet, "as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me; ... as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith" (D&amp;C 21:4-5). There will be some things that take patience and faith. You may not like what comes from the authority of the Church. It may contradict your political views. It may contradict your social views. It may interfere with some of your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord Himself, with patience and faith, the promise is that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory."" (D&amp;C 21:6).<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 59:3-4 The assignments and commandments we receive from the Lord are the "commandments not a few" the Lord mentions in this verse.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 21:6<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;See 1 Nephi 12:17, where the angel speaking to Nephi says that the mists of darkness in Lehi's dream could blind eyes, harden hearts and lead people away into broad roads. The mists of darkness are not an inert fog.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Ezekiel 33:2-3; D&amp;C 101:54<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Thomas S.

He has issued a direct call to young men to serve the Lord as missionaries and welcomed the missionary service of young women. He gave that call and that welcome tremendous impetus when he announced the change in the age of missionary service in October of 2012.

<p></p>
<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I love the start of a new semester. Hope and anticipation are in the air! President Clark and I are blessed to be here and also feel the surge of hope in this new beginning.<br /><br />All of us need and yearn for acceptance and love. It is a basic need. We especially want to feel it from people we care about who are good and who inspire us to be and to do good. That kind of love instills in us a sense of self-worth and confidence. And so, President Clark and I want you to feel our love and know of our desires for your success in school and in your eternal progression.&nbsp; We don't get to know very many of you individually; but the Lord has blessed us in this work at BYU-Idaho to love you, and we feel His love for you. We hope that you are confident of the Lord's love for you.<br /><br />You can seek for evidence of the Lord's love in your lives. Learning of the Savior, studying the scriptures, serving in the church, keeping the commandments . . . anything that draws you near to Him helps you to feel His love. That evidence often comes in the form of what the scriptures call "the tender mercies of the Lord."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As Elder David A. Bednar has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tender mercies are . . . individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>The tender mercies of the Lord are available to all of us . . . the Redeemer of Israel is eager to bestow such gifts upon us.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Today I want to share with you an experience our daughter had in the spring of 2013 that was a tender mercy from the Lord in her life. That was a very difficult time for her when she faced many significant challenges with her family and her children. One day, feeling frustrated and discouraged, she knelt in prayer. I will read what she wrote about what happened.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I sought to be fully open and humble--even if it meant hearing I had somehow strayed from what He desired for me and my children. I wept as I prayed and promised my Father in Heaven that I would do what He needed of me--whatever that was. As I knelt there, the noise of my children playing downstairs perked my ears. This brought me peace. And then a memory entered my mind. It was the memory of another prayer offered in another moment of despair some months ago, before my youngest was born, when in the darkness of my bedroom, in the middle of the night, I fell to my knees by the side of my bed seeking comfort and strength. A voice had whispered to my mind that night, and through the memory of it, whispered again on this afternoon:&nbsp;<em>I trust you. You are their mother.&nbsp; I gave them to you.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>Comforted by this memory, I offered a brief prayer of gratitude. This answer to my prayer was enough. I knew that I had done what was right for my children, and I knew my Father in Heaven was watching over me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just as I was getting up from my knees, Kira, my oldest, knocked on my door and excitedly asked me to come outside to see something. She had found something while walking up our front steps on arriving home from softball practice. She urged me to be quiet as I came out onto the front porch and started down the stairs. She pointed into the bushes to the left of the stairs. At first I couldn't see what she was pointing at. But then a robin flew out of the bush and perched on the other side of the railing. The robin was upset and chirping at me. As I looked where she had flown from, I could see why. There, nestled in the bushes, was a beautifully constructed nest with two of the most brilliant blue eggs I had ever seen resting inside. As I showed my other children the nest, mother robin continued her chirping, never moving from her perch just a few branches away. I went inside to get my phone so I could take a picture. On returning, I realized she was still there watching, protecting, and never wavering.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We checked on the robin with her eggs daily for a couple of weeks. She stopped chirping so wildly at us; but each time we approached, she flew to a nearby branch and watched as we snapped pictures of her nest with the eggs. On Mother's Day I woke up early, anxious to check on the nest, and found that overnight those beautiful blue eggs had hatched! There, in the nest, were two beautiful little baby birds. The not-so-subtle symbolism of the timing of their hatching was not lost on me.&nbsp; It was a beautifully symbolic gift, a sweet tender mercy from my Father in Heaven that reinforced His message to me in answer to my prayers:&nbsp;<em>I trust you. You are their mother. I gave them to you.</em><sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I bear you my witness that the Lord's tender mercies are all around us. When we keep the commandments and draw near to the Lord, we feel His love and recognize His blessings. It is my prayer that we will open our hearts to the love of the Lord and recognize His tender mercies in our lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland was ordained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on June 23, 1994. At the time of this call, Elder Holland was serving as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy to which he had been called on April 1, 1989. <br /><br />From 1980, until his call as a General Authority in 1989, Jeffrey R. Holland served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.&nbsp; He is a former Church commissioner of education and dean of the College of Religious Education at BYU.<br /><br />A student leader and varsity athlete at Dixie High School and Dixie College in his native St. George, Utah, he received his bachelor and master degrees in English and religious education, respectively, from Brigham Young University.&nbsp; He obtained master and doctor of philosophy degrees in American Studies from Yale University. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Holland was active in professional educational activity prior to his call to full‑time Church service.&nbsp; He served as president of the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities (AAPICU), on the board of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), and as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Presidents Commission.&nbsp; For his work in improving understanding between Christians and Jews he was given the "Torch of Liberty" award by the Anti‑Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith.&nbsp; He has served on the governing boards of a number of civic and business‑related corporations, and has received the "Distinguished Eagle Scout" Award from the Boy Scouts of America.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the author of 11 books, 1 of which he co-authored with his wife, Patricia.<br /><br />Elder Holland was born December 3, 1940, to Frank D. and Alice Bentley Holland.&nbsp; In 1963, he married Patricia Terry.&nbsp; They are the parents of Matthew, Mary Alice, and David, the parents-in-law of Paige, Lee, and Jeanne, and the grandparents of 13 beautiful grandchildren.<br /><br /> <br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am thrilled to be with you today as you begin a new school year at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I realize you actually started a few weeks ago but this is the first opportunity President Clark would give me to set foot on campus.&nbsp; He wanted to make sure things got underway properly and therefore requested that I not come in any sooner.&nbsp;<br /><br />I realized while sitting here that this is my first opportunity to be in this beautiful conference center.&nbsp; As some of the very, very senior faculty and staff will remember, I used to come to devotionals in the Hart Building and lead the student body in a stirring cheer to the four R's of the neighborhood--Rexburg, Ririe, Rigby and Roberts.&nbsp; Those were the good old days.&nbsp; You have now gotten so global that cheer would have to be Rome, Raleigh, Raratonga, and Russia--a cheer not appropriate in this hall.&nbsp; My how you have grown. &nbsp;I love this school with all my heart and I certainly love President and Sister Clark with all their administrative, faculty and staff associates here. Thank you, President Clark, for the invitation to be with you.<br /><br />In a phrase I am sure you have heard many times, the Prophet Joseph Smith once said that "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>It is that worthy quest for happiness that I wish to speak today.&nbsp; Note that I said "quest for happiness," not happiness itself.&nbsp; Remember the Prophet Joseph's choice of language: He spoke of the path that leads to happiness as the key to realizing that goal.<br /><br />By the way this is not a new quest that only started with the creation of Family Home Evening groups in Rexburg.&nbsp; No, this has been one of the fundamental pursuits of humankind down through the ages of time. &nbsp;One of the greatest intellectual minds the Western world has ever known once said, "Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; That was Aristotle, but note how presciently his statement parallels that of the Prophet Joseph--almost the exact phrasing.&nbsp; In those opening lines of the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson immortalized both our personal and political quests by forever linking (at least in America) the three great inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&nbsp; But notice in that magnificent troika it is not happiness that is a right (like life and liberty), but specifically the&nbsp;<em>pursuit</em>&nbsp;of happiness.<br /><br />So how do we "pursue" happiness, especially when we are young and inexperienced, maybe a little fearful, and life lies ahead of us as a challenging mountain to climb?&nbsp; Well, we know one thing for sure: happiness is not easy to find running straight for it.&nbsp; It is usually too elusive, too ephemeral, too subtle.&nbsp; If you haven't learned it already, you will learn in the years ahead that most times happiness comes to us when we least expect it, when we are busy doing something else.&nbsp; Happiness is almost always a by-product of some other endeavor.&nbsp; One of my favorite writers from my university days said, "Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; This is one of those great gospel ironies that often don't seem to make sense, like "the last shall be first" and "lose your life to find it."&nbsp; The gospel is filled with such ironies and indirections, and I think the pursuit of happiness is one of them.&nbsp; So how do we optimize our chance for happiness without pursuing it so directly that we miss it?&nbsp; Let me go to a most remarkable book for some answers.<br /><br />The first 30 years of Book of Mormon history do not present a pleasant story. &nbsp;After the abrupt necessity of abandoning their entire earthly fortune, leaving Jerusalem hastily on the eve of international conflict, crossing the Arabian peninsula in the most adverse of circumstances, building a boat without any prior experience in doing so, crossing an ocean with would-be fatal conflicts breaking out repeatedly and landing in a primitive, unknown new land with all the hardship such a settlement would entail, the hostility within the family of Lehi and Sariah became so intense that the two halves of their family split asunder, with one group fleeing yet farther into the wilderness, fearing for their lives lest they fall victim to the bloodthirsty quest of the other.&nbsp; As they plunged into unsettled terrain to seek safety and fashion a life for themselves as best they could, the prophet-leader of this Nephite half of the family says they now tried to live "after the manner of happiness."<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In light of what they had just been through for thirty years and with what we know yet lay in store for them in the trials almost constantly ahead, such a comment seems almost painful.&nbsp; How could any of this be described as anything remotely like "happiness"?&nbsp; Ah, my young Rexburg friends, there is the rub.&nbsp; Nephi does not say they were happy, though it is evident they actually were.&nbsp; What he says is, they "lived&nbsp;<em>after the manner of happiness</em>." &nbsp;Today I would have you understand that that there is a wonderful key in that phrase that can unlock precious blessings for you the rest of your life.<br /><br />I do not think God in his glory or the angels of heaven or the prophets on earth intend to make us happy all the time, every day in every way, given the testing and trial this earthly realm is intended to provide.&nbsp; As President James E. Faust once phrased it: "Happiness is not given to us in a package that we can just open up and consume.&nbsp; Nobody," he said, "is ever happy 24 hours a day, seven days a week."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; But my reassurance to you today is that in God's plan we can do very much to find the happiness we do desire.&nbsp; We can take certain steps, we can form certain habits, we can do certain things that God and history tell us lead to happiness with the confidence that&nbsp;<em>if we live in such a manner&nbsp;</em>that butterfly is much more likely to land upon our shoulder.&nbsp;<br /><br />In short your best chance for being happy is to do the things that happy people do. &nbsp;Live the way happy people live.&nbsp; Walk the path that happy people walk.&nbsp; And your chances to find joy in unexpected moments, to find peace in unexpected places, to find the help of angels when you didn't even know they knew you existed, improves exponentially.&nbsp; Here are at least a couple of ideas about how one might live "<em>after the manner of happiness</em>."<br />&nbsp;Above all else, ultimate happiness, true peace, and anything even remotely close to scriptural joy are found first, foremost, and forever in living the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Lots of other philosophies and systems of belief have been tried.&nbsp; Indeed it seems safe to say that virtually&nbsp;<em>every&nbsp;</em>other philosophy and system has been tried down through the centuries of history.&nbsp; But when the Apostle Thomas asked the Lord the question young people often ask today, "How can we know the way?" (and at your age in life that really translates, "How can we know the way to be happy?") Jesus gave the answer that rings from eternity to all eternity, "I am the way, the truth, and the life . . . And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do&nbsp;<em>it.</em>"<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What a promise!&nbsp; Live my way, live my truth, live my life--live in this manner that I am showing you and teaching you--and whatsoever you ask will be given, whatsoever you seek you will find, including happiness.&nbsp; Parts of the blessing may come soon, parts may come later, and parts may not come until heaven but they will come--all of them.&nbsp; What encouragement that is after a blue Monday or a sad Tuesday or a tearful Wednesday!&nbsp; And it is a promise the realization of which&nbsp;<em>cannot come any other way</em>&nbsp;than by devotion to eternal truth!<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;In the words of then newly ordained Elder David O. McKay just short of a full century ago, "[Unlike gratification or pleasure or some kind of thrill, true] happiness is found only along that well beaten [gospel] track,&nbsp;<em>narrow as it is, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [and] straight [as it is],</em>&nbsp;which leads to life eternal."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; So love God and each other, and be true to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Second, learn as quickly as you can that so much of your happiness is in your hands, not in events or circumstances or fortune or misfortune.&nbsp; That is part of what the battle for agency was over in the pre-mortal councils of heaven.&nbsp; We have choice, we have volition, we have agency, and we can choose if not happiness per se then we can choose to live after the manner of it.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln had plenty to be unhappy about in the most difficult administration a President of the United States has ever faced, but even he reflected that "folks are usually about as happy as they make up their minds to be."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; Happiness comes first by what comes into your head a long time before it comes into your hand.&nbsp; Joseph Smith was living "after the manner of happiness" in a very unhappy situation when he wrote from Liberty Jail to those on the outside who were also the victims of great injustice and persecution:<br /><br />"Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; . . .</p>
<p>"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly.&nbsp; That is not only good counsel against the modern plague of pornography, but it is counsel for all kinds of gospel thoughts, good thoughts, constructive thoughts, hopeful thoughts.&nbsp; Those faith-filled thoughts will alter how you see life's problems and how you find resolution to them.&nbsp; "The Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind,"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;the revelations say. &nbsp;Too often we have thought it was all up to the heart; it is not.&nbsp; God expects a willing mind in the quest for happiness and peace as well. &nbsp;Put your head into this.&nbsp; All of this takes effort.&nbsp; It is a battle but a battle for happiness that is worth waging. &nbsp;In her popular book of a year or so ago, Elizabeth Gilbert wrote:<br /><br />"Happiness is the consequence of personal effort.&nbsp; You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and . . . look for it.&nbsp; You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings.&nbsp; And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it.&nbsp; You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness . . ., to stay afloat on top of it."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I love that phrase of hers:&nbsp; "Participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; Don't be passive.&nbsp; Swim upward.&nbsp; Think and speak and act positively.&nbsp; That is what happy people do; that is one aspect of living after the manner of happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is another.&nbsp; In anticipation of giving this talk, I sat in my study for a long time trying to think if I had ever known a happy person who was unkind or unpleasant to be with.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; I couldn't think of one, not a single, solitary one.&nbsp; So learn this great truth early in life while you are at such a happy place as BYU-Idaho:&nbsp; You can never, worlds without end, build your happiness on someone else's unhappiness.&nbsp; Sometimes, maybe especially when we are young and insecure and trying to make our way up in the world, we think if we can tear someone else down a little, it will somehow miraculously lift us up.&nbsp; That is what bullying is.&nbsp; That is what catty remarks are.&nbsp; That is what arrogance and superficiality and exclusiveness are.&nbsp; Perhaps we think if we are negative enough, or cynical enough, or just plain mean enough, then expectations won't be too high; we can keep everyone down to a flaw-filled level and therefore our flaws won't be so glaring.&nbsp;<br /><br />Happy people aren't negative or cynical or mean so don't plan on that being part of the "manner" of happiness. &nbsp;If my life has taught me anything, it is that kindness and pleasantness and faith-based optimism are characteristics of happy people.&nbsp; From the words of Mother Teresa, "Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier.&nbsp; Be the living expression of God's kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>A related step along the path toward happiness is to avoid animosity, contention, and anger in your life.&nbsp; Remember it is Lucifer, Satan, the adversary of us all who loves anger.&nbsp; He is "the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; After quoting that verse in general conference a few years ago, Elder Lynn Robbins said,&nbsp; "[That] verb&nbsp;<em>stir</em>&nbsp;sounds like a recipe for disaster:&nbsp; Put tempers on medium heat, stir in a few choice words, and bring to a boil; continue stirring until thick; cool off; let feelings chill for several days; serve cold; lots of leftovers."&nbsp; "Lots of leftovers" indeed.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Anger damages or destroys almost everything it touches. &nbsp;As someone has said, to harbor anger is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.&nbsp; It is a vicious acid that will destroy the container long before it does damage to the intended object. &nbsp;There is nothing in it or its cousinly vices--violence, rage, bitterness and hate--that has anything to do with living the gospel or the pursuit of happiness. &nbsp;I do not think that anger can exist--or at least can be fostered and entertained and indulged in--in a life being lived "after the manner of happiness."&nbsp;<br /><br />One last suggestion when there are so many others we should consider; that original verse from Nephi said that in an effort to find happiness in their new land after their 30 years of trouble "I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp; By contrast those from whom they fled "became an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you want to be happy this year in school, or on a mission, or in a marriage--work at it.&nbsp; Learn to work.&nbsp; Serve diligently.&nbsp; Don't be idle and mischievous.&nbsp; A homespun definition of Christ-like character might be the integrity to do the right thing at the right time in the right way.&nbsp; And the right thing for you to do at BYU-I this year is study.&nbsp; This is a year of education paid for by you, by your parents, and by the tithe payers of this Church.&nbsp; So don't be idle.&nbsp; Don't be wasteful.&nbsp; Do the right thing at the right time.&nbsp; "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp; "Be industrious and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. labor, including laboring for and serving others, one of the truly great keys to true happiness."<br /><br />Now, let me close by citing again Alma's straightforward counsel to Corianton:<br /><br />With all the encouragement a father would want to give a son or daughter, he said that in the resurrection the faithful are raised to a state of "endless happiness" wherein they "inherit the kingdom of God."<sup>19&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;At that time, he said, we will be "raised to happiness according to [our] desires of happiness."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; But he also sternly cautions: "Do not suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that [without repentance] ye shall be restored from sin to happiness.&nbsp; Behold, I say unto you,&nbsp;<em>wickedness never was happiness.</em>"<sup>21</sup>&nbsp; Sin is the antithesis of "living after the manner of happiness."&nbsp; Indeed those who believe otherwise, Alma says, "are without God in the world, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><em>A state contrary to the nature of happiness.</em>&nbsp; That is the worst state I can imagine to live in.&nbsp; As a new school year begins I welcome you from the state of Idaho or Wyoming or Arizona or California.&nbsp; I welcome you from any state in the union or any state on the planet.&nbsp; I invite you to rejoice in any state you have ever been in except the "state contrary to the nature of happiness."&nbsp; I ask you to reject transgression in order to live consistent with the nature of God, which is the nature of true happiness.&nbsp; I encourage you and applaud you in "pursuing the path that leads to it."&nbsp; You can't find it any other way.<br /><br />My testimony to you is that God, your Eternal Father in heaven, is always encouraging and applauding your pursuit even more lovingly than I.&nbsp; I testify that He wants you to be happy, to have true joy.&nbsp; I testify of the Atonement of His Only Begotten Son which provides the right path and, if necessary, a new start on it, a second chance, a change in our nature if necessary.&nbsp; In the power and authority of my office I leave an apostolic blessing on each of you that you will know that Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life"<sup>23</sup>--that no one comes to true happiness except by Him.&nbsp; I bless you to know that someday, sometime, somewhere you will have every righteous desire of your heart as you live the gospel of Jesus Christ, thus living "after the manner" that leads to those blessings.&nbsp; I testify and I bless you in the name of Him who is the Good Shepherd, the Chief Cornerstone of this Church, the High Priest of good things to come in your life, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Vice President, BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Garth V. Hall was called to serve as president of the Florida Orlando Mission from 2010-2013. Prior to his call as mission president, Brother Hall served as a bishop twice, in a number of high councils, a number of bishoprics, as a youth leader and advisor. At the present time he and his wife, Sharon, serve in the YSA 1<sup>st</sup> ward.<br /><br />Brother Hall is a native of Salt Lake City, Utah. He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Utah State University and received his doctorate from BYU.<br /><br />After completing his education, Brother Hall coached college football for 24 years at six different universities. He was named the Athletic Director at Ricks College in 1997 and served as a Vice President at BYU-Idaho from 2001-2010.<br /><br />Brother Hall and his wife, Sharon&nbsp; are the parents of six children and they currently have 24 grandchildren.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a privilege for Sister Hall and me to be in your presence today and to be in this magnificent building. Four years ago, as we were preparing to leave BYU-Idaho for our mission. We asked Wayne Clark to arrange a tour for us of this building. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time it had not been completed. They were just beginning to install the seating. For me this experience of seeing every inch of this building was impressive. &nbsp;But it was also personally significant. I knew after my mission I would not return to BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;My time here was completed. I had been here to personally experience the announcement that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho. As was mentioned, I served in administration where I was permitted to see the fulfillment of prophecy daily as we experienced the transition to BYU-Idaho. The completion of the BYU-I center represented the completion of foundational phase or transition of Ricks College to this great teaching institution. BYU-Idaho serves the young people of this Church as a Disciple Training Center.<br /><br />In reflection, our family, our time at BYU-Idaho, and our mission has been the greatest experiences of our lives.&nbsp;As was mentioned in the introduction, Sister Hall and I served in the Florida Orlando Mission. While we were gone our grandchildren would tell their friends that their grandpa was the Mission President of Disney World. We came to love the many different people there. We cherish our relationship with the great stake and ward leaders that we served with and we really learned to love palm trees. Most importantly, we became eternally connected with 617 faithful dedicated missionaries. Many of them are here today.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my final interview with the missionaries, I would ask where they would continue their schooling when they returned home. If they were unsure I would tell them "I have the perfect school for you." I would remind them that they were Florida Orlando missionaries and to be sure to select the Spring/Fall track when applying.<br /><br />When we returned home parents and priesthood leaders would often ask us how to better prepare youth for missionary service. In the Florida Orlando Mission we tried to be focused on being a&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>&nbsp;mission. But in addition to&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>&nbsp;I developed a list of things that I think help prepare young people for missionary service.<br /><br />Eight Principles in Preparing Young People for Missionary Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you read this list may I suggest that these principles will strengthen you wherever you serve in the kingdom.&nbsp;I would like to focus my remarks today on the fourth principle on this list - To Understand and Recognize Priesthood Keys.&nbsp;To better understand the Priesthood let us review some doctrine and principles.</p>
<p><strong>Priesthood is the Power of God.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>"The priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God. Through the priesthood God created the heavens and the earth.&nbsp; By this power the universe is kept in perfect order. Through this power God accomplishes "His work and Glory" to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39)." (<em>Gospel Principles&nbsp;</em>PG 67)</p>
<p><strong>The priesthood has been delegated to man to act for the salvation of the human family.</strong></p>
<p>The Priesthood is the power that blesses all of God's children, men, women and children.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our Heavenly Father delegates His priesthood power to worthy male members of the church. The priesthood enables them to act in God's name for the salvation of the human family. Through it they can be authorized to preach the gospel, administer the ordinances of salvation and govern God's kingdom on earth." (<em>Gospel Principles&nbsp;</em>PG 67)</p>
<p>Let me read from&nbsp;<em>True to the Faith</em><em>:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>"The most important exercise of the priesthood takes place in the family. Each husband and father should strive to be worthy to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. With his wife as an equal partner, he presides in righteousness and love. Serving as the family's spiritual leader he works with his wife to teach the children and help them prepare to receive the ordinances of salvation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Many members do not have faithful Melchizedek Priesthood holders in their homes. However, through the service of home teachers and priesthood leaders all members of the Church can enjoy the blessings of priesthood power in their lives." (<em>True to the Faith&nbsp;</em>pg 125)</p>
<p><strong>Priesthood holders who have priesthood keys govern priesthood authority.</strong></p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"ultimately, all the keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord Jesus Christ, whose priesthood it is.&nbsp; He is the one who determines what keys are delegated to mortals and how those keys will be used." (<em>Ensign,&nbsp;</em>May 2014, pg 50 "The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood")</p>
<p>"Priesthood keys are the authority God has given to priesthood holders to direct control and govern the use of his priesthood on earth." (<em>Church Handbook 2</em>, "Administering the Church", 2.1.1)</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The president of the church holds the keys over all the church.&nbsp; In him is concentrated the power of the priesthood. He holds all the keys of every nature pertaining to the dispensation of the fullness of times. All the keys of former dispensations, which have been revealed, are vested in him." ("Priesthood Restoration of Keys,&nbsp;<em>Deseret News,&nbsp;</em>September 16, 1933, Church Section 4.)</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Ballard explained:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who hold priesthood keys literally make it possible for all those who serve faithfully under their direction to exercise priesthood authority and have access to priesthood power." ("Men and Women in The Work of the Lord",&nbsp;<em>New Era,&nbsp;</em>April 2014, 4.)</p>
<p><strong>Everything done under the direction of priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In Doctrine and Covenants 107:5 it says that "all other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood", speaking of the Melchizedek priesthood.</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught about priesthood authority in the last General Conference. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We are not accustomed to speaking of women having authority of the priesthood in their callings but what authority can it be when a woman young or old is set apart to preach the gospel as a full time missionary. She is given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. The same is true when a woman is set apart to function as an officer or teacher in a church organization under the direction of one who holds the keys of the priesthood. Whoever functions in an office or call received from one who holds priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority."&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Ensign,&nbsp;</em>May 2014, pg 51. "The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood")</p>
<p><strong>Priesthood power results from authorization by priesthood keys and fulfilling those responsibilities with &nbsp;principles of righteousness.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We read in Doctrine and Covenants section 121:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;&nbsp;"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by&nbsp;the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly;"</p>
<p>And then the promise when we develop these principles in our relationships as we carry out our callings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever."</p>
<p>I find it interesting that these principles of righteousness seem to describe the nature of our sisters more than most men.&nbsp; Men seem to have to work harder to develop these characteristics.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of one of the classes Sister Hall and I taught at&nbsp;Institute, one of our wonderful students used this analogy to clear some&nbsp;confusion in the class over priesthood, priesthood keys, priesthood&nbsp;authority and priesthood power.&nbsp;He likened this process to a light fixture.The light bulb&nbsp;represents the priesthood or a calling by the priesthood. The light switch&nbsp;represents the keys of the priesthood. The electricity is priesthood&nbsp;authority and finally the light from the light bulb represents the power&nbsp;of the priesthood.<br /><br />So one holding the keys of the priesthood flips the switch and authorizes someone by their call to function with priesthood authority.&nbsp; If this authority is used righteously it produces priesthood power or the light in fulfilling their responsibilities. I took the liberty to expand this analogy. If all of the things we just mentioned happen but the light is not tightly secured in the socket or the filament is damaged it will never produce light or priesthood power. The light bulb must be secured tightly to the principles of righteousness. A filament that has been damaged because of unworthiness must be repaired through repentance before it can illuminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share with you three principles of priesthood keys that&nbsp;bless our lives. Hopefully, these principles will help you in recognizing&nbsp;and respecting&nbsp; priesthood keys.<br /><br /><strong>Principle 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Priesthood keys not only govern God's work but also express His love for His children individually.<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When we returned home from our mission I had a friend ask if I was&nbsp;able to have a personal relationship with each of my missionaries.&nbsp; With&nbsp;230 missionaries in the mission it was impossible to spend the time you&nbsp;would like with each individual missionary. &nbsp;Before entering the MTC,&nbsp;like most mission presidents I was determined to be as prepared as&nbsp;possible to efficiently interview the missionaries. Knowing that time&nbsp;would be limited, I prepared a list of questions that I could ask in&nbsp;interviews to really get to know the missionaries.<br /><br />I worked hard and had my questions ready. The day after we arrived in the mission field we had thirteen new missionaries arrive. After a welcome dinner, I took the first missionary into the office for their initial interview. I started with my questions to guide our conversation.&nbsp; About three minutes into the interview something happened. A spiritual feeling came over me; I knew this missionary as well as I had ever known anyone. I had a deep feeling of love for them. That love I can only describe as the kind of the love I have for my own children. I recognized their strengths, weaknesses and more importantly their potential. I had similar experiences with the other twelve missionaries that night. This same thing happened each time I interviewed our missionaries. I came to understand one of the powers of priesthood keys is to convey God's love and His personal concern for His children. I would later try to express this by saying, priesthood keys allow you to think things you wouldn't normally think, to see things you wouldn't normally see, to say things you wouldn't normally say, and to feel things you wouldn't normally feel. That was my experience everyday of my mission. No wonder those missionaries became like our own sons and daughters. I related more with the Book of Mormon account of Helaman describing those valiant young men he served with as his sons.<br /><br /><strong>Principle 2:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Different priesthood keys must be aligned with each other and work in unity and harmony.<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Learned as we visited the wards and stakes in our mission, members and leaders were excited about doing their part in missionary work.&nbsp; Most of them would ask what can we do for your missionaries? This often translated into meals, transportation, and joining them in a few lessons with investigators. As important as these things are, there are more important things members need to be involved in.&nbsp; If you search the handbooks of the Church you will learn that the primary work of members in missionary work as directed by the keys of the Stake President is to find and prepare people to be taught by the missionaries. The primary role of the missionaries, directed by the keys of the mission president, is to teach and prepare investigators to be baptized. It is then the responsibility of the members as directed by the keys of the stake president and the bishop to fellowship converts, give them a calling and help them be accepted into their ward family.<br /><br />So the mission president really should be the one asking the question to ward and stake leaders what can we as missionaries do to help you fulfill your missionary responsibilities?<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar taught some important principles of priesthood keys working together to mission presidents in 2012.&nbsp;He taught there is a difference between the keys for missionary work and keys for the work of missionaries. The stake president has the keys to direct missionary work in his stake. The mission president has the keys for the work of the missionaries in teaching and preparing investigators to be baptized.&nbsp;The same principle applies to temple presidents. The temple president does not hold the keys for temple work. He holds the keys for the work in the temple. The stake president holds the keys for temple work in his stake.<br /><br />Elder Bednar concluded his teaching with these two valuable&nbsp;principles:</p>
<p>I learned when the priesthood keys directing members and full time missionaries worked together appropriately the results were powerful.</p>
<p>To illustrate consider these statistics. In our mission if the missionaries found an investigator on their own, usually by tracting, they had around a 10% chance of baptizing them. If members gave a name of someone they knew or "tell them we sent you" the missionaries had a 25% chance of baptizing them. But, if members had worked with neighbors and friends and invited them to listen to the missionaries in their home there was over a 90% chance they would be baptized.</p>
<p>There are some things behind those statistics that are just plain common sense. &nbsp;But most importantly, those statistics are evidence of the power of heaven that results when God's work is done in priesthood order.&nbsp;In working with less active members missionaries that understood priesthood keys would go to the bishop and ask which members he wanted them to work with.&nbsp;When a bishop said just go visit anyone in the ward, we had limited success.&nbsp; But when a bishop had discussed it in ward council, prayed and then gave the missionaries a list of names we were almost 100% successful.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Priesthood keys are essential in the repentance process for serious sin.<br /><br /></strong>Unfortunately, there are a few missionaries that come into the mission that have not fully repented of serious sins.&nbsp; We all know the pressures to go on a mission. Sometimes the embarrassment and guilt of serious sin causes some young people to make a very poor decision. The decision that they will take care of their repentance themselves or worse deny them when confronted by priesthood leaders in worthiness interviews.</p>
<p>They come into the mission field burdened with sin. As they are asked to represent the Lord Jesus Christ and teach the gospel of repentance they are finally brought to their knees in humility.&nbsp; They seek relief--they seek forgiveness--they seek to become clean so they can be a worthy representative of the Savior.<br /><br />I would share with you that the mission field is not the best place for missionaries to repent of serious sin. &nbsp;Many are asked to return home to take care of their repentance and put their lives in order by working with priesthood leaders who hold keys that direct their repentance process.<br /><br />I remember years ago a young woman who had committed a very serious sin. Because of the anticipated public scorn, it was decided to take care of this as a family matter. The thought was to go to the bishop but he was not someone they identified with or felt comfortable with. Without really knowing it they declined the power and blessings of the keys of the priesthood that would have guided and directed her through this difficult process. Now years later not one of this sister's children or grandchildren have the blessings of the gospel in their lives.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion: The Restoration of Priesthood Keys<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In 1820, a fourteen-year old boy possessing great faith knelt down in prayer to ask God which of all the churches was true. This simple act of faith ushered in the dispensation of the fullness of times. Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. Through him the fullness of the gospel and the doctrines of salvation were restored. This work of the final dispensation could only be completely established and carried out through priesthood authority and priesthood keys.<br /><br />First, in May 1829 after inquiring concerning baptism, John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdry and bestowed the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood. A short time later, Peter, James and John bestowed the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood by virtue of which the Church was organized in 1830.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is interesting that shortly after the Church was organized the Lord commanded the saints to build a house in His name. The saints not knowing the urgency of the Lord's mandate did not immediately go to work on the temple in Kirkland. Six months later as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants Section 95, we read the Lord's rebuke:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For ye have sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things, that I have &nbsp;given unto you concerning the building of mine house;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh"</p>
<p>The saints responded and went to work with what little they possessed to erect a house to the Lord. And for what purpose? It was a holy sanctuary where Jesus Christ could visit His people and where he could send His servants, holy prophets, to commit the keys that would direct the work of God in these last days.</p>
<p>One week after the dedication of the Kirkland Temple we read in Doctrine and Covenants 110.&nbsp; Christ appeared to Joseph and Oliver after they had retired to the pulpit after Easter Services. He accepted His House.&nbsp;Next Moses appeared and gave to Joseph and Oliver the keys of the gathering of Israel.&nbsp;After Moses, Elias came and conferred his keys and brought the gospel and the promises made to father Abraham&nbsp;Next Elijah the Prophet who held the sealing power bestowed that power, or the power to use the priesthood to bind on earth and seal in heaven.&nbsp;The Lord concludes this revelation by saying to Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed unto your hands".&nbsp; Joseph Smith stands at the head of this final dispensation. The Prophets prophet .....As we sing in the hymn "Praise to the Man", "Great is his glory and endless his priesthood, ever and ever the keys he will hold. . . "</p>
<p>Priesthood and priesthood keys are essential in the true and living Church. May we better understand the priesthood, priesthood keys, priesthood authority and priesthood power. May we respect and honor the priesthood and the keys that control its power as we assist to move this great work forward as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We are blessed to live in the dispensation of the fullness of times; this day has been foretold and looked forward to by all the ancient prophets.&nbsp; All the keys of their dispensations have been restored through Joseph Smith to the earth.<br /><br />Those keys have been transferred from prophet to prophet until this day of President Thomas S. Monson. He holds all of the keys and is the only one authorized to dispense or delegate their use. That authority comes through the organization of the Lord's Church to those chosen by the keys of revelation to accomplish God's work on earth.&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>What an incredible experience it has been preparing what I believe the Lord would have me share with you today! And because you raised your scriptures and/or other note-taking devices, as is our tradition, you have indicated you are prepared to hear what the Holy Ghost will teach you. So I trust His Spirit will be with us, and I pray that we will be edified.</p>
<p>To illustrate my message, I'll begin by sharing two experiences.<br /><br /><strong>First Experience:</strong><strong><br /></strong>Not too long ago, I was in downtown Seattle for some meetings. As soon as I got to my hotel room, I walked to the large windows to see what kind of view I had. At first, I was disappointed that all I saw was the drab roof of the building below me. But as I looked up I noticed a historical building with unique architecture, another very modern building with lots of reflective windows, and the tops of other buildings bordered by a beautiful blue sky and a few fluffy clouds.<br /><br />As I enjoyed the scene I had discovered, I glanced back down and was struck by how my first assessment of the view from that window represented our unfortunate tendency to keep our heads down and our eyes focused on an unpleasant perspective rather than keep our chins up so we can take in the beauty of what our Heavenly Father offers us. I also realized how it related to what I had been preparing to talk about today.<br /><br />After teaching his son, Helaman, and giving him inspiring counsel, Alma said, "And now, my son...see that ye look to God and live" (Alma 37:47). I love that simple but powerful statement. And wouldn't it be wise for each of us to listen to this counsel, and despite any distractions, "look to God and live?"<br /><br /><strong>Second Experience:</strong><strong><br /></strong>Right after I returned from serving in the New York Rochester Mission, I was called and assigned to teach the eight-year-olds in Primary. One Sunday, to emphasize the need for us to let go of our burdens and specifically to not hold onto sin, I began taking rocks out of every one of my suit pockets and lining them up on the tray of the chalkboard.&nbsp;<br /><br />After they saw the first few rocks, they began to giggle and ask why I had them in my pockets and if I had carried them all through church. Once they were all lined up, I said to them, "Carrying all these rocks in my pockets is as silly as not allowing Jesus to lift our burdens."<br /><br />I don't know if any of them remember that object lesson, but I have thought of it often since then. Isn't it foolish for us to make this life more difficult than it already is by choosing to carry around extra burdens that the Lord will so willingly take from us? In Hebrews 12:1-2, Paul says, "Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us.... Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;faith."<br /><br />One sin that weighs us down and can keep us from the beautiful perspective there is to be had in life is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;obeying the commandment to forgive. The Lord says, in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 64:8-9, "Ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin."<br /><br />We stand condemned for the sin of unforgiveness when we choose to keep our eyes focused on what is ugly and below us (or behind us) and hold onto this unnecessary burden, which can easily overwhelm us. On the other hand, by forgiving, we can lighten our load and allow ourselves to feel the grace of God more fully in our souls.<br /><br />So let's consider first,&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;it means to forgive; second,&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we must forgive; third,&nbsp;<em>whom</em>&nbsp;we should forgive; and finally&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to forgive.<br /><br /><strong>What is Forgiveness?&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong>According to the Gospel Topics page of lds.org, the divine attribute of forgiveness is "to pardon or excuse someone from blame for an offense or misdeed." Other definitions include no longer feeling anger, resentment, or vengefulness toward someone. At the same time, ultimate and Christ-like forgiveness includes reaching the point of having charity toward everyone, even those who have personally hurt us. But for many of us, forgiveness is not always black-and-white. Forgiving others tends to be a process.<br /><br />To help our understanding of its meaning, forgiveness is not the same as condoning what has been done to us, excusing bad behavior, or allowing proper or legal consequences to be avoided. Sometimes, especially early along the path of forgiveness, it also does not include forgetting the incident or embracing the wrongdoer.<br /><br /><strong>Why Should We Forgive?<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>1) It is a commandment:</strong><strong><br /></strong>Why<strong>&nbsp;</strong>do we need to forgive? First of all, it is a commandment. As obedient children of God, we forgive one another. Paul said to the Colossians:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;ye. (Colossians 3:12-13)</p>
<p><strong>2) It allows us to be forgiven:<br /></strong>Forgiving others also allows us to be forgiven. We are told in Matthew 6:14-15 that "if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."</p>
<p><strong>3) It protects us from&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;sins:</strong><strong><br /></strong>Having an attitude of forgiveness can also protect us from the pitfalls of&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;sins. I wonder, for example, if choosing to not forgive can allow us to feel like victims or like someone who does not deserve hardship. This line of thinking can tie us into the beginning stages of pride, vanity, covetousness, or entitlement.<br /><br />Consider these questions: Do we compare our problems to others and allow ourselves to wonder why some people seem to have it so easy? On the other hand, do we sometimes wonder why some people&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;they have it so hard, when from our perspective their problems obviously pale in comparison to our own? Comparing our capacity to bear burdens and judging others is unfair and unenlightened.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is by Neal A. Maxwell:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Among the reasons for not comparing crosses is the fact that, first, we know so little about the weight of crosses and, second, we know even less about the bearing capacity of their owners. Someone who stumbles with seemingly little weight in one thing may have superb capacity for shouldering certain larger tasks. Whenever we think ourselves to be "above all that," we should recall that we are being tutored by Him who "descended below them all" (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 122:8). (Neal A. Maxwell,<em>&nbsp;We Will Prove Them Herewith</em>, Jan. 1982, 70-71.)</p>
<p><strong>4) It helps us to heal:<br /></strong>To our benefit, forgiving others can also free us from burden. Spiritual leaders and psychologists alike say that forgiving is an important part of healing. H. Burke Peterson compared unforgiveness to poison. He said, "The poison of revenge, or of unforgiving thoughts or attitudes, unless removed, will destroy the soul in which it is harbored" (H. Burke Peterson, "Removing the Poison of an Unforgiving Spirit,"&nbsp;<em>Conference Report</em>, Oct. 1983).</p>
<p>We forgive because doing so is a commandment; it welcomes our own forgiveness; it keeps us from falling into other sin; and it helps in our healing.</p>
<p><strong>Whom Do We Need to Forgive?</strong><strong><br /></strong>But whom do we need to forgive? Doctrine &amp; Covenants 64:10 says, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men [and women]."<br /><br /><strong>1) We must be forgiving of everyone:</strong><strong><br /></strong>So let's first consider what it means to forgive all men and women, generally. To be a forgiving person, we have a sensitive, empathetic, and charitable heart toward everyone around us. We look at others the way Jesus sees us all.<br /><br />Not long ago, from this same pulpit, our university president, Kim B. Clark, said that after being cut off on the roads many times while driving, he concluded he would be much better off just deciding that the person in the other car must be having a heart attack--or a baby--and that they must be focused on&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;concern as they so carelessly rush to what must be the hospital.<br /><br />My version of that same perspective is that when someone around me makes any form of unkind or careless gesture, I think,&nbsp;<em>How terrible is their day--or their life--that they would be so inconsiderate or that they would be so quick to lose their temper?</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em>We are all on a journey of perfection, yet far from it. You and I have our shortcomings, and we should be grateful others are willing to overlook ours. Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So long as mortality exists we live and work with imperfect people; and there will be misunderstandings, offenses, and injuries to sensitive feelings. The best of motives are often misunderstood. It is gratifying to find many who, in their bigness of soul have straightened out their thinking, swallowed their pride, forgiven what they had felt were personal slights. (Spencer W. Kimball,<em>Conference Report</em>, Apr. 1955, 98)</p>
<p>One thing I have learned in my years as a bishop is that everyone has burdens. Whether we have sickness in our own hearts&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;our hearts ache for someone we love who is suffering, each one of us has pain in our lives and needs the charity Jesus has taught us to have as His disciples. The essence of the gospel is to love one another as He loves us. I believe that means when we look around, we see in every face a child of God who deserves to be loved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you will receive this next example as reverently as I intend it to be. Often as I am in any group of people, like today, this is how I see the crowd. Imagine with me that: he just failed a test; she just learned her mother has cancer; she feels her roommates don't like her; he wonders if God hears his prayers; she just had a fight with her brother; his fianc&eacute; just broke up with him; he is terribly homesick; and she is struggling with repentance. We could go on, but you get the idea.<br /><br />When I look at any gathering, I really do see my brothers and sisters--individuals whom God loves and whom I love--men and women who certainly have hurt in their lives and who deserve my respect and immediate forgiveness, if necessary. As the children's Primary song says, "Jesus said love everyone; Treat them kindly too. When your heart is filled with love, others will love you" ("Jesus Said Love Everyone,"<em>Children's Songbook</em>, 61).<br /><br /><strong>2) We must forgive those who have hurt us:</strong><strong><br /></strong>But what about those who have hurt us directly and in personal ways? We are also required to forgive them. This does not&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;mean we have to forget the wrongdoing. To forget is a gift that can take time. And like the present but fading scars our own sins can leave, sometimes remembering what has been done to us can protect us from further harm.<br /><br />I have learned that while it is certainly ideal to completely forgive someone without hesitation, there are degrees of forgiveness for many of us. It can be a long series of steps; and that's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as we are on a good path of healing and harmony. Spencer W. Kimball taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To be in the right we must forgive, and we must do so without regard to whether or not our antagonist repents, or how sincere is his transformation, or whether or not he asks our forgiveness. We must follow the example and the teaching of the Master, who said: "Ye ought to say in your hearts--let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds" (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 64:11). (Spencer W. Kimball,&nbsp;<em>The Miracle of Forgiveness</em>, Jan. 1969,&nbsp;<em>283</em>)</p>
<p>As with all of the teachings of Jesus, He shows us the way. He teaches us, for example, in the parable of the Prodigal Son that the father ran to his estranged and wayward son, embraced him, and threw a feast for him. For me, this parable is about the reaction our loving Father in Heaven has for us when we turn from sin and come unto Him. He is the Father and the perfect example.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament we read that even after all the trials Joseph had endured from the time his brothers left him in a pit to be sold into slavery, he forgave them. When they were reunited:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. (Genesis 45:4-5)</p>
<p>I strive for that kind of forgiveness and perspective, but I have found that as a mortal work-in-progress, and with energy already spread thin, I am not always able to be this quick to forgive. However, like the Prodigal Son's father and like Joseph, I know we can do as Jesus taught when He said to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. (Matthew 5:44)</p>
<p><strong>3) We must forgive ourselves:<br /></strong>I want to also touch briefly on the tendency we sometimes have of not forgiving ourselves. Shouldn't we include ourselves among all men and women the Lord has told us we ought to forgive? But for various reasons, even those of us who are&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;forgiving of others choose to carry "rocks in their pockets" and not let go of bad choices they have made.</p>
<p>I have observed that guilt can come from the Holy Ghost to guide us away from something evil. However, Satan can counterfeit those feelings. He can make us feel guilty to the point of doubting God's love for us as His sons and daughters. We can know the difference by considering the direction our guilty feelings prompt us to go.<br /><br />For example, if our feelings cause us to faithfully walk toward God, humbly depending on Him and knowing He loves us and wants our success, they are from the Holy Spirit. But if we are hiding from God and believing the lies that we are worthless, dirty, and past hope, we should recognize the evil source and instead, "look to God and live."<br /><br />I have witnessed individuals struggle with two very sacred experiences in their efforts to find forgiveness. One is knowing when it is appropriate to again partake of the sacrament, and the second is knowing when it is appropriate to return to the temple. We should do neither unworthily; however, at some point we&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;the comfort, cleansing, peace, and power that can come from both. Through a desperate desire and sincerely seeking counsel from the Lord, our bishop, and others we trust, we will be blessed with discernment and guidance in these vital decisions.<br /><br />Now, I submit that if we still hold onto guilt for any large or small sin without forgiving ourselves, even&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing all that is necessary to repent of that sin, we in essence deny God's role and power. If&nbsp;<em>God</em>&nbsp;loves us unconditionally and is willing to forgive us, why would we think we are smarter or better than Him by not doing the same? Why would we question His judgment?<br /><br /><strong>4) We must forgive God:</strong><strong><br /></strong>As a final thought about those we must forgive, sometimes we may become angry with God or resent Him for our challenges. While it is true He may sometimes present tests of our faith,&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;of the trials we encounter are actually consequences of our own choices or the choices of others. So in our effort to forgive everyone, are we sometimes unforgiving of God?<br /><br />Forgiving God may seem like a strange notion. Clearly a perfect God does not need our forgiveness. But if we revisit the definition of forgiveness as&nbsp;<em>excusing someone from blame</em>, don't we sometimes blame God for things that go wrong in our lives or hold a grudge against Him? We need to forgive God only in the sense that we should humble ourselves, let go of resentment, and instead have faith in Him.<br /><br />Rather than ignorantly pointing an accusatory finger at heaven, it is imperative, even central to our worship, that we accept His invitation to "learn of me" (Matthew 11:29, Doctrine and Covenants 19:23, 32:1) and seek to understand our proper relationship with God. As we do so, we should not be casual in developing a balance between familiarity with and reverence for our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br /><br />We know Heavenly Father is our Father, and He calls us His sons and daughters; but we also worship Him. We know Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother, and He calls us His friends; but He is also our Savior, our Advocate with the Father, and our King. Although "His hand is stretched out still" (Isaiah 5:25 [2Nephi15:25]), it for us to fall at His feet. While we may fondly imagine a warm embrace at the end of this life, it is for us to be invited by Him into His arms. This is a more proper respect for and understanding of Whom we worship.<br /><br />As I have carefully considered an appropriate relationship with deity, I am in awe. My learned testimony of God is that He is 1) all loving, 2) omniscient, 3) perfectly just, and 4) omnipotent. Because of this combination of godly characteristics, I know that everything will be okay in the end.<br /><br />Because understanding these things helps me look up to God and remove the rocks from my own pockets, I'll briefly expand upon each aspect of this testimony.<br /><br />First: God does love us unconditionally. We must not make the mistake of measuring His actual love by how unloved we may feel at times. No matter whom we&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;we are or what we have done, we are His children, and He loves us perfectly. We may disappoint Him, but His greatest desire is that we return home to Him. If we come to Him with a truly repentant heart, He will always forgive us.<br /><br />Second: God knows everything about everything, including our potential. We can trust that He will only allow us to endure what is necessary to strengthen us through experience so we can become like Him. We have to trust His timing and ultimate answers to our prayers. When I don't understand something, I remind myself that&nbsp;<em>He</em>&nbsp;does.<br /><br />Third: While I believe God is perfectly just, that doesn't mean I believe&nbsp;<em>life</em>&nbsp;is fair. We see what we would deem unfairness all around us. A very important reality is that by earthly standards, good people aren't always the most blessed&nbsp;<em>in this life</em>, and bad people aren't always fully punished&nbsp;<em>in this life</em>. He will judge each of us according to our actions&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the intent of our hearts. The key is that I know the Lord is a just judge, and He will make all things right at His&nbsp;<em>final</em>&nbsp;judgment.<br /><br />Fourth: No matter what, God is in charge. He is the God of all creation. He knows and controls the balance and harmony of the universe; so we have to trust that He will change a situation if it will truly benefit us in the end. Even when something seems unfair, God knows what is needful. But, just because He is all-powerful and occasionally places some challenges in our way, doesn't mean He makes&nbsp;<em>everything</em>happen. He can save us from evil, but He will not necessarily save us from the consequences of our choices or even the choices of others. That would go against His grand gift of agency.<br /><br />God is so good to us; and He has offered so much to us, especially through the Atonement, which can make up for our limited capacities. If we will simply look to Him and trust Him, rather than blame Him, our perspective will change, and the Lord will help us with all our other relationships and related struggles. It is our choice to embrace and enjoy the good in this world through&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of life's ups and downs.<br /><br /><strong>How Do We Forgive?</strong><strong><br /></strong>So after considering what forgiveness is (and is not), why we must forgive, and all of those we should forgive,&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;do we go about forgiving?<br /><br />There are wonderful, specific, and practical tools to be learned from a little study online, from books, and from working with our bishop or with a trained counselor; but at the center of our efforts to forgive should be what I shared at the beginning of my message today. We must look to God in faith and let go of the unnecessary burden we put on our own backs if we unforgivingly cling to pain, resentment, or worse. To borrow a phrase from our fellow Christian brothers and sisters, we should, "Let go and let God."<br /><br />We can forgive by unloading the rocks from our pockets as we allow those we perceive to have wronged us to work out their&nbsp;<em>own</em>&nbsp;salvation with the Savior. Their forgiveness really is between them and the Lord. So we should let them wrestle through their own repentance, and instead perhaps repent of judging them ourselves.<br /><br />In Luke 6:41 we read, "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" Just imagine what the world would be like if everyone followed this gospel teaching and was careful to first be concerned with their own hearts, along with their treatment of others. Spencer W. Kimball proposed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we would sue for peace, taking the initiative in settling differences--if we would forgive and forget with all our hearts--if we would cleanse our own souls of sin, bitterness, and guilt before we cast a stone or accusation at others--if we would forgive all real or fancied offenses before we asked forgiveness for our own sins--if we would pay our own debts, large or small, before we pressed our debtors--if we would manage to clear our own eyes of the blinding beams before we magnified the motes in the eyes of others--what a glorious world this would be! (<em>Faith Precedes the Miracle</em>, Spencer W. Kimball,195-96).</p>
<p>The Lord knows our hearts; he knows our intentions and our potential, just as He knows the same things about those who may have hurt us. We can forgive by understanding God's role in our lives and by letting Him be the eternal keeper of justice while we focus our energies on loving Him and loving our neighbor. On a number of occasions, Gordon B. Hinckley said variations of the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">May God help us to be a little kinder, showing forth greater forbearance, to be more forgiving, more willing to walk the second mile, to reach down and lift up those who may have sinned but have brought forth the fruits of repentance, to lay aside old grudges and nurture them no more. (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Forgiveness,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2005)</p>
<p>Remember my perspective from the hotel room window--how I first only saw what was dull and depressing below me. It would have been easy to limit myself to that view of things; but instead, I looked up. Forgiveness can be a matter of choosing to lift our sights, as we trust a loving God.</p>
<p>Remember the rocks I took from my pockets and placed along the chalkboard tray. Forgiveness can set our spirits free as we unload the burdens we have picked up along the way.<br /><br />Heavenly Father wants us to look to Him and have joy, despite--or perhaps because of working through--any hardships that come to us. Obeying the commandment to forgive can help fill our souls with all that is good in this life and all the promise of the life to come. The sacrifice and Atonement of our Savior is real, and so is His invitation when He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come unto me, all&nbsp;<em>ye</em>&nbsp;that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11:28-30)</p>
<p>I pray that we may each find it in our hearts to be forgiving of everyone around us each day, as well as those who have specifically hurt us; and that we will forgive ourselves and our God as we look to Him and live.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters I am grateful for this opportunity to be with you. I would like to thank President and Sister Clark for their kindness and hospitality and all those who helped in the preparations for today. I have to let you in on a secret though, I had been trying all summer with little success to lose a few unwanted pounds. But after accepting the invitation to speak in devotional my appetite has not been the same. I never expected this assignment would be my new fitness pal.<br /><br />In all seriousness this has been a unique and humbling experience to prepare for. I have sought earnestly the guidance of Heavenly Father as to the message that He would have me share with you today. I pray for the comfort of the Holy Ghost to be with me and you and that the Spirit will teach us what we need to become better disciples. I am grateful for the love and support of my family and friends who are here in the I-center and those listening online. I feel of their strength and encouragement.<br /><br />What an amazing sight you are. I know that our Heavenly Father is mindful of each us and that we are here on this campus at this time for a specific reason. Looking into the audience brings to mind the scripture found in Abraham chapter 3, where the Lord is speaking to Abraham and He shows him the premortal world in which we lived and states of those in attendance, "and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I can't help but think that today I am surrounded by noble and great spirits, valiant children of our Heavenly Father who seek diligently to know Him and His will for them in their lives. I have witnessed students, faculty, staff and administrators here on campus living the gospel, standing in holy places, being Christ's hands in giving selfless service and magnifying their callings. President Gordon B. Hinckley made the following statement, "Somehow, among all who have walked the earth, we have been brought forth in this unique season. Be grateful, and above all be faithful."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You are doing just that.<br /><br />I love this campus and the Spirit that permeates here. In fact two life changing events happened for me on these dedicated grounds. First, as a new freshman I came to the knowledge for myself that the gospel of Jesus Christ was true. No longer did I wish to lean on the testimony of my parents and leaders. I wanted and needed a testimony of my own. So I studied the scriptures and the words of the prophet. I did as Moroni admonished. I got down on my knees with a sincere desire to know, and I prayed to receive a confirmation. That witness came and has been the foundation upon which I stand. The second was in the summer of 1991 in the beautiful gardens just southeast of the I-center. That was where my sweetheart proposed. Words cannot adequately express the adventure we have been on in the last 23 years and I look forward to an eternity together. These two decisions and choices have helped mold and shape my life.<br /><br />In this audience today there are individuals coping with about every situation imaginable. Some of you have never been happier. Others are grappling with unseen struggles and heartache, only to put on a brave smile and face another day.&nbsp; I know I've experienced both. It is because of our vast range of experiences that one might wince or take offence if a speaker doesn't say just what we want to hear. But here is the reality, we each have our own customized opportunities to grow through trials, but our challenges and disappointments don't change the doctrine. None of our lives are perfect, and neither are we. In fact, please don't suppose that I have things figured or that I anywhere near where I should be. But I do not want to offend or overwhelm anyone; I only wish to remind our spirits of who we really are and our true potential.<br /><br />In Matthew chapter 22, verse 37 when the Savior was asked to identify the first great commandment, he simply stated, "Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart, and with all they soul, and with all thy mind." Looking at that scripture, I do not believe that it is by accident that our hearts were mentioned first. Our hearts can be used as a synonym for our entire makeup. In fact we often use phrases like, heart of gold, big hearted, good hearted, pure hearted, a deceitful heart, or cold hearted to describe the total person. I believe God asks for our hearts and our wills to be turned to Him, because in reality that is the only thing we have to give to Him. Everything else is already His.<br /><br />In fact, in Doctrine &amp; Covenants section 137 verse 9 it reads, "For I, the Lord will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts."&nbsp; So to me this means that when the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure out and wrap it around the person's head to determine how smart they are, nor does He take a chest measurement to determine his strength, but He measures the heart as an indicator of the person's capacity and potential to bless the lives of others. God has told us repeatedly that he does not look on our outward appearances, "but the Lord looketh on the heart."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He doesn't evaluate us on the basis of our physical attributes, our social status, educational degrees, family pedigrees or economic status. I also want to point out that our Savior has not asked us to be a certain size or to look a certain way.<br /><br />It is about our heart and our desires that I wish to speak to you today.<br /><br />The scriptures are filled with accounts of individuals who have either chosen to follow God and His commandments or those who have not. In my study of the Book of Mormon I have looked closely at the differences between those whose hearts were converted and those who did not or would not understand the teachings of God. One that I still can't quite wrap my head around is that of Nephi and his older brothers Laman and Lemuel. They were raised by the same loving parents, taught the gospel principles so what was it that made them so different from each other? May I share with you a few observations:&nbsp; Nephi had a great desire to know God, he sought diligently in faith with a lowly heart to know the truth. He was obedient and faithful to the commandments. One of my favorite scriptures that depicts the character of his heart is found in 1 Nephi chapter 4, verses 6 and 7 it reads, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth."&nbsp;What an amazing example of obedience and conversion. First, because he knew and recognized the Spirit and second because he acted even though he didn't know what the outcome would be. He trusted God. I can't wait to meet Nephi!<br /><br />Now let's look at Laman and Lemuel; they murmured against their father to the point of wanting to take his life, they knew not the dealings of God and disputed or argued continually one with another. In fact we see their lack of desire to know God in 1 Nephi Chapter 15. Nephi is talking with his brothers and he tells them that their father has spoken many things which were hard to understand, &nbsp;"save a man should inquire of the Lord, and they, (Laman and Lemuel) being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought." In fact the scriptures state in many instances that their hearts were past feeling. Then Nephi asks them point blank, "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" And guess what their response was? "We have not, for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us." How can the Lord make something known unto you if you don't ask? Part of me wants to rebuke them by saying O, ye of little faith. Can you not see the hand of the Lord in your life? I just can't quite wrap my head around the actions and attitudes of Laman and Lamuel.<br /><br />The Lord promises that "If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping the commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Isn't it interesting how different the desires of these brothers are? And how instrumental their decisions and choices were between keeping the commandments and hardening their hearts. The question I ask myself then is which one of the brothers do I resemble? We have been warned in a revelation given in the Doctrine and Covenants section 88 that in the last days "men's hearts will fail them."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I do not want to be one of those individuals whose hearts fail them. But we can see that this is being fulfilled, all we have to do is look at the world to know of this sad reality.<br /><br />So what can we do to protect ourselves from becoming past feeling or having our heart fail us? How can we be so converted to the gospel that when we are asked to do hard things we will not murmur but simply go and do. The Savior teaches us in Matthew chapter 6 that we must, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, were moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through nor steal...But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all things shall be added unto you. For where your treasure is there will be your heart also."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I invite each of you to consider how you would respond to the following questions: What do you really want? What does your heart truly desire? And what are you willing to sacrifice and do to get it?<br /><br />Do you want to know if this gospel is true? Do you want to live after the manner of happiness like Elder Holland taught us about last month? Do you want to strengthen your relationship with Jesus Christ? Do we desire to be numbered as His. When we entered the waters of baptism we covenanted with God to take His name upon us and to strive to be like Him. Are we living in such a way that others will look at us and recognize we are disciples of Jesus Christ? Are there changes that we can make today to show our Heavenly Father that more than anything else we want to serve Him? The choice is ultimately ours. It is up to you and me. God will help and facilitate us, but He will not force us.<br /><br />In Alma, chapter 29, Alma teaches that the Lord "granteth unto men according to their desires."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I have come to believe that whatever we really want in this life, we will ultimately get. Twenty years from now what we have become should not be a surprise to us, because we will have become what we have set our hearts upon. Elder Dallin H Oaks stated, "It is our actions and our desires that cause us to become something, whether a true friend, a gifted teacher, or one who qualifies for eternal life."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;If we want wealth, money and status, we'll find a way to get them. If we want to find misery, it is all around us looking for company. By the same token, if you really want to get more physically fit, overcome a bad habit or develop a specific talent or become more in-tune with the Holy Ghost, we'll find a way to do those things as well. We will find what we are looking for.<br /><br />A word of caution to us all. If we love the world more, and are more concerned about how to fit in and to justify the natural man and his behaviors, we will slowly take upon us those characteristics. Some of which are selfishness, contention, bitterness and sadness. I know firsthand that when we allow negative thoughts to fester in our hearts it brings misery into our lives. And the person it effects the most is us. We cannot serve two masters. Heavenly Father has taught us from the beginning that we are meant to be happy.&nbsp; President Monson said, "I believe that among the greatest lessons we are to learn on this short sojourn upon the earth, are lessons that help us distinguish between what in important and what is not. I plead with you not to let those most important things pass you by, instead find joy in the journey now."<sup>9</sup>Men are that they might have joy. Finding and keeping this joy is our choice. I don't stand here today saying that every day of my life has been delightful for me, I have struggled. But I know that the challenges I face are for my benefit and learning. For those of you who know me personally, I have a few mantra's that are said frequently if not daily. "Come what may and love it,"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;which I stole from Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin and "Attitude is Everything."<br /><br />Brothers and Sister another stark reality is that Satan is also after our hearts, because he is fully aware that if he can control our feelings and desires, he can control us - which is why he tries desperately to set our hearts upon the vain things of the world, to puff up our pride and harden our hearts to be past feeling. Kristen Oaks made a great statement when she came and spoke on campus she said, "Hold lightly to the things of this world but hold tightly to the things of heaven."&nbsp;<br /><br />I am not proud of it but there have been times where I have cared more about what the world thinks than standing up for what I know to be true and right. I have had to ask Heavenly Father for forgiveness and use the gift and enabling power of the atonement to repent and become stronger in my convictions. He knows us perfectly. He stands with His arms outstretched all the day long, waiting for us to come unto Him for peace.<br /><br />Elder Neal Maxwell said, "Whatever we embrace [in this life] instead of Jesus and His work will keep us from qualifying to enter into His kingdom and therefor being embraced by Him."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He continues, "I testify that what a wise man wrote is true: If we have not chosen the kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Are there things in your life that are keeping you from embracing the gospel of Jesus Christ? Are there obstacles that we put in our lives that distract us from feeling the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, or that stop us from receiving personal revelation? Are you standing on the porch and peering into the windows of full discipleship rather than entering the door receiving the blessings that come to those who follow the principles of the gospel. If you think that by being in near proximity of the truth will be enough to save you from the shafts and whirlwinds of the adversary, you are wrong. President Dieter F. Utchtdorf put it so eloquently:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Either you are committed or you are not. Either you are moving forward or you are standing still. There's no halfway. We all face moments of decision that change the rest of our live. As members of the Church, we must ask ourselves, "Will we dive in or just stand at the edge? Will I step forward or merely test the temperature of the water with my toes? Those who are only sort of committed may expect to only sort of receive the blessings of testimony, joy and peace. The windows of heaven might only sort of open to them. Wouldn't it be foolish to think, "I'll commit myself 50 percent now, but when Christ appears at the Second Coming, I'll commit myself 100 percent?"<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I might add that is not just foolish but sad. Because it will be too late. This life is the time for us to prepare, for Him to see through our actions and desires that we choose liberty and life through our mediator, Jesus Christ. Just as Abraham was asked to sacrifice something precious to him to show his obedience to God. We must also sacrifice. Are there habits or vices that we could put on the alter to prove our desire and commitment to follow Him. Could we turn off a movie, video game or put down a phone and look for ways to be His hands and better yet be an answer to someone's prayer? Could we make going to the temple a priority so that we can receive revelation and direction? If we love our Savior such that our hearts are forever changed, His image will fill our countenances. As we look to Him we will find the answers that we seek. They could be different for all of us. But the Lord does know the way, because He is the way and He is our only chance for successfully navigating mortality. His Atonement makes available all the power, peace, light and strength that we will need. Once we have decided to turn our hearts over to the Lord and that we want to be like Him, the process of following Him becomes one of joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>My invitation to you is to search your hearts to determine what you really desire. Remember the covenants you have made and the power they carry. Remember that you are noble and great and a potential heir of all the Father has. We cannot risk being casual about the Savior's work or about our role in it. Our influence for good is needed more than ever in this world. The Lord is counting on us to move His work forward. We need to accomplish what we were sent here to do. To become the individuals we were meant to become. Remember that you and I will be judged according to our actions and the desires of our hearts.<br /><br />I will close by asking you again to ponder these three questions:&nbsp; What do we really want? What does our heart truly desire? And what are we willing to sacrifice and do to get it? My plea to you is to find the answers for yourself and then act upon your convictions. We have been promised that if we ask, it shall be given, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;My prayer is that you will stand alongside me in the fight for truth.<br /><br />I know that God lives and desires for us to be happy. He loves us and watches over us. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, it is through His gift of the Atonement that we are able to repent and one day return home. The gospel was restored to the earth through the prophet Joseph Smith who desired to know the truth, who saw God the Father and His Son. We have a living prophet President Thomas S Monson who guides us today. I know that through obedience to the precepts and principles of the gospel true happiness is found. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Brother Michael G. Clark was born and raised in Redwood City, California. He served a Spanish-speaking mission to the Utah Salt Lake City North Mission. He attended Ricks College, graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Spanish and later obtained an MBA from Stanford University. <br /><br /> Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho nine years ago, Brother Clark spent the majority of his career working at Intel Corporation and Sun Microsystems in a variety of supply chain management positions. <br /><br /> Brother and Sister Clark met in California, are the parents of three children and have three grandchildren. <br /><br /> He enjoys tennis&nbsp;and chasing his grandchildren around the playground. Brother Clark currently serves as the deacon's quorum advisor in his ward.&nbsp;​ <br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>My dear young friends, I never imagined that I would be called upon to speak in devotional and am very humbled by this sacred privilege and responsibility. I pray for the Spirit to be with you and with me as I share some thoughts and the feelings of my heart.<br /><br />In a 2007 BYU devotional address entitled, "Lehi's Dream and You," President Boyd K. Packer stated, "Largely because of television, instead of looking over into that spacious building, we are, in effect, living inside of it. That is your fate in this generation. You are living in that great and spacious building."&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Taking a page out of President Packer's talk, I've decided to call my address, "Making Your Escape from the Great and Spacious Building."<br /><br />President Packer's quote has special significance to me because I am a recovering TV addict. I am not proud of this condition as it has had far reaching ramifications in my life. I developed this condition during my teenage years and it severely hindered my intellectual, physical, spiritual, and social development.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For example, as a freshman in high school I got an "A" in Algebra. As a sophomore I got a B in Geometry. Then a B- in Algebra 2 as a junior. As a senior I limped across the finish line with a C in Trigonometry. Yes, my intellectual development suffered during this time and I likewise experienced similar declines in the rate of my physical, spiritual, and social development.<br /><br />Fortunately, through a series of divinely orchestrated events I was blessed with a desire to take ownership of this problem. How I got there was much less important than what I was going to do about it. Just a few months before heading out on my mission, I came to ask myself, "How has watching countless reruns of&nbsp;<em>Gilligan's Island</em>,&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Bugs Bunny-Road Runner Hour</em>&nbsp;made me a better person? How was I better off for watching TV sporting events, especially NFL games on the Sabbath?" I was stumped. I could not come up with a single meaningful answer to these very important questions.&nbsp;At this point it became clear that I was wasting too much precious time on programs of&nbsp;<em>no lasting value</em>. I was idling away my time when I needed to be "up and doing,"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;growing and serving and increasing my ability to perform the important work that lay before me. In summary, I needed to become a better disciple of Jesus Christ. So in keeping with the words of our Savior--"if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out"<sup>4</sup>--and believing that moderation would not work for me in this situation, I made the decision to stop watching TV, "cold turkey."<br /><br />Now to be perfectly clear, I am not suggesting that watching television in and of itself constitutes a sin. Of course there are many good uses of this marvelous invention. However, I had lost control in this area of my life and therefore needed to take a bold and decisive course of action to solve this problem. In essence, I began to live by the following counsel that Elder D. Todd Christofferson gave at a BYU-Idaho devotional in January of 2009.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You and I can put Christ at the center of our lives and become one with Him as He is one with the Father (see John 17:20-23). We could begin by stripping everything out of our lives and then putting it back together in priority order with the Savior at the center. We would first put in place the things that make it possible always to remember Him.... In this way the essential will not be crowded out of our lives by the merely good, and things of lesser value will take a lower priority or fall away altogether."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As I filled my time with more wholesome and productive activities--beginning with feasting on the word of God--I instantly became more optimistic, more curious, more creative, more able to think independently, more aware and thoughtful of others. I left on my mission during this period of reawakening and did my best to love and serve others and was richly blessed in the process. The momentum continued after my mission. I was more agreeable and helpful at home, more effective in my church service, my grades&nbsp;<em>dramatically&nbsp;</em>improved and, more importantly, I was blessed to find my eternal companion in a most unlikely and miraculous fashion. Turning off the TV as a young single adult was a defining moment in my life and the blessings of this decision have continued for more than 30 years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The temple of television is, you see<br />What the great and spacious building was for me.<br />Where my spirit was covered with worldly grime,<br />Where I learned to envy and squander my time.<br />But then a few questions came and broke the spell,<br />A clarion call from a liberty bell!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How was I better for the shows I had seen?<br />How was the spirit brighter, the mind more keen?<br />There was no real answer that I could give<br />To this simple, piercing interrogative.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In an instant I changed, new things came to view,<br />Living, loving, serving, so much good to do.<br />Instead of watching I got up and I moved!<br />The result of this? My performance improved!<br />Our glorious Savior enabled escape</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From the floating realm over hell's open gape.<br />Now this great, spacious building, described as "strange,"<br />For each and every person, its form will change.<br />What is it for you, what mocking do you hear?<br />No matter its form, the solutions are clear.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hold fast to the rod, to mocking give no heed,<br />God will make you mighty in word and in deed.<br />Many lives you will bless, fill with charity.<br />Precious fruit will be yours for eternity.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So now I ask, what are your individually tailored temptations that emanate from this great and spacious building? What is pulling you into or keeping you there? How good is your grip on the iron rod? If you are partaking of the precious fruit how well are you dealing with the fingers of scorn that are pointed in your direction? Very simply, we might ask, where do we currently find ourselves in Lehi's dream? If, as President Packer suggested, you find yourself in that great and spacious building to one degree or another, you may want to develop an escape plan. Such an escape plan must be individual; however, I would like to suggest a few common components that might be included in many of our plans. These are Sabbath observance, listening to worthy music, making wise use of technology, and feasting on the word of God.</p>
<p><strong>Sabbath Observance</strong><strong><br /></strong>In January of 1985, when I was employed as a part-time teacher in the Provo Missionary Training Center, I attended a small meeting for the teachers in our MTC zone. At the start of this meeting one of the teachers gave a spiritual thought. He was older than most of us, a graduate student, and married with a few small children. He shared with us the details of his struggle to raise his personal bar of righteousness as it pertained to Sabbath observance.<br /><br />He spoke of his love of televised sports and of his habit of watching Sunday football games. With great emotion he told of how this habit had been highly detrimental to the spirit in his home; how he had let down his wife and toddler children who would rather have his undivided attention on this sacred day. He then lit up and told of how he had quit watching Sunday games three months earlier and of the great peace and joy he and his family had experienced in the ensuing months as he instead used the time in more uplifting activities--like reading to his children, playing appropriate games and going on walks together as a family, working on his church calling, and discussing goals and making plans with his wife. Then, likening his experience to a course in school, he said that his "final exam" was being held during the coming weekend--on Super Bowl Sunday--and how he was looking forward to passing this test with flying colors. Key to his success was a change in attitude, where he and his wife focused on engaging in the countless appropriate "DO's" of Sabbath observance rather than pining for a few worldly "DON'Ts." Through this experience he learned that keeping the Sabbath holy was not a burden, but a blessing, for truly, "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gives us a simple and effective blueprint for escaping the worldliness of the great and spacious building,&nbsp;"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Moreover, as we "rest from [our] labors...pay [our] devotions...and offer [our] oblations and [our] sacraments unto the Most High," He will bless us with joy and with the good things of the earth, resulting in strengthened bodies and enlivened souls.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Isaiah provides a second witness to the great spiritual and temporal blessings that come from keeping the Sabbath holy:<sup>10</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>"If thou turn away...from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, ...and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;of the earth."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we partake of the sacrament worthily as part of our Sabbath observance, we renew our covenants to "always remember [Jesus] and keep his commandments" so that we will "always have his spirit to be with [us]."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This vital practice will help us know what we must individually do to find ourselves under the tree of life where we can bask in the love of God and happily feast on the fruit that is "most sweet" and "desirable above all other fruit."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>If I might be so bold, I would invite you to prove the Lord in this matter. If you seek more love and harmony in your home or apartment, if you want to be "more used"<sup>15&nbsp;</sup>and effective in building the kingdom,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;if you need additional confidence to step outside of your comfort zone and overcome daunting challenges, then raise the level of your Sabbath observance. I know that great spiritual and temporal blessings will flow.<br /><br /><strong>Worthy Music</strong><strong><br /></strong>A few years ago an international student approached an instructor I know and asked for recommendations on music he could listen to. This instructor was very fond of the "music of the masters," as President Gordon B. Hinckley called it, the great classical works "that [have] lived through the centuries, the music that has lifted people."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Perhaps this student was prompted to make a change in this area of his life after hearing these words from President Thomas S. Monson at the April 2010 Priesthood Session of General Conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Music can help you draw closer to your Heavenly Father. It can be used to educate, edify, inspire, and unite. However, music can, by its tempo, beat, intensity, and lyrics, dull your spiritual sensitivity. You cannot afford to fill your minds with unworthy music."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In response to this student's request, the instructor suggested an easy entry point into the expansive world of musical variety and beauty to which President Hinckley referred: namely, Water Music, by George Frideric Handel, the legendary master who also wrote the Hallelujah Chorus under the inspiration of the Almighty. A week or so later this student, quite troubled, came to the instructor and said, "When I listen to the music you recommended, my roommates make fun of me." The instructor asked, "What did&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>think of the music?" "Well, I really liked it," he said. "It was energizing and uplifting." The instructor then told him, "If you feel energized and edified by this music, then give no heed to what your roommates say or think."</p>
<p>This episode highlights a couple of realities of escaping the great and spacious building and partaking of the fruit. First, we will be mocked. We don't seek to be mocked, but we must recognize that it will surely come, in one form or another. Next, President Packer tells us, "All of the mocking does not come from outside of the Church."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;This is a much more painful reality, as this international student found out. Living in a predominantly LDS community for the first time, he assumed his roommates would support him in his efforts to seek out that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy," but instead they mocked him. Fortunately, when such mocking occurs we can look to the Savior as did these Saints from Nephite history.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church--not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we "are not of the world,"<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;when we are meek, humble and faithful, then we can take comfort in knowing that the Savior prayed for us.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;When we receive of His divine love, represented by the tree of life,<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;then the mocking won't matter to us and "[our] garments shall be made clean."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><strong>Wise Use of Technology</strong><strong><br /></strong>One way that the adversary tempts us to stay in the great and spacious building is through the misuse of technology. In my youth it was primarily with television, but now we are faced with the challenge of properly using a greater variety of much more alluring technical wonders.<br /><br />In recent years as I have pondered why video games are so captivating, I have come to realize that it is because they often resonate with and provide fascinating outlets for vital God-given instincts. They often tap into our godly instincts to (1) choose the right, (2) overcome challenges, and (3) progress eternally.<br /><br />I believe that each of us has a fixation with good versus evil that reaches far back into our premortal experience when we chose good and rejected evil during the Grand Council. Lucifer's rebellion precipitated the war in heaven where we fought alongside Michael. That war rages to this day, where in mortality we are enlisted in battles of self-control and service as we advance the cause of righteousness. Many video games put participants into a virtual war environment and these likewise tap into our God-given instinct to choose "good" and triumph over "evil."<br /><br />Next, we like to overcome challenges. In mortality we learn that "opposition in all things"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;is designed into our experience so that we will find joy and satisfaction from the success of our labors, be they physical or of the mind.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Video games also provide many opportunities to overcome challenges. We find satisfaction from beating the competition or from completing a difficult level in a game.<br /><br />Finally, we like to progress. It is part of our eternal DNA. As we access the redeeming and enabling power of the atonement we grow in our discipleship, receive grace for grace and eventually qualify for and "receive of [the Father's] fullness."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;We are His children and want to become like Him<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;and live forever in the family unit with eternal increase. We are promised that if we are faithful, we will be made "ruler over many things."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;As our gaming successes mount we are rewarded with more points, new powers, and expanding dominions. We progress through levels until we receive all that a game has to offer.<br /><br />While a video game here and there may help "loosen your bow," so to speak, and facilitate a measure of social interaction, these occasional and minimal benefits carry the risk of trapping individuals in a counterfeit pattern of exercising God-given instincts in a way that has little or no lasting value; where participants are "ever progressing, but never coming closer to their true potential" as sons and daughters of God. Not surprisingly, those who struggle to perform well and progress in real pursuits of enduring value--like obtaining an education or dating and finding their eternal companion--are particularly vulnerable to falling into this all-consuming video game trap and spending countless hours in pursuit of counterfeit success.&nbsp;Happily, I know several individuals who have broken free of this trap. One young man in particular abandoned the excitement and pseudo safety of his virtual worlds, squared his shoulders and faced real challenges head on. He trusted in the Lord and His counsels and was thereby strengthened with additional peace of mind and confidence to take the inevitable ups and downs of life in stride. As a result of his efforts, over time he was blessed to achieve his demanding educational goals, find his eternal companion, and see his career grow and blossom in miraculous ways.<br /><br />We also know that counterfeits abound in the world of social media. Earlier this month, at the Priesthood Session of General Conference, Elder Quinten L. Cook explained this phenomenon by paraphrasing thought leader, Arthur C. Brooks, saying we broadcast "the smiling details of our lives but not the hard times at school or work" and then consume the "fake lives" of our social media friends.<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Elder Cook encouraged the brethren to follow Elder David A. Bednar's counsel to be "authentic" in our use of social media. Indeed, we have a scriptural responsibility with our use of social media, as Elder Bednar said, "to sweep the earth with messages filled with righteousness and truth--messages that are authentic, edifying, and praiseworthy--and literally to sweep the earth as with a flood."<sup>31</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>President Ezra Taft Benson, with his prophetic insight and vision, was no stranger to the blessings and pitfalls of technology. Even though technologies have dramatically advanced since his time, the principles embodied in this sobering assessment, given in 1971, still apply.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The magnetism of TV and radio is in the accessibility of their mediocrity. Lovely is not an adjective to describe most of their products. The inventors of these wonders were inspired by the Lord. But once their good works were introduced to the world, the powers of darkness began to employ them for our destruction. In each medium--the phonograph, motion pictures, radio, and television--the evolution of decline from the inventor's intentions can be easily traced."<sup>32</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Yes, the same technologies can be used to build or to destroy. Notwithstanding the many technology-enabled dangers, I have high hopes that you, current and future parents in Zion, will make wise decisions regarding the many useful inventions of our time. Heavenly Father knows you are capable of using these wonders primarily as tools and not toys; tools that help you learn, make you more organized and more effective with your time and in your service; tools to help you share the gospel, connect with ancestors, and encourage others as they face life's challenges.<br /><br /><strong>Feasting on the Word of God</strong><strong><br /></strong>Of course, we know that the adversary's counterfeits also exist outside the world of technology. Fortunately, the word of God, found in the scriptures and in the teachings of our latter-day prophets and apostles, provide great insights that expose these counterfeits. For example, those in the great and spacious building tell us they are happy, but Alma states, "wickedness never was happiness."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The worldly wise tell us that we should follow their example if we want to succeed, for "every man prosper[s] according to his genius."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;However, Jacob tells us that worldly "wisdom is foolishness," that its purveyors will perish, and that "to be learned is good [only if we] hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>35</sup>The mocking voices tell us they are free to do as they will and that we should join them; that there is no right or wrong or long-term consequences to our actions because "when a man is dead, that [is] the end thereof."<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;But Lehi makes it clear that our primary options are "to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil." Using our agency<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;to seek and obtain the fruit of the tree of life will make us truly happy and free while lingering in that building will enslave us and ultimately bring sadness and regret, "for [the devil] seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself."<sup>38</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When we "feast upon the words of Christ...[they] will tell [us] all things what [we] should do"<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;in order to "Go...out from Babylon"<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;or, in other words, the great and spacious building. I testify that the iron rod, the word of God, "which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword" will "[divide] asunder"<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;the "mist of darkness"<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;and keep us on the path that will "point to [us] a straight course to eternal bliss."<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let Us Be an Independent Covenant People</strong><strong><br /></strong>Brothers and sisters, today we have considered our standing in Lehi's dream and discussed just a few of the many ways in which we are tempted to sit back and relax in that great and spacious building and learn to become more like the world and less like the independent and distinct covenant people the Lord intends us to be--a steadfast and immovable "peculiar people"<sup>44&nbsp;</sup>safely basking in the love of God as we journey toward eternal life and exaltation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now this great, spacious building, described as "strange,"<br />For each and every person, its form will change.<br />What is it for you, what mocking do you hear?<br />No matter its form, the solutions are clear.<br />Hold fast to the rod, to mocking give no heed,<br />God will make you mighty in word and in deed.<br />Many lives you will bless, fill with charity.<br />Precious fruit will be yours for eternity.</p>
<p>May this be so, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As I thought about speaking at devotional and as I look out at you today, I have been reminded of the students individually and collectively who have had an impact upon my life. Some are easier to remember than others. Sometimes it was a location like Carey, Idaho, or Sri Lanka, or Colstrip, Montana--or sometimes it was an unusual name or sometimes a very common name. You are special individuals. I know that each of you has a teacher on this campus who knows your name and knows you. And faculty and employees, there are students who will remember you forever--your names, your knowledge and skill, and most of all your interest in them.<br /><br />My life has been blessed by students. I have watched students progress at various rates. For some, the process was more challenging than others. For some, the vision and understanding of learning was a small seed. I remember a conversation with a young man about learning and his effort. He shared how in high school, he was mainly going through the motions and wasn't working to his potential. He didn't understand learning. When he arrived at college, he started to develop different patterns and put forth a different effort level. I asked him what made the difference. His response, "I realized that learning was part of the gospel." I hope that all of us can have this thought radiate in our hearts and minds.<br /><br />I share with you two verses found in Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 118 and 119.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Section 88 was a response and an answer to the brethren seeking direction. As I study the history of the Church, I am constantly reminded of examples of the importance of learning and education. Revelation nudged leaders to build communities with a central focus on education and spiritual empowerment. The Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and many others of the early brethren were examples of great learning. The Prophet Joseph was self-taught with little formal education. In the School of the Prophets, instruction was provided in Theology, English Grammar, Hebrew, and other fields to better qualify elders for conducting God's work and proselyting worldwide.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Our prophets and church leaders today are examples of continuous learning. We generally have no knowledge or perception of the depth of knowledge and understanding of our current prophets, seers, and revelators.<br /><br />President Hinckley gave us counsel concerning learning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"None of us . . . knows enough. The learning process is an endless process. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">". . . You cannot afford to stop. You must not rest in your development. . . . There is so much to learn and so little time in which to learn it."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Today, I want to share thoughts on Learning and a House of Learning. I start by referring to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Temple</strong><strong><br /></strong>We go to the temple receiving the blessing of being taught. Elder John A. Widstoe encourages us to look at the learning pedagogy we experience in the temple. The spoken word, the representation and symbolism, and the engagement of the participants. He reminds us that the ordinances are packed with eternal truths.<br /><br />The temple is referred to as the Lord's university. The temple is a place of special instruction where we learn those things that will take us back to our Father in Heaven's presence. Our education for the eternities is provided there.&nbsp; We receive teachings, covenants, and promises.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I have learned some important direction as I participate in the learning available in the temple. Preparation by planning and inviting the spirit to be with me improves my temple experience. The time in the temple allows me to reflect. This reflection and pondering provides the opportunity to be taught and prompted. The Holy Ghost will be our own personal mentor. Your promptings will be different than the person next to you. As I direct my reflection to the meaning of the ordinances and covenants, I am taught. As I go to the temple, I have come to understand the importance of repetition. Repetition helps me remember. It is like an ongoing class with continuous tutoring and promptings to help us pass the final exam. If I want to receive the help that is available, I can go to the House of Learning. The Lord, through the temple, will teach, tutor, and remind me of what I must know and do. As I go to the temple, I am reminded of service and love. I can experience special feelings for those that I serve by way of proxy. I need them and they need me. The temple helps me to understand service.<br /><br />As I go to the temple, I am reminded of the importance of applying and doing better. I want to be a better companion, a better father, a better person. The thought has come to me as I watch a couple kneeling at the altar, across from each other, that the sealing is an invitation to return, to repeat, and to recommit to keeping the covenants and the promises they have made.<br /><br />We all need to return often to that special classroom where all of us receive a special feeling - that the teacher knows us and he cares about us. The teacher wants so much for us to be that successful student. This temple on our hill is a special place of learning--it is the House of Learning.&nbsp; It is the House of the Lord.<br /><br /><strong>Home</strong><strong><br /></strong>I now share a few thoughts on our homes as a House of Learning. Our homes are sacred places and should be a sanctuary for learning and goodness. How do we make our homes a House of Learning? How do we prepare an environment for learning?<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley tells of a room in his parent's home they called their library. The room had volumes of books. He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There was quiet in that room. It was understood that it was a place to study. . . there was an environment . . . of learning. I would not have you believe that we were great scholars. But we were exposed to great literature, great ideas from great thinkers, and the language of men and women who thought deeply and wrote beautifully."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Creating an environment for learning and teaching is so important. Fathers and mothers together create the environment for learning. I had the great blessing of being raised in a home that valued spiritual and temporal learning. We were not wealthy and my parents didn't receive a lot of formal education. But they provided us with examples of learning. My mother was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. During her seventh year of age, her younger brother died, her mother passed away, and her older brother was lost at sea in World War I. An aunt had joined the Church and migrated to Utah where she had married. The aunt and her husband sent an invitation for the family to send one of their children and they would raise that child in the United States. The family sent my mother. She thought she was going on a trip and never saw her father or siblings again. My mother and her aunt were the only two members of the family who joined the Church.</p>
<p>During her lifetime, she became an example to her children for learning. She couldn't continue her education because of the needs of her new family and the school was a significant distance. I observed her desire for learning and her continued appetite for study of things both temporally and spiritually. She learned English and continued to study English. Her handwriting was beautiful, her spelling foundational. When I came home from school, she was doing crossword puzzles, reading the newspaper, studying the scriptures. She loved TV quiz shows. Her preparation for teaching in her church callings was exemplary. I remember her notes and her study.<br /><br />My father was the oldest in his family. He shared a major responsibility to provide for the family and take care of the family farm. Because of distance and conditions, he wasn't able to continue his education. My father loved to read. We always had a small library with books to read. I remember an atlas and a large book on animals. I remember books on the history of the nation. I remember church books. There were a lot less than today, but very valued. My father's counsel was if you have books and you don't read them, you are no better off than the person who sleeps with the light on. He required us to do the exercises and problems of math in our heads. When he was in his forties, he took a course, using a record player and a book to learn how to type and use a typewriter. This was an old heavy-duty Underwood typewriter. I know that the terms typewriter and record player are foreign to most of you. He took notes. He tried to learn. At age 60, he was learning how to play the piano. My parents provided a climate of learning. I was blessed with a "House of Learning."<br /><br />Sometimes in our world of luxury, technology, and volumes of information at our hands, we may miss the full vision of a House of Learning. The opportunity of creating an environment and climate for learning in our homes is special.<br /><br /><strong>University</strong><strong><br /></strong>My thoughts turn now to our university as a House of Learning. This has caused me to ponder upon my experiences at a university. I can remember many of my teachers and some of the classes. I would not be telling the truth if I told you I remembered all of my learning and experiences. I remember geology from Brother Bushman. I came to more fully appreciate the Tetons and other blessings of nature because of a geology class. I came to understand and appreciate the miracle of the creation through an anatomy and physiology class. My interest in economics was stimulated by Brother Parson and Brother Wimmer. I felt the power of the restoration and the history of the Church through Brother Barrett from the Religion Department and Brother Campbell from the History Department. I was blessed by good teachers and a good climate for learning. We have that great blessing upon this campus.<br /><br />As we look at the university as being a House of Learning, we look at a very special experience that can exist between the student and the teacher. This process is one of leading the learner into light and understanding. One of the most impressive examples of true teaching is found in the life of Helen Keller.<br /><br />She tells her story of beginning life in a natural, happy childhood. She was stricken with a disease, losing her sight and hearing. She plunged into a house of darkness. She says she would have remained there if it were not for the help of a good teacher--the teacher that arrived with infinite patience, great understanding, and devotion. The teacher worked with Helen Keller. She would make symbols in her hand. It was very difficult with the resistance of Helen.<br /><br />One day with the usual struggle when the teacher was trying to teach the sign for water and for cup, there were no encouraging results. They took a break and went for a walk. The hired man was watering the horses in the barnyard. Leading the child to the pump, the teacher thrust her hand under the spout and made the touch sign for water. Something of an awakening light occurred. Helen realized that the sign spelled into her hand meant the cool liquid she was feeling. She had light come to her understanding. There were difficulties ahead, but the way had been opened.<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Anne Sullivan did what teachers do--make symbols of learning come to life. A step toward mastery of any class or course is to make the essential symbols come alive and meaningful. A special bond develops in a learning environment where teachers and students come together. I pray that at this university, we continue to develop that special bond, and that both learner and teacher will understand and develop in their sacred role.<br /><br /><strong>You and I</strong><strong><br /></strong>Now, we all have the blessing and opportunity of creating our own House of Learning. I have spoken of the temple, the home, and the university. I hope you understand that all of those work together to bless your life. Now, what do you need to do in your life to add to that climate and pattern for learning? I share with you a few thoughts and suggestions. These are not new. You will recognize their inclusion in Preach My Gospel, the Learning Model, youth curriculum, the Gospel Principles manual, and in good learning and teaching. &nbsp;I mention four brief points.<br /><br /><strong><em>First, Vision and Understanding Leads to Acting</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>A couple of years ago, I was in Fortaleza, Brazil. On Sunday evening, I was scheduled to speak at a fireside for youth and their parents. I had thought that I would share parts of the Learning Model. On the way to the fireside, I had the prompting that I should share some different thoughts.<br /><br />I felt that I should help these members create a vision and understanding of the blessing and importance of education. It is like they needed to understand the doctrine and principles then their behavior and actions would follow. It was to be a matter of "why" rather than "how". I was prompted that it was to be about vision.<br /><br />President James E. Faust tells of his experience with his father concerning education. He was reminded by his father the "why" of learning and an education. He had returned from World War II. He was married with a family and wanted to move on with his life. He had served a mission and served in the military. He had three years of school to complete, which would require effort and continued poverty as a young family. He said to his father, "I don't think I'll go back to school. I'll just get a job or start a business and go forward in my life." His father had completed law school after World War I with a wife and three children. His father who was typically blunt, said to him, "What can you do?" The brutally honest comment had an impression. He went back to school. Our vision and understanding of "why" will have an impact upon our educational efforts.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Prophet Joseph tells of his yearly visits with the Angel Moroni. He received instruction, intelligence, and interviews in respect to why, how, and what. The Lord was creating vision and understanding for the Prophet Joseph through the Angel Moroni. That vision and understanding led to action and the service of the prophet. As you come to understand the why of learning, your vision grows, and your action increases.<br /><br />We have all been blessed with Elder David A. Bednar's teachings concerning vision on agency and acting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You and I are here upon the earth to prepare for eternity, to learn how to learn, to learn things that are temporally important and eternally essential, and to assist others in learning wisdom and truth. Understanding who we are, where we came from, and why we are upon the earth places upon each of us a great responsibility both to learn how to learn and to learn to love learning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As a learner, what are the implications for me of knowing that I am an&nbsp;<em>agent</em>&nbsp;blessed with agency who can act rather than an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;that is merely acted upon?"<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our vision increases our acting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second, Preparation by Study and by Faith</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>When I think of preparation, I return to the Prophet Joseph and four years with visits from the Angel Moroni before receiving the plates. I think of the preparation required to master a skill or share a musical talent. In 3 Nephi, chapter 17, verse 3, the Lord gives instruction to the people assembled. He had been teaching and blessing their lives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and&nbsp;<em>ponder upon the things which I have said</em>, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and&nbsp;<em>prepare your minds for the morrow</em>, and I come unto you again."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>He encourages them to go to their homes and prepare for the morrow. That preparation was pondering and praying--preparing your mind for further instruction and learning. For you as a college student and for us as members of the Church, an investment of study will prepare us to be taught. Preparation requires a demonstration of study and faith. Our study and our faith leads to preparation.</p>
<p>From Preach My Gospel, we read two powerful sentences concerning preparation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What do these two sentences mean? Preparation requires you to study, to improve your learning skills, to have faith in our ability to learn. A reminder - study is not just reading. Preparation requires effort and time. By study and by faith, we reap the blessings of our preparation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third, the Holy Ghost is our Facilitator and Teacher</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>I share with you the thought that the Holy Ghost is more important than we understand in our learning. We are not always conscious of the impact of the Holy Ghost. I do not profess to know all about how the Holy Ghost works, but I do know that having the companionship of the Holy Ghost increases my learning and understanding.<br /><br />Let me suggest a few thoughts concerning the role of the Holy Ghost in your learning process. These thoughts were influenced by Elder Bednar's teaching. You must come to a desire to have the Holy Ghost as a learning partner. You need to invite the Holy Ghost into your life and into the learning process. You must merit the companionship. Desire, inviting, and to merit the Holy Ghost will be facilitated by your prayers, work, and worthiness. Companionship of the Holy Ghost improves our ability to feel and understand promptings. We spend a lifetime of learning to feel and understand promptings. This is part of the sanctification process.<br /><br />I mention to you the importance of recording those promptings, those learning experiences. Elder Richard G. Scott shared with us that if we record our promptings, we will have the ability to build upon our experiences with the Holy Ghost and that they will have a tendency to increase. I challenge you to keep a journal of your learning experiences, your promptings, your breakthroughs. Record your educational experiences. Recording what you learn in the learning process will lend itself to increased learning and to an increased role of the Holy Ghost. You will learn how to learn.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong><em>Fourth, Pondering Leads to Increased Learning and Understanding</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Pondering. This is another special word from Third Nephi, chapter 17, verse 3. The Savior instructed the multitude to "ponder upon the things which I have said."<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>There are many references to the word pondering in the scriptures and the history of the Church. There are examples of pondering in discoveries in the sciences. There are ponderings that are part of artistic creations. &nbsp;<br /><br />In Doctrine and Covenants, section 138, President Joseph F. Smith gives us a powerful example of pondering. Let me read verses 1 - 3 and verse 11.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What does it mean to ponder? We have to learn how to ponder. We have to shut out the noise, the background music, the phone. Pondering requires process, focus, and effort. Like the counsel given to Oliver Cowdery, you must study it out in your mind.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I encourage you as students to ponder upon the value and process for deep learning and understanding.</p>
<p>The effort of pondering had an influence upon a young boy. The Prophet Joseph tells of his experience after reading in the Epistle of James:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This effort of pondering had an impact on you and me.&nbsp; I hope that the thoughts on learning have caused you to ponder.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the direction to create a House of Learning is vital for our progression and sanctification. We need not separate temporal and spiritual learnings--in fact, we should rejoice in the blessing of being at this university with this climate for learning. Learning is part of the gospel--to know of the things of the earth, to learn from good books, to enjoy the arts, to know of those things that will help you professionally, to know of and apply the teachings of the scriptures.<br /><br />I pray that your vision and understanding of the importance of learning will increase in order that you might take advantage of your opportunities. Your Father in Heaven knows you individually. He cares about you. He loves you. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>As I thought about speaking at devotional and as I look out at you today, I have been reminded of the students individually and collectively who have had an impact upon my life. Some are easier to remember than others. Sometimes it was a location like Carey, Idaho, or Sri Lanka, or Colstrip, Montana--or sometimes it was an unusual name or sometimes a very common name. You are special individuals. I know that each of you has a teacher on this campus who knows your name and knows you. And faculty and employees, there are students who will remember you forever--your names, your knowledge and skill, and most of all your interest in them.<br /><br />My life has been blessed by students. I have watched students progress at various rates. For some, the process was more challenging than others. For some, the vision and understanding of learning was a small seed. I remember a conversation with a young man about learning and his effort. He shared how in high school, he was mainly going through the motions and wasn't working to his potential. He didn't understand learning. When he arrived at college, he started to develop different patterns and put forth a different effort level. I asked him what made the difference. His response, "I realized that learning was part of the gospel." I hope that all of us can have this thought radiate in our hearts and minds.<br /><br />I share with you two verses found in Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 118 and 119.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Section 88 was a response and an answer to the brethren seeking direction. As I study the history of the Church, I am constantly reminded of examples of the importance of learning and education. Revelation nudged leaders to build communities with a central focus on education and spiritual empowerment. The Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and many others of the early brethren were examples of great learning. The Prophet Joseph was self-taught with little formal education. In the School of the Prophets, instruction was provided in Theology, English Grammar, Hebrew, and other fields to better qualify elders for conducting God's work and proselyting worldwide.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Our prophets and church leaders today are examples of continuous learning. We generally have no knowledge or perception of the depth of knowledge and understanding of our current prophets, seers, and revelators.<br /><br />President Hinckley gave us counsel concerning learning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"None of us . . . knows enough. The learning process is an endless process. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">". . . You cannot afford to stop. You must not rest in your development. . . . There is so much to learn and so little time in which to learn it."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Today, I want to share thoughts on Learning and a House of Learning. I start by referring to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Temple</strong><strong><br /></strong>We go to the temple receiving the blessing of being taught. Elder John A. Widstoe encourages us to look at the learning pedagogy we experience in the temple. The spoken word, the representation and symbolism, and the engagement of the participants. He reminds us that the ordinances are packed with eternal truths.<br /><br />The temple is referred to as the Lord's university. The temple is a place of special instruction where we learn those things that will take us back to our Father in Heaven's presence. Our education for the eternities is provided there.&nbsp; We receive teachings, covenants, and promises.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I have learned some important direction as I participate in the learning available in the temple. Preparation by planning and inviting the spirit to be with me improves my temple experience. The time in the temple allows me to reflect. This reflection and pondering provides the opportunity to be taught and prompted. The Holy Ghost will be our own personal mentor. Your promptings will be different than the person next to you. As I direct my reflection to the meaning of the ordinances and covenants, I am taught. As I go to the temple, I have come to understand the importance of repetition. Repetition helps me remember. It is like an ongoing class with continuous tutoring and promptings to help us pass the final exam. If I want to receive the help that is available, I can go to the House of Learning. The Lord, through the temple, will teach, tutor, and remind me of what I must know and do. As I go to the temple, I am reminded of service and love. I can experience special feelings for those that I serve by way of proxy. I need them and they need me. The temple helps me to understand service.<br /><br />As I go to the temple, I am reminded of the importance of applying and doing better. I want to be a better companion, a better father, a better person. The thought has come to me as I watch a couple kneeling at the altar, across from each other, that the sealing is an invitation to return, to repeat, and to recommit to keeping the covenants and the promises they have made.<br /><br />We all need to return often to that special classroom where all of us receive a special feeling - that the teacher knows us and he cares about us. The teacher wants so much for us to be that successful student. This temple on our hill is a special place of learning--it is the House of Learning.&nbsp; It is the House of the Lord.<br /><br /><strong>Home</strong><strong><br /></strong>I now share a few thoughts on our homes as a House of Learning. Our homes are sacred places and should be a sanctuary for learning and goodness. How do we make our homes a House of Learning? How do we prepare an environment for learning?<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley tells of a room in his parent's home they called their library. The room had volumes of books. He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There was quiet in that room. It was understood that it was a place to study. . . there was an environment . . . of learning. I would not have you believe that we were great scholars. But we were exposed to great literature, great ideas from great thinkers, and the language of men and women who thought deeply and wrote beautifully."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Creating an environment for learning and teaching is so important. Fathers and mothers together create the environment for learning. I had the great blessing of being raised in a home that valued spiritual and temporal learning. We were not wealthy and my parents didn't receive a lot of formal education. But they provided us with examples of learning. My mother was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. During her seventh year of age, her younger brother died, her mother passed away, and her older brother was lost at sea in World War I. An aunt had joined the Church and migrated to Utah where she had married. The aunt and her husband sent an invitation for the family to send one of their children and they would raise that child in the United States. The family sent my mother. She thought she was going on a trip and never saw her father or siblings again. My mother and her aunt were the only two members of the family who joined the Church.</p>
<p>During her lifetime, she became an example to her children for learning. She couldn't continue her education because of the needs of her new family and the school was a significant distance. I observed her desire for learning and her continued appetite for study of things both temporally and spiritually. She learned English and continued to study English. Her handwriting was beautiful, her spelling foundational. When I came home from school, she was doing crossword puzzles, reading the newspaper, studying the scriptures. She loved TV quiz shows. Her preparation for teaching in her church callings was exemplary. I remember her notes and her study.<br /><br />My father was the oldest in his family. He shared a major responsibility to provide for the family and take care of the family farm. Because of distance and conditions, he wasn't able to continue his education. My father loved to read. We always had a small library with books to read. I remember an atlas and a large book on animals. I remember books on the history of the nation. I remember church books. There were a lot less than today, but very valued. My father's counsel was if you have books and you don't read them, you are no better off than the person who sleeps with the light on. He required us to do the exercises and problems of math in our heads. When he was in his forties, he took a course, using a record player and a book to learn how to type and use a typewriter. This was an old heavy-duty Underwood typewriter. I know that the terms typewriter and record player are foreign to most of you. He took notes. He tried to learn. At age 60, he was learning how to play the piano. My parents provided a climate of learning. I was blessed with a "House of Learning."<br /><br />Sometimes in our world of luxury, technology, and volumes of information at our hands, we may miss the full vision of a House of Learning. The opportunity of creating an environment and climate for learning in our homes is special.<br /><br /><strong>University</strong><strong><br /></strong>My thoughts turn now to our university as a House of Learning. This has caused me to ponder upon my experiences at a university. I can remember many of my teachers and some of the classes. I would not be telling the truth if I told you I remembered all of my learning and experiences. I remember geology from Brother Bushman. I came to more fully appreciate the Tetons and other blessings of nature because of a geology class. I came to understand and appreciate the miracle of the creation through an anatomy and physiology class. My interest in economics was stimulated by Brother Parson and Brother Wimmer. I felt the power of the restoration and the history of the Church through Brother Barrett from the Religion Department and Brother Campbell from the History Department. I was blessed by good teachers and a good climate for learning. We have that great blessing upon this campus.<br /><br />As we look at the university as being a House of Learning, we look at a very special experience that can exist between the student and the teacher. This process is one of leading the learner into light and understanding. One of the most impressive examples of true teaching is found in the life of Helen Keller.<br /><br />She tells her story of beginning life in a natural, happy childhood. She was stricken with a disease, losing her sight and hearing. She plunged into a house of darkness. She says she would have remained there if it were not for the help of a good teacher--the teacher that arrived with infinite patience, great understanding, and devotion. The teacher worked with Helen Keller. She would make symbols in her hand. It was very difficult with the resistance of Helen.<br /><br />One day with the usual struggle when the teacher was trying to teach the sign for water and for cup, there were no encouraging results. They took a break and went for a walk. The hired man was watering the horses in the barnyard. Leading the child to the pump, the teacher thrust her hand under the spout and made the touch sign for water. Something of an awakening light occurred. Helen realized that the sign spelled into her hand meant the cool liquid she was feeling. She had light come to her understanding. There were difficulties ahead, but the way had been opened.<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Anne Sullivan did what teachers do--make symbols of learning come to life. A step toward mastery of any class or course is to make the essential symbols come alive and meaningful. A special bond develops in a learning environment where teachers and students come together. I pray that at this university, we continue to develop that special bond, and that both learner and teacher will understand and develop in their sacred role.<br /><br /><strong>You and I</strong><strong><br /></strong>Now, we all have the blessing and opportunity of creating our own House of Learning. I have spoken of the temple, the home, and the university. I hope you understand that all of those work together to bless your life. Now, what do you need to do in your life to add to that climate and pattern for learning? I share with you a few thoughts and suggestions. These are not new. You will recognize their inclusion in Preach My Gospel, the Learning Model, youth curriculum, the Gospel Principles manual, and in good learning and teaching. &nbsp;I mention four brief points.<br /><br /><strong><em>First, Vision and Understanding Leads to Acting</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>A couple of years ago, I was in Fortaleza, Brazil. On Sunday evening, I was scheduled to speak at a fireside for youth and their parents. I had thought that I would share parts of the Learning Model. On the way to the fireside, I had the prompting that I should share some different thoughts.<br /><br />I felt that I should help these members create a vision and understanding of the blessing and importance of education. It is like they needed to understand the doctrine and principles then their behavior and actions would follow. It was to be a matter of "why" rather than "how". I was prompted that it was to be about vision.<br /><br />President James E. Faust tells of his experience with his father concerning education. He was reminded by his father the "why" of learning and an education. He had returned from World War II. He was married with a family and wanted to move on with his life. He had served a mission and served in the military. He had three years of school to complete, which would require effort and continued poverty as a young family. He said to his father, "I don't think I'll go back to school. I'll just get a job or start a business and go forward in my life." His father had completed law school after World War I with a wife and three children. His father who was typically blunt, said to him, "What can you do?" The brutally honest comment had an impression. He went back to school. Our vision and understanding of "why" will have an impact upon our educational efforts.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Prophet Joseph tells of his yearly visits with the Angel Moroni. He received instruction, intelligence, and interviews in respect to why, how, and what. The Lord was creating vision and understanding for the Prophet Joseph through the Angel Moroni. That vision and understanding led to action and the service of the prophet. As you come to understand the why of learning, your vision grows, and your action increases.<br /><br />We have all been blessed with Elder David A. Bednar's teachings concerning vision on agency and acting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You and I are here upon the earth to prepare for eternity, to learn how to learn, to learn things that are temporally important and eternally essential, and to assist others in learning wisdom and truth. Understanding who we are, where we came from, and why we are upon the earth places upon each of us a great responsibility both to learn how to learn and to learn to love learning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As a learner, what are the implications for me of knowing that I am an&nbsp;<em>agent</em>&nbsp;blessed with agency who can act rather than an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;that is merely acted upon?"<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Our vision increases our acting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second, Preparation by Study and by Faith</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>When I think of preparation, I return to the Prophet Joseph and four years with visits from the Angel Moroni before receiving the plates. I think of the preparation required to master a skill or share a musical talent. In 3 Nephi, chapter 17, verse 3, the Lord gives instruction to the people assembled. He had been teaching and blessing their lives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and&nbsp;<em>ponder upon the things which I have said</em>, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and&nbsp;<em>prepare your minds for the morrow</em>, and I come unto you again."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>He encourages them to go to their homes and prepare for the morrow. That preparation was pondering and praying--preparing your mind for further instruction and learning. For you as a college student and for us as members of the Church, an investment of study will prepare us to be taught. Preparation requires a demonstration of study and faith. Our study and our faith leads to preparation.</p>
<p>From Preach My Gospel, we read two powerful sentences concerning preparation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What do these two sentences mean? Preparation requires you to study, to improve your learning skills, to have faith in our ability to learn. A reminder - study is not just reading. Preparation requires effort and time. By study and by faith, we reap the blessings of our preparation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third, the Holy Ghost is our Facilitator and Teacher</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>I share with you the thought that the Holy Ghost is more important than we understand in our learning. We are not always conscious of the impact of the Holy Ghost. I do not profess to know all about how the Holy Ghost works, but I do know that having the companionship of the Holy Ghost increases my learning and understanding.<br /><br />Let me suggest a few thoughts concerning the role of the Holy Ghost in your learning process. These thoughts were influenced by Elder Bednar's teaching. You must come to a desire to have the Holy Ghost as a learning partner. You need to invite the Holy Ghost into your life and into the learning process. You must merit the companionship. Desire, inviting, and to merit the Holy Ghost will be facilitated by your prayers, work, and worthiness. Companionship of the Holy Ghost improves our ability to feel and understand promptings. We spend a lifetime of learning to feel and understand promptings. This is part of the sanctification process.<br /><br />I mention to you the importance of recording those promptings, those learning experiences. Elder Richard G. Scott shared with us that if we record our promptings, we will have the ability to build upon our experiences with the Holy Ghost and that they will have a tendency to increase. I challenge you to keep a journal of your learning experiences, your promptings, your breakthroughs. Record your educational experiences. Recording what you learn in the learning process will lend itself to increased learning and to an increased role of the Holy Ghost. You will learn how to learn.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong><em>Fourth, Pondering Leads to Increased Learning and Understanding</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Pondering. This is another special word from Third Nephi, chapter 17, verse 3. The Savior instructed the multitude to "ponder upon the things which I have said."<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>There are many references to the word pondering in the scriptures and the history of the Church. There are examples of pondering in discoveries in the sciences. There are ponderings that are part of artistic creations. &nbsp;<br /><br />In Doctrine and Covenants, section 138, President Joseph F. Smith gives us a powerful example of pondering. Let me read verses 1 - 3 and verse 11.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What does it mean to ponder? We have to learn how to ponder. We have to shut out the noise, the background music, the phone. Pondering requires process, focus, and effort. Like the counsel given to Oliver Cowdery, you must study it out in your mind.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I encourage you as students to ponder upon the value and process for deep learning and understanding.</p>
<p>The effort of pondering had an influence upon a young boy. The Prophet Joseph tells of his experience after reading in the Epistle of James:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This effort of pondering had an impact on you and me.&nbsp; I hope that the thoughts on learning have caused you to ponder.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the direction to create a House of Learning is vital for our progression and sanctification. We need not separate temporal and spiritual learnings--in fact, we should rejoice in the blessing of being at this university with this climate for learning. Learning is part of the gospel--to know of the things of the earth, to learn from good books, to enjoy the arts, to know of those things that will help you professionally, to know of and apply the teachings of the scriptures.<br /><br />I pray that your vision and understanding of the importance of learning will increase in order that you might take advantage of your opportunities. Your Father in Heaven knows you individually. He cares about you. He loves you. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>President and Sister Clark, we express to you our thanks our love and appreciation for the incredible work you are doing here at BYU-Idaho. This University has become and will continue to be an example to the education communities around the world of innovation, teaching, learning and creating. Thank you for your willingness to leave the Harvard School of Business and bring your creativity and revelation to this beautiful campus.<br /><br />Marcia and I consider it a great blessing to be on the campus of BYU-Idaho today. I have very fond memories of this campus.&nbsp; This is probably ancient, Old Testament type history for you, but you may not know that the MTC was on this campus in the mid 1970's, for the languages of Scandinavia. I was called at age 19 to serve a mission in Finland. I came here, to a much smaller campus, for eight weeks to learn the Finnish language. This is a picture of my MTC group outside the Manwarring Center. I was joined by missionaries going to Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. These grounds are sacred to me because of that experience.&nbsp; It was here that I learned my first Finnish word. It was here that I learned hard work and dedication and what I needed to change to become a missionary. During those days, as a 19 year old, walking the paths of this campus, I didn't know what my future held. I never imagined then, that I would be standing here today speaking with you. When I was 19 and on this campus, I have another memory. I had apprehension about the future. I didn't know what Finland would be like.&nbsp; I often worried about my future education, employment, finding a wife and beginning a family. Today, as you look towards your future, you might also have apprehension about the unknown.<br /><br />It is about your future that I would like to speak today. My wife Marcia has a very unique trait that she has allowed me to share with you today.&nbsp; She loves to read and she has read many good books. Before she was able to load a book on her iPad, she bought books the old fashioned way. They were made of paper and glue and cardboard.&nbsp; You might remember those days. As we were traveling together, or as she was at home reading, I would notice that she was beginning a new book. Within a very short period of time I would notice that she was all of a sudden reading the very last chapter of the new book. I would say to her, "I know you are a fast reader, but that is really fast.&nbsp; How did you get to the end of the book so quickly?" Over time, and over 36 years of marriage now, I know that as soon as Marcia gets interested in a book, and especially the lives of the characters, she is drawn to the last chapter because she is so anxious to see if the characters she now loves find happiness. She will continue to read the book and loves the book, but she wants to know how it ends before she can go back to the beginning.<br /><br />Your generation has a phrase for that.&nbsp; You call it a "spoiler." My kids think I am the worst when it comes to spoiling a movie or a book.&nbsp; They tell me that if I have seen a movie or read a book before they have, that I am so anxious to share with them the ending that I spoil the experience for them. If I ever begin to tell them about a movie they have not seen or a book they have not read, they say to me, "Dad, stop!&nbsp; Don't say another word. I haven't seen that movie or read that book yet."&nbsp;<br /><br />I have wondered how this idea of a "spoiler" applies to you and your future. If I said to all of you today, I can tell you how your life story ends, would you be like my wife Marcia and want to skip to the end of the book and read the last chapter?&nbsp; Or, would you be like my kids and say, "Stop Elder Nielson, I don't want to know the ending yet, you will spoil it for me."<br /><br />Because my kids know that I cannot avoid sharing the end of a good movie or good book, even before they have seen or read it, I am about to tell you the wonderful ending of your life story. I believe that if you know how your life story ends, you will be much better equipped to face the challenges that come to you every day. This is a major "spoiler alert".<br /><br />There are certain things I know about each of you. You are wonderful, faithful, young men and young women who have kept the commandments of God and have qualified yourselves to attend this University. You have been recommended by your Bishop and your Stake President.&nbsp; They have certified to the University that you are an exemplary, righteous young man or young woman. You are on the path to eternal life.&nbsp; The Savior taught in Matthew 7:14: "Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it."&nbsp; You are among the fortunate few who have found the path.</p>
<p>Lehi describes you this way in the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>You are these valiant people who have found the straight and narrow path, who have caught hold of the iron rod and who have made your way to the tree and have partaken of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describing your current state in the Book of Mormon, Nephi says to you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.&nbsp; Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: (are you ready for the spoiler) Ye shall have eternal life."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>As you continue to press forward with faith in Christ, you will have eternal life with the Father. It is this restored knowledge of the plan of happiness that has attracted new converts for centuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's see if we can get an even better description of your future. This is another spoiler alert:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has given-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"They are they who are the church of the Firstborn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"These are they who are just men [and women] made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.&nbsp; These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all..."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I promise you who are here today, who have been baptized and confirmed faithful members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who have received or will receive the ordinances of the Temple; and who will endure to the end;&nbsp; that is your future. I really can't say that is how your life ends, because that is really how your eternal life begins.</p>
<p>You might say to me, "but, I have a lot of living to do. I am still really young. How do I know that this will be my future? What if I make some mistakes?&nbsp; What if trials come to me in my life?"</p>
<p>My response would be that I know that you will make mistakes and I guarantee you trials will come, but as you continue to repent and endure faithfully, the promises are sure.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's assume then that you continue on your current path and you faithfully endure to the end. By doing so, the Lord tells us that he is bound when we do what he says.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;If my spoiler is correct and you know how your mortal life ends; if you understand that you are promised eternal life with the Father; then I have an important question for you to ponder today: With the knowledge of your future safely in hand, how will you now live your life from day to day?<br /><br />I am fascinated by a statement made by Nephi in the Book of Mormon. He and his family along with his brothers Jacob and Joseph and their families separated themselves from Laman and Lemuel and they established a righteous life together. Nephi describes this choice and their life in very simple terms.&nbsp; He says in 2 Nephi 5:27 "And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness."<br /><br />Is it possible for you be happy in your life and still face sin and trials? I would say to you that once you understand the end of your mortal life story and that you have been promised life with the Father, you become free from the worries of this world to act for yourself. To move forward with faith, no fear and to accomplish all that you desire in righteousness. The Savior taught his disciples, "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;How does knowing the truth about God and His Son Jesus Christ and the end of your mortal life make you free and allow you to move forward with no fear?<br /><br />What does this look like when you wake up tomorrow and start a new day?<br /><br />Marcia and I have been young single and young married adults just like you. We have watched our six children go through high school, missions, dating, college, marriage, employment and kids. Two of our sons are still seeking degrees.&nbsp; We have seen the obstacles that stand in your way of living after the manner of happiness. May I offer a few suggestions to help you along the way?<br /><br />In our premortal life the Father explained his plan to us.&nbsp; He told us we would come here and receive one of these bodies. We learned that we would have appetites and passions that would be difficult to control and that we would sin. We also learned that in order to make it back to the father we had to be clean. We had a serious dilemma, how could we sin and also be clean? The Father promised us that he would provide a Savior for us who would come and atone for our sins. We shouted for joy. The Savior came in the meridian of time and he has atoned for your sins if you will repent.&nbsp; Do you want to be free? Do you want to live after the manner of happiness with no fear?&nbsp; Let the Savior take your sins. Too often we profess a belief in the Savior and His atonement, but we don't think it will actually work for us.&nbsp; We carry our own sins.&nbsp; We worry, we doubt and sometimes face despair. That is not God's plan for you. From the very beginning He told us the Savior would atone for our sins if we would repent. Let him do it. There is no reason for you to carry your own sins any longer. If you will do this, you will be free to act for yourself.&nbsp;<br /><br />I learned this lesson from a faithful missionary that I interviewed during a Mission Tour a few years ago. His President told me that this missionary was one of the hardest workers in the Mission. He was obedient and strong, but he was carrying with him every day some things that he had done in his past and he could not get happy. &nbsp;As I spoke with him I asked him what he had done. He shared with me a past, serious transgression. I asked if he had confessed this to his Bishop and Stake President before his mission. He had done that.&nbsp; I asked him if he had asked forgiveness from those he had hurt or offended. He had done that. I asked if he had sought forgiveness in prayer from his Heavenly Father. He had done that. I then asked him, "Why do you want to pay for your own sins when the Savior has already paid for them?" He is standing at the door and knocking. He is inviting you to come and partake of the fruit of His atonement.&nbsp; Turn it over to him. Let it go. Let Him take it. I shared with him that the very message of the gospel he was teaching each day was the message he needed to hear. "Go thy way and sin no more."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy sins are forgiven."<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>As we talked and shed some tears, he finally got it and I felt like he left behind in the office that day a huge burden he had been carrying. He left like he was floating. He was free.&nbsp; He was living after the manner of happiness.<br /><br />My young brothers and sisters on this campus, if you are still trying to pay for your own sins, understand that you are missing the very essence of God's plan for you. The Savior has paid the price already. It is only Satan who wants you to think you can't be forgiven and that you have to pay for your own sins.&nbsp; Let them go and do it today. Because you know how your life story ends, your daily happiness comes as you free yourself from thinking and worrying about your past sins.&nbsp; You might ask, but what if I sin again? Then you repent again. Let the Savior take your sins. Let the redeeming power of the Atonement work for you.<br /><br />What else might stand in your way of living after the manner of happiness?&nbsp; Most people would tell you that it is the difficult trials that will confront you throughout your life. These trials may be physical or emotional illness, family difficulties, school work, dating, employment, not enough money. What about trials? How can you possibly live after the manner of happiness and be faced with trials?&nbsp;<br /><br />In the premortal life the Father explained to us that we would come here to earth to be tested and tried. You knew that when you accepted the plan. Trials are not only a part of our earthly existence, they are essential to our progression. It is how we become. I had a General Authority tell me years ago that if I didn't have any trials in my life, the plan wasn't working for me.<br /><br />When I was your age, the Prophet was Spencer W. Kimball. As he became older he had many challenges with his health. He suffered from heart problems; he had cancer of the larynx and had to reteach himself how to speak. He had a subdural hematoma, which is fluid on the brain. After all of his trials and difficulties, do you know what he taught as he returned to General Conference? He said, "Give me this mountain, give me these challenges."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I remember being stunned. Why after all he had been through would he ask for another mountain, for more challenges? He taught us with the example of his life that we grow through trials.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is fascinating to me to think that our pioneer ancestors, those who lost limbs and lives and loved ones as they crossed the United States said after all their suffering, "We became acquainted with God in our extremities."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;If you know the end of your mortal life, and I already gave you the spoiler, you are going to live life eternally with the Father, then can you and I find freedom and happiness in knowing that the trials we face in life are learning experiences? They forge our souls and help us become more like God. You may not feel you are ready to pray for a trial like President Kimball, but if you will embrace your trials and ask yourself, "What can I learn for my eternal life from this?" As you have faith in Jesus Christ, He will lift you up and direct your paths and will help you overcome.&nbsp; His invitation in Matthew is "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.... For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you know what I was doing exactly one year ago today, November 11, 2013? I was in the Area office in the Philippines with individual pictures of 204 missionaries on a big screen in a conference room. I was surrounded by my counselors and the Philippines Area Office staff and we were trying to figure out how to rescue the 204 missionaries from a disaster zone in Tacloban. Typhoon Haiyan had just hit the Tacloban Mission. It brought with it a 25 foot tsunami wave along with 200 mile an hour winds.&nbsp; It is reported to be one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the face of the earth. Thousands were killed and one million left homeless. We had no communication, no transportation, no electricity and we didn't know if our missionaries were alive. Over a four day period of time two by two we located those missionaries and they were rescued from a tragic site of death and devastation. As we brought them to Manila and they were able to assimilate what had happened to them, do you know what we found? We found missionaries who were wise beyond their years. They had gone through a trial so big and so devastating and they had learned so much about themselves that as time passed they began to see this experience as a blessing both to them and the people who lived in Tacloban. Sister Nielson and I met with all of them in April as they all returned to Tacloban to finish their missions. We found a strong, resilient, faithful group of missionaries who understood that they could withstand one of the most devastating trials of their lives and they could learn from it. They were back in the exact place where they had experienced that trial, living after the manner of happiness.<br /><br />Knowing the end of your mortal life story and the beginning of your eternal life can free you from despair and help you gain an eternal perspective of your trials. Don't let your trials own you. You own them. Because you know the truth and the truth has set you free, you can look in the face of adversity with faith and ask this powerful question, "what can I learn from this?" Joseph Smith was taught this lesson so well in D&amp;C 122:7, "know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good."&nbsp; Embrace your trials and live after the manner of happiness.&nbsp; You know how the story ends, so move forward with faith, not fear.<br /><br />Your next question for me might be, "Okay, Elder Nielson, I understand that I can be free from sin and I understand that I can grow from my trials, but when I am in the middle of sin and trials it feels hopeless. What can I do in the moment to obtain the strength to overcome sin and to make it through some very difficult trials?" That my young brothers and sisters, is an excellent question and is perhaps the most important thing we can discuss today.<br /><br />We have spoken of the redeeming power of the Savior's Atonement. We all know that through the infinite atonement the Savior has paid for your sins. But we must know as we make our way through this life that there is also an "enabling power" that can make your burdens light and allow you to live after the manner of happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Bednar stated in our last April General Conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...Do we also understand that the Atonement is for faithful men and women who are obedient, worthy, and conscientious and who are striving to become better and serve more faithfully? I wonder if we fail to fully acknowledge this strengthening aspect of the Atonement in our lives and mistakenly believe we must carry our load all alone-through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline and with our obviously limited capacities."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Alma learned this lesson in the Book of Mormon as he and his people were faced with a trial that required them to literally carry heavy physical burdens on their back every day. Alma and his people prayed to the Lord. Interestingly the Lord did not change their circumstances at first, He did not remove the burdens from their backs, but he did something quite unexpected. We read in Mosiah 24:15, "And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key tomorrow when you wake up and face the burdens of your life is to submit cheerfully and with patience to the will of the Lord.&nbsp; Allow the Savior's enabling power of the Atonement to make your burdens light. As Elder Bednar taught us, you do not need to carry your load alone.<br /><br />As you struggle with sin and pass through trials, can the Lord make your burdens light? Yes he can. We see it every day.&nbsp; How do single students who go to school, work, serve others, date and keep the commandments live after the manner of happiness? It is the Lord's enabling power of the Atonement. How do young parents who have been sealed in the Temple go to school, work two jobs, have children and still live after the manner of happiness? It is the enabling power of the Atonement. The Lord lifts us up and makes us equal to our trials.&nbsp; He helps us and heals us.<br /><br />So, you know now, how your mortal life will end. You have heard the spoiler. If you endure to the end you will have eternal life, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God. Knowing the end now, will you free yourself from sin, embrace your trials with faith and allow the enabling power of the Atonement to make your burdens light and bring you to the point where you and your family "live after the manner of happiness."<br /><br />It is my testimony to you that as you remain faithful; the Lord has promised you all that the Father hath. He is inviting you to come.&nbsp; He has offered you His only begotten Son who has freed you from sin and is now offering you His Atonement to help you on your journey home as you go from good to better to best to Saint.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;May you have eyes to see and ears to hear the wonderful blessings God has promised to those who love Him.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Nearly five years ago I had the opportunity to meet with President Clark while applying to become a faculty member in the BYU-Idaho Art Department. Toward the end of our interview I asked him if he would share his biggest concern for the students at BYU-Idaho. After some thoughtful contemplation he replied, "to help them keep the world out of their hearts. It gets in so easily." I have though a lot about that comment during the ensuing five years and would like to share some thoughts on that topic today. I'll begin by asking you three questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) In a world rife with turmoil, what is the greatest danger you will face in the future?<br />2) What will protect you from that danger?<br />3) What does that protection cost?</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, ancient prophets not only saw our day but worked hard to tell us what we would need to know. The scriptures are filled with information both about and for us. We know that our time will be both wonderful and tumultuous. Many of those ancient prophets rejoiced to see the gospel of Jesus Christ spread across the earth, temples multiply, and the word of God become so accessible to so many of God's children. However, along with these visions of hope and righteousness, prophets have also foretold that the earth would experience turmoil and that the adversary would increase his efforts.</p>
<p>The scriptures tell us that we will experience great pollutions, there will be wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes and other natural disasters, and that there will be famines and pestilences across the earth.&nbsp;More troubling than these external difficulties will be the turmoil raging in human hearts.&nbsp;The ancient apostle Paul provided a long list of the ways this turmoil will manifest itself. Among other things, Paul warned that men&nbsp;would become covetous and proud, unthankful and unholy, despising those&nbsp;that&nbsp;are&nbsp;good. That they would be high-minded,&nbsp;having&nbsp;a&nbsp;form&nbsp;of&nbsp;godliness,&nbsp;but&nbsp;denying&nbsp;the&nbsp;power&nbsp;thereof, and that they would ultimately love&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;more&nbsp;than they would love God.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The Savior Himself taught that in the last days that&nbsp;"... because&nbsp;iniquity&nbsp;shall&nbsp;abound,&nbsp;the&nbsp;love&nbsp;of&nbsp;many&nbsp;shall&nbsp;wax cold"<sup>2</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and that&nbsp;"... men's&nbsp;hearts shall&nbsp;fail&nbsp;them;&nbsp;for&nbsp;fear&nbsp;shall&nbsp;come&nbsp;upon&nbsp;all&nbsp;people."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Because the gospel of Jesus Christ nurtures faith, not fear, we must be careful that fear does not overshadow our faith and that we allow anxiety to overwhelm us. Many of these latter-day problems, when viewed through the eye of faith, are only temporary anyway. However, some are not. The Savior explained this distinction to His apostles when He taught, "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Although media outlets report daily about the physical dangers--the wars, natural disasters, and epidemics--we must not let these things trouble us to the point where our hearts fail us. However, please note that only the prophets of God are clearly reporting on the real danger, drawing our attention to those things that will destroy the soul. If we have ears to hear and eyes to see, our prophet will help us discern the nearly invisible flaxen chords Satan is subtly weaving to lead mankind carefully down to hell where he will bind with the unbreakable chains of spiritual death.<br /><br />Again, the greatest dangers we face are not physical. They will not come from an epidemic, a natural disaster, or from war, but rather from distraction, disinterest, and doubt. These dangers are so real because their consequences aren't temporary. They are eternal.<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi introduces us to two such dangers through an inspired dream he experienced. He describes the first danger as mists of darkness, both dull and subtle, that would become exceedingly thick. In our day these mists present themselves in the form of entertainment that encourages carnal pleasure and the philosophies of the world that can dull our spiritual senses and blind our minds, that distort our perception of the truth until we can't see the difference between good and evil and morality becomes relative.<br /><br />The other danger Lehi witnessed presented itself as a sharp and confrontational finger of scorn leveled at those who would follow Christ. This finger mocks in an effort to intimidate and shame those who seek righteousness because it is not culturally correct.&nbsp;Again, these dangers are real and, as the scriptures warn, will increase in both subtlety and in brazenness as we progress towards the Savior's eventual return.<br /><br />What will protect us from these dangers? Fortunately, Lehi's dream not only reveals the dangers but also teaches about that protection which God has prepared for His children. In the account of this dream we are introduced to a strait and narrow path, a rod of iron, and ultimately to a tree of eternal life bearing fruit that is precious above all other fruit. By studying these metaphors more closely we can understand the protection our loving Heavenly Father has provided for each of us and the price we must each pay for such protection.<br /><br />Let's first concentrate on the iron rod. The prophet Nephi taught that it is a representation of the word of God. He then explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"... whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Although we might be accustomed to thinking of the word of God as the scriptures and as conference talks, it is much, much more than that. Elder Lance Wickham explains that, "At a more specific level, [the word of God] is the sacred covenants between God and man." In this light, because we understand a covenant to be a promise between two individuals, the word of God can literally be viewed as God's word, His part of the promise extended to us and given on His integrity of character. &nbsp;Elder D. Todd Christofferson explains that when God enters into a covenant with us He, "... binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Just think of it. God binds Himself to us through His covenant promise. What a powerfully reassuring thought. As part of His covenant God gives His word that, if we trust Him, all things will be turned for our good. When we trust God's word we trust His plan of salvation for each of us, including both its trials and rewards. We trust that He knows us each individually and is personally engaged in our salvation. We trust that His instructions to us will really work and that the things He warns us against really are harmful for us.<br /><br />Thus, to hold fast to the iron rod is to trust God implicitly, to hold on when the mists of darkness become exceedingly dark, when the broad roads and spacious buildings become most alluring, or when our hearts are heavy from the difficulty of the path we must travel.<br /><br />Do you trust God's word? Do you believe He will keep His promise to you?&nbsp;Ultimately, God's promise to each of us is embodied in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;The apostle John taught, "In&nbsp;the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;was&nbsp;the&nbsp;Word,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Word&nbsp;was&nbsp;with&nbsp;God, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Word&nbsp;was&nbsp;God....And&nbsp;the&nbsp;Word&nbsp;was&nbsp;made&nbsp;flesh,&nbsp;and&nbsp;dwelt&nbsp;among&nbsp;us."<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Jesus Christ is central to our Heavenly Father's plan for His children. In giving His Word, God gave us His Only Begotten who, in turn, gave Himself a ransom for us.&nbsp;So, to hold fast to the iron rod is to both believe that Christ is mighty to save and to accept that we must live by every word that proceeds forth from His mouth.&nbsp;Do you believe that through the atonement of Jesus Christ you can be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel?<br /><br />There are always two parties in a covenant relationship. If we view the iron rod as symbolizing God's part of the agreement, we can then view the strait and narrow path as our covenant promise to God. Unlike God's word, which is constant, steadfast, and eternal, our word to Him represents a journey of becoming. When we enter a covenant with God we give our word that we will change, that we will put off the natural man through the process of conversion. We promise to go wherever the path leads us and do whatever our Father calls us to do. We commit ourselves to the journey of discipleship.<br /><br />Please note the description of our part of the covenant. The term "strait and narrow" is important. First, note that the word strait is spelled s-t-r-a-i-t, not s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t. Lehi was not describing a path that never turned to the left or the right. Rather, he chose a word that has many different interpretations. The most common synonym for strait is narrow. Lehi could have certainly chosen this redundancy--narrow and narrow--to emphasize the nature of our covenant. Repetition is a Hebrew literary technique used for emphasis, much like the phrase "remember, remember," found often in the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />Other definitions for the word strait proffer even greater understanding of the nature of our covenant path. For instance, Strait can mean:</p>
<p>Each of these definitions sheds wonderful light on the nature of our covenant promise and what God expects from His children who enter that covenant.<br /><br />That last definition, tightly drawn, tight-fitting, or binding, provides the origin for the word strait jacket. However, unlike a strait jacket, which is usually forcefully fitted to its wearer, God will never bind us against our will. If we become bound by our covenants to God it is because we chose to. When we talk of being bound by God's laws or by our duty to Him, we are really talking about our willingness to be bound.<br /><br />The strait and narrow path stands in stark contrast to other elements in Lehi's dream: the spacious field, the broad roads, and the great and spacious building. Each of these symbols promise wide-open expanse in contrast to the strictness of discipleship, marketing individual expression, carnal pleasure, and total freedom from obligation as more fulfilling than the exacting commitments God requires. Please remember that none of these advertisements can deliver on their promise. In fact, they are cunning devices crafted by the adversary to ultimately bind us to him with a binding worse than any man-made strait jacket provides. There is no freedom in sin. As a bishop I have watched helplessly as individuals have disregarded their covenants, choosing instead the fake freedom of the broad roads and spacious buildings. I have also struggled and cried and prayed along side many who, tightly bound by the fetters of addiction or the consequences of sin, long for the peace and protection that comes from binding ourselves to God. Our covenants protect us.<br /><br />What is the price of this protection? To explore this question I'd like to discuss the three different groups of people in Lehi's dream who commence on the strait and narrow path intending to reach the tree of life. Nephi explains that baptism is the gateway covenant that leads to that path. He teaches, "For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost. And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>With this in mind let's view these three groups of individuals in Lehi's dream as baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ who have entered into a covenant with God and have commenced on their journey toward eternal life. These groups comprise of, (1) those who attempt the journey without holding on to the iron rod, (2) those who complete the journey only to be shamed away by the mocking coming from the great and spacious building, and (3) those who complete the journey, partake of the fruit of the tree of eternal life and who are subsequently filled with such light and joy that the pointing fingers have no effect and the forbidden paths have no allure.<br /><br />Many of God's covenant children attempt to walk the covenant path without holding on to the iron rod without trusting in God's word. This happens in one of two ways. First, we may not trust that God knows us, that He knows when we are suffering, or that He can turn that suffering to our good and for our exaltation. This doubting approach to discipleship happens far too often.<br /><br />&nbsp;The other way we attempt to travel the strait and narrow path with out the safety of the iron rod occurs when we justify actions that oppose God's word or when we rationalize thoughts and opinions that contradict His guidance. When we do this we cease holding onto the iron rod and attempt the journey unaided, trusting our own judgment over God's. In either of these two circumstances, not trusting God's intentions or not trusting His wisdom, the outcome is the same: we inevitably become lost in the mists of darkness leaving ourselves vulnerable, without any protection from the merciless enemy of our souls.<br /><br />The second group in Lehi's dream traveled along the strait and narrow path getting close enough to the tree of eternal life to actually taste its fruit. But they were still vulnerable, embarrassed at being identified as saints when mocking came from the great and spacious building. The results were devastating. Nephi records, "And after they had&nbsp;tasted&nbsp;of the fruit they were&nbsp;ashamed, because of those that were&nbsp;scoffing&nbsp;at them; and they&nbsp;fell away into forbidden paths and were lost."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>How could this happen? Didn't they have the same experience Lehi did when he tasted the fruit? Listen to Lehi's description of his experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>When comparing the actions of this second group to the description Lehi gave of the fruit itself I can't help but wonder, "did these people taste the same thing Lehi tasted?" I don't think they did. What would keep them from experiencing a sweetness that filled Lehi's soul with exceedingly great joy? I have some thoughts I'd like to share. If the covenant path is ultimately a path of conversion, of changing from the natural man into an individual prepared for eternal life, then this second group seems to have gone through the motions of change without actually changing. In other words, although these individuals followed the strait and narrow path holding to the iron rod, they were not sufficiently binding themselves to God along the way for their covenants to protect them when that protection was most needed.</p>
<p>Although there could be various reasons why these individuals were not fully changed through their covenant journey, one reason might be found in the weakness they exhibited that ultimately proved their destruction: their concern for the opinions of others. Could it be that by merely clinging to God's word instead of holding fast to it--a distinction addressed by Elder David A. Bednar during his October 2011 conference address--that these individuals were splitting their allegiance? In similar fashion to Abraham's nephew, Lot, who pitched his tent in the fertile valleys of the Promised Land but directed the door of that tent toward Sodom and Gomorra, we place our whole covenant process in jeopardy when we continue to look back at the world we are working to leave behind, to hold on to desires for broad roads and spacious buildings, even if we believe those desires are harmless. To bind ourselves to God we must also actively unbind ourselves from the world, from cultural norms, family traditions, and personal philosophies that tug our attention away from the eternally important journey of discipleship.<br /><br />The Book of Mormon prophet Alma clearly explained that the desires of our heart will play a pivotal role in determining the final outcome of our mortal experience.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; And Elder Neal A Maxwell explained that we allow our desires to determine how susceptible we are to the world:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What we are speaking about is so much more than merely deflecting temptations for which we somehow do not feel responsible. Remember, brothers and sisters, it is our own desires which determine the sizing and the attractiveness of various temptations. We set our thermostats as to temptations."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Do you desire to make and keep sacred covenants with your Father in Heaven? Do you desire the changes the covenant path will bring? Or, does your heart really desire other things? Too often we approach our covenants with God through what my brother-in-law calls the tax code approach to discipleship; always searching for a loophole so we don't have to pay the full price that such discipleship demands. This will not work because covenants are not about what we get in exchange for what we give, but rather what we are willing to become because of what we desire more and whom we trust most. If you look for opportunities to skirt around your commitment to abide by the honor code, including the dress and grooming standards, if you look for opportunities to dress immodestly now because one day you plan to enter the holy temple and will then have to give up immodest dress, if you look for entertainment that is titillating but not technically pornography, you are bound by loopholes, not covenants. Unless you change your desires now your fate will be that of the five foolish virgins who knew the gospel in theory but never paid the price to know Jesus. Please do not let this happen!</p>
<p>So, what was different about that third group? Why were they able to successfully travel the strait and narrow path, partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and ultimately experience the same joy that Lehi experienced? Remember that they also suffered through the mists of darkness and were not spared the scorn and ridicule coming from the great and spacious building. How did they remain covenant keepers when other covenant makers failed to? There must be something in the way this third group approached that journey which made the difference. Nephi explains that they "<em>held fast"</em>&nbsp;to the iron rod as they pressed forward along the path. Remember, to hold fast to God's word is to implicitly trust both His intentions and His wisdom. We must believe in the power of Christ's atonement and in His grace sufficiently that we intentionally live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, including those words delivered through His prophets. Doing so will require sacrifice. Christ teaches this relationship between covenants and sacrifice:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command--they are accepted of me."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What will we be called to sacrifice in exchange for covenant protection? Like Lamoni's father, we will need to give away all our sins to know God. Like Saul of Tarsus who originally sought to persecute the followers of Christ, we will need to give away any deeply held but wrong belief or tradition. If we are prideful we must pay the price to become humble. Bitterness, anger, and hurt must be replaced with forgiveness, coveting with charity, and distraction with active effort. We must sacrifice anything that is keeping us from becoming converted, including our desires for these things.The cost of covenant protection, then, is to not only faithfully sacrifice the things of this world, but to actively educate our desires so that, instead of craving the praise and possessions of this world, we hunger and thirst after righteousness. Only then will our hearts be honest and fortified against letting the world in.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this may seem like a steep price. But remember, with God, all things are possible. Hold fast to His word. Christ's grace is sufficient to strengthen any one of you who desire to make and keep sacred covenants, even if that desire is tentative at first. The price is not out of reach for anyone. Here is the Lord's promise to all who do pay the price for covenant protection, "For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>That promise is a promise not only of protection but ultimately of exaltation. It is a valid promise that will be honored especially today, in this wonderful but tumultuous world.<br /><br />Now, I would like to speak specifically to a group of individuals who I have learned to care deeply for during my service as a bishop. There are members in the church, some probably in this audience, who have faithfully strived to follow the covenant path but are experiencing heartache, feelings of betrayal, and even drastic life changes because others, who you trusted, have violated their own sacred covenants through abuse, infidelity, or addiction. As a result you may be questioning your own self worth.<br /><br />You may be wondering how God could allow such things to happen. You may feel doubt or even despair concerning your own covenants. Whatever you do, do not let go of God's word! Please hold on to Christ. The healing power of His atoning sacrifice is especially for you. Because we live in a fallen world and because agency is so important to Heavenly Father's plan of salvation, we will each experience consequences resulting from other people's actions. This is precisely why we need covenant protection. Your God will not abandon you. He will strengthen you through your own covenants to bear up this burden. But you must trust Him enough to do everything He guides you to do, especially as He guides you through how to forgive those who have hurt you.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, your covenants do matter. Being bound to God through them is the only protection you have to escape being bound by Satan. But you must be willing to be completely bound by your covenants. In Lehi's dream, those who moved toward the tree of eternal life while still holding on to the world in their hearts suffered the same fate as those who actively sought the broad roads or spacious building. The gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in these latter days specifically so we could have access to covenant protection. God lives. He loves each of His children perfectly. Jesus Christ is the perfect mediator in God's plan of salvation. He is mighty to save each one of us if we will honestly and completely trust Him. I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was almost three years ago when I first entered this beautiful building and felt the remarkable spirit here. I had come to BYU-Idaho for a job interview, and had just found out I had been offered the position. I was filled with gratitude and awe. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that the Lord had granted me such an amazing opportunity. What a wonderful blessing it is to work on this extraordinary campus and associate with each one of you! I have thought a lot about the experiences that brought me here as well as the work that lies before me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I wish with all my heart to help you understand how much the Lord loves each of you. I pray that His intended message will sink deep into your souls and will enable you to become better acquainted with Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are familiar with stories of the Mormon handcart pioneers. These dedicated Church members lacked the funds to purchase teams and wagons to cross the plains to join the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley, and so they traveled from Iowa City to Salt Lake on foot pulling or pushing their belongings in handcarts. The Willie and Martin Handcart Companies left late in the season and were caught by early snowstorms in Wyoming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In describing his experience, Francis Webster, a survivor of the Martin Handcart Company said, &ldquo;We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities. I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it. I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there. Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to reach our extremity? In the case of the Martin Handcart pioneers, it was a moment marked by imminent destruction or death. For you and me, it might be a time when we have reached our breaking point or a time of great and critical need.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Consider the experiences of Abraham when he was about to sacrifice Isaac, Job when he had lost everything, Joseph Smith&rsquo;s experience in Liberty Jail and Jesus Christ&rsquo;s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross at Calvary. Our extremities seem to vary depending upon our experience, the lessons we need to learn and the faith we need to gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical need for me occurred when I went back to school to earn my degree. Though I had many educational opportunities earlier in my life, I began my university studies in earnest when I was thirty-one years old. Up until that time, I didn&rsquo;t feel the need or recognize the importance of a formal education. After all, I just wanted to be a wife and a mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had three young children at the time, and a husband whose health was failing rapidly. Cancer and its effects had taken their toll on him for almost ten years. It became obvious to us all that he would not live much longer and the responsibility to support our family would soon fall upon my shoulders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, I took evening classes at Dixie College, but my degree soon required daytime attendance at Southern Utah University, about an hour away. That first morning, I prepared my husband&rsquo;s breakfast and medications, hoped my oldest child would get ready for school on time, and took my two youngest children to daycare before driving to Cedar City. My wonderful Relief Society President volunteered to check on my husband at noon and bring in lunch each day during the summer quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came home, I fixed dinner, attended to my family and then went to bed&mdash;too tired to focus on homework. Each weekday during that term, I followed a similar schedule, waking well before dawn to complete the homework that was due that day in order to care for my family when I got home. Though it seemed impossible, I completed thirty credit hours that summer, and even made the Dean&rsquo;s List. A week after the quarter ended, my husband died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t suffer in the way that Francis Webster described, though I did become better acquainted with God though my extremity. I often felt that I could only complete one more assignment or fix one more meal, or get up early one more day, and then I would need to quit, but then somehow I had the capacity to do more. I was able to get by with less sleep, finish assignments in less time and still take care of my family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was nothing short of miraculous and I had a remarkable learning experience! I know that the Holy Ghost supported and assisted me in my studies. He helped me think clearly, improved my memory, gave me insight and understanding and comforted me when I became overwhelmed. My studies gave me hope and allowed me to focus on the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few years, I went on to complete my associate&rsquo;s and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees. After my second marriage ended in divorce, I completed my master&rsquo;s degree. This experience was even more challenging for me, and for my family. I was working full-time with a full course load, three teenagers and a demanding calling. There were times when my sorrow almost overcame me and I worried that I might become bitter and distance myself from the Lord. I knew my confidence had been shaken and I was concerned that my faith might not sustain me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here then is a great truth.&rdquo; said President James E. Faust in a 1979 General Conference address. &ldquo;In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner&rsquo;s fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. In this way the divine image can be mirrored from the soul. It is part of the purging toll exacted of some to become acquainted with God. In the agonies of life, we seem to listen better to the faint, godly whisperings of the Divine Shepherd.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember walking in the crisp North Dakota air before dawn one morning, lamenting my trials, and asking Heavenly Father why He had given me so much to bear. I felt overwhelmed and in deep despair. I couldn&rsquo;t understand why&mdash;when I was trying so hard to be good&mdash;life was so difficult and seemed so hopeless. I had reached my extremity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point, there came into my mind these words, &ldquo;Lynne, if I gave you anything easier, you would just do it yourself, and you wouldn&rsquo;t come to rely on Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience that day was an epiphany for me! I began to understand how very much my Heavenly Father loved me and how important He felt it was for me to come unto Him, get to know Him and learn to rely on Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amaleki wrote, &ldquo;And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That day I came to understand more fully that I was worth redeeming, and that if I allowed it to, God&rsquo;s love and the Savior&rsquo;s Atonement would heal me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in a 2009 <em>Ensign</em> article, &ldquo;&hellip;every experience can become a redemptive experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through it. These difficult lessons teach us that man&rsquo;s extremity is God&rsquo;s opportunity, and if we will be humble and faithful, if we will be believing and not curse God for our problems, He can turn the unfair and inhumane and debilitating prisons of our lives into temples&mdash;or at least into a circumstance that can bring comfort and revelation, divine companionship and peace.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a decision that day to tie myself to God and become better acquainted with Him. Today I would like to share five things I&rsquo;ve learned that will help us bind ourselves to God in our extremities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Come Unto Christ</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, come unto Christ. He has invited us all to come unto Him. Through Isaiah the Lord said, &ldquo;Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;When Jesus Christ was on the earth he taught us to come unto Him, take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, and that when we did so, we would find rest unto our souls.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my divorce, I cried every day; often more than once. Initially, I cried through entire Sacrament Meetings and temple sessions. Then little by little over time my grief began to subside. Though I wanted the pain to end quickly and completely, that is not what happened. Eventually, I was able to go through an entire week without tears. I found rest to my soul in much the same way that Alma and his people were blessed. &ldquo;And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions. And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have learned that seeking the Savior often and consistently and asking for strength beyond our own helps us carry the burdens we&rsquo;ve been given. Francis Webster described it as angels pushing his handcart. I testify that the Lord has strengthened me and promise that He will strengthen you. He will make our burdens light and we will come to know, without a doubt, that there are angels assisting us along the way.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obey with Exactness</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, obey with exactness. Obedience to God&rsquo;s laws is essential. We have been told that it is through obedience that we obtain&nbsp;blessings from God.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has promised us great and marvelous blessings and confirms that His promises are sure. He said, &ldquo;I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I begin to feel a gap in my relationship with the Lord, when I am feeling just beyond His embrace, I know I need to become more obedient. I have found that my faith and confidence grow when I obey with more exactness. This has held true for me with every law and every commandment. The following scripture from the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants has become especially dear to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out. His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand. From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail. For thus saith the Lord&mdash;I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end. Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory. And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom. Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations. And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught. For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will&mdash;yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, no yet entered into the heart of man.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have come to know for myself that the more obedient we are, the wiser we become. This wisdom comes from God. It allows us to be wiser parents, better employees and more valiant servants. I cannot explain how this is done. I only know that it is true. There are times when the things I do and say amaze me, for they do not come from my own understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi said it this way, &ldquo;And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them;&rdquo;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has been merciful and gracious to me. I have felt His strength and wisdom flow through me in my studies and in my work. I know from whence it comes. I promise that as you seek to serve God in righteousness and truth, He will bless you beyond measure. Your wisdom and understanding will become greater. You will receive power from on high to complete your work and improve your relationships with God and with others. Your burdens will become light and you will become an instrument in His hands for good.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Serve God First</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, serve God first. The Lord will make more of us than we can ever make of ourselves. When we do the Lord&rsquo;s work first, it is like paying tithing on our time. He magnifies our efforts so that we accomplish more than we could without serving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I&nbsp; regularly attend the temple to renew my covenants with the Lord and seek to minister to His children, I have always had the time I needed to finish my homework, attend my children&rsquo;s activities, fulfill my church assignments, maintain my home and support my family. While I do not have excess time, I have what I need. It&rsquo;s amazing to me; it&rsquo;s truly miraculous! President Henry B. Eyring said that &ldquo;Through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our natures can be changed. Then our power to carry burdens can be increased more than enough to compensate for the increased service we will be asked to give.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ability to carry additional burdens has not only increased because of the service I render, but because of the service others have rendered unto me. I have been especially grateful for our valiant home and visiting teachers and neighbors. They have ministered to our family and helped us do things we could not do for ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our family lived in Bismarck, North Dakota, our stake president became our home teacher. He traveled out of state frequently, but made it a point to visit our family with a lesson as often as possible and a phone call when he could not be there. One day, he called to let me know that he had asked to be released as our home teacher and had requested that another man be assigned to our family. I was devastated! He was faithful and consistent and we felt his love for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was initially skeptical our new home teacher became a wonderful blessing in our lives. He seemed to know everything about automobiles and fixing things. Three of my children still drive the cars he helped us purchase and maintain. He would often invite my children to work alongside him as he repaired their vehicles so that they could learn how to be more self-reliant. He plowed our driveway, repaired leaks, installed dryer venting and visited us with his wife and a lesson each month. I can never repay him for his loyalty and his service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson said, &ldquo;My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness&mdash;be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord&rsquo;s hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in our extremities, we can minister to others. The Lord needs us and has asked us to serve valiantly. I invite you to become more courageous and dependable in your home and visiting teaching assignments. I doubt it will be easy&mdash;nothing worthwhile ever is. The adversary will try to discourage you. It will take time, courage, consistency and love beyond your own, but the Holy Ghost will be your guide and will bless you with inspiration and guidance. I promise that you will find nothing in this life as rewarding as serving others, it will transform you!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trust God </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, trust God. &ldquo;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When things seem improbable or impossible, learn to trust God, yield your heart to Him and more fully embrace His plan. King Benjamin said, &ldquo;Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power&hellip;believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neal A Maxwell said, "When you and I finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God&rsquo;s will, then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only possession which is truly ours to give!&rdquo;<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also said, &ldquo;It is only by yielding to God that we can begin to realize His will for us. And if we truly trust God, why not yield to His loving omniscience? After all, He knows us and our possibilities much better than do we. If faithful, we end up acknowledging that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s hands and should surrender to the Lord on His terms&mdash;not ours. It is total surrender, no negotiating; it is yielding with no preconditions.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we yield our hearts unto God, we become purified and sanctified.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;While enduring the harsh conditions of Liberty Jail through the winter of 1838-39, the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote, &ldquo;Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we submit to the Lord and &ldquo;cheerfully do all things that lie in [our] power,&rdquo; remarkable things happen! Our hearts change and we are blessed well beyond our own capacity. I have experienced this in my schoolwork, in my career and in my home. I promise that as you cheerfully yield your will to God, He will show you possibilities you never imagined. You can start by asking Him what He would have you do and then act on those promptings.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abide Forever</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, abide forever. The definition of abide is to wait for, to endure, to withstand, to bear patiently, to tolerate or to accept without objection.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Malachi exclaimed, &ldquo;Who may abide the day of his coming; and who shall stand when he appeareth?&rdquo;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;When we are in our extremities, we need to learn to abide. The ability to abide will become essential as we prepare to meet God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said, &ldquo;Christ is everything to us and we are to &ldquo;abide&rdquo; in Him permanently, unyieldingly, steadfastly, forever. For the fruit of the gospel to blossom and bless our lives, we must be firmly attached to Him, the Savior of us all, and to this His Church, which bears His holy name. He is the vine that is our true source of strength and the only source of eternal life. In Him we not only will endure but also will prevail and triumph in this holy cause that will never fail us. That is the call of the gospel message to everyone in the world. Come, but come to remain. Come with conviction and endurance. Come permanently, for your sake and the sake of all the generations who must follow you, and we will help each other be strong to the very end.&rdquo;<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that our ability to abide in the Lord is a spiritual gift from God that allows us to wait upon Him forever. It comes as we consistently align ourselves with the Savior and His Gospel. It comes when we realize that His promises are sure. While we need to yield our wills to God, we cannot yield our allegiance to Him. I promise that as you abide in Him through your extremities, you will endure them well. Jesus said, &ldquo;&hellip;without me ye can do nothing.&rdquo;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;I know this to be true. I have found that I can do nothing without the Savior, but with Him I have been able to accomplish impossible things even in my extremities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, when you feel you have reached your own extremity, when you feel you can no longer pull your handcart any further, the Lord will give you courage and strength beyond your own ability as you come unto Him, obey His commandments with more exactness, serve Him first, trust Him by yielding your heart to Him and abide in Him forever. As you do these things, the cart will begin to push you. The angels will assist you and you will become better acquainted with God as a result. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen</p>

<p></p>
<p>I love our devotional music and admire those who provide it for us. Thank you.&nbsp; And thank you for the prayer and the scripture.<br /><br />As a librarian I would be remiss if I did not recommend to you today a book or two, or maybe, three.&nbsp; The first by President Boyd K. Packer titled&nbsp;<em>Teach Ye Diligently</em>,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn1" target="_self">[1]</a>&nbsp;I wish I had read it and begun applying its principles much earlier in life.&nbsp; It is as much an invitation to teach well, as it is an invitation to parent well; perhaps they are one and the same thing.&nbsp; So you young parents read it soon, don't delay.&nbsp; The other two I will quote from or reference in my remarks today.&nbsp; They are,&nbsp;<em>The God Who Weeps: How Mormonism Makes Sense of Life</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn2" target="_self">[2]</a>&nbsp;by Terryl and Fiona Givens, a book I began rereading as soon as I finished it, and the other is a little treasure of a book by President J. Reuben Clark Jr. called,<em>&nbsp;Wist Ye Not that I must be about My Father's Business?<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em>&nbsp; I encourage you to put them on your reading list.<br /><br />On Easter morning 2010 Elder Richard G. Scott expressed a belief that caught my attention and has influenced my gospel study ever since.&nbsp; He said, "I believe that it is instructive to try to imagine what the Atonement required of both the Father and His willing Son."&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn4" target="_self">[4]</a>&nbsp; As I thought about his statement I determined that I should use my imagination more while studying the gospel.&nbsp; Not in a fanciful way, but in an empathetic way seeking understanding even as imperfect as my imagination might be.&nbsp; To some, suggesting empathy with God would seem blasphemy, but it was He who said if ye love me keep my commandments and then commanded us to be like Him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn5" target="_self">[5]</a>&nbsp; I'm thankful for Elder Scott's example.<br /><br />As I have imagined what the Atonement required of our Heavenly Father and Savior my soul has been stirred and inspired with deep feelings of reverence, awe, and love and I have an increased desire to worship them with all my might.&nbsp; When I say worship I mean worship with all its synonyms, revere, venerate, and adore.&nbsp; I think on them with tenderness and deference for their accomplishments and attributes; I regard them as holy and sacred because of their character; I try to pay homage by word and ceremonial, to bow before them; I seek to manifest through obedience to the commandments unquestioning love for them.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn6" target="_self">[6]</a>&nbsp; I believe that the Atonement required agency, both ours and the Savior's.&nbsp; I believe perfect love was also required.&nbsp; I've come to associate the words cost and price with the word require and I am sure that it is impossible to fathom the full and complete price paid by the Father and the Son in realizing the Atonement.&nbsp; But, part of the price was certainly the Savior's perfectly pure, sinless life and His immeasurable love for the Father and us.<br /><br />Satan "sought to destroy the agency of man."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn7" target="_self">[7]</a>&nbsp; He claimed that he would "redeem all mankind, that not one soul [should] be lost."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn8" target="_self">[8]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps he proposed to rule the world by force or perhaps he proposed to offer us a life free of consequences; but redemption whether by force or by the removal of all consequences would have been no redemption at all.&nbsp; Without agency the Atonement would lose its meaning and purpose; without it there would be no redemptive or enabling power in the Atonement.&nbsp; Part of the cost of the Atonement was the preservation of agency.&nbsp; Cost, is not only what we pay for something; it is also what is lost, damaged or given up to achieve or get something.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn9" target="_self">[9]</a>&nbsp; The Father allowed a son of the morning and a third of the hosts of heaven to be lost in order to preserve our agency. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Agency was also preserved through the miracle we call the veil of forgetfulness.&nbsp; If we arrived in mortality with the memory of our pre-mortal life intact we could not truly be tested or enjoy the full power of agency.&nbsp; Our pre-mortal choice to follow God's plan, as valiant and faith filled as it was, was made in the presence of the Father and the Son.&nbsp; Being with them provided us a great deal of evidence that we were making a good choice.&nbsp; Making choices after having forgotten all reveals our character.&nbsp; Of our choices Terryl and Fiona Givens write, "What we choose to embrace, to be responsive to, is the purest reflection of who we are and what we love.&nbsp; That is why faith, the choice to believe, is, in the final analysis, an action that is positively laden with moral significance."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn10" target="_self">[10]</a>&nbsp; All of Father's children who kept their first estate and have come to earth have passed through the veil of forgetfulness.&nbsp; The veil of forgetfulness enables us to really be agents unto ourselves.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn11" target="_self">[11]</a><br /><br />The Savior's agency was also assured through this miracle.&nbsp; Of our Redeemer Elder James E. Talmage taught, "He came among men to experience all the natural conditions of mortality; He was born as a truly dependent, helpless babe as is any other child; His infancy was in all common features as the infancy of others; His boyhood was actual boyhood, His development was as necessary and as real as that of all children. Over His mind had fallen the veil of forgetfulness common to all who are born to earth, by which the remembrance of primeval existence is shut off."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn12" target="_self">[12]</a>&nbsp; Under these conditions the Savior's choices revealed His impeccable character.<br /><br />Eliza R. Snow poetically described this experience we all chose,<br /><br />For a wise and glorious purpose<br />Thou hast placed me here on earth<br />And withheld the recollection<br />Of my former friends and birth;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn13" target="_self">[13]</a><br /><br />This magnificent leap of faith into mortality was such a courageous act, when I contemplate it I'm filled with some sense of admiration and respect for every soul I encounter in this life.&nbsp; Think of it, every person you see stood on the precipice of decision and determined to trust the Savior, leave everything behind, and wake up with no recollection of the past and no certain vision of the future.&nbsp; Such bravery almost demands our love and respect.&nbsp; So here we are on this beautiful earth, each one of us endowed with agency and faced with what Hugh Nibley called "The terrible questions".&nbsp; Where did we come from? Why are we here? And where will we go when this life is through?&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn14" target="_self">[14]</a>&nbsp; To the world these questions are terrible because no one knows the answers so they are often avoided; and though the restored gospel of Jesus Christ gives us comforting, soul satisfying answers we still walk by faith.&nbsp; It is our faith in God and trust in witnesses that assures us we have an eternal nature, that we are indeed spirit children of our Heavenly Father who loves us.&nbsp; We are here to be proved, to experience mortality by receiving a body of flesh and blood.&nbsp; We are here to learn to choose the good over the evil. &nbsp;<br /><br />We hear these glorious truths so often we may be tempted to lightly pass over them.&nbsp; Let me pause for a reminder from Elder Neal A. Maxwell "A superficial view of this life, therefore, will not do, lest we mistakenly speak of this mortal experience only as coming here to get a body, as if we were merely picking up a suit at the cleaners. Or, lest we casually recite how we have come here to be proved, as if a few brisk push-ups and deep knee bends would do."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn15" target="_self">[15]</a>&nbsp;A correct view of our bodies and the formidable reality of our testing are vital to understanding why we are here and where we are going.&nbsp; We will be punished for our own sins and not Adam's transgression.&nbsp; We all enjoy the hope and promise of the resurrection; we believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn16" target="_self">[16]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior gave us a study guide to the test and insight to the final when to the Nephites He said, "And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.&nbsp; Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn17" target="_self">[17]</a><br /><br />While speaking of the Atonement and agency President Boyd K. Packer called repentance "the escape clause in it all".&nbsp; He said, "Repentance is the key with which we can unlock the prison from inside. We hold that key within our hands, and agency is ours to use it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn18" target="_self">[18]</a>&nbsp; For us, the Atonement and repentance take the "terror" out of the "terrible questions" without them agency would have been as President Packer says a "fatal gift".<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn19" target="_self">[19]</a>&nbsp; But for our dear Redeemer, the answers to the terrible questions were as terrible as the questions themselves.&nbsp; He was the Lamb of God.&nbsp; Agency came to Him without an escape clause, if he landed in prison due to sin there would be no key to unlock the doors for him or anyone else, for Him there was to be no ram in the thicket. When He walked into Gethsemane for the last time and when He was lifted up at Golgotha His life would have to be clean; His soul without blemish or spot.&nbsp; The Atonement required the Lord with His agency to live a perfectly pure life and to willingly submit to the Father.&nbsp; President Packer explained, "The cost of the Atonement was borne by the Lord without compulsion, for agency is a sovereign principle. According to the plan, agency must be honored."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn20" target="_self">[20]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures do not tell us when or exactly how the King of kings came to know and understand that He was the promised Messiah.&nbsp; In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 93 we read, "And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.&nbsp; And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;&nbsp;And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness;"&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn21" target="_self">[21]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />To assist in the reception of grace for grace during the Savior's childhood two noble and great spirits were carefully chosen.&nbsp; Mary and Joseph were obviously faithful, presenting the baby at the Temple at the appointed time and making the offering of a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. Mary would have had a significant role in the holy child's earliest development.&nbsp; At age five or six it is likely that He would have attended a local school where the focus of the curriculum would have been the book of Leviticus.&nbsp; Think of how certain passages of scripture have touched your heart and then imagine how these lines might have worked on the heart of this pure little boy who as the mighty Jehovah had proclaimed, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. ... And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy ... And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn22" target="_self">[22]</a><br /><br />As the child grew, every year Mary and Joseph went to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover which would have coincided with His birthday.&nbsp; They would have followed all of the protocols associated with that great feast.&nbsp; Joseph would have assured that their house was clean of any leaven, and they would have taken a lamb with them or acquired one at Jerusalem for the sacrifice.&nbsp; When Jesus was 12 years old he would have gone with Joseph up to the temple and assisted in killing the lamb; he would have seen its blood spilt by the priest at the foot of the alter.&nbsp; The Passover meal would have been prepared with the cooked lamb.&nbsp; According to tradition, during the meal the boy Jesus would have stood and asked what was the meaning of all this and the patriarch of the home would have rehearsed the significance of every detail.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn23" target="_self">[23]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus would have learned by study and faith, through inspiration, revelation, and perhaps heavenly visitation, that the law of sacrifice had been instituted long before the Passover, even in the very beginning with Adam.&nbsp; Apparently Adam had the "how" and the "what" of sacrifice down very well.&nbsp; He had been obedient to the commandment for "many days".&nbsp; I wonder what he must have thought as he watched the blood and life drain from the little lambs.&nbsp; Whatever his thoughts, the Lord saw fit to send an angel so that Adam would understand the "why" behind the commandment to worship the Lord God by offering the firstlings of his flocks.&nbsp; "And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn24" target="_self">[24]</a>&nbsp; Thereafter Adam and his posterity, including the mortal Messiah, would understand that the sacrifice of those innocent creatures represented the sacrifice of the Son of God who would offer himself in order to bring us back into the presence of the Father.&nbsp; It is hard to imagine a more vivid symbol of Christ's sacrifice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through the ages the true followers of Christ offered up the firstlings of their flocks, from Adam to Noah, and on down to Abraham and Isaac who through astonishing obedience had a most significant experience with the law of sacrifice.&nbsp; Jesus would have been very familiar with their story, imagine again how this story must have worked upon His heart and mind.&nbsp; From grace to grace He would have come to fully comprehend what He revealed through Amulek, "Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.&nbsp; And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn25" target="_self">[25]</a><br /><br />I am utterly mystified by the enormity of the Lord's responsibility I cannot imagine nor hope to comprehend the weight of His tremendous burden.&nbsp; Most of us, if not all, have at one time held the infinitesimally small responsibility of keeping a room clean in the house.&nbsp; How quickly we bristle when our room is threatened with clutter.&nbsp; Perhaps you have, like me, allowed a cloud of gloomy resentment to darken your heart as you cleaned up a mess left by someone else.&nbsp; In mortality we are plagued by temptation and sin and we often make a mess of things.&nbsp; Lesser souls than the Savior might have observed the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of all those around them and grown resentful at the mounting burden.&nbsp; But He carried no resentment even as the Givens attest, "[His] empathy ... was dearly paid for, each day of His mortal life, filled as it was with all the trauma an uncomprehending world could inflict on perfect innocence."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn26" target="_self">[26]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />And yet with magnanimous patience He taught the truths of eternity, with great generosity and kindness he forgave sin.&nbsp; In the face of ingratitude and unbelief he healed the sick and raised the dead.&nbsp; To the faithful he was particularly tender when they relied on His strength.&nbsp; Imagine how sweet the tone of His voice as he soothingly said, "Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn27" target="_self">[27]</a>&nbsp; In extreme agony the depth of His character shone through as He implored the Father to "forgive them; for they know not what they do."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn28" target="_self">[28]</a>&nbsp; The Savior gave His life for us not only in death but in every moment of His mortal life, in every thought, in every word; in every deed He gave us His life.&nbsp; Even knowing that He would have to descend below it all, our Redeemer gave no heed to the temptations that drag us down.&nbsp; He, like all of Father's children was tempted; but unlike all of us he never submitted&nbsp;His will to temptation but obeyed His Father's will and overcame the world. How did He do it?<br /><br />In a word, "love" His love of the Father and for us is so great that one who walked with him in mortality wrote simply, "God is love."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn29" target="_self">[29]</a>&nbsp; Another prophet declared, "... the love of God ... is the most desirable above all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn30" target="_self">[30]</a>&nbsp; Surely our elder brother counted the cost before, He meekly yet boldly volunteered "Here am I, send me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn31" target="_self">[31]</a>&nbsp;In mortality He taught, "And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.&nbsp; For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn32" target="_self">[32]</a>&nbsp;His love and the strength of his character were sufficient to pay all the demands of justice and to extend to us bounteous mercy.&nbsp; It was His great love that made His yoke easy and His burden light.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn33" target="_self">[33]</a>&nbsp; What He says to one He says to all, "Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn34" target="_self">[34]</a><br /><br />In March 1981 Brother Dennis Peterson, a physician in Bountiful, Utah, submitted an article to the Ensign titled, "To Love the Things God Loves".&nbsp; In the article he recounted how, while a missionary, he wrestled with the fear that he might never be worthy of heaven.&nbsp; He explained, "Sometimes I felt as though keeping the commandments was a self-imposed strait jacket, an unnatural posture that the gospel would stuff me into while Satan kept snipping at the seams."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn35" target="_self">[35]</a>&nbsp; After experiencing the great joy of seeing the gospel change the lives of his investigators he became desperate to learn how to overcome sin and temptation.&nbsp; Brother Peterson searched and prayed daily for weeks and then one day he was reading in&nbsp;<em>Jesus the Christ</em>&nbsp;and the bright light of revelation began to dawn on him.<br /><br />Elder Talmage had written, "The Savior had the capacity, the ability to sin had He willed so to do. ... Nevertheless his insurance against [sin] ... is not that of external compulsion, but of internal restraint due to his cultivated companionship of the spirit of truth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn36" target="_self">[36]</a>&nbsp; Brother Peterson concluded that a love for God and the things God loves would help him become righteous.&nbsp; Mormon taught him to pray to the Father with all the energy of heart to be filled with the pure love of Christ.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn37" target="_self">[37]</a>&nbsp; Brother Peterson applied his new found knowledge by praying to see things as God sees them, to understand them as God understands them.&nbsp; As he did so his desires began to change; his view of the Sabbath was transformed, a difficult relationship with a coworker became a friendship. &nbsp;Brother Peterson reported it might take weeks for changes of heart to come but that they would come as he pled daily with the Lord.<br /><br />I first read about Brother Peterson's experiences in 1983 when I was a young missionary having some of the same feelings that he described.&nbsp; Over the years I too have found that true change may come very slowly, and that all of the pleading must be accompanied by determined action. I have found comfort in what Sister Virginia H. Pearce said in a BYU-Idaho devotional as she spoke about change, "Now this may not seem like such a big deal when you are twenty. But, trust me, as you grow older and older and fail again and again at resolutions to do this or<em>not</em>&nbsp;do that, you will long to not just do things differently, but to actually&nbsp;<em>be&nbsp;</em>different. Self-discipline, personal goals, resolutions, and keeping covenants are vital, but the real miracle of change comes through the Savior."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn38" target="_self">[38]</a><br /><br />By speaking about the long road of discipleship I don't want to discourage anyone about repentance or confuse anyone making you vulnerable to the deception that Elder Holland described as a, " ... satanic sucker punch--the idea that it takes years and years and eons of eternity to repent. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say, "I'll change"--and mean it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn39" target="_self">[39]</a>&nbsp; He goes on to say that of course there will follow real work to prove the permanence of our repentance.&nbsp; May I suggest one change of heart that many of us might pray for in this world where we are bombarded by a hyper-sexualized media and where some come to be stained by the pollution of pornography?&nbsp; Perhaps we could pray with all the energy of heart that we might delight in chastity the way God delights in chastity.&nbsp; Perhaps we could pray to understand gender roles as God understands them.&nbsp; Perhaps we could pray to view human intimacy as He does.&nbsp; As we learn to love what God loves our desires to sin fade away and our ability to resist temptation is fortified.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis the great Christian Apologist wrote, "Christian Love, either towards God or towards man, is an affair of the will. If we are trying to do His will we are obeying the commandment, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.' He will give us feelings of love if He pleases. We cannot create them for ourselves, and we must not demand them as a right. But the great thing to remember is that, though our feelings come and go, His love for us does not. It is not wearied by our sins, or our indifference; and, therefore, it is quite relentless in its determination that we shall be cured of those sins, at whatever cost to us, at whatever cost to Him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn40" target="_self">[40]</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore what? Therefore let us give our all to God, let us place a broken heart and a contrite spirit upon the alter.&nbsp; Let us "Establish an attitude of ongoing, happy, joyful repentance by making it [our] lifestyle of choice." as Elder Jorg Klebingat encouraged us in our most recent General Conference.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn41" target="_self">[41]</a>&nbsp; May we each seek to love the things that God loves and thereby find strength to overcome temptation until we are finally able to say with complete conviction "not my will but Thine be done."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn42" target="_self">[42]</a>&nbsp; Let us come unto Him and be made partakers of his love, let us heed His call, "Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2014_12_01_Cole.htm#_edn43" target="_self">[43]</a>&nbsp; This Christmas season let us imagine what the Atonement required of the Father and His willing Son, I promise if you do your celebrations will be filled with a greater sense of reverence and awe for the tiny babe born in Bethlehem.&nbsp; This Christmas season oh come let us adore Him.<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Religious Education Faculty Member</p>
<p>Michael Bolingbroke is a faculty member in the Religious Education Department at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; <br /><br /> He served a full-time mission in the Denmark Copenhagen Mission.&nbsp; <br /><br /> He earned both a BS in Business Management and an MA in Recreation Management from Brigham Young University.&nbsp; He later received his doctorate degree in Educational Leadership from the University of Nevada-Reno. &nbsp;<br /><br /> Before coming to BYU-Idaho, Brother Bolingbroke was employed in the Church Education System for over 20 years as a Seminary and Institute teacher, principal, and director in Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada. <br /><br /> &nbsp;He has been a bishop, a member of a stake presidency, and now serves as a high councilor in the Rexburg YSA 7<sup>th</sup> Stake. <br /><br /> &nbsp;He and his wife, Vickie, are the parents of 6 children and 3 grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Each December we celebrate two important births: that of the Savior Jesus Christ and that of the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; Today I would like to share my testimony regarding these two great sons of God.</p>
<p>Some years ago while serving as a scoutmaster, I attended a scout camp located in the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains.&nbsp; Camp Fleischmann was located in the midst of thick pine trees, canyons, lakes and streams. &nbsp;I would spend the week attending to the many needs of the boys. &nbsp;Often my bishop would come up on Friday to spend time with the boys, thereby allowing me to leave the boys and fish the streams of the Sierras.&nbsp; There was a river just a few miles from camp that I loved to fish.&nbsp;<br /><br />On one of these occasions, I arose early in the morning, put on my waders, grabbed my pole and began to hike down the mountain to the river.&nbsp; It was a beautiful morning on the river.&nbsp; I was all alone enjoying the quiet of mountains.&nbsp; I traveled quite a distance down river.&nbsp; When it was time to return to camp, I began to retrace my way up the river.&nbsp; It was difficult walking, with many boulders and branches blocking the way.&nbsp; I decided to leave the river and hike my way through the forest.&nbsp; I found an old logging road and began to follow it in the direction of camp.&nbsp; The road eventually disappeared and I decided that I knew the way well enough and began to hike up the mountain for what I thought would be just a short distance to camp.&nbsp;<br /><br />After I came to the top of the hill, I looked at the terrain, and it was all unfamiliar to me.&nbsp; There were canyons and ravines branching out in all directions.&nbsp; I could no longer hear the river, and with the thick pines I could hear no sounds of scouts coming from the camp.&nbsp; I knew the general direction to travel and decided to continue making my course toward camp.&nbsp; After an hour of wandering the hills, I realized that I was not making any progress.&nbsp; The many canyons and ravines often took me away from my destination.&nbsp; I now knew that I was lost and needed to retrace my steps back to the river, where I was sure I could find the "true course" back to camp.&nbsp; I was greatly relieved and comforted when I reached the familiar sounds of the river which, if followed, I knew would take me back up the trail to camp.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are prone to wander!&nbsp; If we are not careful, our wandering will lead us into paths that will not lead us back to God.&nbsp; President J. Reuben Clark, in his landmark address, "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," related a similar experience regarding a mariner whose ship was tossed about in a storm.&nbsp; He quoted Daniel Webster:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick weather, and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first pause in the storm, the earliest glance of the sun, to take his latitude, and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from his true course. Let us imitate this prudence, and, before we float farther on the waves of this debate, refer to the point from which we departed, that we may at least be able to conjecture where we now are.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>(<em>The Charted Course of the Church in Education,</em>&nbsp;1994, 1.)</p>
<p>President Clark continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Webster seemed to invoke so sensible a procedure for occasions where, after wandering on the high seas or in the wilderness, effort is to be made to get back to the place of starting, that I thought you would excuse me if I invoked and in a way used this same procedure to restate some of the more outstanding and essential fundamentals underlying our Church school education.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>(Ibid.)</p>
<p>Today many seem to wander down the trails of doubt and confusion.&nbsp; Some may struggle with supposed conflicts between science and the creation of the earth.&nbsp; Others struggle with church history events, rumors, and cultural differences from the past.&nbsp; Still others have found great difficulty with current social issues regarding marriage that seem to have wide public support but are in direct conflict with the teachings of the Church and the living prophets. &nbsp;Still others struggle with the organization and order of the priesthood or the translation of the Book of Abraham and The Book of Mormon. &nbsp;The Church has produced and posted on lds.org several essays on many of these topics.&nbsp; In these essays the doctrine is explained, and some of the "whys" are given.&nbsp; Sometimes the essays leave some questions unanswered.&nbsp; Recently I had a discussion with one of my sons regarding one of these new essays on the Church's website concerning difficult historical topics.&nbsp; He said: "Dad you always seem so sure about these things."&nbsp; The truth is, I have unanswered questions, and I am looking forward to more light and knowledge from the Lord. &nbsp;But there are some things that I am absolutely sure about, and I don't need to be retaught or reconverted.&nbsp; Through prayer, fasting, and study I have felt the witness of the Spirit in my mind and in my heart that certain doctrines and principles are true (see D&amp;C 8:2-4). &nbsp;There is much we do not know, but there has been so many wonderful doctrines restored that are so clear and have become an anchor for my testimony.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;President J. Reuben Clark gave clear direction regarding what we do know when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In all this there are for the Church, and for each and all of its members, two prime things which may not be overlooked, forgotten, shaded, or discarded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First--that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, the Creator of the world, the Lamb of God, the Sacrifice for the sins of the world, the Atoner for Adam's transgression; that He was crucified; that His spirit left His body; that He died; that He was laid away in the tomb; that on the third day His spirit was reunited with His body, which again became a living being; that He was raised from the tomb a resurrected being, a perfect Being, the First Fruits of the Resurrection; that He later ascended to the Father; and that because of His death and by and through His resurrection every man (and woman) born into the world since the beginning will be likewise literally resurrected. &nbsp;This doctrine is as old as the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The second of the two things to which we must all give full faith is that the Father and the Son actually and in truth and very deed appeared to the Prophet Joseph in a vision in the woods; that other heavenly visions followed to Joseph and to others; that the gospel and the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God were in truth and fact restored to the earth from which they were lost by the apostasy of the primitive Church; that the Lord again set up His Church, through the agency of Joseph Smith; that the Book of Mormon is just what it professes to be; that to the Prophet came numerous revelations for the guidance, upbuilding, organization, and encouragement of the Church and its members; that the Prophet's successors [were] likewise called of God.... &nbsp;These facts also, and each of them, together with all things necessarily implied therein or flowing therefrom, must stand, unchanged, unmodified, without dilution, excuse, apology, or avoidance; they may not be explained away or submerged. &nbsp;Without these two great beliefs the Church would cease to be the Church....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have set out these matters because they are the latitude and longitude of the actual location and position of the Church, both in this world and in eternity. &nbsp;Knowing our true position, we can change our bearings if they need changing; we can lay down anew our true course.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>(Ibid., 1-3.)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify to you that Jesus Christ is my Savior and my Redeemer.&nbsp; I testify to you that Joseph Smith was God's prophet and that the restoration of the gospel in these the latter-days has taken place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have had a testimony of the Prophet Joseph since I was a young boy.&nbsp; I love the Prophet Joseph Smith, and I love defending him.&nbsp; While serving as young missionary I had many opportunities to teach people about the Prophet Joseph and his mission.&nbsp; I served in the Denmark Copenhagen Mission and was privileged to learn Danish.&nbsp; Those of you who have learned a foreign language know how difficult this can be.&nbsp; Danish is a very challenging language, especially the pronunciation.&nbsp; In 1979, the year I began my mission, our first discussion was the Joseph Smith story.&nbsp; We would give large parts of the story in Joseph's own words.&nbsp; There were many difficult words to pronounce--words like "overenstemmelse," "indbyrdes," "betractninger," "gradvis," "bebrejdelser," "beskrivelse," and more.&nbsp; Most missionaries struggle with the language the first several months of their missions, and I was no exception.&nbsp; A few weeks into my mission we met a young man who invited us into his apartment, mostly because we were from America and he was curious.&nbsp; He quickly stated that he was an atheist but consented to listen to what we had to say.&nbsp;<br /><br />My companion asked me to give the first concept of the first discussion, which was the Joseph Smith story.&nbsp; I plowed my way through it and tried the best I could to teach this man what I held dear to my heart.&nbsp; I could see from his face that he was struggling to understand the words and the story, and of what he did understand, he was skeptical.&nbsp; As I closed the concept, I quoted the words of Joseph saying: "I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air." (JS-History 1:16-17.)&nbsp; There were many difficult words in that section that I struggled pronouncing.&nbsp; I finished the concept and bore my testimony to him.&nbsp; At the conclusion of my testimony, the young man burst into laughter and cackled as he said, "You don't believe this. &nbsp;(He also used an expletive that only later did I understand)."&nbsp; His laughter continued as he talked, and I had difficulty understanding him.&nbsp; I turned to my companion for help.&nbsp; He leaned over and whispered in my ear: "What do you expect?&nbsp; You massacred it."&nbsp; I looked back at the man, and he was still chuckling in derision.&nbsp; I felt very alone.&nbsp; I could feel the redness of embarrassment begin to form in my stomach, and it seemed to crawl up my body until my face flushed red.&nbsp; My companion said a few words, and we left.&nbsp; Not much was said between my companion and me the rest of the night, as we were rejected most of the evening.&nbsp; We returned to our apartment, had a quick snack, and engaged in prayer and quiet study before we went to bed.&nbsp;<br /><br />My companion said good night, and he went right to sleep.&nbsp; I was unable to sleep and began to review in my mind the young man laughing and my obvious embarrassment.&nbsp; I climbed back out of bed and knelt in prayer.&nbsp; I said: "I'm sorry, Father, that I am not a very good missionary.&nbsp; I am sorry that I taught the lesson so poorly."&nbsp; As I offered my sincere prayer, I was overcome with a peaceful feeling.&nbsp; I heard in my mind the words: "I love you! &nbsp;Keep bearing testimony of Joseph Smith.&nbsp; He is my prophet!" &nbsp;I knew again that this is God's work. &nbsp;I asked the Lord for help with the language and with the skills of communicating and teaching the gospel.&nbsp; The inspiration came to me that I needed to read the Joseph Smith brochure in Danish every day and practice, practice, practice, the pronunciations.&nbsp; The Danish version of the Joseph Smith brochure was 28 pages long.&nbsp; I vowed to study four pages a day, thus finishing it each week, and then I would start over.&nbsp; With the Lord's help I was able to master the words very well, and I could share with you today hundreds of experiences where I have borne my testimony to those who would listen.&nbsp; Never have I been embarrassed or blushed in any way since that day, as I have testified numerous times that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God!&nbsp; I love the Prophet Joseph!<br /><br />Elder Neil L. Andersen, in the October 2014 general conference, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The negative commentary about the Prophet Joseph Smith will increase as we move toward the Second Coming of the Savior. &nbsp;The half-truths and subtle deceptions will not diminish. &nbsp;There will be family members and friends who will need your help. &nbsp;Now is the time to adjust your own spiritual oxygen mask so that you are prepared to help others who are seeking the truth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith can come differently to each of us.&nbsp; It may come as you kneel in prayer, asking God to confirm that he was a true prophet. &nbsp;It may come as you read the Prophet's account of the First Vision. &nbsp;A testimony may distill upon your soul as you read the Book of Mormon again and again. &nbsp;It may come as you bear your own testimony of the Prophet or as you stand in the temple and realize that through Joseph Smith the holy sealing power was restored to the earth.&nbsp; With faith and real intent, your testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith will strengthen. &nbsp;The constant water balloon volleys from the sidelines may occasionally get you wet, but they need never, never extinguish your burning fire of faith.&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/11/saturday-afternoon-session/joseph-smith?lang=eng" target="_self">https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/11/saturday-afternoon-session/joseph-smith?lang=eng</a>)</p>
<p>Elder Anderson continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I give (you) a specific challenge: Gain a personal witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith. &nbsp;Let your voice help fulfill Moroni's prophetic words to speak good of the Prophet. &nbsp;Here are two ideas: First, find scriptures in the Book of Mormon that you feel and know are absolutely true. &nbsp;Then share them with family and friends.... &nbsp;Next, read the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Pearl of Great Price or in the pamphlet, now in 158 languages. &nbsp;You can find it online at LDS.org or with the missionaries. &nbsp;This is Joseph's own testimony of what actually occurred. &nbsp;Read it often. &nbsp;Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly, and sharing it with friends. &nbsp;Listening to the Prophet's testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek. &nbsp;("Joseph Smith,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, November 2014.)</p>
<p>I add my challenge to you to read Joseph Smith's story again.&nbsp; Ask with a sincere heart to really know of Joseph's prophetic ministry, and I promise you that the Holy Ghost will help you to know for yourself that Joseph is God's prophet.</p>
<p>The other doctrine or true course which may not be overlooked, forgotten, shaded, or discarded is that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and He leads His Church today. &nbsp;I received my testimony of Jesus Christ as a young teenager, and it has never left me.&nbsp; Over the years it has only strengthened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em>I remember as a young boy singing in church the hymn, "I Know That My Redeemer Lives," and being filled with joy and peace.&nbsp; I knew as a young boy that my mother and father knew and loved Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This gave me such strength and peace.&nbsp; This testimony has enabled me to withstand temptation and follow the one true course to happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost thirty-five years ago to the day, again while serving my mission, I was attending a mission Christmas conference in Odense, Denmark.&nbsp; My companion and I were serving on an island in the Baltic Sea, thirty kilometers from the German border.&nbsp; After our Christmas conference in Odense, we decided to take a different route home so that we could see some new scenery.&nbsp; We carefully planned a bus trip through the countryside to Faaborg, Denmark.&nbsp; We had several bus connections to make that would take us to the docks, where we would board a Ferry boat across a channel to our island and then take another bus home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip was going nicely, and all was well, except the weather turned bitter cold, and the sleet began to fall, covering everything in a sheet of ice.&nbsp; We arrived safely at the bus station in Faaborg, and we looked at the schedule and saw that our connecting bus should arrive in just a few minutes to take us to the dock.&nbsp; While we were waiting in the station, a fisherman came into the room and approached the scheduling board.&nbsp; My companion, Elder Michael Meiners, and I had a goal to talk to everyone we met and to never miss an opportunity to share a message.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was closest to the board, so I approached the gentleman.&nbsp; He was dressed in a yellow rain slicker and had a long flowing beard.&nbsp; One of my best techniques as a missionary to meet people was to play a "dumb American."&nbsp; This came naturally to me.&nbsp; I asked the man if he could help me read the schedule and tell me when the next bus would arrive to take us to the docks.&nbsp; He was a typical Dane, and he immediately came to my side and was so kind to help me read the schedule.&nbsp; After carefully studying the schedule, he turned to me and said, "I am sorry but there is no bus tonight, and no ferry boats are sailing."&nbsp; I thought, "Great, I am playing a dumb American, and I meet a dumb Dane."&nbsp; So I pointed to the bus that was scheduled to arrive in just a few minutes and said, "How about this bus."&nbsp; He then kindly pointed to a very small asterisk and said, "Son, when you see this asterisk you need to go to the bottom of the schedule."&nbsp; Following the asterisk we read that no ferry boats sail at night between December and February.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were stranded.&nbsp; I thanked the man and rushed to my companion and explained the situation.&nbsp; He asked me how much money I had on me.&nbsp; I, of course, had spent all my money on a pastry, and he had only a few cents, not even enough to make a phone call.&nbsp; This was before the age of cell phones.&nbsp; We had no credit cards, nothing. &nbsp;While we were discussing our options, the clerk in the bus station office yelled out the window that the station was closing in a few minutes, and that we couldn't stay there.&nbsp; We paused and offered a prayer and asked the Lord for help.&nbsp; Our mission president counseled us to always have $50 cash on us at all times.&nbsp; Oh, how I wished I had obeyed that counsel.&nbsp; In all the commotion, I had lost track of the old fisherman.&nbsp; He had left the station.&nbsp;<br /><br />After our prayer, while we were still in a panic, the door opened to the station and in walked the kind fisherman.&nbsp; He approached me and said: "I couldn't help noticing your predicament.&nbsp; I have been outside visiting with my wife, and we would like to invite you to our home tonight to eat and sleep, and we will take you to the dock in the morning." &nbsp;For a brief moment, I thought that maybe the blood on his slicker wasn't from fish!&nbsp; I wanted to say, "We don't even know you!&nbsp; You could be some crazy person."&nbsp; Not wanting to offend him, I looked at him and said instead, "You don't even know us."&nbsp; He came close to me and looked me in the eye.&nbsp; He put his arm around me and gently touched my name tag and said, "You are a representative of my Lord Jesus Christ, aren't you?" &nbsp;The Spirit came over me so powerfully, and I felt the Lord speak to me.&nbsp; I knew I was His representative, and that He knew me and loved me.&nbsp; I knew the Lord had placed this kind man in our path so that my companion and I would not have to sleep on the streets that night in a blizzard.&nbsp; I know missionaries have had much harder trials than what we would have faced that night, but it was a tender mercy for me.&nbsp; We went to his home and had a wonderful fish dinner.&nbsp; We taught them the first three discussions, slept comfortably, and made it home safely the next day.&nbsp;<br /><br />From that day to today, I have never really doubted again whose name I represent.&nbsp; I have learned, however, that following Jesus Christ and his prophets is not always easy.&nbsp; I have been laughed at, spit on, had my bike stolen, mocked, had guns pointed at me and dogs released to attack me. &nbsp;And that was just last week while I was teaching here at BYUI!&nbsp; Okay, that was a joke.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify to you that wearing the name tag that bears the name of Christ is a privilege.&nbsp; Jesus himself was beaten and bruised for the gospel's sake and ultimately gave His life for us.&nbsp; In John 6, Jesus taught hard things.&nbsp; He taught in essence that he was Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament.&nbsp; Many of his disciples, when they had heard this, said: "This is an hard saying; who can hear it?" (John 6:60). &nbsp;"From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him" (John 6:66). &nbsp;He turned to the twelve and said, "Will ye also go away?" (John 6:67). &nbsp;Peter then answered: "To whom shall we go?&nbsp; Thou hast the words of eternal life.&nbsp; And we believe and are sure that thou are that Christ, the Son of the Living God" (John 6:69).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus is still teaching hard doctrines today.&nbsp; In fact, He is at the head of this Church and is guiding our prophets.&nbsp; We live in a world where many feel there is no sin.&nbsp; Still others say, "Eat, drink, and be merry; it doesn't matter what we do, God will forgive us."&nbsp; (See 2 Nephi 28:7-8.)&nbsp; Jesus said, speaking of our day: "They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol" (D&amp;C 1:16).&nbsp; In the April general conference of last year, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland made it very clear that Jesus requires us to stand for and defend the truth, when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Jesus said,] "I came not to [bring] peace, but a sword"<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(Matthew 10:34).&nbsp; He warned those who thought He spoke only soothing platitudes. &nbsp;No wonder that, sermon after sermon, the local communities "pray[ed] him to depart out of their coasts" (Mark 5:17).&nbsp; No wonder, miracle after miracle, His power was attributed not to God but to the devil.&nbsp; (See Matthew 9:34).&nbsp; It is obvious that the bumper sticker question "What would Jesus do?" will not always bring a popular response.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the zenith of His mortal ministry, Jesus said, "Love one another, as I have loved you" (John 15:12).&nbsp; To make certain they understood exactly what kind of love that was, He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments"<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(John 14:15) and "whosoever&nbsp;... shall break one of [the] least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be&nbsp;... the least in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:19).&nbsp; Christlike love is the greatest need we have on this planet in part because righteousness was always supposed to accompany it. &nbsp;So if love is to be our watchword, as it must be, then by the word of Him who is love personified, we must forsake transgression and any hint of advocacy for it in others. &nbsp;Jesus clearly understood what many in our modern culture seem to forget: that there is a crucial difference between the commandment to forgive sin (which He had an infinite capacity to do) and the warning against condoning it (which He never ever did even once)....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be strong. &nbsp;Live the gospel faithfully even if others around you don't live it at all. &nbsp;Defend your beliefs with courtesy and with compassion, but defend them.... &nbsp;It is a strait path, and it is a narrow path without a great deal of latitude at some points, but it can be thrillingly and successfully traveled, "with ... steadfastness in Christ, ... a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20).&nbsp; In courageously pursuing such a course, you will forge unshakable faith, you will find safety against ill winds that blow, even shafts in the whirlwind, and you will feel the rock-like strength of our Redeemer. &nbsp;("The Cost--and Blessings--of Discipleship," Conference Report, April 2014).</p>
<p>Believing in Jesus Christ and his true doctrine as taught by the prophets has and always will require us to leave the world behind, to be different, to stand firm when the winds of criticism blow.&nbsp; Be careful not to travel down paths of doubt and skepticism but to be believing and patient as you struggle to know the mind and will of God.&nbsp; His path, his one true course, is a narrow and strait path, and sadly, few there be that find it.&nbsp; Many choose to follow the broad and wide path of the world and become lost in the filthy rivers and mists of darkness.&nbsp; They succumb to the pointing fingers of scorn from those who love the world more than God.</p>
<p>I assure you, however, that there are many holding fast to the iron rod and who are traveling the strait path that leads back to God and his love.&nbsp; I promise you that angels will attend you as you strive to stay on the one true course.&nbsp; Some of you in this room may have already fallen off the path and are feeling hopeless.&nbsp; I promise you there is a way back.&nbsp; Repentance is powerful and possible.&nbsp; Elder Bruce R. McConkie once taught, "We don't need to get a complex or a get a feeling that you have to be perfect to be saved. What you have to do is get on the straight and narrow path--thus charting a course leading to eternal life&shy; and then, being on that path, pass out of this life in full fellowship....&nbsp; You don't have to live a life that's truer than true. &nbsp;You don't have to have an excessive zeal that becomes fanatical and becomes unbalancing. &nbsp;What you have to do is stay in the mainstream of the Church and live as upright and decent people live in the Church--keeping the commandments, paying your tithing, serving in the organizations of the Church, loving the Lord, staying on the straight and narrow path. &nbsp;If you're on that path when death comes ... you'll never fall off from it, and for all practical purposes, your calling and election is made sure"<strong>(</strong>"The Probationary Test of Mortality," address given at University of Utah, January 10, 1982, p. 11).<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, stay in the mainstream of the church.&nbsp; Live the gospel the best you can.&nbsp; Stay on the course that leads to eternal life.&nbsp; Jesus said, "I am the way! &nbsp;Come follow me!&nbsp; My paths are straight!"&nbsp; I love my Savior.&nbsp; I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. &nbsp;I love President Monson, and I love this church. &nbsp;During the Christmas break, I challenge you to strengthen your testimonies of Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith.&nbsp; While away, don't fall back into old negative habits or allow faithless friends to lead you away from the path you know you should travel.&nbsp; That you will come back to us purer and stronger in your testimony of the restored gospel is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>
