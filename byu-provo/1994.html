<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is impressive to know that on an occasion like this with all the other places you could be and all the other things you could be doing with your time, you have chosen to be here in a Church-related setting. That tells me a lot about the kinds of good decisions you are making in your lives. You are going in the right direction, and if you continue choosing the right, you will arrive at a destination that will be good for you--now and in the hereafter.<br><br>For me, it is a humbling experience to be with you because there are among you some of the most impressive spiritual heroes we know. Barbara and I have learned to know about you and to know many of you because almost wherever we go, we meet people we had the privilege of seeing or knowing some place before.<br><br>That reminds me of the experience of a father saying to me, "Say, you were president of the MTC when our son was there. Did you know him?"<br><br>He told me his full name, and after thinking for a few moments, I said, "I'm sorry. I didn't know him."<br><br>And he said, "Oh, thank heavens!"<br><br>I would like to speak to you tonight very personally. What a blessing it would be to have the privilege of visiting with each of you one-on-one and get acquainted with you individually--to know of your background, your interests, aspirations, and concerns. Of all the young people I have met over the years, I have not met one who did not want to be happy and successful.<br><br>To a degree, we all know the gospel and what we should be doing in our lives. Very likely, we know more than we apply. Right?<br><br>It may be a little like the young county farm agent who wanted to put his college training to use and said to the farmer, "Sam, you know that now we use something called contour plowing." And then he went on to expound on the benefits of hybrid strains of grain and crop rotation, and about the time he got to the benefits of milking the cows three times a day rather than two, the old farmer said, "Hey, sonny, just a minute. I'm not farming half as well as I know how already."<br><br>Isn't that the way life is? None of us is performing to the level of our knowledge. This is because it is hard to farm, or perform, as well as we know how. And that brings me to the subject for this evening.<br><br>I would like to visit with you about resolutions--resolutions to conform our lives more closely to what we already know about the gospel. I am sure that some of us have made a bundle of New Year's resolutions, and maybe a few of us haven't chosen to make any because of prior problems we have had in keeping them. Don't overlook the power that making good resolutions can have to help make your life happier and more successful--regardless of your past behavior.<br><br>Let's explore for a moment the term<i>resolution.</i>As a noun, it suggests steadfastness of purpose. As an adjective,<i>resolute</i>is characterized by firmness or determination. As a verb,<i>resolve</i>brings to mind such terms as courage, mettle, fortitude, tenacity, backbone, and moral stamina in the face of hardship, temptations, and unfavorable odds (see<i>American Heritage Dictionary</i>[Boston: Houghton-Mifflin]).<br><br>I was anxious to know something of your concerns and aspirations, and so I had an informal survey taken of 150 young adults who were asked to list three resolutions they felt would help them to become more successful and happy during the new year. Almost everyone in the survey (98 percent) included a resolution to increase the level of his or her spirituality. Two out of three (68 percent) indicated they would like to improve their social skills. Half (49 percent) indicated a desire to increase their level of physical fitness, and half (48 percent) wanted to grow intellectually. Everyone indicated a desire to improve. After all, self-improvement is at the heart of why we are here in mortality.<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). In the Joseph Smith Translation (Matthew 5:50), we read: "Ye are therefore commanded to be perfect." The translation of the Greek word for<i>perfect</i>means "complete, finished, fully developed." Some biblical analysts indicate that the suggestion to become perfect is exaggerated idealism or scriptural hyperbole. That is not the way we as Latter-day Saints interpret it. We believe that the Savior meant what he said and that, for us, becoming like our Father in Heaven and the Savior is a commandment--not just a suggestion. We should strive continually to become more like them.<br><br>You remember that following his resurrection the Savior rhetorically asked his disciples, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" He then answered his own question, "Even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>There is only one verse of scripture in the entire New Testament that tells us what the Savior did to develop himself during his mortal years from age twelve--when he had that experience in the temple--until he began his formal ministry at age thirty. The verse consists of just fourteen words. Count them: "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52).<br><br>In other words, the Savior increased or developed in the same areas that those of you who were included in the poll indicated that you would like to improve, that is:<br><br>--intellectually (in both wisdom and knowledge)<br><br>--physically (in stature)<br><br>--socially (in favor with man)<br><br>--spiritually (in favor with God).<br><br>I am convinced that if we made and kept resolutions in these four areas, we would have a happier and more successful new year and every year for the rest of our lives.<br><br>First, consider this one:<br><br><i>I resolve to expand my intellectual horizons. I will increase in wisdom.</i><br><br>This year, commit yourself to read good books--not just when you are attending the university or college, but throughout your life. Some people learn to read but don't read. A few years ago, a disturbing poll indicated that 56 percent of college graduates, in that sample, never completely read a book all the way through following their schooling. At some point in our lives, we learned to read. But the question tonight is: Are we reading? Are we growing in wisdom?<br><br>We belong to a lay Church, as we believe the Church was in the Savior's time when humble fishermen and tax collectors were called to become his designated leaders. We do not have a professional, theologically trained and salaried clergy. Leaders and teachers are called from among the membership--people like you and me.<br><br>In terms of learning, however, the scriptural commandment to us is: "Seek ye out of the<i>best</i>books words of wisdom" and, "Become acquainted with all<i>good</i>books, and with languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118, 90:15; emphasis added).<br><br>Notice the emphasis on<i>best</i>books and<i>good</i>books. What we choose to read will make a huge difference in the development of our minds and character.<br><br>We cannot justify mentally shifting into neutral and failing to exert our efforts to make progress intellectually. Way back in 1838, a member of the First Presidency addressed a group of relatively new members of the Church in which some apparently thought that all they had to do was to be baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then just sit back and wait to receive the celestial glory. He said:<br><br><i>Vain are the hopes of those who embrace the gospel, and then suppose ... they have nothing more to do. ... The great God ... never thought of ... raising up a society of ignoramuses, but of men and women of ... intelligence as high as human nature was susceptable</i>[sic]. [Sidney Rigdon, "To the Saints Abroad,"<i>Elders' Journal</i>1, no. 4 (August 1838): 53]<br><br>So whether or not you are in school, the challenge is the same. We should continue learning throughout our entire lives--and, especially, learning more about the gospel. Now, with the enhanced Institute of Religion program, all of you can and should resolve to be enrolled in a religion class every term--whether or not you are a college student.<br><br>In the area of continued learning, my father-in-law was a real inspiration to me. He was the twelfth of thirteen children of a very poor convert immigrant family from Switzerland. After he had finished the first six years of elementary school, he, like many others in his time, was encouraged to drop out of school and learn a trade. Then one day he met Mr. Hicks, the new school teacher, who had come to Midway. He asked, "Albert, are you coming to school this year?" Albert explained that he was not planning to come back to school. Mr. Hicks said, "Well, why don't you come for three or four days and see how you like it?"<br><br>Albert came, and his future life was dramatically changed for the better. He said that this new teacher didn't just answer the questions that were raised in class, but he would write on the chalkboard the titles of the books where the students could find the answers. A thirst for learning developed in Albert that was never quenched. He was a hardworking farmer providing for a large family, but when I came to know him, I hardly remember his being in the house without having a book--usually a thick book--in his work-worn hands. He would circle words he didn't know and write their definitions in the margins. He was a real student of history and the doctrine of the Church. Although he never had the opportunity to go beyond the eighth grade, he read much more than most college graduates. He not only learned to read, he read.<br><br>Suppose you were to read an entire book each week for the next seventy years. You would read 3,640 books. That sounds like a lot; however, reportedly, there are today in the Library of Congress more than twenty-seven million books. One futurist--Tofler--said that books are spewing from the presses of the world at the rate of a thousand titles per day. That means that in seventy years there will be at least an additional twenty-five million volumes.<br><br>If we read continually, we would not be able to read more than the smallest fraction of the books in print. We should not waste time reading anything but that which would be uplifting and instructive. There is a lot of frivolous, useless, and morally destructive material in print that falls far short of that with which we should spend even a minute of our time. Remember, the scripture said, "Seek ye out of the<i>best</i>books words of wisdom" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118; emphasis added).<br><br>English clergyman Edwin Paxton Hood said, "Be as careful of the books you read, as of the company you keep; for your habits and character will be as much influenced by the former as by the latter"<i>(The New Dictionary of Thoughts</i>[New York: Standard Book Co., 1960], p. 65).<br><br>Here is a practical suggestion: Ask a few respected people who you know are readers to share with you the titles of the five books besides the scriptures they feel have had the most positive influence in their lives. You will soon accumulate a good list of titles for starters.<br><br>In addition to making a resolution that we will read only the best in print, it would be very beneficial if now we resolved not to watch even one R- or X-rated (NC-17) movie, video, or television show from now on. That may sound extreme to some of you, but I assure you that much of our future happiness and success depends on it.<br><br>There is safety in following the prophet. President Benson has said:<br><br><i>Consider carefully the words of the prophet Alma to his errant</i>[and promiscuous]<i>son, Corianton, "Forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes." (Alma 39:9)</i><br><br><i>"The lusts of your eyes." In our day, what does that expression mean?</i><br><br><i>Movies, television programs, and video recordings that are both suggestive and lewd.</i><br><br><i>Magazines and books that are obscene and pornographic.</i><br><br><i>We counsel you, ... not to pollute your minds with such degrading matter, for the mind through which this filth passes is never the same afterwards. Don't see R-rated movies or vulgar videos or participate in any entertainment that is immoral, suggestive, or pornographic.</i>["To the 'Youth of the Noble Birthright,'"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 45]<br><br>In our day, this is one of the most effective tools Satan has to pacify and lull us into carnal security, cheat our souls, and lead us carefully down to hell (see 2 Nephi 28:21).<br><br>Senator Robert Byrd has said:<br><br><i>If we in this nation continue to sow the images of murder, violence, drug abuse, ... perversion, [and] pornography ... before the eyes of millions ..., year after year and day after day, we should not be surprised if the foundations of our society rot away as if from leprosy.</i>[Michael Medved,<i>Hollywood vs. America</i>(New York: HarperPerennial, 1992), p. 194]<br><br>Now for the second resolution.<i>I will be resolute in preserving and strengthening my physical health.</i><br><br>It is impressive that more than 160 years ago the Lord revealed a health code that we call the Word of Wisdom, which can make all the difference in how we feel and perform. With good health, we can be happier and more successful. Without it, we are curtailed in almost every other way.<br><br><i>Resolve to get an adequately balanced diet.</i><br><br>Getting healthy nutrition is another area where it is hard to perform up to the level of our knowledge. Some friends of ours were having that last final parental review that most missionaries get prior to entering the door of the MTC.<br><br>The mother said, "Now, Bronson, you have your toothbrush and your pajamas?" "Yes, Mom," he answered patiently.<br><br>"You remember how to iron a shirt? Be sure to put a cloth between the iron and your suit pants when you press them."<br><br>"Yes, Mom!" "But we'd better hurry. We're going to be late."<br><br>"Okay, Son. Before we leave, just repeat back to me the four basic food groups."<br><br>"Sure, Mom," he said. "The four basic food groups for a prospective missionary are: peanut butter, Hostess chocolate cupcakes and Twinkies, chocolate milk, and Ramen noodles." (Story told by Petrea Kelly, prior to Bronson Kelly's departure to the California Fresno Mission.)<br><br>If this young man had continued with that philosophy on food, he could have ended up like a good friend of mine. His wife has been encouraging him to take off some weight. She said, "Bill, there are fifty pounds of you that I am not sealed to."<br><br>Well, Bronson did finish a good mission and must have learned some additional nutritional habits because, from all we know, he has been able to keep his health. In fact, I understand he is in the audience tonight.<br><br>Resolve to follow the do's in the Word of Wisdom: Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains. Discover that a meal does not have to feature meat every time in order to be enjoyable. In addition to improving your health, your budget will also be benefited. It really is a "win-win" situation.<br><br>Then, resolve to avoid<i>completely</i>the don'ts--tobacco, alcohol, and addictive stimulants, coffee, tea, and drugs in any form--and you will be blessed in a multitude of ways. If any of these negative practices have been, or are a part of your life, right now, tonight, resolve that in your future there will be absolutely<i>no</i>participation in tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs,<i>ever!</i>What an improved society we would live in if the whole world were to make that one resolution!<br><br><i>Resolve to get adequate physical exercise.</i><br><br>Choose some sport or other vigorous physical exercise that is consistent with your situation and physical condition and be regular in pursuing it. Get the blood circulating and give your major muscles a workout. An appropriate amount of time and effort spent in exercising will help you to be more effective in all other areas of your life.<br><br>I don't know what your choice will be. Personally, I prefer racquetball or walking to jogging. I haven't seen many joggers who look very happy while they are doing it. Of course, you need to make your own choice, but resolve to do something physical regularly.<br><br><i>Resolve to get adequate rest.</i><br><br>Really follow the counsel of the Lord where he said: "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated" (D&amp;amp;C 88:124).<br><br>Some of you are not getting the rest that you need. Some are habituated to going to bed late and sleeping much longer than your system really needs, thus missing out on some of the personal inspiration you could be receiving.<br><br>Adequately rested, there is great value that can come to you as an early riser. Years ago, Barbara and I were asked to drive President and Sister Marion G. Romney from Provo to their home in Salt Lake City. Along the way, President Romney shared some of his personal experiences when he was first called to serve as a General Authority way back in 1941. He had been serving as a stake president at the time and had gone to general conference, where he was called, without prior knowledge, to be a General Authority. He was shocked and very nervous. He felt that he needed some advice, and so he went to Elder Harold B. Lee, a new member of the Quorum of the Twelve and former associate as a stake president. He asked him for advice about how to be successful as a General Authority. Elder Lee told him:<br><br><i>If you are to be successful as a General Authority, ... I will give you one piece of advice:</i>Go to bed early and get up early.<i>If you do, your body and mind will become rested and then, in the quiet of those early morning hours, you will receive more flashes of inspiration and insight than at any other time of the day.</i><br><br>President Romney said,<br><br><i>From that day on, I put that counsel into practice, and I know it works. Whenever I have a serious problem, or some assignment of a creative nature with which I hope to receive the influence of the Spirit, I always receive more assistance in the early morning hours than at any other time of the day. Following that counsel has helped me a great deal through the years.</i>[See Joe J. Christensen,<i>To Grow in Spirit</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1983), pp. 27–28]<br><br>You can have a similar experience in your own life. You can change, even if you consider yourself a "night person." Set the habit in twenty-one days. When it comes right down to it, it is a matter of<i>strong</i>resolve and "mind over mattress."<br><br>Now to the third major resolution:<i>I resolve to be a truer friend and to become more socially acceptable to people of high standards.</i><br><br>Learn to be the kind of person with whom others of high standards enjoy associating. We all would like to have more friends. More than fifty years ago, Dale Carnegie wrote<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</i>In it, he listed some time-honored principles for making friends. You should read and reread the entire book. His suggestions are equally valuable today. Among them are:<br><br><i>Become genuinely interested in other people.</i><br><br><i>Smile.</i>[Remember, the Lord commanded us to "be of good cheer."]<br><br><i>Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</i><br><br><i>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.</i><br><br><i>Talk in terms of the other person's interests.</i><br><br><i>Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.</i>[Dale Carnegie,<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>(New York: Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, 1982), p. 112]<br><br>Occasionally, look in a full-length mirror. Certainly we should not become obsessed with how we look, but we should work to improve our physical appearance. President Kimball said:<br><br><i>How nice and easy would it be if we had a magic wand! But we haven't. You might take a careful inventory of your habits, your speech, your appearance, your weight, ... and your eccentricities. ... Take each item and analyze it. What do you like in others? What personality traits please you in others? Are your dresses too short, too long, too revealing, too old fashioned? Does your weight drive off possible suitors? Do you laugh raucously? Are you too selfish? Are you interested only in your own interests?</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 295–96]<br><br>The Lord expects us to do the best we can with what he has given us. President McKay said, "Even a barn looks better when it's painted." After you have done what you can to improve your appearance, forget about yourself and think of others and their needs.<br><br>Rather than working so hard to find Mister or Miss Right, work harder to<i>become</i>Mister or Miss Right and you will more likely have the social life and marriage you desire. You will have good friends, and, in the end, I hope you can be fortunate enough to marry your best friend.<br><br>In the New Testament, Jesus said to his disciples:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>Our challenge is to resolve to love everyone in the<i>appropriate</i>way. You all know there are different kinds of love--the romantic, the brotherly, and the kind that enables us to love our enemies. The Savior<i>universally</i>commands us to love our neighbors and even our enemies. On the other hand, the expression of romantic love is<i>anything but</i>a universal commandment. The full expression of romantic, physical affection by you is designed for you and one other person<i>only, inside</i>the bonds of marriage. If you remember that, then you will avoid the temptation to make the romantic expressions of physical affection merely a game, and you will be sure to protect and preserve yourself from the immense problems that come from the immorality that is so prominent in today's culture. You have heard so many times that your body is a temple and not a visitors' center. No tours are permitted.<br><br>Finally, the fourth resolve mentioned by everyone in the poll:<i>I will grow spiritually--I will increase in favor with God.</i><br><br>In order to grow spiritually, there are a few items that are essential. Let's start with the most difficult and universally applicable to us all. If we are to increase in "favor with God,"<i>we must resolve to overcome as much as possible the sin of human pride.</i><br><br>President Benson and others maintain that pride is the universal sin (see "Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, p. 6). That means that everyone of us, to one degree or another, suffers from the problem. No one of us is completely free from its effects, but we must do all in our power to overcome its influence.<br><br>Pride creeps up on us, because as human beings we have a<i>remarkable</i>capacity to fall under its influence--even when we think we are in the safest of religious settings.<br><br>I remember reading about the Sunday School teacher who gave to her class that great scriptural lesson on the proud Pharisee who had thanked the Lord that he was not a sinner like the publican, who knew he was a sinner and prayed for forgiveness. Jesus said the publican went down to his home more justified than the Pharisee. The Sunday School teacher then suggested to her class that they should all thank God that they were not like that Pharisee!<br><br>Another story relates that a Carthusian monk, explaining to an inquirer about the di tinctive feature of his monastic order, said: "When it comes to good works, we don't match the Benedictines; as to preaching, we are not in a class with the Dominicans; the Jesuits are away ahead of us in learning; but in the matter of humility, we're tops" (adapted from Robert J. McCracken,<i>What Is Sin? What Is Virtue?</i>[New York: Harper &amp;amp; Row, 1966], p. 14).<br><br>Even in Church callings there can be danger. We may fall into the trap of aspiring to some position or another. That would be almost like praying, "Father, I want to serve. Use me ... in an<i>executive</i>position! Remember that even the greatest of all--our Savior, Redeemer, and the Creator of worlds without number--set the example of humble service by kneeling and washing his disciples' feet. Where we serve does not matter.<i>How</i>we serve matters a great deal.<br><br>Pride causes us to become overly concerned as we compare ourselves with others about how intelligent we think we are, the brand of our jeans or other clothing, the "costly apparel" we wear, to what organizations we belong, on which side of town we live, how much money we have, what race or nationality we are, what kind of car we drive, to what church we belong, how much education we have been privileged to acquire, and on, and on, and on.<br><br>In the scriptures there are many indications that pride has risen to destroy individuals, nations, and, in some cases, even the Church itself. Remember in 3 Nephi where we read:<br><br><i>And they began again to prosper and to wax great. ...</i><br><br><i>And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</i>[A real urban renewal program.]<br><br><i>And there were many highways cast up, ... which led from city to city, and from land to land. ...</i>[Some sort of an interstate highway system, I suppose.]<br><br><i>But it came to pass ... there began to be some disputings among the people; and</i>some were lifted up unto pride<i>and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</i><br><br><i>For there were many merchants in the land</i>[you business majors],<i>and also many lawyers, and many officers.</i>[Apparently, a real stratified society developed.]<br><br><i>And the people began to be distinguished by ranks,</i>according to their riches and their chances for learning;<i>yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</i><br><br><i>Some were lifted up in pride. ...</i><br><br><i>And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up.</i>[3 Nephi 6:4–14; emphasis added]<br><br>Someone calculated that no less than thirty times throughout the Book of Mormon, the cycles of prosperity and peace were destroyed, principally by the effects of human pride.<br><br>Your opportunities, your relative prosperity, and our stratified society make overcoming inappropriate pride a genuine challenge. Your cup of advantages is very full, and as the English proverb states, "A full cup must be carried steadily."<br><br>Some years ago, just after finishing graduate school, I was visiting with an acquaintance. He was much older--probably twice my years. Earlier in his career he had gone back east to a major university and received some graduate training from a few of the then--known scholars in his field.<br><br>In the course of our conversation, my friend was critical of the leaders of the Church and some of the policies that he felt should long since have been changed.<br><br>Then he said the words that still ring in my memory, "You see, Joe, I am an intellectual."<br><br>In my experience, the genuine intellectual does not need to announce it. Since that time, he spent his life on the fringe, speaking, writing, and associating with those who felt they knew more than the designated leaders of the Church. These negative and critical attitudes affected his wife, some of their children, and on to the grandchildren. In my mind he seemed to become an incarnation of the type of individual who had not heeded the warning Nephi gave when he said:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men!</i>When they are learned they think they are wise,<i>and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside,</i>supposing they know of themselves,<i>wherefore,</i>their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.<br><br><i>But to be learned is good</i>if<i>they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>It seemed that he permitted himself to be trapped by the sin of pride. We all face the same challenge, and succumbing to it could also cause us to perish spiritually.<br><br>An insightful man, Robert J. McCracken, wrote:<br><br><i>If we make a listing of our sins,</i>[pride]<i>is the one that heads the list, breeds all the rest, and does more to estrange us from our neighbors or from God than any evil we can commit. ...</i><br><br><i>... In this aspect, it is not only the worst of the seven deadly sins; it is the parent sin, the one that leads to every other, the sin from which no one is free. ...</i><br><br><i>... Pride of rank--the delight taken in status, recognition, honors, in being at the head of the table, the top of the line. ... Pride of intellect--the arrogance that thinks it knows more than it does, forgets the finiteness of the human mind, talks in terms of morons, smiles at the cultural crudity of contemporaries, and needs to be told what Madame Foch said to one of her sons who was boasting about a school prize:</i>"Cleverness which has to be mentioned does not exist."<i>Pride of power--the passion to achieve it, to wield more and more of it, to feel superior to others, to give orders with a strident voice and move men about like pawns on a chessboard.</i>[McCracken,<i>What Is Sin?</i>pp. 11–12; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Resolve now that you will read from the scriptures daily.</i><br><br>President Benson has repeatedly emphasized that we should include some reading every day from the Book of Mormon. It really is another testament that Jesus is the Christ. Within its pages some scholars have counted that there are 3,925 references to the Savior. It has been calculated that, on average, in every 1.7 verses in the Book of Mormon, one reads something about Jesus. Even slow readers can read two pages in ten minutes or less. If we started each January first reading just two pages of the Book of Mormon each day, by the time we came to September, we would have finished another reading. Then we could start over and continue to, as Nephi said, "feast upon the words of Christ." If you don't think you can handle two pages per day, do as a friend of mine suggests: Try fifteen seconds at least. Read at least one verse. Every decision of your life could be more inspired if you were to do this consistently.<br><br>Next,<i>resolve really to pray and not just say prayers.</i><br><br>There is a big difference. Learn to pour out the real in-depth feelings of your heart to your Heavenly Father, rather than merely going through the form of saying about exactly the same trite words and phrases that you have become accustomed to use. Remember that if we don't feel like praying, as President Brigham Young counseled, that is the time to pray until we do feel like it.<br><br>I remember the experience of one bright missionary who came to the MTC to begin learning Spanish. He had one major problem. He could not trill an<i>r.</i>His tongue didn't work that way. You can't learn to pronounce Spanish well without trilling<i>r's.</i>He worked, struggled, and prayed. A week before leaving the MTC, he had conquered his problem. He triumphantly wrote a letter to his parents. The entire first page was filled with nothing but<i>r's.</i>He said that if he had not learned another thing in his entire mission than to humble himself and how really to pray, the whole experience would have been worth it.<br><br>Many of you brethren and some of you sisters have already been on full-time missions. For all of you single young men who haven't, resolve now that you will prepare yourself physically, mentally, emotionally, and morally to serve as a full-time missionary. There is no other experience in which you will grow spiritually more effectively and efficiently than you will while serving a full-time mission. If an elder follows the schedule, in two years he will receive more than 7,000 hours of specialized instruction in the scriptures; the basic principles of the gospel and how to teach them; and how to relate to members, nonmembers, and even companions. If we attended the three-hour block of meetings every Sunday, it would take us over forty-six years to accumulate 7,000 hours of instruction! You brethren have that<i>responsibility,</i>and some of you sisters will have that<i>opportunity.</i><br><br>Next, if you are really serious about growing spiritually, then "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." The scriptures tell us that "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work" (Exodus 20:8–10).<br><br>Permit me to share a personal experience that I think helped change my life for the better. Following my mission I was enrolled at BYU in my first semester home. The study requirements seemed to me to be stringent. I had an advanced course with a very demanding professor. The class met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 A.M. Every Monday morning there was always a detailed examination on the assigned material. The competition was keen, and I was highly motivated to do well.<br><br>On Sundays, after returning from my meetings, I started a practice of studying during the afternoon in preparation for what I knew would come on Monday morning. On one of those afternoons, another returned missionary roommate observed what I was doing. He said, "Say, Joe, are you a Mormon? Do you<i>really</i>believe in keeping the commandments?"<br><br>My answer was obvious: "Sure."<br><br>"Then how about 'Six days shalt thou labour, and do<i>all</i>thy work'?"<br><br>I got the message, and from that time on I changed. I began to do a better job of organizing my study time during the six days of the week. And sometimes I found that I needed to get up early--and I mean<i>very</i>early--on some Monday mornings to finish an assignment or preparation. There was less procrastination in my life. And so it continued on through graduate school. I knew that I should get it done during the week. I couldn't let myself get behind. I found that I felt better about myself and even noticed that my grades improved. I began to look forward to the change of pace that Sunday provided to take time to turn to things that were more spiritual.<br><br>I agree that there is some essential work that must be done on the Sabbath, and,<i>occasionally,</i>the ox does get in the mire. But usually, through our poor organization or procrastination, we may give the ox a little nudge.<br><br>Temptations to break the Sabbath are even greater now than they used to be. Television is a challenge. I love football, basketball, and about any athletic event. It doesn't matter who is playing whom. Barbara said, "Joe, I don't understand you. It doesn't matter who is playing--Mars could be playing Jupiter and I'll bet you would be interested." I agreed that if Mars were playing Jupiter, I would<i>really</i>be interested.<br><br>As you know, some of the best games are televised on Sunday, and whether it is Super Bowl or not, the temptation is great. There are probably several within the sound of my voice who justify regularly spending hours on Sunday in front of the tube watching the plays, replays, and listening to the almost endless postgame commentary. Or, maybe for you it is justifying yourself watching other shows on Sunday that are anything but spiritually uplifting.<br><br>I have discovered that we can take advantage of technology. You who have them can simply use VCRs to record the program you don't want to miss on Sunday, and then, in a fraction of the time on another day at your own convenience, you can watch that special event, fast-forward through the commercials and time outs, and not miss a thing.<br><br>After you have attended your meetings and other Church duties, you don't have to sit and fold your hands on Sunday. It is not a day for grubbies, but there are many things you can do that can make the day special. Choose from among the following suggestions from this First Presidency message:<br><br><i>As we plan our Sunday activities, ... set aside time for ... meditation, and for service to others. ... Read the scriptures, conference reports, and Church publications; study the lives and teachings of the prophets; prepare church lessons and other church assignments</i>[for example, study for your religion class];<i>write to or visit relatives and friends; write to missionaries; enjoy uplifting music ...; read with a child; do genealogical research,</i>[work on your]<i>personal histories; sing Church hymns; read uplifting literature; develop our appreciation for the cultural arts ...; friendship nonmembers ...; visit the sick, the aged, and the lonely.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Therefore I Was Taught,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1982, p. 3]<br><br>Make Sundays special, and they will help make you special in the sight of the Lord. Who was it that said, "It is not so much that the Jews kept the Sabbath," but rather, over the centuries, "The Sabbath kept the Jews." Keeping the Lord's day holy will do the same for you.<br><br>Well now, as one brother said, I have spoken<i>about</i>as long as it seems, and as the king advised in Lewis Carroll's<i>Alice in Wonderland,</i>"Begin at the beginning ... and go on till you come to the end: then stop" ("Turtle Soup," stanza 12). Well, we have come to that point.<br><br>It will take energy and effort to keep the resolutions about which I have spoken this evening. I pray that we will do this so that we can increase in "wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." And, in so doing, we will become more like the Savior every day for the rest of our lives. You have my sincere respect, confidence, trust, and love. I have never known more surely than now that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Exemplar. He lives, as does our Father in Heaven. We are commanded to become more like them, and if we make and keep good resolutions, we will become happier and more successful. For that I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Joe J.

<h1>the Light of Christ Shine Through Us: Our True Image - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
How does the month of January affect you? Gone are the carols, the wrapping paper, and the lights. Put away carefully are the wreaths, garlands, and bows. Out on the curbside sits the dry tree, which has left a trail of pine needles down the driveway. Packed predictably on our hips and thighs are the holiday treats served lovingly by grandmas, neighbors, and friends.<br><br>Has your "one-horse open sleigh" turned into a pumpkin with the first stroke of January? Has your "Silent night . . . all is calm, all is bright," gone to "study all night; what is wrong? I have no life?"<br><br>I would like to introduce my topic today with a bit of trivia. Did you know that the month of January was named after the Roman god Janus, who had two faces: one to look into the past and one to look into the future?<br><br>As we make our New Year's resolutions, we do so like Janus with an eye on the future but also with a look back on past mistakes as well as past successes. It seems we must do this in order to put our lives into perspective and decide how we can improve and refine ourselves.<br><br>As we reflect on our past, get a grasp on the present, and look to the future, it is important that we see clear images of where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going. Think how difficult that would be if the gospel of Jesus Christ were not a part of our lives. We would be able to see only the here and now, and our image of the present would be distorted by a lack of perspective. It is about seeing clear images with an eternal perspective that I would like to speak today.<br><br>When we see things up too close without looking at the entire picture, we lose perspective. Have you ever been to an art museum and viewed a painting from a few inches away, and then stepped back to see the grandeur of the artist's intent? (I've always wondered how great artists could catch the vision of the finished product only a paintbrush away.)<br><br>Have you ever looked at your face so close in a mirror that a zit appeared to be the size of a strawberry? Not long ago, our youngest daughter, Christie, was getting ready for a party when I heard this horrible sound. It was somewhere between a scream and a groan. Fearing she had burned herself with the curling iron that had been left on for an hour (with five daughters, Rex has spent the past fifteen years running around our house unplugging curling irons--that's how he trained for marathons), I rushed into her bathroom. There she sat on the counter with her feet in the sink and her face two inches away from the mirror.<br><br>"Gross," she kept repeating. "Gross! I am so ugly, I can't believe I would even go out of this house!" I stepped closer to see what was so gross, but it escaped me.<br><br>"Look at this," she said, turning her face toward me. "Did you ever see anything so gross?"<br><br>"What? Where?" was my honest response. "You look wonderful to me!"<br><br>"Oh, you're just saying that because you're my mother. If you can't see this red thing on my face then you are blind. It makes me look so ugly."<br><br>As she turned into the light, I finally saw the object of her distress, but just barely. It was a tiny bit pink and vaguely visible. In no way did it render her whole person ugly. I stood there by her side, the two of us looking at her reflection in the mirror. She saw only one thing, yet I could see so much more. I saw a beautiful young girl and could envision her beyond the beginning of her teens and see what she would become. She could see only the moment of anguish. I could see the loving heart and caring spirit. She could see only the blemish, a magnification of what was wrong, and it became the whole of her. No amount of talking on my part could convince her that my image of her was the clear one.<br><br>I thought to myself, "How can she not see who she really is? How can she complain when she has been given so much? How can one little blemish diminish her image of herself? Why can't she see the total picture of who she is and who she can be?"<br><br>And then I had a humbling thought. Aren't we all at times a little like Christie? How often do we fail to see things in their eternal perspective? How often do we let one flaw, one mistake, one bad grade, one disappointment, or even many disappointments loom so large before our eyes that we fail to see circumstances as they really are?<br><br>I can remember the first English paper I ever wrote when I was a freshman on this campus. It came back with red marks all over it--suggestions, corrections, sentences obliterated. I had thought I was a good student, that English was one of my best subjects, that I was a good writer. But, no! Now, because of one paper with a bunch of red marks on it, I saw myself as a failure.<br><br>Tears rolled down my cheeks as I walked across campus, and I questioned what I was doing here. Wasn't I being just a little like Christie? Did my Father in Heaven think I was a failure because of one English paper? Of course not. But momentarily I lost my confidence, and with it my eternal perspective. I had lost my ability to be the person Heavenly Father saw in me. When we allow this to happen, the light of Christ that is in us dims. That light is a gift to each of us. We are born with it, and by our acts on earth that light either fades or brightens.<br><br>As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 11:<br><br><i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.</i><br><br>Only through that light will we see clear reflections of who we and others are. Sometimes we are fooled by what the media would have us believe is perfection: gorgeous bodies, flawless skin, fashionable clothes. But this is not the way our Father in Heaven looks at us. We are told that "the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (l Samuel 16:7). He uses a measuring stick of eternal perfection, where what really counts is how much we illuminate with the light of Christ.<br><br>Whenever I think of letting the light of Christ shine through us, I think of a rainbow or a prism that refracts light and displays many beautiful colors in the process. Even with the light of Christ in each of us, our lives will be as different as the colors in the rainbow. Remember, it is not possible for us in this earth life to be mirror images of Christ's perfection. However, what we can do is allow his light to shine through us just as light shines through the atmosphere creating a rainbow--a unique piece of beauty.<br><br>Despite what the world may tell us, this light--or this beauty--does not grow brighter with cosmetics or expensive clothes. Instead, it increases with Christlike acts and living gospel principles, whether it be taking an extra few minutes to help a friend, being kind to someone less fortunate, speaking a soft word to someone who is stressed or angry, or giving up something that we want in order to make someone else's day more joyful, comfortable, or happy.<br><br>Marion G. Romney once said, "When earth life is over and things appear in their true perspective, we shall more clearly see . . . that the fruits of the gospel are the only objectives worthy of life's full efforts" (<i>CR,</i>October 1949, p. 39).<br><br>We would all like to have the ability of the two-headed Roman God Janus to look forward and backward at the same time, letting our past experiences direct our future ones. The best way--the only perfect way--this can be accomplished is by bringing the light of Christ into our lives. Only through the light of Christ that is in us and our understanding of the gospel can we see things in perspective--seeing as clearly as is possible in this life what is in the past and in the future.<br><br>I don't know about you, but I want to see everything. I wish I knew more and could understand all things. I am impatient, and I want to see everything clearly now. Even as a child I wondered what it would be like to see my Savior. I wondered if I would know him and if he would recognize me. My brothers and sisters, through the years I have come to understand that if we let his light shine in us, we will receive "his image in [our] countenances" (Alma 5:14), and he will know us, not by our outward appearance but by the light within. He will know us because our total beings will reflect his image. And we will know him because we recognize his light in us.<br><br>I know that our Redeemer is the light of the world and that his light dwells in each of us. I bear testimony that this is true. I want his image to be on my countenance. And when I look in my mirror of life, I want to see past the blemishes. I want his light to glow so deeply inside me that I will be able to see things, as completely as possible, with an eternal perspective. It is my prayer that we will nurture the God-given light that is in us. And when we feel its glow growing dim, we will reach out to others in Christlike ways reflecting his light and glory. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E.

<h1>ng Ingratitude with Gratitude - Rex E. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is a story, probably apocryphal, of an aging widow who eked out a meager living by selling soft pretzels on a busy city street corner for fifty cents apiece. Each morning a businessman passed her corner on his way to work. He had no taste for pretzels, but he wanted to help the person who sold them, so each morning he would give her the fifty cents and not take a pretzel.<br><br>One morning, after the man had performed the daily ritual and was walking away, the woman called him back. He said, "I know. You're wondering why it is that I never take my pretzel." She replied, "I couldn't care less about that. I just want you to know that the price has gone up to seventy-five cents."<br><br>In the mid-1970s I was the head of the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice. Together with about three hundred other lawyers, we handled the broad range of civil law suits brought either by, or more frequently against, the United States. One of the issues with which we dealt was the nationwide effort in the fall of 1976 to provide a vaccine against what most experts predicted would be a severe epidemic of swine flu that would affect the country during the ensuing winter. The government's medical experts predicted that millions would benefit from the vaccine, but they also predicted that with virtual certainty there would be a handful of people who would become quite ill, and some might even die--not from the flu, but from the vaccine. Some of these people would certainly sue the government, and past experience indicated that the resulting judgments might be substantial in amount. For these reasons there was a large debate within the government as to whether the predictable assistance to millions of people was justified in light of the large amounts that the government might have to pay in damage judgments.<br><br>During the course of one of those deliberations, I expressed to my governmental colleagues the following thought: "This problem exists only because of the government's humanitarian effort to save possibly millions of its citizens from serious illness and, in some cases, death. The United States of America is under no obligation to supply this vaccine. And yet we are anticipating an apparently predictable consequence in which some of the very people we are trying to help will turn around and sue us because of our Good Samaritan generosity." And then I asked the question that caused such amazement among the dozen or so other participants at that meeting: "Wouldn't you think that someone in this fair land of ours, maybe even one who had an adverse reaction to the vaccination, would say, 'You know, I really appreciate what the government is doing for me, looking out for my health, and going to great and unrequired effort and expense to help me and many others cut down our chances of sickness or death?" In short, I asked, "Shouldn't somebody be saying, 'Thank you for doing your best,' rather than, 'This better work or I'll see you in court?'"<br><br>I will never forget my colleagues' responses to those questions. They ranged from facial expressions reflecting unmistakable incredulity to verbal utterances, including such words as "naïveté," "lack of sophistication," and "that's what you get when you take some kid from the Rocky Mountains and ask him to handle the government's litigation."<br><br>The common feature of these two stories, of course, is gratitude or, perhaps more accurately, lack of gratitude. Today I want to share some thoughts concerning why gratitude is so important, why it is so neglected among all segments of society, including, regrettably, those of us who are members of the LDS Church, and whether there are any positive steps we can take to enhance our consciousness and our practice of this particular virtue.<br><br>There can be no doubt that gratitude is one of the great human accomplishments and ingratitude one of the great human failings. Scriptures, both ancient and modern, are very clear on this subject. President Benson tells us, "The Prophet Joseph is reported to have said at one time that one of the greatest sins for which the Latter-day Saints would be guilty would be the sin of ingratitude" (<i>TETB,</i>p. 363). Similarly, President Hinckley has observed that, "Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency" (<i>CR,</i>October 1964, p. 117). The Psalmist, in Psalm 100, put the basic proposition with characteristic simplicity and beauty: "Know ye that the Lord he is God: . . . be thankful unto him, and bless his name" (verses 3–4). And in more modern times, the Lord revealed the same truth to Joseph Smith: "And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious" (D&amp;amp;C 78:19).<br><br>In short, it is not open to any serious doubt that, as President Romney said in general conference about eleven years ago: "The virtues of gratitude have been widely extolled and the sinfulness of ingratitude has been just as widely condemned" ("Gratitude and Thanksgiving,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, p. 49).<br><br>Let me tell you of two of our students from whom over the past year I have learned important lessons about gratitude. They are both members of our men's basketball team, John Fish and Shawn Lindquist. In the past fifteen months neither of them has had as much playing time as he would have liked. At different times I asked each of them how he handled this challenge emotionally, and the responses I received were in each case a personal learning experience for me.<br><br>What John Fish told me, just prior to the Maui Classic a year ago, was, "Of course I'd like to be playing more. But I've concluded that if my role is to add depth and to provide playing minutes when the team needs me for that purpose, I'd rather do that as a member of a good basketball team, which this one certainly is."<br><br>Shawn's response was, "I'm just grateful to be in a BYU uniform and contributing when I can and what I can. When the team needs me, whether in practice or in a game, I'm there."<br><br>What a wonderful lesson from two very talented basketball players whose reaction could have been one of resentment. Instead, it was one of gratitude.<br><br>The most common English phrase we use to express our gratitude is a simple "Thank you." I've long been fascinated by the fact that the Spanish word for<i>thank you</i>also has another, quite separate, meaning. The word is<i>gracias,</i>as I suspect most of you know. But the word<i>gracias</i>is also the plural of the noun<i>grace,</i>and therefore implies a full range of virtues and characteristics related to human decency and kindnesses, including courtesy, civility, and genuine concern for other people. The fact that the Spanish word that is used as the basic expression of gratitude is also a noun that embraces generally those qualities of civility and kindness is surely pure coincidence. But it is also a convenient--even if coincidental--reminder of the breadth of human virtues that we develop when we practice gratitude.<br><br>Gratitude also involves more, however, than simple human kindness and courtesy. Righteousness itself is involved. In describing to Timothy the signs of human deterioration that would characterize the last days, Paul predicted that people would become "unthankful, unholy" (2 Timothy 3:2)--implying, I believe, that there is a direct link between unthankfulness and unholiness and, conversely, therefore, between thankfulness and holiness.<br><br>The most important question is, of course, how can we progress from theory to practice? What can we do to get ourselves beyond simply observing that gratitude is such a good thing and ingratitude such a bad thing? How do we move to the next step of actually doing something about it and adding gratitude to the list of virtues that we practice in fact? Thereby making ourselves better, total people--more thankful, and therefore more holy.<br><br>Each of the two steps is fairly simple. Part of the problem is simply one of recognition. That is, it is not so much that we practice ingratitude as a deliberate vice--as one might offend either the Word of Wisdom or principles of sexual morality because he or she chooses to do so for pleasure--but rather that we overlook and bypass positive opportunities to practice gratitude as an affirmative and consistent part of what we are. My favorite example of ingratitude--and one which demonstrates that inadvertence is probably one of its root causes--involves the ten lepers whom the Savior healed. Luke reports:<br><br><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i><br><br><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i><br><br><i>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</i>[Luke 17:15–18]<br><br>You know something? I think that report by Luke, of only one leper out of ten who even bothered to come back and say thank you, may be a fair statistical measure of what we might call the human gratitude index--not only 2,000 years ago, but today as well. Indeed, in today's world, ten percent would probably be an overly optimistic estimate.<br><br>I believe the first hurdle, therefore, is to conquer simple inadvertence. We are just not as aware as we ought to be. We need to make a conscious effort, because there are people for whom we should be grateful and there are opportunities all around us to express that gratitude. A simple awareness of those people and those circumstances will not come easily or naturally, as the story of the ten lepers illustrates. But we can work at it, and, like all worthwhile things, we will be happier and better people if we will make the effort.<br><br>Conquering inadvertence--making ourselves aware of the problem--is not the complete solution to overcoming ingratitude. It gets us partway there by bringing us to an inward consciousness of the debt of gratitude we owe to others. But there is, I believe, also another element. Gratitude should be not only felt inwardly but also expressed outwardly. And for most of us, for some reason, even those of us who express ourselves rather liberally on most subjects, expressing ourselves on this one is uncommonly difficult. This reality was illustrated very well by my colleague Dee Andersen in a Thanksgiving devotional address he delivered in this building in 1985. He reported that at a time when he worked at the Church Office Building in Salt Lake, he frequently found himself arriving at the parking lot at about the same time with another individual, whom he had admired for many years but to whom he had never been able to express his feelings of admiration and gratitude. In Brother Andersen's words, "Each time we entered the building and climbed onto the elevator together, I found myself tongue-tied. I could hardly stammer, 'Good morning,' much less, 'Oh, how I admire you,' or 'Thank you for all you have done and are doing for me.'" Finally, Brother Andersen, in his words, "took a pen in hand and in longhand wrote a short note that expressed [my] feelings."<br><br>A few days later, he received the following response:<br><br><i>Dear Dee,</i><br><br><i>That was one of the sweetest notes I have ever received, and I appreciate hearing from you. I am indeed grateful to be so close to you, and I hope that we may see each other once in a while. May the Lord bless you and assist you in all your efforts. With kindest wishes. Faithfully yours . . .</i><br><br>And whose signature was at the bottom of that note? We all recognize the name: Spencer W. Kimball. Dee concludes: "Oh, how President Kimball blessed my life because I took the time and had the courage to say thank you" ("Thanks-Living,"<i>BYU 1985–86 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1986], pp. 48–49).<br><br>These, then, are the two steps that I offer as a formula for adding the noble virtue of gratitude to our individual inventory of personal moral strengths: First we recognize the problem, and then we take affirmative steps to do something about it. Each step is simple to state and, at an abstract level, to understand. But as experiences from the days of the ten lepers down to Dee Andersen's time demonstrate, neither is easy to accomplish.<br><br>In conclusion, then, let me begin personally, right now, to practice what I have today been preaching and express a few things for which I am grateful.<br><br>1. I am grateful for the Restoration. I am grateful for prophets, for revelation, for the priesthood, for the Book of Mormon, and for the fact that I have been privileged to have come to earth during a time when the gospel and its plan for living are here in their fullness.<br><br>2. I am thankful for my family. With each passing year I grow more aware of just how important they are to me. Let me tell you of something that happened just a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday afternoon, and following dinner, instead of reading the scriptures in the usual way, we went around the table and from the oldest to the youngest asked each one to read his or her favorite scripture and make a brief comment as to why it was a favorite. It was a rather ordinary experience, and yet, as I listened to each of them, my gratitude intensified for family members who understand the scriptures and are committed to the eternal principles for which they stand. Nothing in this world, I think, brings quite the same joy as do loving family members who share common values and common devotion.<br><br>3. I am grateful for Brigham Young University. I appreciate the superb undergraduate preparation that I received here as a student--preparation for law school and preparation for life--in an atmosphere that builds great faith at the same time it stimulates the mind. I am grateful to the faithful tithe payers around the world whose contributions provide for about seventy percent of the cost of this unique education. Among my list of things for which I am grateful, this one is easy to overlook, and so I deliberately remind myself of it from time to time. I am also grateful for the students of your generation, for each of you, individually, and for some of your groups.<br><br>4. I am grateful for the loyalty, the competence, the encouragement, and the love that I enjoy from my professional colleagues at BYU, including the members of the President's Council, the broader administration, the faculty and staff, and my two colleagues with whom I work on a daily basis, Janet Calder and Jan Nelson. I am grateful that in my present employment, as in none other I have had, my wife Janet is also a professional colleague in many significant ways. In addition to the enjoyable aspects of that fact, she is, quite simply, very good at what she does--all the way from giving devotional talks to raising money to formulating and implementing new ideas to serving on committees and hosting. And for that competence and that devotion I am also grateful.<br><br>5. I am grateful for little things like food and water and clothes and a warm house, and the fact that unlike so many people in the world, and also unlike some of my ancestors, I have never been deprived of any of these. I am grateful that for fifty-five years there was no damage to the nerves in my legs, and I was privileged to participate in the many joys that healthy legs can bring. I am also grateful for life itself, for the fact that being relegated now to walking rather than running appears to be my most serious health challenge.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the business of BYU is education. We have come here to learn. The education for which we strive here reaches a broader range of learning than at other universities. Let me challenge each of us to make a conscious effort to include within that broader range of things to be learned at BYU an increase in our determination to practice gratitude, to enhance our appreciation for other people and for abundant blessings. May we deliberately strive to be more like Dee Andersen on the day he wrote that note to President Kimball, more like the one leper who came back to say "thank you," less like the nine who did not, and less like the pretzel merchant whose only response was that the price had gone up for pretzels she did not supply.<br><br>It will not be easy. Quite simply, for most of us gratitude is not something that develops naturally, without effort. But as prophets both ancient and modern have reminded us, expenditure of that effort is worthwhile, because we are dealing with one of the most important of all human virtues and one of the most common of all human deficiencies. Moreover, as Paul reminded Timothy, gratitude is tantamount to holiness. This means that when we enlarge our capacity for gratitude, we are also enriching our entire souls. Be conscious of people and circumstances all around you--family members, roommates, professors, classmates, and others who are really deserving of your gratitude--and then buck up your courage enough to tell them how you feel. That we may extend that positive effort is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1> By Faith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is both a privilege and an honor to speak to you on this occasion and to represent the faculty of this wonderful institution. I am conscious of the hope and faith that has brought you here this morning and of the obligation that is now mine to offer something worthy of your trust. My only request is that you listen actively, rather than passively, and become part of a silent dialogue that will invite you to make an honest appraisal of the nature of your commitment to the process of learning and a quiet review of your desires, experiences, and objectives in spiritual things. It is my hope that you will be encouraged to approach the learning process with fresh vision and enthusiasm and motivated to increase your understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ by striving to live according to its principles.<br><br>I have chosen to speak about learning by faith. It is a subject that is often mentioned but seldom discussed and frequently misunderstood. I am confident that it is appropriate and timely because of the manner in which I have been impelled to prepare it. It is especially appropriate at Brigham Young University, for those who choose to come here to teach or learn are expected to live and study in ways that conform with eternal principles.<br><br>In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord admonished his people to "seek learning, even by study and <i>also</i> by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118; emphasis added). Let us reflect on this statement for a few moments. It begins with the word <i>seek,</i> instead of a word like <i>acquire, obtain, secure,</i> or <i>gain--</i>words that might seem on the surface to be just as appropriate. To seek, in its scriptural context, means to pursue an objective with a firm commitment to reaching it. Seeking is not an attempt that is easily abandoned; nor is it a desire that is placated for the sake of convenience. It demands devotion, direction, and dedication. "Seek, and ye shall find" (Matthew 7:7) is a wonderful promise. Those who seek objectives that are right, good, and expedient in the wisdom of God will be provided in time with the means to realize their desires (3 Nephi 18:20).<br><br>I also find significance in the use of the word learning, instead of a word like <i>education, knowledge, understanding, skill,</i> or <i>wisdom.</i> Learning is a process, not an objective. Rather than directing us to seek a predetermined result, such as a certain species of knowledge or a specific skill, we are encouraged by the Lord to seek the process through which these can be obtained. To engage in the process of "learning" is to immerse oneself in the means by which knowledge, understanding, skill, and wisdom are acquired. It is the way growth and development are nurtured and attained on a personal level.<br><br>We are comfortable with the idea of seeking to learn through study. This institution, like most others, assumes that those who "enter to learn" accept the necessity of study and have already developed effective study skills. Nevertheless, within the classroom environment it has been my observation that some students approach the opportunity of study with dread rather than with excitement. Interest and desire, those important qualities so essential to personal motivation and commitment, are often weak and sometimes entirely missing. Many seem to hope that class attendance, marginal participation, obedient completion of carefully guided activities, objectified tests, or other questionable trappings of institutionalized "learning" will provide an easier, friendlier substitute for the rigor and discipline of study. As a consequence, the mental exhilaration and quiet confidence that come only through genuine study are replaced by doubt and insecurity--all because of an incorrect assumption that learning can result from comfortable means. For many, study is a burden--an obligation to be satisfied as quickly and effortlessly as possible, a "requirement" one must satisfy to acquire the accoutrements of education.<br><br>The Lord has assured us that "it is [his] will that [we] should hasten to ... obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man" (D&amp;amp;C 93:53). He has encouraged us to "study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15). The apostle Paul counseled Timothy to study so that he would be able to understand and teach the truth without perversion or distortion and not be ashamed before God (2 Timothy 2:15). Jesus Christ, himself, the perfect exemplar, studied the law and the prophets early in life. Luke informs us that thereafter Jesus "increased in wisdom and stature" (Luke 2:52). In Proverbs we are taught that "the heart of the righteous studieth to answer" (Proverbs 15:28), a clear reference to one of the methods of seeking and receiving revealed knowledge in which the Lord has instructed us to "study it out in [our] mind" before asking if it be right (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). We should, according to Paul in his instruction to the Thessalonians, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21). We are expected to study. If we wish to acquire knowledge, skill, understanding, or wisdom, we must apply the principles of effective study as we seek learning.<br><br>While learning by study is widely understood, accepted, and valued, learning by faith is often misunderstood, seldom applied, and generally ignored as a valid learning process. Why is this? Is it because we have been so thoroughly indoctrinated with the secular definition of faith that we fail to understand its real nature and value? When confronted with the Lord's counsel to seek learning by faith, what do we assume he means? Is it an admonition to engage in a process that may be just as essential as study? Or do we dismiss it as a fuzzy invitation to believe those things that are difficult to explain or impossible to prove and get on with life?<br><br>There is obviously more to learning than mere study. Surely, none of us wants to be accused, as was Job, of opening our mouth in vain by multiplying "words without knowledge" (Job 35:16). Nor do we aspire to be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7). Even though "truth is knowledge of things as they are" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24), it is difficult, given the limitations of our temporal bodies and minds, to clearly perceive and accurately define reality. There are so many convincing counterfeits of truth. Well might we ask, as did Elihu:<br><br><i>Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</i><br><br>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? [Job 35:10–11]<br><br>Perhaps you have occasionally longed, as I have, for the relative certainty of a simpler time, a time long ago when the Creator himself "gave [our earliest progenitors] knowledge, in the day [that he] created them" (Moses 7:32).<br><br>Is there a key to learning, to perceiving things as they really are and understanding their significance? I believe a fundamental principle is found in two parallel statements in Proverbs. The first asserts that "knowledge of the holy is understanding" (Proverbs 9:10), and the second proposes that "knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth" (Proverbs 14:6). To know that which is holy one must commit to live the principles of holiness--those principles of living espoused by our Eternal Father, the Man of Holiness (Moses 6:57, 7:35). Experience will confirm that living by these eternal principles does result in a level of personal understanding that makes the process of acquiring knowledge easier in a certain sense. To seek holiness with a sincere heart is to invite the Spirit of Truth to "guide you into all truth" (John 16:13). As the Holy Ghost guides you into truth, you begin to understand and appreciate the quiet confidence of Ammon in the presence of King Lamoni--affirming that a portion of the Holy Spirit dwelled in him, which gave him knowledge (see Alma 18:35). The experience of receiving knowledge through spiritual means is not only informative, but sanctifying and enriching. It is knowledge that has wholeness because it is grounded in "the holy." Alma taught that knowledge received in this way is perfect knowledge (see Alma 32:34).<br><br>The person who is not inclined toward holiness, sometimes identified as the "natural man[,] receiveth not the things of the Spirit" (1 Corinthians 2:14). In this mental condition he or she is impervious to knowledge of that which is holy and may be unable to understand the meaning of information gathered through study or experience. Without spiritual assistance, trying to acquire knowledge can be difficult. Learning and developing a skill may be complicated by fear, understanding might appear to be an elusive dream, and wisdom is a mystery.<br><br>Let us now approach the idea of learning by faith more directly. What is faith, and what does it mean to seek learning by faith? The author of Hebrews defines faith as "the substance [or assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence [or proof] of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). According to this definition, faith is characterized by substantial assurance and evidence that is absolutely convincing as proof of things that cannot be perceived through the physical senses or validated by common methods of inquiry. What kind of assurance is this? How does one receive it? If something cannot be seen, what kind of evidence would possibly convince one that it exists? The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "Faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen, and the principle of action in all intelligent beings" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i> 1:9). In drawing a comparison between belief and faith, Elder James E. Talmage wrote:<br><br><i>Belief, in one of its accepted senses, may consist in a merely intellectual assent, while faith implies such confidence and conviction as will impel to action.</i> [<i>The Articles of Faith</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1975), pp. 96]<br><br>Clearly, both individuals are describing faith as a condition of absolute confidence that results from evidence that is convincing and assurance that is substantial.<br><br>What is the real substance of this assurance and evidence we call faith? According to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Faith comes by hearing the word of God, through the testimony of the servants of God; that testimony is always attended by the Spirit of ... revelation" (<i>HC</i> 3:379). We learn from this that it is the spirit of revelation that produces faith in the listener. What, then, is the nature of the spirit of revelation and how does it infuse the listener with faith? The Lord has given us a clear answer:<br><br><i>I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation. [D&amp;amp;C 8:2]<br><br>The spirit of revelation influences the mind and the heart. It comes through the Holy Ghost and may dwell in our heart. More specifically, the Lord has said:<br><br><i>I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br>And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness. [D&amp;amp;C 11:13–14]<br><br>The Holy Ghost, through its enlightening influence on the mind and its joyful effect within the core of our being, provides the convincing evidence and compelling assurance that we call faith. The influence of the Holy Ghost has "substance" that can be perceived. Our perception of its powerful effect provides convincing proof of its existence. And because this experience is subjective in nature, there is no real need to seek evidence from another source. As the Prophet Alma exclaimed in reference to this experience of spiritual enlightenment and pure joy, "Is not this real?" (Alma 32:35).<br><br>Faith, then, is a spiritual gift that is available through the agency of the Holy Ghost. How does one qualify for this gift? Moroni, quoting from the sermons and letters of his father, Mormon, provides us with a clear answer. A person, he writes, "cannot have faith ..., save he shall be meek, and lowly in heart. ... for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart" (Moroni 7:43–44). To qualify for the gift of faith, one must first be acceptable before God, and only those who are meek and lowly in heart are acceptable. This being so, how does one acquire the qualities of meekness and lowliness of heart? Referring to repentance and baptism, Mormon answers:<br><br><i>Fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</i><br><br>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer. [Moroni 8:25–26]<br><br>The process is simple. One is convinced of the truth, importance, and benefits of God's ways while under the influence of the Holy Ghost. The convincing power of the Holy Ghost induces feelings of sorrow for sin that lead to a sincere desire for change that impels one to repent. The consequence of genuine repentance is remission of sin, which results in "meekness" or "lowliness of heart." Another word more commonly used to describe this spiritual condition is humility. Because of humility the Holy Ghost is able to visit and abide, blessing the qualified individual with faith, hope, and perfect love. By "diligence unto prayer" this blessing may continue.<br><br>Is it any wonder that this institution requires higher standards of behavior than most other schools? Faith can only be acquired through personal righteousness, and learning by faith will not occur until that prerequisite is satisfied. For example, do you remember the promise of the Word of Wisdom? Those who abide by its principles "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 89:19). We should be thankful for standards that remind us continually of the way we ought to live. We should more fully appreciate the opportunity of living in an environment where repentance is taught and valued. Only by grasping and living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ will any of us be able to enjoy the gift of faith.<br><br>It should have become obvious by this point in our discussion that to seek learning by faith is to qualify to learn under the influence of the Holy Ghost. Though the way we must qualify is clear, it is not easy. Constant awareness, personal discipline, a willingness to change and grow, and humility must replace pride, behavioral rigidity, weakness of character, and a casual approach to life. Phrased in the vernacular, we must be willing to "walk the talk."<br><br>As we seek learning by faith, we may be enlightened, edified, chastened, comforted, assured, strengthened, restrained, given peace of mind, or have conclusions reached through study confirmed or rejected. I will briefly identify, describe, and discuss each of the evidences or assurances that characterize learning by faith. In the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas ... ; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> p. 151]<br><br>A sensitive self-awareness is required to discern the difference between "pure intelligence flowing into you" and the normal functioning of your powers of logic, reasoning, or imagination. But there is a discernable difference. "Pure intelligence" is always accompanied by feelings of peace and certainty, rather than hesitation and doubt. One has a confident sense of enlightenment. If we respond to these "sudden strokes of ideas" by pursuing them further through concentrated study and committed application, understanding and wisdom will result.<br><br>We know we are learning under the influence of the Holy Ghost if we are being edified. Edification is characterized by a perception of goodness, a noticeable enlarging of the soul, and enlightenment of the mind. Those who desire to learn by faith must continually reject darkness and seek light.<br><br><i>That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i><br><br>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>Those who seek to learn where spiritual darkness reigns will always seek in vain, and without spiritual assistance. Darkness is not in harmony with the nature of the Spirit of Truth. The sophistry of the world claims that one is free to plunge into any avenue of study without fear of harm. "After all, it's only study," we are told, only an intellectual exercise or experiment. But when darkness is chosen, the light of truth inevitably grows dimmer, and the learner enters a perilous mental environment. Learning by faith is centered in edification--the process of receiving light through continuing in God's ways.<br><br>There are some things that can only be learned through experience. In this Jesus Christ is the great exemplar. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered," reports the author of Hebrews (Hebrews 5:8). If it was expedient for him to learn the principle of obedience through suffering, should we be surprised if we are required, from time to time, to walk a similar path? The Lord has warned us that his "people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer" (D&amp;amp;C 105:6). There will be times when painful experience is the only effective teacher, especially if we have made unwise decisions or pursued unworthy objectives. During experiences of this kind, however, those who seek learning by faith will have access to "the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost," to fill them with the strengthening substance of spiritual assurance (John 14:26).<br><br>It is instructive to note the Lord's purpose in allowing the Prophet Joseph Smith to suffer injustice and personal tragedy. "Know thou, my son," he spoke with perfect understanding, "that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). As part of the learning we seek, we may need to be chastened through experiences that require patience and endurance, but we will have no fear if we walk "in the comfort of the Holy Ghost" (Acts 9:31).<br><br>When one pursues a line of reasoning that is incorrect, or makes false assumptions, the restraining influence of the Holy Spirit will be perceived if sin has not dulled spiritual awareness. This restraint may be manifest as conflict or agitation in the mind, an absence of peace, or a sense of mental darkness. Further study and a flexible attitude of mind, together with humility born of repentance, will usually lead to the discovery of new direction and clarified vision. However, if we persist in an incorrect line of thinking or an unwise course of action because of pride or "the persuasions of men" (D&amp;amp;C 3:6), in spite of or in opposition to spiritual signals of restraint, our thinking will become muddled and unclear. In this mental condition concepts are formed with difficulty and creative ideas lack integrity. When the influence of the Holy Ghost is lost, the mind becomes darkened (see D&amp;amp;C 10:2).<br><br>In contrast, as one follows a path of logic or imagination that is right and true, the subtle, confirming influence of the Holy Ghost is manifest. Most often this is perceived as a calm, peaceful mental condition or a fluent and agile imagination. "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?" the Lord instructed Oliver Cowdery. "What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23).<br><br>When we combine learning by study with learning by faith, a wonderful level of confidence emerges. I have always been grateful that Oliver Cowdery failed in his attempt to translate because his failure invited the Lord to give the following instruction about learning by faith:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i> [Let's pause here for a moment and reflect on how often we might have been guilty of taking no thought before asking.]<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought. [D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>Notice here the precise requirement of study before asking for assistance, and the promise of a specific form of confirmation if your decision is right and another if it is wrong. What a marvelous gift this is! It is one of those precious methods of learning by faith that our Father in Heaven has provided for our use. But we must be careful how we use it. As he warned Oliver Cowdery on another occasion: "Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not" (D&amp;amp;C 8:10).<br><br>I believe we may profit by briefly considering one of the greatest benefits of seeking learning by faith--the gift of charity. The reason that faith, hope, and charity are so closely related in the scriptures is that they come through the same source. That source is the Holy Ghost. Do you remember the instruction quoted earlier from Moroni's father, Mormon, promising that repentance will allow "the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love" (Moroni 8:26)? Earlier in that section of scripture, Mormon teaches that "charity is the pure love of Christ" and exhorts us to "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ" (Moroni 7:47, 48). As we qualify for the gift of faith, the gift of charity follows.<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth ... in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i> [Moroni 7:45]<br><br>It is a perfect way of living. "Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth," Paul taught the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 8:1). Do we fully understand why learning by faith is so important? Perhaps it is because doing so leads one to the pure love of Christ--the most important influence a person could ever desire.<br><br>Difficult temptations come as one aspires to acquire knowledge, skill, and understanding. Those involved in higher education, as we are, are surrounded by an enterprise that thrives on vain imaginations. On every hand we are encouraged to become a self-sufficient authority in some area of learning--gradually closing off our dependence on others, sometimes including God, and lifting ourselves up as a source of light. The prophet Jacob put this tendency in proper perspective:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.</i> [2 Nephi 9:28]<br><br>So, does the process of learning by faith help us overcome this temptation? Yes, I believe it does, because humility is a prerequisite. Let's pursue this idea a little further.<br><br>Knowledge may cause us to be critical of others less informed than we are in a particular matter. Having discovered something of value through our interests and efforts, it is tempting to make comparisons with others--assuming that our small piece of knowledge is essential, if not transcendent. Moroni counseled us wisely when he cautioned us against condemning him, his father, or his people because of their weaknesses. He said, "Rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been" (Mormon 9:31). Humility, meekness, and lowliness of heart invite charity, the pure love of Christ. And this pure love endows us with understanding and puts knowledge in proper perspective.<br><br>Nephi warns us of a practice he calls priestcraft--another temptation that follows educational success--and testifies that the Lord forbids it.<br><br>[The Lord] <i>commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men ... set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</i><br><br>Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love. [2 Nephi 26:29–30]<br><br>Again, learning by faith can provide protection from the temptation to become a self-appointed authority or to seek gain and praise of the world, because it leads us into charity, which turns our efforts naturally toward service. In the words of the prophet Jacob, "To be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29).<br><br>Self-sufficiency, arrogance, and priestcraft can surely prevent us from learning by faith. But there are a number of other impediments. If we transgress the commandments of God and go contrary to his laws, we withdraw ourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, and it no longer has a place in us to guide us in wisdom's paths (see Mosiah 2:36). We must remember that "the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" (Helaman 4:24). The Holy Ghost is repelled if we seek those things that are wicked or evil (see Mormon 1:14), if we are unwilling to receive counsel (see D&amp;amp;C 63:55), if we are lustful in our desires (see D&amp;amp;C 42:23), if we contend against the spirit of revelation (see Alma 34:38), or if we try to use position or authority to manipulate others (see D&amp;amp;C 121:37). The Holy Ghost may visit briefly and not stay because things are amiss in our life (see D&amp;amp;C 130:23).<br><br>In an institutional environment, surrounded by power structures of our own making, one may succumb to temptations of a more subtle nature. Intellectual pride can replace honest inquiry, especially if praise becomes a subconscious objective. Contention, so destructive of spiritual means, may be easily justified as an essential learning behavior--a method of keeping others honest even if it might require us to sometimes be dishonest. Gratitude may be replaced by expectations of adulation and comfortable support. A focus on personal accomplishment, excellence, or professional advancement may replace a desire to serve the needs of others. In these and a number of other ways we may distance ourselves from our Father in Heaven and his ways and slowly, almost imperceptibly, become hard in our hearts. When this condition exists, learning by faith is no longer possible.<br><br>Let us learn an important lesson from Amulek, a companion of the prophet Alma. After rehearsing his distinguished genealogy and the course of his comparatively successful life, he revealed a weakness that is probably quite common:<br><br><i>I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power....</i><br><br>Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know. [Alma 10:5–6]<br><br>How often are we guilty of the same blindness? Are we not all prone to repeat Amulek's mistake if we are not concerned and careful? Are we willing to accept the admonition to "seek learning, even by study <i>and also by faith"</i> (D&amp;amp;C 88:118; emphasis added), or are we content to follow the world's ways? Will we continually soften our hearts, change our lives, and partake of the knowledge and understanding our Father in Heaven wishes to give us? Or will we confine ourselves to the safe, secure methods of the educational establishment and accept a lesser portion?<br><br>The invitation of the Lord is plain, for he has said,<br><br><i>Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom by humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God, that his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened that he may hear;</i><br><br>For my Spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnation of the ungodly. [D&amp;amp;C 136:32–33]<br><br>I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the Holy Ghost enlightens those who are willing to qualify for that blessing through sincere repentance. May each of us nurture a desire to live worthy of the opportunities that are available at this institution to learn by study and also by faith. I testify to the truthfulness of the principles that have been discussed this hour, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>K.

<h1> Peace: Blessed Are the Peacemakers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the prayer, for the music, for the kind introduction, and most of all for visiting with you tonight. I want to talk with you about peace and about the Prince of Peace. Please join your prayer with mine that we might have the companionship of the spirit of truth and of peace.<br><br>When you look at your newspaper and your television screen you don't see much about peace. Oh, there was and still is some talk in the press and by politicians in the United States about a "peace dividend." You will notice less and less talk about that. That dividend was supposed to be the money we would no longer have to spend on armaments as a nation because of what was called the "collapse" of the Soviet Union. But every day the news is filled with more violence, apparently growing violence, across the world and in our own cities. Most of you even plan what you do at night, taking your safety into account. You hope to avoid the violence of other people.<br><br>Now, if you listen carefully, in the debates about what to do to create peace, you will hear some common themes. Interestingly, the themes remain much the same whether the question is how to gain peace in the world or in your neighborhood. One theme is disarmament. Those who see danger in bombs or in guns take comfort when any country or any group of people give up weapons. But there are those, equally sure, who argue that the only safety is to have enough bombs or guns that no one will attack you.<br><br>Another theme is that of negotiation: If we can just get people to talk with each other, then they will choose peace. And so you read about and see pictures of diplomats and secretaries of state and heads of nations flying to Geneva or somewhere else to talk. Always the media is there to tell you how it is going. They try to judge whether, because of what is negotiated, the shooting will stop or go on. But even when shooting stops, usually just for a short while, the meetings and the media move to some other place, because the shooting has started somewhere else.<br><br>Another theme in the search for peace is education: If people just knew more, if they understood better, if they were educated enough to have a better life, they would choose peace. And so we search for ways for more people to have better educations.<br><br>In that theme, the theme of education, is a key to understanding both the difficulties in most proposed solutions to violence and also the sure way to peace. The hope of ending violence by better education is that if people just understood better, they would want peace and so they would choose it. If you believe education could promote peace, you believe that anyone who could think clearly will not choose violence. But when you look at experience, both in your life and as the world has sought peace, you can see that the most devastating violence begins in thoughtful choice. Disarmament treaties are signed, and then nations, and individuals, decide that it is in their best interest to break them. So, they do, usually in secret and then finally in the open. Or, people decide that arming themselves will keep the peace, and then, quite rationally, get more arms to match what their enemy gets. And then both sides acquire so much that their own bombs and guns become as dangerous to them as are those in the hands of their enemies.<br><br>Even the proposals to build more prisons and have tougher laws and give us more law enforcement officers are based on the hope that people who would harm you will make a thoughtful choice not to try. But you know from your own experience and from observing others where that finally fails. As long as people want something for themselves enough to hurt you to get it, they will keep searching until they find a way. And you can never build a fence long enough, or high enough, or strong enough but that they will find a way around, or under, or through it.<br><br>That is why neither education, nor disarmament, nor armament, nor negotiation, nor all of them in combination are likely to create a world or a neighborhood of lasting peace. To do that, a change has to come into human hearts. The change must be in what people want. Almost everyone in the world has heard of what that change is, because it is common to religions and philosophies across the world and across the centuries. It is said differently in the scriptures and writings of others, but the words you will recognize best are these: "Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets" (3 Nephi 14:12).<br><br>You can see how that would work, if that change had come to your heart and to mine. If you and I both felt that way, whether we did or didn't have a gun wouldn't matter, unless you tried to give me yours because you felt I needed it to hunt for food more than you did.<br><br>We would certainly still need to negotiate when we disagreed, but our negotiations would take a very different turn. I saw two such men--changed men--negotiate for a place in a cafeteria waiting line a few years ago. One, the younger man, tried to get the older man to go ahead of him, because he thought the older man's time was more valuable than his. But the older man refused. They were negotiating their disagreement as I watched, both determined that the other would go first. I remember that the older man won his point. His name was Spencer W. Kimball. The younger man must have thought that the time of the president of the Church was more valuable than his. But I suppose President Kimball thought that the younger man's stomach needed something in it sooner than his did. There was disagreement and negotiation. But think of what a disagreement that was, and think of the smiles on their faces as they found, together, a path of peace.<br><br>Because so many of you are paying so great a price for education, you need assurance that what you learn can contribute to peace--in your own life and even in the world. Education can help you understand what is in the interests of your brothers and sisters and in your own best interests. And it can help you know how to create and to provide what will be in our best interest. The fruits of science and of other learning are enriching our lives today beyond what our ancestors, even a few generations ago, could have imagined. Much of that came from the fruits of people like you, who sacrificed and persevered to gain education and then used its fruits in the service of others.<br><br>But knowing what is best for you and me, and even knowing how to provide it, will not necessarily change our hearts to want each other's interests as much as we want our own. That is the change which matters. And only a very special and rare education, one that the Savior Jesus Christ offers, will bring it into human hearts. And that is what we need in ourselves, in our families, in our neighborhoods, and in the world.<br><br>Now, as Latter-day Saints, we should work for peace. You remember that the Lord said, "Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace" (D&amp;amp;C 98:16).<br><br>So we should study out and then support whatever would reduce war and violence. But among all the proposals we may consider, only one will go to the heart of what is required for peace. Look at the very next phrase in that section of the Doctrine and Covenants, after we are commanded by God to renounce war and proclaim peace. It is just a few words--they may seem to some almost not connected to what went before, but they tell us where to look for the path to peace. Here is the whole phrase:<br><br><i>Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:16]<br><br>The path away from war and violence and toward peace is in the turning of hearts. And we wisely start with a turning in feelings toward others--those closest to us, those to whom we owe the most, those upon whom we most depend, and those with whom we want to associate most often.<br><br>With all the effort and thought and caring you may give to the pursuit of peace, never stray far from seeking ways to change hearts. And start close by, in your own heart and the hearts of those close to you.<br><br>More than that, we know, because God has told us through his servants, the road to travel to find peace. No road leads to peace, for a person or for the world, unless it leads away from the effects of sin and Satan. Satan has always taught men and women to take what they want by taking life. I like the forthright way John Taylor, a president of the Church in this dispensation, gave us the direction to follow. He said:<br><br><i>Peace is the gift of God. Do you want peace? Go to God. Do you want peace in your families? Go to God. Do you want peace to brood over your families? If you do, live your religion, and the very peace of God will dwell and abide with you, for that is where peace comes from, and it do</i>[es]<i>n't dwell anywhere else.</i>[<i>JD</i>10:56]<br><br>When President Taylor urges you to go to God for peace, he is saying more, much more, than to simply ask for it in prayer. That change in what we want, the one that will bring peace in your heart and then between people, is the natural fruit of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life. President Kimball described our private peace this way:<br><br><i>The essence of the miracle of forgiveness is that it brings peace to the previously anxious, restless, frustrated, perhaps tormented soul. In a world of turmoil and contention this is indeed a priceless gift.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 363]<br><br>And then, just a few pages later, he wrote, almost as if he were explaining how to follow the instruction of President Taylor:<br><br><i>It is not easy to be at peace in today's troubled world. Necessarily peace is a personal acquisition. ... it can be attained only through maintaining constantly a repentant attitude, seeking forgiveness of sins both large and small, and thus coming ever closer to God. For Church members this is the essence of their preparation, their readiness to meet the Savior when he comes.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>p. 366]<br><br>How that cleansing of sin changes our hearts and moves us closer to God is described in numbers of ways in the scriptures, but one seems to me the clearest in telling you what to do to help others want to make the change and then choose to make it. It is in the eighth chapter of Moroni, starting at the twenty-fifth verse. Listen very carefully. This is almost like a list of instructions, and it is a simple one, one you could follow:<br><br><i>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</i><br><br><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</i>[Moroni 8:25–26]<br><br>There are words to remember there. The remission of sins brings meekness and lowliness of heart. Because of that, the Holy Ghost can come, which gives us hope and perfect love. And that love--if you ask God for help with enough faith and sincerity and often enough--will stay with you through all the troubles and hatred you will ever face. And then you will live with God.<br><br>Now, with that clear, one of the passages in Isaiah that you may sometimes pass too quickly because you think you won't understand it, makes perfect sense: "And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever" (Isaiah 32:17).<br><br>But you might well say, "But do I have to wait until I am perfect and the people around me are perfect before I can live in peace?" I suppose in one way the answer is, "Yes," if you mean to live in perfect peace. But there is a much happier answer, and a true one. It is this: We are promised peace in this life before we are perfect. You remember how the preface to the Book of Mormon describes its most important message:<br><br><i>The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.</i>[Introduction: 3]<br><br>I testify to you that you can taste peace in this life. God grants us peace as we go along the road to perfection. Here is the way Elder Bruce R. McConkie described the promise, which is a true one. He is describing eternal life, which means to live in families in the celestial kingdom, and then he speaks of what we can expect here, in this life:<br><br><i>Eternal families have their beginning in celestial marriage here in mortality. Faithful members of them continue in the family unit in eternity, in the highest heaven of the celestial world, where they have eternal increase. ... Perfect peace and a full endowment of all good graces attend such eternal families. By obedience to the laws of the gospel (which are celestial laws), Latter-day Saint families begin here and now to enjoy much of that peace, joy, love, and charity which will be enjoyed in eternal fulness in the exalted family unit.</i>[<i>MD,</i>p. 273]<br><br>You can begin to know peace, the peace the gospel brings, even before you are blessed to live in such a family, sealed by eternal covenants. If you are wise, you will start now to prepare to live in peace in such a family. If you start that preparation, it will direct your attention to the few people with whom you live and associate each day. It is with a few people where you have the best chance to begin learning how to go to God to bring peace.<br><br>Now, it's important that I give you a caution. We will talk tonight about what you can do to help those close to you choose the path to that change in their hearts which will bring them inner peace and peace with others. Most of you will be giving this service to those to whom you are not married, who are not part of your family. You naturally long for the day when you can build peace within the walls of a home you are creating. In learning how to do that before marriage, be careful. Always reserve for that future day, with great care, the physical and emotional intimacy which is sacred to the family.<br><br>Now, as we have talked tonight, a few things ought to be clear. First, you and I will know how to recognize the change of heart, the mighty change, when it comes to bring peace. You will know it has come in you when you or they want what is good for others as much as you want good for yourself. And, second, we know the sure way for that change to come: It comes as the certain fruit of the gospel of Jesus Christ working because you exercised faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance.<br><br>Now, let me tell you how I know some things you can do to make it more likely that those around you will find the peace the gospel brings. The reason I can do this is that people around me have helped me make choices that brought changes and peace to me. Now, to be honest with you, I also know what to recommend to you because when those around me didn't do these things we'll talk about, there was less peace, and sometimes sadness for me. That wasn't because the people around me made me sad, but because without these influences we'll talk about, I was less likely to make the choices that would have brought me peace.<br><br>I can see a question forming in your mind. It goes something like this: "Wait a minute, Brother Eyring, are you saying that my living the gospel depends on help from people around me? Don't you know that I am nearly alone in trying to live the gospel?"<br><br>I know that many of you struggle with little help from those around you. No, of course you are not dependent, and neither am I, on having people around us to help. We are all responsible for our choices. And God will not leave us so alone that we cannot live the gospel of Jesus Christ. He never gives a commandment without preparing the way for us to keep it. And I am like you: I want to be strong enough to stand alone when I must. But what a blessing each of us can be, if we try, to bless those around us. I testify that your power to stand alone, to live the gospel of Jesus Christ in hard circumstances, will be increased as you reach out to help others live it. And you will feel less alone as you do.<br><br>It's not hard to know what to do to help. The people you will see tonight or tomorrow need to do some things that are simply said, but not easily done: First, they must exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repent, with a broken heart and contrite spirit; third, accept the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ; and, fourth, gain the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. And you know, and I testify to you, that from these simple things will come in time the mighty change, and with that, the peace in this life and the hope of eternal life in the world to come will follow.<br><br>Let's begin with helping people to build faith: What could you do to make it more likely that someone you associate with will exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ? Example is one way. And, it is example that has had the most powerful effect in encouraging me to exercise faith. You and I have seen great faith. You've seen young people choose to serve missions when neither family nor circumstance made that easy. You may have served with one as a companion. You've seen a child, late on a fast day, watch intently as dinner is prepared. And then it dawned on you that they had fasted, twenty-four hours, because they loved the Savior, without either being spoken to or saying a word about it themselves. You've seen parents at the funeral of their child, tears streaming down their faces, thanking you for being so thoughtful to come. And they may have whispered to you, "Oh, we're fine. We know we will all be together again." You remember their smiles as much as their words, and you felt their faith.<br><br>Now, to a suggestion for you. You can be an example that will make it more likely that those near you will decide to exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. There is at least one simple way to choose what you will do. And, by the way, you don't have to plan to be observed. You don't start with the idea of putting on a performance. Just start this way: Ask yourself this question, "What would the Savior have me do that I have been putting off because it seemed hard?" You won't have any trouble thinking of more than one. It doesn't have to seem hard to anybody else, just to you. Then, choose one from your list and do it. You might even try not to be observed. People who live and work with you notice more than you think. And they are more likely to exercise faith when they see your faith in Jesus Christ by your doing what for you took sacrifice.<br><br>You will also at times want to bear testimony of the Savior in words. That can build faith. Although you will do that in your own way as you are prompted, I can tell you what has helped me most. My heart seems to feel faith when the person speaking expresses both conviction and love. The conviction doesn't seem to come with the emotion in the voice as much as from the way I have seen the person behave. So your example may mean more than your words in conveying conviction. But, since my heart needs to be drawn toward the Savior, you help me most when your testimony includes words that tell me what you know about how the Savior loves you and loves me. That draws me to him, and that's what I must feel to have faith enough to want to repent and to feel I will be forgiven.<br><br>You can be sure of this: When the person begins to feel real faith in Jesus Christ, they will begin to feel sorrow for sin. You can't make another person repent, but you can make it easier for them to want a repentant heart. The people who have helped me most have been those who asked my forgiveness as if it mattered to them and have forgiven me easily when I have offended. I've noticed, as perhaps you have, that such help most often comes from children. Aren't you softened when you see a child forgive so easily? Or when one says to you, with a catch in her voice, "I'm sorry, Daddy. Will you forgive me?"<br><br>I suppose that act of a little child works so powerfully on me because it makes me want to be like them--clean. And just that thought starts the inner review which so often leads to our asking forgiveness, both from those we have wronged and from God.<br><br>For most of us, that forgiveness needs to come often, for things we hope are small and that we catch early. That forgiveness is hard enough to seek, from others and from God. But when someone who is close to you begins to feel the desire to repent of larger, more serious sins, there is something else you can do to help. You have to start early, long before the need for forgiveness is felt.<br><br>It comes from this simple fact: Forgiveness for serious offenses requires both the forgiveness of the Lord and of the Lord's servants in his Church, who he calls "judges in Israel." You remember how those servants were instructed to deal with repentance in Mosiah:<br><br><i>Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</i>[Mosiah 26:29–30]<br><br>From that, you can see what you could start to do. And sooner is better. You could look for some evidence today that confirms your testimony that your bishop, your stake president, or some other of God's servants in the Church is inspired. And you could find a moment to share that with someone close to you. Do it over a long period of time, and I will tell you how that may be the key to peace someday for the person who hears you say those words.<br><br>They will always find it hard, even when they have faith and want so much to be free of the weight of serious sin, to go to a bishop, an ordinary person, to confess and to ask for forgiveness. It may be even harder to accept a decision a bishop or stake president may have to make by revelation to take away a privilege, or even membership in the Church, to help the person you love gain forgiveness and then find peace. If you speak early and often of your faith in the office and callings of God's servants, preferably ones you know well, and of your honest confidence in their inspiration, you will someday make a great difference. The person you blessed in that way will be more likely to make the choice for repentance and the remission of sins.<br><br>You know what comes next in the simple description of the path to God and to peace: baptism. For someone not yet baptized, or for someone who has lost their membership, that ordinance is necessary to have the Atonement work to bring the mighty change in a heart. But even someone in the Church will need to bring the effects of that baptism into their lives frequently. You may think of more ways than I can suggest to help, but I can give you two, offered to me by those around me. These may seem to you common things to do. But they can have an uncommon effect.<br><br>People around me have shown me by what they do how much they honor and value covenants. Others have had that blessing, too. You've all heard, I hope, the prophet, President Benson, tell of watching his mother press carefully her temple clothing. You've heard him talk about watching his parents pull out of their yard for the trip to the Logan Temple. I'm not sure how much his parents had to say about the value of a temple covenant. You don't have to say much to make it more likely that people around you will so treasure covenants to feel the remission of sins God promises by our keeping them.<br><br>You could show the value you place on the baptismal covenant by how regularly and carefully you renew it. You could be there, whatever your schedule and whatever your pressures, to partake of the sacrament when it is offered to you. Today, you did what the Lord commanded in the fifty-ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the ninth verse:<br><br><i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:9]<br><br>And then, in verse 12, he goes on to say:<br><br><i>But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.</i><br><br>The sacramental prayers were dictated by the Lord himself to keep us reminded of the gospel covenants we have made. Your being there to do that every Sabbath will make a difference for those close to you. And there is another way you could show that you value them. Here is what Alma said you promised as you made the baptismal covenant:<br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life.</i>[Mosiah 18:9]<br><br>Many of you, and some in my family, have shown me what believing and honoring that covenant can mean. You have shoveled coal out of one basement and into another for someone else, built homes for the homeless, fixed a rusted and broken dryer in the apartment of a single mother, tutored little children, and on and on--giving comfort to those who needed it, as you covenanted you would, and doing it when I could not see how you could possibly fit one more thing into hectic schedules. And, oh, how you have helped me by carrying a Book of Mormon every time you traveled, and then telling me with excitement of how a book was accepted. Because of you, I find myself trying harder to stand as a witness at all times and in all things and in all places that I may be in.<br><br>Now, listen to the end of that invitation to the covenant of baptism. Listen to what God promises to those who honor the covenant:<br><br><i>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i>[Mosiah 18:10]<br><br>You know that the change and the peace we seek comes only under the influence of the Holy Ghost. Remember how that wonderful process goes, because it tells you something about how to help others. You remember it was described this way in Moroni:<br><br><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love.</i>[Moroni 8:26]<br><br>Think of that--the effect of feeling forgiveness is to feel meek and lowly. And that's what then allows you to have the Holy Ghost with you. You not only need to be meek and lowly to receive the Holy Ghost, but that is part of the effect he has on you when he visits. Listen to this from Galatians. Listen to see what it suggests you might do to help someone welcome the Holy Ghost into their lives. As you listen, think of the apartment or the room or the house where you live and some of the people in it. Now, here is the description of what having the Holy Ghost as your companion brings:<br><br><i>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</i><br><br><i>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</i><br><br><i>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</i><br><br><i>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</i>[Galatians 5:22–26]<br><br>Well, I've seen and felt how the people around me have helped me welcome the Holy Ghost more into my life. When I fish for vainglory in the form of a compliment for the sake of a compliment, I don't get much response at my house. Even when I act to provoke, they don't provoke back. And I never feel or see envy, at least from those closest to me. I don't know how conscious all that is. It may just be that they know, as you do, that when I am meek and lowly and quiet, I will more likely receive the Holy Ghost. And they love me enough to want that for me.<br><br>You might consider one other thing you could do to help those around you have the Holy Ghost as a companion. I don't know what pictures you have hanging on walls in your room. Nor do I know what music you play or what magazines you have around for others to see and read. But I've been blessed with people around me who seem to make those choices, again perhaps unconsciously, as if they wanted all the sights and sounds to help me feel, and keep feeling, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. That doesn't make my home as dull a place as you might think. And I have felt and feel the Holy Ghost more often because of the music, and pictures, and words on a printed page, chosen by people around me. You could help someone that way, too. And you could start tonight.<br><br>Now, you will think of more ways than I have suggested to help those around you exercise faith, repent, make and keep covenants, and welcome the Holy Ghost. But it's important to be realistic about what to expect the results will be when you do.<br><br>You may be rejected. You may even meet anger. Now, you might well ask, "Wait a minute. You told me that I could bring peace, and instead I get war coming back at me. How can that be?"<br><br>First, don't feel picked on, because we've all had that happen. I have a memory of watching my little boys kick each other as they lay before me on the floor during our family night as I taught a lesson on peace in the family. In fact, that topic would bring it on. They heard me, they understood me, and yet they had been kicking for a long time before I started preaching. Now, years later, they reach across the world to help each other. But the change takes time. So be patient and persistent.<br><br>There are techniques for bringing quick, brief periods of peace in families as there are in cities and among nations. I recommend whatever of those techniques work and do not interfere with the process of change that will give us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. But the change we need, the big and permanent change we need, takes some time. You can feel the patience you need by listening to this description given by Alma. It gives you a sense of the magnitude of the change that can come from the simple, small things we have talked about tonight. You need to remember both how simple are the things to do and yet how great the change that is promised. I testify to you now this is true.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</i><br><br><i>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</i>[Mosiah 27:25–26]<br><br>You would expect that will take some time and effort. And you would expect some setbacks along the way. For one thing, not all hatred comes from sin. Some of it is passed on to us by tradition. You remember what Jacob told the Nephites who were falling into sin. He told them that the Lamanites were more righteous than they were. And he said that the Lamanites hated only because of the traditions handed down to them. Habits of hatred may yield slowly, even to the power of the gospel.<br><br>But let me give you some encouragement that is certain. First, however much turmoil and violence you have had to live with, your spiritual longings, which come from the father of your spirit, is for peace. However tough and hardened you have become, perhaps just to survive, what you really want is a heart softened by the gospel. And that change of heart in the people close to you will bring peace to them and with them.<br><br>And as you offer that help in living the gospel of Jesus Christ, that same gospel is working on you. You come unto Christ and become more like him as you invite others to come unto Christ. When you become a peacemaker by offering the gospel of Jesus Christ, you also change by that same power. That may help you understand a scripture which is part of the promise made to you tonight. The Savior has always made this promise to his disciples. You can hear it again in 3 Nephi. He said it the same way, in the same words, in his mortal ministry in Jerusalem: "And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God" (3 Nephi 12:9).<br><br>When I read that as a boy, I wondered about the promise. You remember that he promised the meek that they would inherit the earth and that the pure in heart would see God. It didn't sound like anything very glorious to be promised that you would be called the children of God for being a peacemaker. But you and I see now that the promise is both glorious and sure. Those who will have eternal life are the children of God. And the childlike heart which goes with that will come to you as you offer peace to the hearts of those around you.<br><br>That leads to one more encouragement which may help you. You may well doubt that you can have much effect on the people around you. But you will have help. You have been given, as you were given the gospel, the promise of help as you reach out to help. The Lord made a promise to his twelve disciples who he chose among the people in the Americas, after his resurrection. He told them their role and gave them a promise: "Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people" (3 Nephi 15:12).<br><br>I testify that God knows you, that it is not by chance that you have found the gospel of Jesus Christ and his restored Church. He cares about those around you, and he loves you. You are his disciple, and that makes you a light to this people. When you act with faith to offer the gospel and peace to those around you, the light that will come to them will be more than your example and more than your words. They will feel the light of the Savior, and it will have drawn them to him. You will have pointed the way President Taylor said to go. You remember his direction: "Peace is the gift of God. Do you want peace? Go to God. Do you want peace in your families? Go to God."<br><br>I testify to you that God lives, Jesus is the Christ. I feel his love for you. I feel your Heavenly Father's love for you. I testify that through the Prophet Joseph and each of the prophets who have followed him has come the power to offer ordinances that, if honored, lead to mighty change, to peace in this life, and eternal life in the world to come. I pray that you will offer peace, and so as peacemakers become the children of God. I testify to you that I know the Savior spoke the truth when he said, both of you and of me, "Blessed are the peacemakers." In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>mate Paradox - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When Nephi saw in vision the condescension of both the Father and the Son in offering the Son as the Lamb of God, he could only describe the love in superlative phrases as "beauty ... exceeding of all beauty; ... the whiteness of the driven snow. ... Precious above all. ... The most desirable above all things. ... And the most joyous to the soul" (1 Nephi 11:8–9, 22–23). That Emmanuel, "God with us," deigned to "descend from his throne divine" ("I Stand All Amazed,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 193) to assume the temptations, pains, suffering, and infirmities of mortality, and then voluntarily yield to death led Søren Kierkegaard to describe the condescension of the Son of God as "the ultimate paradox" (Søren Kierkegaard,<i>Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers,</i>vol. 3 (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1975), p. 400). Indeed, from his birth through his death, the Savior's ministry was full of both paradox and irony. Note, for example, the irony of the Savior's mortal accommodations. Though "the earth [was] the Lord's, and the fulness thereof' (Psalms 24:1), "there was no room for [him] in the inn" (Luke 2:7). Though "worlds without number [had he] created" (Moses 1:33), "the Son of man hath not where to lay his head" (Luke 9:58). Though "all things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made" (John 1:3), his final resting place in mortality was a borrowed tomb (see Matthew 27:57–60). Such was the pattern of the condescension of the Son of God at birth, in life, and in death.<br><h2><b>The Irony and Paradox of Jesus' Birth and Early Life</b></h2><br>Of his humble birth, Martin Luther wrote, "For what man, if left to his natural promptings, if he were God, would humble himself to lie in the feedbox of a donkey?" (Roland Bainton,<i>Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther</i>[New York: Mentor, 1950], p. 173). Although Elohim must have lovingly observed the birth from a heavenly vantage point, even Mary's extraordinary travail increased the irony. The tiring journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem when she was great with child, the exclusion from the inn, the natural anxiety of bearing a first child, and Mary's isolation from her own family must have weighed heavily upon her soul.<br><br>"The birth was still more pitiable," wrote Martin Luther.<br><br><i>No one noticed that in a strange place she had not the very least thing needful in childbirth. There she was without preparation: no light, no fire, in the dead of night, in thick darkness. ... And now think what she could use for swaddling clothes--some garment she could spare, perhaps her veil. ...</i><br><br><i>Think, ... there was no one there to bathe the Baby. ... The mother was herself midwife and the maid.</i>[<i>Here I Stand,</i>p. 277]<br><br>Yet when the ordeal was over, the heavens proclaimed the eternal significance of the event by the voice of angels and the light of a new star, summoning representatives from the full spectrum of the human condition--the lowly shepherds and the affluent wise men--perhaps a harbinger of the universal scope of the Savior's ministry. And so the Son of "God deigned to take on the likeness of man," noted Malcolm Muggeridge, "in order that thenceforth men might be encouraged to aspire after the likeness of God" (Malcolm Muggeridge,<i>Jesus, The Man Who Lives</i>[London: Fontana/Collins, 1984], p. 22).<br><br>But if Joseph and Mary were pleased with the human and divine adulation of the birth of Jesus, they were soon shaken by an ominous warning to Joseph to flee Bethlehem for Egypt. What irony that the vassal king Herod, in a fit of jealousy, issued a sweeping edict to massacre the male infants in Bethlehem so that he might slay the King of Kings--the supposed rival to his throne. Yet this was only the beginning of the collision of the Savior's loving condescension with the spirit of rebellion. The juxtaposition of love and rebellion only exacerbated the irony and paradox associated with the Son of God's ministry. What irony, too, that the targeted Savior was in flight from Israel to Egypt, from whence he, as Jehovah, had led the children of Israel out of bondage, protecting Israel's sons with the blood of the lamb on that Passover evening. Now Egypt became a temporary refuge for the Savior from the storm in Israel.<br><br>Eventually the circuitous route from Nazareth to obscure Bethlehem to Egypt and back to Nazareth was complete. In a modest home among the common people, the Son of God is tutored in virtual obscurity.<br><br><i>So, a carpenter's shop in Nazareth rather than a liberal education in Rome or Athens ... was the requisite preparation for Jesus's ministry. ... [Jesus] needed to experience at first hand the hazards ... of earning a living in order to be able to teach us with conviction to pray:</i>Give us this day our daily bread--<i>seven words singularly beautiful and touching, and calculated to explode all the fantasies of affluence, and convey the basic condition of our existence.</i>[<i>Jesus, The Man Who Lives,</i>p. 45]<br><br>Consistent with this unpretentious pattern of paradox, although the Son of God was without moral blemish, he was, for the sake of example and the will of the Father, baptized "with water unto repentance" (Matthew 3:11). Later, ever subservient to his Father, the Redeemer humbly commenced his ministry by fasting for forty days. During that period he was both fortified by divine beings and sorely tempted by Satan.<br><br>"What would be said of a God," asked Dennis Rasmussen, "who came not in glory but in secret, a King who came not to command but to obey" the will of his Father? (See Dennis Rasmussen,<i>The Lord's Question</i>[Provo, Utah: Keter Foundation, 1985], p. 61.) Any measure of divine favoritism, either at birth or during the preparatory years of his ministry, was carefully concealed in the cloud of his seemingly obscure origins. After all, was not this the carpenter's son?<br><h2><b>Condescension and the Servant Metaphor</b></h2><br>When his formal ministry finally commenced, unlike worldly royalty, Jesus disdained the trappings of status, the exercise of unrighteous dominion, the quest for recognition, the display of wealth, or the flaunting of righteousness. Instead, "the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Matthew 20:28). His teachings were as paradoxical as his life. For example, "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matthew 20:26–27). "Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:4). "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it," he said, "and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 16:25). "The last shall be first, and the first last (Matthew 20:16). "Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted" (Matthew 23: 12).<br><br>Furthermore, the Savior rejoiced that the precious pearls of the gospel were hidden from the "wise and prudent, and ... revealed ... unto babes" (Luke 10:21). In his doctrine, the wise are foolish, and fools are wise, and he came into the "world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind" (John 9:39). Ironically, he assigns the "weak and the simple" to proclaim the fullness of his gospel (D&amp;amp;C 1:23) and the "unlearned and despised, to thrash the nations by the power of [his] Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 35:13). "The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones" (D&amp;amp;C 1:19). The "weak ... shall be made strong" (D&amp;amp;C 50:16), and "the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up ... shall be thrust down to hell!" (2 Nephi 28:15). The "meek ... shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5) and "the poor in spirit ... the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:3).<br><h2><b>Condescension and Mortal Relationships</b></h2><br>The spirit of condescension was also evident in the choice of Christ's mortal associates. His closest disciples were drawn from the ranks of the common people. Some were fishermen. Even the detested class of publicans was represented by Matthew. Far more startling, however, was the array of sinners, lepers, unpopular Samaritans, beggars, the sick, lame, blind, deaf, those possessed of evil spirits, the lost sheep, the prodigal, and even the deceased who were restored to life. These were the central characters of the Christian experience, whether in parable or narrative expression. Any deprivation of "the least of these my brethren" (Matthew 25:40) created a singular appeal to the Savior's breadth and depth of compassion. For Jesus, the sick, not the whole, needed the physician. Ironically, in the eternal scheme of things, no one was ultimately whole. All had need of the Redeemer.<br><br>Actually, the Savior's special interest in the downtrodden, oppressed, sick, and infirm should not have been a surprise. Had Isaiah not seen in vision, seven hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Savior's compassionate condescension for the "poor," "the brokenhearted," "the captives," "the blind," and the "bruised"? (See Luke 4:18; Luke paraphrases Isaiah 61:1–3.) And had Alma not seen the Savior "take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. ... loose the bands of death ... and ... take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, ... that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people" (Alma 7:11–12)?<br><br>Indeed, the Son of God did know how to succor his people! To illustrate his loving condescension, let us briefly examine three cases of troubled humanity: the woman taken in adultery, a leper, and the Samaritans (the second-class citizens of their day).<br><br>Imagine the scene on the temple grounds when the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery to the Savior. How frightened the woman must have been. What embarrassment and shame she must have felt. Was she in tears? How insensitive of the scribes and the Pharisees to accuse her in that manner and in a public setting. Did the Savior stoop down to avert his eyes from the woman and to separate himself from her accusers? When the scribes and Pharisees, trying to find some grounds for accusation against the Savior, asked whether the woman should be stoned to death, Jesus, drawing in the sand, ignored the question. Was he gathering his thoughts? Was he nurturing his compassionate feelings for the accused? Was he restraining his mounting emotions for the accusers? Finally, when the scribes and Pharisees hypocritically persisted in their quest for an answer, Jesus arose in majesty to his full stature and said to them, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8:7). Ironically, by that rigorous standard, only the Son of God was qualified to cast any stones. The Savior stooped down again to write in the sand. One by one, the accusers, thoroughly reproved for their impure lives and motives, began to leave. Not until they had all gone did the Savior stand again to face the woman. How relieved and grateful she must have felt. For a moment, her life stood in the balance, but, mercifully, it was entrusted to the Son of God: "Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:10–11). What a healing phrase--"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more," containing, in just a few words, the elements of forgiveness and the prospect of lasting change! Suddenly the focus had reverted from her mortal life to her eternal life. Imagine the memorable impression on her soul as she walked away from her Redeemer, perhaps weeping for joy. Was this a divine example of one of those occasions of which the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke?<br><br><i>Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy ...; and should we even forgive our brother, or even our enemy, before he repent or ask forgiveness, our heavenly Father would be equally as merciful unto us.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 155]<br><br>Although the leper's plight was of a very different nature from that of the woman taken in adultery, the heartache, and even the sense of rejection, was just as real. In the New Testament period, lepers were considered unclean. They were the untouchables and pariahs of their day. Cast out from normal social intercourse, they hungered for warm human contact and acceptance. But for the leper who encountered Jesus as he came off the mountain, it was not human, but divine healing that he sought. "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean" (Matthew 8:2). What solace the leper must have felt when he who was considered unclean and untouchable was gently touched by the Savior before he healed him. Of the significance of that touch, listen to the words of the nineteenth-century cleric George Macdonald:<br><br><i>Jesus could have cured him with a word. There was no need he should touch him.</i>No need<i>did I say? There was every need. For no one else would touch him. The healthy human hand, always more or less healing, was never laid on him; he was despised and rejected. It was a poor thing for the Lord to cure his body; he must comfort and cure his sore heart. Of all men a leper, I say, needed to be touched with the hand of love. ... It was not for our master, our brother, our ideal man, to draw around him the skirts of his garments and speak a lofty word of healing, that the man might at least be clean before he touched him. The man was his brother, and an evil disease cleaved fast unto him. Out went the loving hand to the ugly skin, and there was his brother as he should be--with the flesh of a child. I thank God that the touch went before the word. Nor do I think it was the touch of a finger, or of the finger-tips. It was a kindly healing touch in its nature as in its power. Oh blessed leper! thou knowest henceforth what kind of a God there is in the earth--. . . a God such as himself only can reveal to the hearts of his own. That touch was more than the healing. It was to the leper what the</i>[phrase] Neither do I [condemn thee]<i>was to the woman</i>[at]<i>the temple.</i>[George Macdonald,<i>The Miracles of Our Lord</i>(New York: George Routledge &amp;amp; Sons, 1870), pp. 88–89]<br><br>But the Savior was just as adept at succoring a disdained ethnic group, like the Samaritans, as he was one on one with unpopular individuals. There were two natural obstacles to the Savior in forming a meaningful relationship with the Samaritans. First, he was a Jew, and the Jews had established a reputation of having "no dealings with the Samaritans" (John 4:9). Second, because the Savior was sent explicitly to the house of Israel, neither the gentiles nor the Samaritans enjoyed the full blessings of the gospel. In fact, Jesus instructed the Twelve, "saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." (See Matthew 10:5–6. Authorization for the Samaritans to receive the gospel came in Acts 1:8.) However, the compelling example of the Savior's love for the Samaritan people broke down both of these artificial barriers. His own solicitous care for the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, his offer to provide her "living water. . . springing up into everlasting life," his discernment of her spiritual status, the witness she received that he was the Christ, her testament to her fellow Samaritans, and the Savior's two-day sojourn among her people convinced many "that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world" (John 4:4–42). Moreover, the heroic figure, so carefully crafted by Jesus in the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:29–37) and in the story of the grateful Samaritan (the only one of he ten lepers to return to Jesus to thank him for healing him of his affliction; Luke 17:11–19) solidified the growing bond of mutual affection. But the crowning evidence of solidarity between Jesus and the Samaritans was a backhanded compliment. In the dominant culture the word<i>Samaritan</i>had become a powerful slur comparable in emotional intensity to the most repulsive ethnic epithets of our time. In a moment of passion, the detractors of Jesus resorted to name-calling: "Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil" (John 8:48–49). Note, however, that the Redeemer refused to disavow the imputed identification with the Samaritans. Such was his love for these social outcasts and, for that matter, all people--including his own.<br><h2><b>The Rejection of the Savior's Miracles</b></h2><br>No feature of the Savior's ministry increased his public visibility quite like the performance of miracles. For example, when the Savior approached the gate of the city of Nain, he encountered a funeral procession taking the only son of a widow to his burial. When Jesus saw the mother weeping, he had compassion for her. The Savior stopped the cortege, touched the casket carried by the pallbearers, and commanded the young man to "Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak." Luke describes the startling effect of the miracle:<br><br><i>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</i><br><br><i>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</i>[Luke 7:11–17]<br><br>But this was only one of countless miracles. In the category of restoration of life from death, two others, the daughter of Jairus; and Lazarus, the brother of Mary Magdalene and Martha; were likewise blessed. There were miracles of nature, including the miraculous feeding of thousands, the changing of water to wine, the calming of a tempest, the walking on water, the retraction of a coin from the mouth of a fish, and others. Numerous miracles healed physical ailments, and others dispossessed the afflicted of evil spirits. To be sure, the Savior's fame spread throughout the land.<br><br>There was irony, too, and the spirit of condescension in conjunction with these miracles. In the midst of the euphoria and joy produced by these blessed events, Jesus was ridiculed and, as Isaiah prophesied, "despised and rejected of men" (Isaiah 53:3). Some simply dismissed him as "a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!" (Luke 7:34). At the site of the healing of the daughter of Jairus, "they laughed him to scorn" (Matthew 9:24). There was a poignant scene at the temple when the Savior healed "the blind and the lame. ... And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; [the chief priests and scribes] were [ironically] sore displeased" (Matthew 21:14–15). And when the Pharisees were told that Jesus had brought Lazarus back to life from four days of death in a tomb, "from that day forth they took counsel together ... to put [the Son of God] to death" (John 11:53).<br><br>The finding of fault continued to mount. After a remarkable healing of a blind man on the Sabbath, the Pharisees referred to Jesus disparagingly as "this fellow" (John 9:29), "a sinner" (John 9:24), and a "man [who] is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day" (John 9:16). With his Father Elohim, Jehovah had instituted the Sabbath as the earth was formed. Indeed, he was Lord of the Sabbath. How incongruous that the creator and Lord of the Sabbath is accused of its violation. "It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days," he said to his critics, after healing another man of a withered hand. Nevertheless, "the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him" (Matthew 12:10–14).<br><br>In those vexing cases of evil spirits, his opponents accused him of casting "out devils through the prince of the devils" (Matthew 9:34). To this argument Jesus convincingly asked the rhetorical question, "How can Satan cast out Satan?" (Mark 3:23).<br><br>For me, one of the most intriguing miracles of the New Testament involved the man called Legion, who had been transformed into a man who slept not in a home but among the tombs--"no man could bind him, no, not with chains, ... neither could any man tame him." He wore no clothing, and "night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones." Some of us might have bypassed the man called Legion (Luke 8:30), but not the Savior. As the Son of God cast out the evil spirits, the spirits rushed into a herd of swine that ran, in turn, into the sea. But that is not the essence of the miracle. The real miracle was the change in the man. He came out of the tombs, wore clothing, ceased cutting his own flesh, and became a disciple of Christ. After hearing the news of this singular event, "the whole city came out to meet Jesus." Ironically, "when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts." (See Mark 5:1–20 and Matthew 8:34; also Luke 8:26–39. The account in Matthew describes two men possessed of devils, whereas the accounts in Mark and Luke only refer to the story of Legion.)<br><br>By far the most serious indictment of the Savior was blasphemy, the trumped-up charge that, along with sedition, eventually led to his death. The argument asserted that Jesus was an imposter, masquerading as the Son of God. It too surfaced in the context of the performance of miracles. When the friends of a man who was seriously afflicted with palsy, out of their love and faith, dismantled a roof so that they could lower him on a bed to the feet of the Savior, Jesus saw that the man's most compelling need was forgiveness of his sins. Immediately, he assured the diseased man that his sins had been forgiven. At that moment, the Savior also discerned that the scribes saw the act of forgiveness as concrete evidence of blasphemy. To them, Jesus said,<br><br><i>Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</i><br><br><i>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</i><br><br><i>And he arose, and departed to his house.</i>[Matthew 9:2–8]<br><br>Once again, as Nephi prophesied, "The world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught" (1 Nephi 19:9).<br><br>Ironically, in the cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, "wherein most of his mighty works were done," the inhabitants "repented not." In fact, Jesus said that, given the light they had rejected, the wicked cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom would fare better on judgment day than these cities (Matthew 11:21–24). In Nazareth, his hometown, though the people were "astonished" at his "wisdom, and these mighty works," they too were offended. It was in Nazareth that Jesus lamented, "A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house" (Matthew 13:54–58). And so for many, despite the condescension of the Son of God, the miracles were performed in vain.<br><h2><b>Law and the Condescension of the Son of God</b></h2><br>In the matter of law, irony was also prominent in the condescension of the Son of God. Amidst the thunder and lightning of Mount Sinai, Jehovah had given the law to the prophets for the children of Israel. Now many of the children of Israel were judging and condemning the law giver, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for his interpretation and implementation of the law. Jesus of Nazareth interpreted the law with much greater flexibility. One brief example may suffice.<br><br>On the Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples walked through a grain field. To satisfy their hunger, the disciples plucked a few ears of grain. This action grated on the moral sensibilities of the Pharisees, and they inquired of the Savior why his disciples broke the law. The Savior wisely cited the Old Testament precedent of King David eating the shew bread in the house of God on the Sabbath day. Then Jesus taught the broader principle: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath" (Mark 2:27).<br><h2><b>The Ultimate Paradox: The Bitter Cup</b></h2><br>As the ministry of the Son of God came to a close, the irony only intensified. During those last days, this modest King of Kings and Lord of Host's triumphal entry into Jerusalem came "not riding clouds of glory, but a borrowed donkey" (Muggeridge,<i>Jesus, The Man Who Lives,</i>p. 49). Despite the agony of the anticipation of Gethsemane, the betrayal, the arrest, the trial, and the ordeal at Calvary, Jesus preserved his noble, godly composure. "Let no one think," wrote George Macdonald,<br><br><i>that</i>[the sufferings of our Lord]<i>were less because He was more. The more delicate the nature, the more alive to all that is lovely and true, lawful and right, the more does</i>[one]<i>feel the antagonism of pain, the inroad of death upon life; the more dreadful is that breach of the harmony of things whose sound is torture. He felt more than man could feel, because He had a larger feeling.</i>[Rolland Hein, ed.,<i>Creation in Christ</i>[Wheaton, Illinois: Harold Shaw Publishers, 1976], p. 334]<br><br>And so let it not be said that because he was more, his suffering was less.<br><br>The intensive odyssey of godly testing began at Passover. Jesus was only hours away from that moment in cosmic history that worlds without end had awaited. The word<i>condescend</i>literally meant to descend with or be among his people, but now he was about to descend below all things. His rendezvous with destiny, sealed in that grand council by his own words--"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2)--had arrived. This was the culmination and convergence of the love of the Father and the Son. Later in the evening he would teach his disciples, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). In divine modesty, he declined to note that he was also laying his life down for his enemies.<br><br>Years of Passover celebrations and the animal sacrifices from Adam to the meridian of time had all pointed to this moment.<i>Passover</i>signified deliverance, the blood of the Lamb, redemption. The symbol of the sacrificial lamb and the reality of the Lamb of God had finally come together. This was the eve on which the Lamb of God was to go like a lamb to the slaughter. In the Passover feast were the usual symbolic items--the lamb, the unleavened bread, the wine, and perhaps the bitter herbs. If the unleavened bread signified a sense of urgency, it now, with the wine, was used by the Savior to introduce the sacrament, a visual aid of what would soon transpire to help them and us to remember him. If the bitter herbs usually signified the bitterness of the Exodus experience, the most proximate and compelling symbol for the Savior must have been the bitter cup.<br><br>During that extraordinary evening Jesus was the consummate servant. He devoted his time to teaching, comforting, preparing, challenging, serving, and praying for the Twelve and for all who would somewhere and sometime believe in his words. With the bitter cup raised almost to the level of his lips, how could he be so selfless? After the Passover supper he washed each of the disciples' feet in an ordinance that reminded them of the essential nature of their ministry as servants commissioned to administer the love of God that shed forth in their hearts. It was in this context of the ordinance of washing of feet that the Savior said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34).<br><br>Following the washing of feet, the Savior's final discourse on mortality rivaled in beauty the Sermon on the Mount (John 14–16). The sermon was imbued with the language of comfort, love, and peace of mind. It also affirmed our utter dependency on the Savior: "As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me" (John 15:4).<br><br>Sometime during the evening Jesus offered the moving intercessory prayer (John 17). Remarkably, only the first few verses barely mention the fact that his own "hour is come." He was praying as an advocate for his Father's children. Finally, Jesus and the Twelve sang a hymn together before the Savior, Peter, James, and John departed for Gethsemane.<br><br>Jesus then<br><br><i>began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</i><br><br><i>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</i><br><br><i>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</i>[Matthew 26:37–39]<br><br>Of that excruciating experience King Benjamin wrote,<br><br><i>He shall suffer ... even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness ... of his people.</i>[Mosiah 3:7]<br><br>In reflection, the Savior added,<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18]<br><br>Soul--wrenched, his clothing soiled with "great drops of blood" (Luke 22:44), fatigued in body and in spirit from the incomparable ordeal only endurable by a God, Jesus emerged from the garden.<br><br>By now the voices of betrayal and arrest were within the range of the human ear. Ironically, thirty pieces of silver, the price for a common slave, was the value attached to him whom Isaiah called, "Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). How incongruous that a kiss, an emblem of affection, consummated the betrayal. In the confusion surrounding the Son of God's arrest, Peter severed the ear of Malchus, one of the assailants of Jesus. The Savior, ever the servant and healer, restored the ear to its normal state. Charitably, Jesus also requested that the officials in charge of the arrest let his disciples "go their way" (John 18:8). Ironically, in the interim between his arrest and Calvary, each disciple, to one degree or another, forsook him. "All ye," Jesus prophesied, "shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered" (Matthew 26:31). Completely alone, although the Savior had at his disposal legions of angels, he deferred to the will of the Father and submitted to the train of indignities.<br><br>From the scene of the arrest, the Savior was illegally taken to the home of the high priest Annas. There he was interrogated, charged with blasphemy, smitten, spat upon, and mocked. He received more of the same treatment when he was sent to Caiaphas. When Caiaphas took Jesus to Pilate, the indictment changed from blasphemy to sedition, an action calculated to stir up the Romans. When Pilate found no evidence of guilt, learning that Jesus was actually in Herod's jurisdiction, Pilate sent him to Herod. "And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate" (Luke 23:11). When Pilate still found no justification for the accusations, he proposed, customary with the tradition of the feast days, to release him. But his antagonists insisted on both crucifixion and that the notorious Barabbas, justly convicted of sedition and murder, be released in lieu of the falsely accused Son of God. Finally, when a spineless Pilate caved in to the social pressure, the process of crucifixion commenced.<br><br>In preparation,<br><br><i>Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</i><br><br><i>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</i><br><br><i>And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</i>[John 19:1–3)<br><br>Nephi observed this whole demeaning process in panoramic vision:<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</i>[1 Nephi 19:9]<br><br>Centuries before, in "similitude" (Jacob 4:5) of the "great and last sacrifice" (Alma 34:10), Isaac--lowly in heart, innocent, and obedient--carried wood for his father Abraham for sacrifice on Mount Moriah, just as the Savior bore wood, his own cross, for his Father toward Calvary, "where they crucified him" (John 19:17–19), ironically, between two thieves. How ironic, too, that the perpetrators of the Crucifixion "did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted" (Isaiah 53:4). Instead, "he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities" (Isaiah 53:5). Wrote Dietrich Bonhoeffer,<br><br><i>It is infinitely easier to suffer in obedience to a human command than to accept suffering as free, responsible men. It is infinitely easier to suffer with others than to suffer alone. It is infinitely easier to suffer as public heroes than to suffer apart and in ignominy. It is infinitely easier to suffer physical death than to endure spiritual suffering. Christ suffered as a free man alone, apart, and in ignominy, in body and in spirit.</i>[Dietrich Bonhoeffer,<i>Letters and Papers from Prison,</i>ed. Eberhard Bethge (New York: Macmillan, 1953), p. 31]<br><br>Even on the cross his compassion was endless. He gently placed his mother, Mary, in the caring hands of his beloved disciple John; to the solicitous thief he promised a personal rendezvous in the spirit world; and to those who crucified him he sought forgiveness, "for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). He was like "a rock," noted George Macdonald, "which swallowed up the waves of wrong in its great caverns and never threw them back to swell the commotion of the angry sea whence they came" (C. S. Lewis, ed.,<i>George Macdonald, 365 Readings</i>[New York: Collier, 1986], p. 112).<br><br>Søren Kierkegaard was right. The mortal ministry of the Savior was, indeed, "the ultimate paradox." He drank the bitter cup that we might drink the sweet. He was taken captive that we might be delivered. He was mocked that we might be more merciful. He was spat upon that we might be more sensitive. He was scourged that we might be sanctified. He was judged of the world that we might be justified. He was bruised that we might be blessed. He was wounded that we might be made whole. He died that we might live.<br><br>"My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross," he said, "that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me" (3 Nephi 27:14). What is our stance toward this "man of sorrows ... acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3)? If we turn our backs on the Holy One of Israel, our rebellion, ironically, collides with his infinite love.<br><br>"If ye love me," he said, "keep my commandments" (John 14:15), "feed my sheep" (John 21:15–17), and "love one another" (John 15:12). May we strive more fervently to do so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gary L.

<h1>ive: The Lord is at the Helm - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a tremendous picture. I do not know how many there are here tonight, but the number is large. And I guess, Brother Peterson, there are as many again out in other halls. There may be forty thousand young people--a few old gray heads, but very few. A few bald heads--more of those. It is very nice to be with you. I am glad you are here.<br><br>I prepared a talk for about twenty minutes, and Brother White said, "You will have to go longer than that. Except for the prayers and a musical number, you're the only thing on the program." I asked my secretary, when I was leaving town, to call down and put this on the teleprompter. I don't know whether I'm going to rely on that. I may break loose from my text and just talk a little informally about a variety of things, if there's that much time. I'll watch the clock; you watch your neighbor.<br><br>I appreciate what Brother Gray said in his prayer. I appreciate what he said concerning President Benson. Everywhere we go, of course, people want to know about President Benson, how he is. He's doing well for a man of his age, but he's in his ninety-fifth year. And, as maybe one or two of you may discover, when you're ninety-five, you're not what you were when you were fifty-five. Age has a way of hitting us--sometimes hitting us rather hard. He has difficulty speaking. He has difficulty walking, as might be expected. But he's still the Lord's prophet, regardless. We don't need more revelation at this time. We just need to follow more closely the revelation we've already received and we'll be all right.<br><br>Don't worry. The Lord is at the helm. This is his church. He has made provisions for it to go forward under any set of circumstances that might face it. He has provided leadership in such a way that every man who is ordained an apostle has conferred upon him the keys of the priesthood. That doesn't mean he is authorized to exercise all of those keys at any time. That prerogative rests with the president of the Church. When he is not functioning as he might wish to be, he has counselors. And, as is made clear in section 102 of the Doctrine and Covenants, they--the two of them, or one of them if the other might be disabled somehow--could function and carry forward the work of the First Presidency. And behind the presidency is a backup of twelve apostles, each of whom has received those same keys.<br><br>The Church doesn't need to worry about this situation. Things are going forward the way the Lord would have it. We just need to do our own duty and be faithful and true in our own way. And I think your presence here tonight, and out across the nation and the continent, is an indication of your faithfulness, your fidelity to the work of the Lord, your love for this great cause. Thank you for your presence, and thank you for your faithfulness.<br><br>I am grateful to be safely here tonight. Yesterday morning I flew to Washington, D.C., and spoke last night at a large gathering. I spoke this morning at another gathering and then got on a plane, and I made it--I am here. But that is rather dangerous living.<br><br>I repeat my love for you and my appreciation and my respect. You are good and great people--the cream, as it were, of this generation. You are young men and women of faith and of faithfulness. You pray, and that's a singularly wonderful thing in this day and age of the history of the world--that you actually get on your knees and pray, I believe, night and morning. What a wonderful thing it is that you don't feel sufficient unto yourselves--self-sufficient, egotistical to the point where you think you can make it all alone--that each of you recognizes that there are occasions when you need help, and you need it desperately, and you ask for it. And you know how to ask for it. I hope that the habit of prayer will remain with you all the days of your lives. If there is anything this nation needs, it is a return to prayer, to seeking the guidance of the Almighty, his watch care over us as a people, and the humility that ought to go with prayer. Oh, if only our leaders prayed more and declaimed less. I think we'd be, perhaps, in better condition.<br><br>Now, I'm going to talk with you tonight about something that I have spoken about before. I looked up in my file and found that I talked along these lines here about twenty years ago. None of you were here then. It's time to say it again. It's time to repeat it. Before I get into that, I want to draw two contrasts--or one contrast, perhaps, between two situations.<br><br>I picked up the<i>Washington Post</i>this morning and thumbed through it. It appeared to me a litany of negativism. If you were to read the<i>Washington Post</i>this morning, you might think the whole nation was going down the drain, and the whole world. Oh, Mr. Nussbaum resigned a day or two ago, and Whitewater is on the minds of the people, and a lot of things of that kind.<br><br>I contrast that with the optimism I feel concerning the Church. This is the greatest day--the greatest season--in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in my judgment. How wonderful to be alive today. How wonderful to be a part of this great cause at this time in the history of the world and in the history of this church. Never has it been so large. Never has it been so strong. Never has it been so highly regarded. Never has it made the kind of progress that it is making today. I say that with great humility and with great appreciation. I don't discount the glorious days when the Prophet Joseph Smith walked the earth and spoke as a prophet to the people. I don't discount the great, marvelous days of struggle and sacrifice and pain when our people came west under the leadership of President Brigham Young. I don't minimize the accomplishments of any other era of the history of the Church or the greatness of any president who has presided over the Church. I simply say that things are getting better and better. And I feel profoundly grateful for that.<br><br>In 1946, 55 percent of the membership of the Church resided in Utah. Today, only 17 percent of the membership of the Church reside in Utah. In 1946, only 6 percent resided in international areas. In 1992, 45 percent resided in international areas. We were once a Utah church. Now we are becoming a great universal church, a great international church. Things are happening of tremendous significance.<br><br>There were in the Church last year 305,000 convert baptisms. That's the equivalent of about 150 stakes the size of the nineteen stakes that are represented here tonight. Think of it--150 new stakes in a single year. That growth poses tremendous challenges in providing housing, buildings in which to accommodate the people. It provides tremendous challenges in developing leadership, in training people to take over the responsibilities of the work, because this is a church that is operated by a lay priesthood, if you please--"the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker," who by the goodness of their lives become qualified to lead the people and teach them. It is a miracle, my brethren and sisters.<br><br>This church operates this, the largest private university in America, if not in the world. We are trying to carry on, I think, the greatest family history program anywhere on earth. I think we carry on perhaps the largest building program. We have before us now requests for hundreds of new buildings this year. Think of it. We won't build them all--we can't move that fast--but we'll build 350 or 400 of them as we've done each year for the past several years. This is a great time of strength and activity.<br><br>This is the greatest temple-building era in the history of the Church. It has been my pleasure to dedicate about twenty-three or twenty-four new temples since I came into the presidency in 1981. There never was such an era before, and I don't take credit for that. The president of the Church would have been there in each case--President Kimball or President Benson--had he been able to be there, but they were not because of the circumstances of their health, and that opportunity largely fell to me. We are building temples where just a few years ago we never would have dreamed of building temples. As you know, we will dedicate this year a new temple in Orlando, Florida, and another in Bountiful, Utah. We've broken ground for a temple in Bogota, Colombia, and for a temple in Hong Kong. We have property now for a temple in Madrid, Spain. We have property for about seven others.<br><br>This is a great era. One hundred years were needed for this church to reach a membership of one million. We now add as new members one million people every three and a half or four years. It is significant. It is tremendous. It is wonderful. It is made possible because of people like you.<br><br>What a wonderful time to be alive. How enthusiastic I feel about this church. How enthusiastic I think each of you should feel about this church. It is wonderful what is happening. It is the Lord's work. This is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that is rolling forth to fill the whole earth. And what we see today is but a foreshadowing of greater and more marvelous and wonderful things yet to come. I have only one regret, and that is that I am so old. But it will come--because it is the Lord's work and he is at the helm.<br><br>I am glad that you are here. I am glad that you are young, and I hope you are enthusiastic, because there is a terrible ailment of pessimism in the land. It's almost endemic. We're constantly fed a steady and sour diet of character assassination, faultfinding, evil speaking of one another. Read the newspaper columnists. Listen to the radio and television commentators. The writers of our news columns are brilliant, the commentators on the electronic media are masters--but they seem unable to deal with balanced truth, notwithstanding their protests otherwise. The negative becomes the stuff of headlines and long broadsides that, in many cases, caricature the facts and distort the truth--at least the whole truth. The tragedy is that this spirit of negativism seems to prevail throughout the country.<br><br>To hear tell these days, there is nowhere a man of integrity among those holding political office. This spirit has infected the atmosphere on university campuses and the workplace, even this campus. The snide remark, the sarcastic gibe, the cutting down of associates--these too often are the essence of our conversation. In our homes, wives weep and children finally give up under the barrage of criticism leveled by husbands and fathers. Criticism is the forerunner of divorce, the cultivator of rebellion, sometimes a catalyst that leads to failure. Even in the Church it sows the seed of inactivity and, finally, in many cases, apostasy.<br><br>I come this evening with a plea that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I'm suggesting that we accentuate the positive. I'm asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment virtue and effort.<br><br>I am not asking that all criticism be silent. Growth comes with correction. Strength comes with repentance. Wise is the man or woman who, committing mistakes pointed out by others, changes his or her course. I am not suggesting that our conversation be all honey. Clever expression that is sincere and honest is a skill to be sought and cultivated. What I am suggesting and asking is that we turn from the negativism that so permeates our society and look for the remarkable good in the land and times in which we live, that we speak of one another's virtues more than we speak of one another's faults, that optimism replace pessimism.<br><br>Let our faith replace our fears. When I was a boy, my father often said to us, "Cynics do not contribute, skeptics do not create, doubters do not achieve."<br><br>I should like to say a few words about America--the nation of which most of us here tonight are citizens. There may be some here who come from other lands. I think I have been in all of the lands from which you come. I appreciate your people, their innate goodness, their art, their industry, their strength. I have marveled at the beauty of the earth, the wonder and magnificence of God's creations as I have seen them in every part of the world. No land is without its beauty, no people without their virtues, and I hope that you who come from elsewhere will pardon my saying a few words concerning my own native land, America. I know that she has problems. We've heard so much of these for so long. But surely, my brothers and sisters, this is a good land, a choice land, a chosen land. To me it is a miracle, a creation of the Almighty. It was born of travail. The Constitution under which we live is the keystone of our nation. It was inspired of God. Of it the great Englishman Gladstone said, "As the British Constitution is the most subtle organism which has proceeded from ... progressive history, so the American Constitution is ... the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man" ("Kin Beyond Sea,"<i>North American Review</i>127 [September/October 1878], p. 185).<br><br>There is too much fruitless, carping criticism of America. I know that for some the times are dark. There have been dark days in every nation. I would like to repeat the words of Winston Churchill spoken when bombs were dropping on London. The German juggernaut had overrun Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, and Russia. All of Europe was in the dread grasp of tyranny, and England was to be next. In that dangerous and desperate time, when the hearts of many were failing, this great Englishman said, and I quote--and I remember hearing these words on the radio at the time:<br><br><i>Do not let us speak of darker days; let us speak rather of sterner days. These are not dark days: these are great days--the greatest days our country has ever lived; and we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.</i>[Address at Harrow School, 29 October 1941]<br><br>Earlier he had said to his people and to the whole world, following the catastrophe at Dunkirk when the prophets of doom foretold the end of Britain--and, again, I heard him say these words:<br><br><i>We shall not flag or fail. ... We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.</i>[Speech on Dunkirk, House of Commons, 4 June 1940]<br><br>It was such talk as this, not the critical faultfinding of glib cynics, that preserved the great people of Britain through those dark and deadly days when all the world thought their little island would go under.<br><br>It shall be so with America if we will do less of speaking of her weaknesses and more of her goodness and strength and capacity. President Harold B. Lee, speaking to a group such as this at Ricks College, said:<br><br><i>This nation, founded ... on principle</i>[s]<i>laid down by men whom God raised up, will never fail. ... I have faith in America. You and I must have faith in America if we understand the teachings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>Deseret News,</i>27 October 1973, p. A4]<br><br>I do not doubt that we shall have days of trial. I am confident that so long as we have more politicians than statesmen, we shall have problems. But I am certain that if we will emphasize the greater good and turn our time and talents from vituperative criticism, from constantly looking for evil, and lift our sights to what may be done to build strength and goodness in our nation, America will continue to go forward with the blessing of the Almighty and stand as an ensign of strength and peace and generosity to all the world.<br><br>We still hear much talk of economic depression. Some of you here tonight may be unemployed or struggling to make it. Things could be worse. Heaven forbid that we should ever slip again into the kind of monetary quagmire through which we struggled in the 1930s. I was there then. I graduated from the University of Utah in 1932. The unemployment rate was more than 30 percent. Those were days of long soup lines, of suicides that came of discouragement, of a bleakness of life that few of you can understand. But somehow we survived and made it. I hope and pray that such hard times will never come again, but I think it is not impossible or even improbable if enough people, in a spirit of negativism and defeatism, talk about it and predict it. We are the creatures of our thinking. We can talk ourselves into defeat, or we can talk ourselves into victory.<br><br>Likewise, it is so in the Church. We even have some who quibble and fret over little things, evidently totally unaware of the majestic destiny of this, the work of God.<br><br>When gold was discovered in California in January of 1848, men of the Mormon Battalion were there and participated in the discovery. Completing their contract, they came to the Salt Lake Valley to join their families. Some of them brought with them gold; and in the hard and desperate days that followed, particularly in the bitter winter of 1848–49, many wanted to go to California where life was easier and gold was to be picked from the riverbeds. In that time of gloom, Brigham Young stood before the people in the old Bowery on Temple Square and said:<br><br><i>Some have asked me about going. I have told them that God has appointed this place for the gathering of his Saints, and you will do better right here than you will by going to the gold mines. .</i>. .<br><br><i>We have been kicked out of the frying pan into the fire, out of the fire into the middle of the floor, and here we are and here we will stay. God has shown me that this is the spot to locate his people, and here is where they will prosper....</i><br><br><i>... We shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and to the south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of the Saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become the great highway of the nations. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here, while the wicked and ungodly will envy us our comfortable homes and possessions.</i>[<i>Autobiography of James</i>S.<i>Brown (Life of a Pioneer),</i>pp. 119–23, cited by Preston Nibley,<i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936), pp. 127–28]<br><br>What a remarkable statement under such circumstances! My heart goes out to those who were cold and hungry that winter of 1849. I am confident there was much of grumbling and criticism, and understandably so. But how marvelous when a man looked beyond the winter and spoke as a prophet, under the power of the Holy Spirit, of better days to come. Those days have come. This has become one of the great highways of the nations. Millions come to Temple Square. There are hundreds of flights daily in and out of here. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth visit us here. There's scarcely a week when we do not have some prominent world figure call on us.<br><br>Brigham Young went on to say on that occasion:<br><br><i>It is our duty to preach the gospel, gather Israel, pay our tithing, and build temples. The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and his people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell. This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution, and be true. But my greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth; and yet they have to be tried with riches, for they will become the richest people on this earth.</i>[Nibley,<i>Brigham Young,</i>p. 128]<br><br>To which I can hear many of you say, "Hasten the day."<br><br>I believe it is here. I believe that day, spoken of by Brigham Young with a voice of prophecy that rose above the voices of defeat and criticism, has come. We have been blessed with the bounties of heaven and the bounties of earth. Oh, how magnificently and munificently we have been blessed! Now, with gratitude in our hearts, let us not dwell upon the few problems we have. Let us rather count our blessings and in a great spirit of gratitude, motivated by a great faith, go forth to build the kingdom of God in the earth.<br><br>In our individual circumstances let us look for and cultivate the wonders of our opportunities. You are students on this university campus, and beyond here, on the campuses of many other universities. You can be overcome by a spirit of defeatism, or you can reach with eagerness for the opportunity to learn, to develop marvelous associations, and to build great loyalties. It is so easy, under the pressure of the daily grind, to become negative and critical, to be shortsighted, and even go down in defeat. I have been touched by these words spoken by Benjamin I. Wheeler, who at one time served as president of the University of California. Said he to a group of students such as you:<br><br><i>This university shall be a family's glorious old mother, by whose hearth you shall love to sit down. Love her. It does a man good to love noble things, to attach his life to noble allegiances. It is a good thing to love the Church, it is a good thing to love the State. It is a good thing to love one's home, it is a good thing to be loyal to one's father and mother. And, after the same sort, it is good to be loyal to the university, which stands in life for the purest things and the cleanest, loftiest ideals. Cheer for her; it will do your lungs good. Love her; it will do your heart and life good.</i><br><br>In your associations one with another, build and strengthen one another--"No man is an island, No man stands alone" (words and music by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer, 1950). We so need help and encouragement and strength, one for another.<br><br>On one occasion when the Savior was walking among a crowd, a woman who had been long sick touched his garment. He perceived that strength had gone out of him. The strength that was his had strengthened her. So it may be with each of us. Let me urge you to desist from making cutting remarks one to another. Rather, cultivate the art of complimenting, of strengthening, of encouraging. What wonders we can accomplish when others have faith in us. No leader can long succeed in any society without the confidence of the people. It is so with us in our daily associations. Said the Lord to Peter,<br><br><i>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</i><br><br><i>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</i>[Luke 22:31–32]<br><br>Declared Paul, "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak"--and then he adds, "and not to please ourselves" (Romans 15:1).<br><br>It is a responsibility divinely laid upon each of us to bear one another's burdens, to strengthen one another, to encourage one another, to lift one another, to look for the good in one another, and to emphasize that good. There is not a man or woman in this vast assembly who cannot be depressed on the one hand, or lifted on the other, by the remarks of his or her associates.<br><br>I was impressed with a Sydney Harris column that I clipped from the<i>Deseret News</i>some years ago. He said:<br><br><i>Sir Walter Scott was a trouble to all his teachers and so was Lord Byron. Thomas Edison, as everyone knows, was considered a dullard in school. Pestalozzi, who later became Italy's foremost educator, was regarded as wild and foolish by his school authorities.</i><br><br><i>Oliver Goldsmith was considered almost an imbecile. The Duke of Wellington failed in many of his classes. Among famous writers, Burns, Balzac, Boccaccio, and Dumas made poor academic records. Flaubert who went on to become France's most impeccable writer, found it extremely difficult to learn to read. Thomas Aquinas, who had the finest scholastic mind of all Catholic thinkers, was actually dubbed "the dumb ox" at school. Linnaeus and Volta did badly in their studies. Newton was last in his class. Sheridan, the English playwright, wasn't able to stay in one school more than a year.</i><br><br>All of this seems to say to me that each of these men, every one of whom later became great, might have done much better in his studies had he received less of criticism and more of encouragement.<br><br>For those of you who are married, it is particularly important that you cultivate a positive attitude and constantly look for the virtues in one another. Two students of BYU came to see me some years ago. Six months earlier they had been married. They had declared their love for one another. In a sacred place they had pledged their loyalty one to another for time and eternity. Now, the young man came first. He was disillusioned. He was bitter. He was heartbroken. His wife, he said, did this and did that--simple little things of small consequence, such as leaving the dishes undone when she left for school in the morning. And then came his wife, a beautiful girl of great talent. She spoke of her husband's faults. He was stingy. He did not pick up his clothes. He was careless. Each had his or her faults. Every one of those faults was easily correctable. The problem lay in the fact that there was a stronger inclination to emphasize the faults than there was to talk of virtues. With a little self-discipline, each could have changed. With a little desire, each could have spoken with a different tone. But neither was willing. They had permitted a negative attitude to destroy the sweetest, richest association of life. They had thrown away with careless and sour words the hopes and dreams of eternity. With criticism and shouting, they had violated the sacred promises that might have taken them on to exaltation.<br><br>My dear young friends, don't partake of the spirit of our times. Look for the good and build on it. There is so much of the sweet and the decent and the good to build upon.<br><br>You are partakers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel means "good news." The message of the Lord is one of hope and salvation. The voice of the Lord is a voice of gladness. The work of the Lord is a work of glorious and certain reward. I do not suggest that you simply put on rosecolored glasses to make the world look rosy. I ask, rather, that you look above and beyond the negative, the critical, the cynical, the doubtful, to the positive. I carry with me a statement that I took from an article published some years ago on Commander William Robert Anderson, the man who took the submarine<i>Nautilus</i>under the North Pole from the waters of the Pacific to the waters of the Atlantic. In his wallet he carried a tattered card with these words: "I believe I am always divinely guided, I believe I will always take the right road, I believe God will always make a way where there is no way" ("If It's 3-to-1 Against Anderson: Can a Congressman Afford a Conscience?"<i>Look,</i>20 April 1971, p. 48).<br><br>Said the Lord in a dark and troubled hour to those he loved, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). Said he on another occasion, "Be not afraid, only believe" (Mark 5:36).<br><br>Said Nephi when his brothers were plagued with fear and doubt and defeat,<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Said Joseph Smith, the Prophet:<br><br><i>The truth, like the sturdy oak, has stood unhurt amid the contending elements, which have beat upon it with tremendous force. The floods have rolled, wave after wave, in quick succession, and have not swallowed it up. ... Stand fast, ye Saints of God, hold on a little while longer, and the storm of life will be past, and you will be rewarded by that God whose servants you are. ... Your names will be handed down to posterity as Saints of God and virtuous men.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 184–85]<br><br>The very essence of this work is faith. Faith cannot grow in an environment of doubt.<br><br>I know that many of you are struggling. Do not lose hope. Some say that your prayers are not answered. Your Father will answer in his own time and in his own way. But answer he will.<br><br>Some who are single long for marriage. It will be more likely to happen if there is the kind of positive, faith-prompted attitude that expresses itself in happiness and good cheer. Nobody loves a grumbler.<br><br>Our Father knows. He is not unmindful of us. Never forget it. Only forget yourself, your selfish interests and desires, and reach out to others.<br><br>I leave my blessing with you this evening, insofar as it is my right to do so. I bless you that you may know of happiness, of accomplishment, of peace in your lives, and much of love, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was the First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6March 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ng Faith, Reaffirming Trust, Rekindling Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Nadauld and I have an interesting perspective on the BYU experience that stems from three different periods of association. We were first here as students beginning in the fall of 1964, nearly thirty years ago. We returned twelve years later in 1976, and I spent some wonderful years as a faculty member, during which time I also served as a bishop on campus. We now experience BYU from the perspective of our children.<br><br>Some months ago I overheard President Lee talking to a parent who had several children here. He teasingly said, "President, you have more of our children, not to mention our money, than we do."<br><br>The president replied with a classic line that I wish I had used as a university president and that endeared him to me in a way that only parents can appreciate. He said, "I only hope we can do as well with them here as you have done with them in your home."<br><br>President Lee, you and the faculty and staff are a great blessing in the lives of men and women who are students here, and you are definitely doing well with them. We thank you.<br><br>Representing all of your parents, I hope you know how much we love you and how much of our joy and satisfaction is bound inextricably to your success and happiness in life. The apostle John said, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth" (3 John 1:4). In that vein I have gained a deeper appreciation for an experience I had here twenty-eight years ago. I was a twenty-four-year-o1d returned missionary senior chemistry student sitting in my off-campus apartment when a knock came at the door. I opened the door, and there stood my mother. She came in, and we had a wonderful visit. It was a visit of love, humor, grace, and some subtlety. I realized when she left that she had determined, among other things, what I was eating, who I was dating, how my grades were, and how I was doing in church. She perhaps had a better idea than I did about what I was going to do the rest of my life. She had also inspected the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. She drove two hundred miles, spent an hour with me, and drove two hundred miles back home. Such is a mother's love and a father's love.<br><br>I have come to appreciate that there were some very important things my mother was concerned about--beyond how much Top Ramen I was eating. I distinctly remember during those years the conversations with roommates until two or three in the morning. Years later, as a bishop, I counseled my ward members about similar concerns. And now, more years later, these are the concerns of my children. Fundamentally they have not changed: What should I major in? How should I earn a living? Who am I going to marry? Where am I going to live? Will I have a family?<br><br>It's evident that these questions and the potential consequences of their answers create feelings of uncertainty and anxiety and generate, as the French say, a certain malaise. Those decisions that you are wrestling with are appropriate to your stage in life. You may suppose that once you have successfully made them, it will be smooth sailing. Would that it were so. Unfortunately, they will be replaced by the anxiety and uncertainty of death, disease, false accusations, loss of job, and loss of loved ones.<br><br>So how is one to cope at your age with your particular set of challenges or, at any later age, with the inevitable circumstances that can cause the apprehension, anxiety, and angst that weigh us down?<br><br>I do not know fully the answers to that question, but I would like to speak to three notions that I believe can make a difference. Let us visit together about increasing faith, reaffirming trust, and rekindling love.<br><br>Much has been said about faith because it is the most fundamental of doctrines in the plan of redemption. We speak of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as the first principle of the gospel. In Hebrews 11:1, Paul taught, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." One challenge to the ready understanding of this definition is the implication that faith is "substance" or "evidence." This runs counter to the general use of the word that usually is interpreted to mean that something accepted on faith is accepted<i>without</i>proof, evidence, or substance. The footnote to this verse explains that the Prophet Joseph Smith preferred to translate the word<i>substance</i>as "assurance." Using the word<i>assurance</i>and adding several additional words allows us to formulate an expanded expression that provides significant insight into the issue of faith.<br><br>The expanded expression is:<i>Having</i>faith is<i>having</i>or<i>accepting</i>an assurance of things hoped for and<i>accepting</i>evidence of things not seen.<br><br>Let us continue by dealing with the first part of the expanded definition. Having faith is having or accepting an assurance of things hoped for. The meaning is enhanced by understanding what is<i>hoped for.</i>Throughout the scriptures the objects of hope are stated as "hope in eternal life," "hope in a glorious resurrection," and "hope in Christ."<br><br>Moroni provides a superb one-verse summary:<br><br><i>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</i>[Moroni 7:41]<br><br>So our passage reads: "Now<i>having</i>faith is<i>having</i>or<i>accepting</i>an assurance of Christ, his resurrection, his atonement, and eternal life."<br><br>The expanded expression fits beautifully with the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Alma. Alma speaks of men being ordained priests for the purpose of teaching the plan of redemption. He then explains that they were called and prepared according to the foreknowledge that God had concerning their "faith" and "good works." One might wonder how it was possible to have faith (or good works) in the premortal world where there was presumably no veil and no earthly distractions. But in fact, we could elect to have faith in the plan. Faith then was the same as faith now. Faith was<i>having</i>or<i>accepting</i>an assurance in the plan of redemption. It was not a slam dunk! We had to accept assurance that Christ would do what he said he would; that he would follow the plan; that he would come to earth as an infant, be tempted, suffer pain. Could he really do it? Some of us accepted the assurance offered, some did not.<br><br>Continuing on with the definition: What is the nature of the assurances? Suppose we partition them into two kinds: divine assurances and personal assurances. What a blessing to know that it is indeed possible to receive divine assurance of things hoped for. Section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants contains a marvelous discussion of gifts given by the Spirit of God. Verses 13 and 14 state:<br><br><i>To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</i><br><br>This scripture speaks of both kinds of assurances: heavenly, those that come through the Holy Ghost; and personal, those that come to us by way of another person. The scripture teaches us that to some it is given to believe on the words of others; that is, to accept their personal assurances of things hoped for. This important point deserves some additional comment.<br><br>We attend each month a special meeting called a fast and testimony meeting. These are unusual meetings both in terms of format and content. Their purpose is to build faith. When we bear our testimony, we have an opportunity to provide assurances that others might accept. But if we wish to increase faith and be in harmony with the purpose of the meeting, those assurances must be of the things "hoped for." Warm personalities, charisma, and travel experiences all have some appointed place, but the basic issue for a testimony meeting is whether or not we can stand and add our witness--add our assurance that there is a plan of redemption, a Savior, an atonement, a resurrection, and eternal life.<br><br>Let me illustrate. I know a young, impetuous, but very loving bishop who after a testimony meeting approached a youthful member of his ward who had spoken in the meeting. This bishop said in a way that only he could, "That's an interesting testimony that you bore. Would you be willing to take this Book of Mormon home, read it every day, and come back next month and try it again?"<br><br>Now I hasten to add that this is not standard operating procedure. We would never want to<i>risk</i>offending anyone in an area as sensitive as that of personal testimony. In this case the person was unoffended but motivated and returned the next month to strengthen others with a strong witness of "things hoped for."<br><br>Our definition now reads: Having faith is having or accepting divine and personal assurances of Christ, the atonement, the resurrection, and eternal life.<br><br>Let us add the second part of the definition: "Now faith is the evidence of things not seen." We will work with the restated expression as cited earlier: Now<i>having</i>faith is<i>accepting</i>evidence of things not seen. That this is exactly the meaning that Paul intended is confirmed by examining verse 3 of the same chapter 11 of Hebrews. It says: "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." While his wording to us may seem awkward, he is simply affirming that the worlds we see are evidence of the word of God, which we do not see. Thus the restatement<i>"having</i>faith is<i>accepting</i>evidence of things not seen" is consistent with Paul's example in which the existence of the world should be accepted as evidence of the unseen word of God that created it.<br><br>In the same manner that assurance was divided into divine and personal, let us partition evidence into two parts. Call the partitions<i>macro</i>and<i>micro.</i>So what is the macro-evidence we can accept? I agree with Paul that the earth, the seas, the mountains, the streams, the glorious world we live in is rich visual evidence of God's unseen hand. The scriptures are replete with prophetic utterance on this issue.<br><br>I would say parenthetically that while here as a student, I majored in chemistry and minored in math and physics. I read and studied about the Heisenburg uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics, and relativity. I have read and studied geology, the fossil record, and evolution. I subscribe to<i>Scientific American</i>and read almost every article. It is all more or less useful, but all the evidence I ever needed came one night as I camped on the banks of the Snake River and lay on my sleeping bag looking up through the pine trees at the same glorious heavens that Abraham saw. My favorite expression of this macro-evidence is in the words of this hymn:<br><br><i>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder</i><br><i>Consider all the worlds thy hands have made,</i><br><i>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,</i><br><i>Thy pow'r thruout the universe displayed. . . .</i><br><br><i>When thru the woods and forest glades I wander,</i><br><i>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,</i><br><i>When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur</i><br><i>And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,</i><br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><br>["How Great Thou Art,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 86]<br><br>Here in the tops of the everlasting hills, can there be any question about the handiwork of God? I believe the scriptures also serve as extraordinary macro-evidence of things unseen. The Book of Mormon especially is hold-in-your-hand, read-and-study "big" evidence--just the kind that Paul had in mind.<br><br>What about micro-evidence? Micro-evidence is a convenient taxonomy for including all the personal and individual experiences that each of us has that serve as evidence of the hand of God. They are private experiences, they are often sacred experiences--some ought not be shared, some can be.<br><br>I well remember such a personal experience that took place just a few blocks from here. It was more than twelve years ago. Margaret had gone into labor a month early, and about 3:00 a.m. on a beautiful June morning she gave birth to twin boys. After learning that she and the twins both seemed well, I was much relieved and went home for a few hours of sleep. About 7:00 a.m. the phone rang. It was a call from the hospital explaining that the second twin born was in serious trouble and that I should come quickly. I called my counselor in the bishopric, who was also an administrator at the hospital, and asked if he could meet me there immediately. I knelt in prayer and then rushed to the hospital, hoping to arrive in time to give the baby a priesthood blessing and, if necessary, a name. We found the baby lying in an isolette, a specialized chamber for premature infants. He was blue and gasping for breath. To my dismay he was so small and hooked up to so many tubes and pieces of apparatus that we could find no way to place our hands on his head to administer a blessing. After some agonizing moments we determined that there was a spot on his little chest about the size of a half-dollar that perhaps we could touch. So, reaching under and through and around all the tubes and equipment, we were able to get the very tips of four enormous index fingers on that one tiny available spot on his chest. We blessed him that he would receive specialized medical attention, that his life would be spared, and that he and his brother would serve together as missionaries in the year two thousand.<br><br>That day in our family we received some very personalized micro-evidence of the unseen power of God.<br><br>We have expanded Paul's definition of faith and can now summarize: Having faith is having or accepting divine assurance and personal assurance of things hoped for; namely, a living Savior, a resurrection, an atonement, and eternal life. It is accepting macro-evidence and micro-evidence of the unseen, but very real power of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now I suggest you take an inventory. Where do you stand relative to receiving a heavenly assurance that there is a plan of redemption, including all the "things hoped for"? Count up the personal assurances from those who have born witness and testimony to you. Include among them the powerful assurances coming to you from my brethren of the General Authorities. Rehearse to your satisfaction the macro-evidence that is shouted from God's handiwork and spoken plainly from the scriptures. Enumerate your own experiences--the undeniable expressions of the power of God, unseen but clearly demonstrated.<br><br>Each of us in our personal life can take such an inventory. For most of us the assurances, both heavenly and personal, and the macro- and micro-evidence, when reviewed, are so overwhelming that we should be thrust profoundly to the next step. That next step is to place our personal trust firmly in God. Here we find an interesting paradox. We have examined our faith; the assurances and evidences are compelling. It should be an easy matter to place our trust in someone who is omnipotent and omniscient. But we are reluctant, and we struggle. We struggle because of our pride. We struggle because of our imperfections. The great prophet Nephi understood perfectly.<br><br>There is no more eloquent statement of that struggle and resulting trust than that found expressed by Nephi in chapter 4 of 2 Nephi. I commend it to you for a complete reading. He begins by describing in verse 17 feelings that we have all had. He says:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works</i>[in other words, Nephi is rehearsing the evidence of things unseen],<i>my heart exclaimeth:</i>O<i>wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities. . . .</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</i><br><br><i>My God hath been my support: he hath led me . . . ; and he hath preserved me. . . .</i><br><br><i>He hath filled me with his love. . . .</i><br><br><i>He hath confounded mine enemies. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . He hath heard my cry . . . , and he hath given me knowledge by visions. . . .</i><br><br><i>Awake my soul! . . . Rejoice, O my</i><br><br><i>heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>Do not anger again. . . . Do not slacken my strength. . . .</i><br><br><i>Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation. . . .</i><br><br>[Then we read this passage with such beautiful visual imagery:]<i>O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! . . .</i><br><br>[Nephi then finishes with these final thoughts:] O<i>Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh. . . .</i><br><br><i>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</i>[2 Nephi 4:17–35]<br><br>What an inspiring expression of trust in the Lord. Nephi rehearses his experience with the Lord and reaffirms his trust.<br><br>We would do well to ponder at length on this extraordinary passage. I call to your attention one particular phrase found in verse 34. Nephi says, "I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh." That same thought is found in section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants. This section constitutes the Lord's preface to the doctrine, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation--at a time when "every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16). In one long sentence in which the Lord speaks plainly of his grand design, he says, "Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 1:17). In other words, the Lord did what he has done in all generations past. He called a prophet to speak to the people, so that all might be fulfilled,<br><br><i>that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh--</i><br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth.</i><br><br>[D&amp;amp;C 1:19–21]<br><br>Here is a direct admonition from the Lord that the answers to our problems, the solace we seek, will not be found in the philosophies of men but through increasing faith and reaffirming our trust in him.<br><br>The words of a favorite hymn are so appropriate:<br><br><i>Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;</i><br><i>With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.</i><br><i>Leave to thy God to order and provide;</i><br><i>In ev'ry change he faithful will remain.</i><br><br><i>Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend</i><br><i>Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.</i><br><br><i>Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake</i><br><i>To guide the future as he has the past.</i><br><i>Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;</i><br><i>All now mysterious shall be bright at last.</i><br><br><i>Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know</i><br><i>His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.</i><br>["Be Still, My Soul,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 124]<br><br>How we wish we could see into the future to know the outcome of every troublesome decision--to arrive at the destination without having to make the journey. Many of you pay your tithing, read the scriptures, keep yourselves morally clean, and pray with real intent. And yet you fail tests, your cars break down, you don't have enough money to pay the rent, and you strike out with someone you hoped you had a chance with. These are the normal experiences and challenges of life. Your faith is not misplaced. Remember the words of the song, "Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end."<br><br>The journey does have a joyful end. That is the message of the plan of redemption. Christ said, "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33)."<br><br>Faith in the plan of redemption and its outcomes leads to keeping the commandments. Faith and trust provide the foundation for a happy and productive life. There isn't anything more important that you could learn here. You can't begin to imagine all the experiences you will have in your lifetime. You will be grateful for a full reservoir of faith and trust to see you through.<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, put away your fears, put away your anxieties, put away your sins and your pettiness. Believe in his plan; trust in God. Put not your trust in the arm of flesh. Lean not on your own understanding. But be believing; come desiring that the Lord will encircle you about in the robe of his righteousness. Study to increase your faith, study the Atonement, study the Resurrection, study the plan of redemption, study the relationship between faith and trust and humility.<br><br>With faith and trust firmly in place, a wonderful thing can happen. You can set aside your self-absorption, quiet your anxieties and fears, and fill your souls with love. The Savior's message is clear--understanding the doctrine should lead to practical application. Practice serving, practice lifting and building and strengthening others, provide assurances, rehearse the evidence one to another.<br><br>What a remarkable transformation takes place when we allow our faith to lead to trust. Our combined faith and trust rekindles<i>love--</i>love of the Savior, love of our fellowman, love for those near and dear to us; love that provides sweetness, true joy, the giving of one's self for others.<br><br>And you know, the most amazing thing will happen. You'll wake up one day with a career and another day with a companion and a third day with a family--and then a mortgage, lower back pain, and a stack of bills from your orthodontist!<br><br>Please know that we believe in you, we have confidence in you, we trust you, and, oh, how we love you and how we pray for your happiness. I witness to you that God's plan of redemption is a true plan of happiness. I add my assurance to those who have come before that Jesus Christ is our Savior. He is our Redeemer. He fulfilled his role as the Messiah, the Anointed One, the one who atoned for our sins. The Resurrection is a reality. We can live eternally with a loving Heavenly Father.<br><br>May we increase our faith, reaffirm our trust, and rekindle our love, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Stephen D.

<br>
As President Merrill Oaks was so kindly introducing me, it occurred to me that I have now had the privilege of being introduced in the Marriott Center by President Dallin Oaks and President Merrill Oaks. I love them both! I did not know their father, but I did know their mother, Stella. She was a very special woman, and one can see her spiritual genes in Merrill and Dallin Oaks.<br><br>I am delighted to be with you tonight and to be in the presence of President Rex Lee and his wife, Janet. We sometimes feel a sense of being kindred spirits with certain people when we first get to know them. These friendships are not friendships of initiation, but of resumption. I certainly feel that way about President and Sister Lee, and about others on this stand whom I've come to know, again.<br><br>As we approach Easter, with all its glorious significance, we should rejoice in God's great gift of immortality, unearned and universally given--"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). However, God's greatest gift--eternal life--will be given only to a comparative few: those who respond to Jesus' invitation, "Come, follow me" (Luke 18:22). It is this invitation to discipleship about which I will speak tonight. The great gift of the Resurrection, therefore, will be "added upon" by the exaltation inherent in eternal life, which is contingent upon the degree of our discipleship.<br><br>Consistent with the lovely invocation tonight, I ask for your hearts as well as your ears, because we will consider some of the deep things of God. Such doctrines of the kingdom should not be treated superficially or lightly, so I ask for your pondering as well as your listening.<br><br>When Jesus took upon him the heavy, atoning yoke to redeem all mankind by paying the agonizing price for our sins, he thereby experienced what he himself termed the "fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:107). The phrase itself makes the soul tremble. Jesus also volunteered to take upon him additional agony that he might experience and thus know certain things "according to the flesh"; namely, human sicknesses and infirmities and human griefs, including those not associated with sin (Alma 7:11–12). Therefore, as a result of his great atonement, Jesus was filled with unique empathy and with perfect mercy.<br><br>In turn, however, he who bore the atoning yoke has asked, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me" (Matthew 11:29). So the taking of Jesus' yoke upon us constitutes serious discipleship. I speak especially to those of you who are young, saying to you that there is no greater calling, no greater challenge, and no greater source of joy--both proximate joy and ultimate joy--than is found in the process of discipleship. This process brings its own joys and reassurances. Don't, however, expect the world to understand or to value your discipleship. They will not. In a way, they may admire you from afar, but they will be puzzled about the priorities resulting from your devotion.<br><br>Shouldering the yoke of discipleship greatly enhances both our adoration and knowledge of Jesus, because then we experience, firsthand, through our parallel but smaller-scaled experiences, a small but instructive portion of what the Savior experienced. In this precious process, the more we do what Jesus did (allow our wills to be "swallowed up in the will of the Father"), the more we will learn (Mosiah 15:7). This emulation directly enhances our adoration of Jesus.<br><br>Simultaneously, in this same process, the more we become like Jesus, the more we come to know him. There may even be, more than we now know, some literalness in his assertion "When ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). We lack deep understanding of the implications of that remark of Jesus. As with so many things, he is telling us more than we are now prepared to receive.<br><br>But back to submissiveness. The Prophet Joseph Smith, writing redemptively to his rebellious brother William, said, "God requires the will of his creatures, to be swallowed up in his will." The Prophet Joseph then pled with William to make "one tremendious [<i>sic</i>] effort [to] overcome [his] passions, and please God" (Dean C. Jessee, comp. and ed.,<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984], p. 115). Alas, William didn't do it, just as some of us fail to overcome our passions and thereby fail to "please God." We are too busy pleasing ourselves.<br><br>In contrast, meek Enoch reached a point in his discipleship, wrote Paul, when Enoch received a testimony that he pleased God (see Hebrews 11:5). Ponder that, brothers and sisters. One can come to the point where he or she knows that they please God.<br><br>One mistake we can make during this mortal experience, especially in an academic setting, is to value knowledge apart from the other qualities to be developed in submissive discipleship. Knowledge is very important. Its discovery, its preservation, its perpetuation is one reason we have this special university. Yet being knowledgeable, by itself, while leaving undeveloped the virtues of love, mercy, meekness, and patience, is not enough for full discipleship. Mere intellectual assent to a truth, if it is unapplied, deprives us of the relevant, personal experiences. It's like hearing a lecture without experiencing a lab. It's like being briefed on a field trip but never taking the field trip. There were probably orientation briefings in the premortal world about how this mortal life would unfold for us, but the real experience is another thing!<br><br>Thus, although knowledge is clearly very important, standing alone it cannot save us. I worry sometimes in various Church classes that we get so busy discussing the doctrines that talking about them almost becomes a substitute for applying them! One cannot improve upon the sobering words of King Benjamin, who said, "Now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10). Such is still the test. Deeds, not words--and becoming, not describing--are dominant in true discipleship!<br><br>Of necessity, of course, we are to teach and learn the doctrines. We would be spiritually stranded without them, and, likewise, without the saving and exalting gospel ordinances, because<br><br><i>in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i><br><br><i>And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:20–21]<br><br>So it is that discipleship requires all of us to translate doctrines, covenants, ordinances, and teachings into improved personal behavior. Otherwise, brothers and sisters, we may be doctrinally rich but end up developmentally poor!<br><br>The celestial attributes--such as love, patience, mercy, meekness, and submissiveness--embody what we are to become. They are not just a litany of qualities to be recited! Awareness of them--even articulate awareness--without their application will not do. Furthermore, these same attributes cannot be developed in the abstract. The relevant experiences are required, even when you and I would try to avoid them. Moreover, our individual developmental schedules reflect God's timetable, not ours. His timetable, if followed, prepares us incrementally for the journey of discipleship and for going home!<br><br>Any serious disciple yearns to go home to Heavenly Father and to be welcomed there by Jesus. But the Prophet Joseph Smith declared we cannot go where they are unless we become more like them in the principles and attributes and character they possess (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 216).<br><br>Of the many restored truths, God has surely given us "enough and to spare." Soberingly, however, we have been told that unto whom "much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). I hope we feel the cutting edge of the word<i>required.</i>It is used instead of the milder<i>expected.</i>Neither does the Lord say, "It would be nice if . . ." The word is<i>required,</i>bringing us back again to the need for submissiveness in discipleship.<br><br>The gospel's rich and true doctrines combine to constitute a call to a new and more abundant life, but this is a lengthy process. It requires much time, learning through relevant experiences, keeping covenants, and receiving the essential ordinances--all in order to spur us along the discipleship path of personal progression. In the journey of discipleship we lose our old selves. The natural man and the natural woman are "put off," and then we find ourselves having become more saintly (see Mosiah 3:19). We see such saintliness all about us in the Church--quiet, good women and men, not particularly status-full, who are becoming saintly. This is what should be happening in the lives of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>There are even some noticeable and helpful tuggings--you and I feel them at times--to remind us who we really are. As eternal beings living very temporarily in time, it is often much more than a whisper that tells us we are strangers here and that our ultimate home is someplace else (see "O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292).<br><br>Walking and overcoming by faith is not easy. For one thing, the dimension of time constantly constrains our perspective. Likewise, the world steadily tempts us. No wonder we are given instructive words from Jesus about the narrowness and the straightness of the only path available to return home: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). And then he said, "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Jesus laid down strict conditions.<br><br>We live in a world in which, happily, many others regard themselves as Christians. Some live rich and marvelous lives. But there are some who style themselves as Christians who admire but do not worship Jesus. Some regard him as a great teacher but not as the Great Redeemer. Yes, Jesus is the generous Lord of the Expansive Universe, but, brothers and sisters, he is also the Lord of the Narrow Path! Some people forget his latter lordship.<br><br>The ravines on both sides of that narrow path--which, by the way, has much loose gravel on it--are deep and dangerous. Moreover, until put off, the shifting, heavy, unsettling burden of the natural man tilts us and sways us. It is dangerous.<br><br>Nor does the natural man or the natural woman go away quietly or easily. Hence, the most grinding form of calisthenics we will ever know involves the individual isometrics required to put off the natural man. Time and again the new self is pitted against the stubborn old self. Sometimes, at least it's so with me, just when at last we think the job is done, then the old self reminds us that he or she has not fully departed yet.<br><br>A vital, personal question for each of us, therefore, is, "Are we steadily becoming what gospel doctrines are designed to help us become?" Or are we merely rich inheritors of an immense treasure trove of truth but poor investors in the process of personal development so essential to discipleship?<br><br>Significantly, when the Lord described his purposes by saying, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39), he used the word<i>work,</i>even though his is a "marvelous work." For us, becoming even as Jesus is certainly is work (see 3 Nephi 27:27)! Of necessity, this process requires the cross of discipleship to be taken up daily--not occasionally or seasonally.<br><br>Sometimes, as we commence taking up the cross, we ignore or neglect the first part of Jesus' instruction. He said, "Deny [yourselves], and take up [your] cross daily, and follow me" (Luke 9:23). This self-denial is especially challenging in a world filled with so many sensual and secular stimuli. Greed and lust, though they have always been friends, have never formed quite the cartel that they have formed now. It is global. It is profitable.<br><br>Denying oneself has never been popular as a lifestyle, and it is clearly not today. Self-denial is portrayed by many as too puritanic and too ascetic. Scoffers in this nation have acquired powerful pulpits from which they bray their message, which constantly puts down discipleship and encourages the natural man to think highly of himself and to please himself.<br><br>What is it that we are we to deny ourselves? The ascendancy of any appetites or actions that produce not only the seven deadly sins but all the others. Happily, self-denial, when we practice it, brings great relief. It represents emancipation from all the "morning-after" feelings, whether caused by adultery or gluttony. True disciples, being concerned with tomorrow, are very careful about today!<br><br>Self-denial also includes not letting our hearts become too set on any trivial or worldly thing. Then we can learn the great lessons about the relationship of righteousness to the powers and the joys of heaven.<br><br>There's a lot of talk currently in America about empowerment. Certainly economic and political slavery should concern us, and rightly so, but what of being in bondage in other ways? What of emancipation from the enslavement resulting from so many subtle forms of servitude? Listen to these words of Peter: "For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage" (2 Peter 2:19). So many different things can overcome and capture us.<br><br>The fundamental fact is that if we do not deny ourselves, we are diverted. Even if not wholly consumed with the things of the world, we are still diverted sufficiently to make serious discipleship impossible. As a consequence, all the gifts and talents God has given us are not put meekly on the altar to serve others and to please God. Instead, we withhold to please ourselves. Diversion, therefore, is not necessarily gross transgression, but it is a genuine deprivation--especially if we consider what we might have become and what more we might have done to bless and to help others.<br><br>Ironically, brothers and sisters, the natural man who is so very selfish in so many ordinary ways is strangely unselfish in that he reaches for too few of the things that bring real joy. He settles for a mess of pottage instead of eternal joy.<br><br>By denying the desires of the natural man (to the degree that these exist in each of us), we avoid this diversion, making it easier for us to take up the cross of discipleship. Of course, when it occurs in our lives, emancipation from various forms of bondage brings no celebrating parades, nor does it make the evening news. But it is big news because we<i>come off conqueror!</i><br><br>So it is that discipleship, far from being ascetic, is to choose joy over pleasure. It is to opt for the things of eternity over the trendy and appealing things of the moment. Eventually we become readied for the final moment of consecration, when, gladly and completely, we let our wills be swallowed up in the will of the Father. Jesus did this in Gethsemane and on Calvary: "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). What was God's will? That Jesus complete the Atonement. Even so, Jesus cried out, "Take away this cup from me" (Mark 14:36), and still later, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34). Yet Jesus yielded.<br><br>Is it possible to develop discipleship when one has no initial, inner desires for discipleship? I don't know. Can we plant inner "desires" in someone against their will? External exhortation of such individuals won't usually produce much change. For most of us, however, even when the inner desire is there, it requires periodic sharpening of some outward circumstances to quicken any existing inner desires and to get us to act upon these. It was so with Abraham. Abraham desired a better life, more happiness, and the blessings of the holy priesthood (see Abraham 1:1-2). Outward circumstances were a spur to Abraham's yearnings, but clearly he had firm and basic desires of discipleship.<br><br>It's different in the case of prodigals, in the sense that turning away from the world and toward God, toward home, requires of them to make what I call the Great Pivot. This Great Pivot begins slowly and tentatively when the mind perceives<i>what is</i>in comparison with<i>what might be.</i>This represents the first tentative steps in the process of beginning to develop "the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16). Regarding the varying degrees of progress we have made in our personal development, ponder, if you will, this bit of imagery. What if, brothers and sisters, our individual lack of inner, spiritual symmetry were somehow visibly reflected in our outward physiology? How odd, swollen, and misshapen, or anemically underdeveloped some of us would appear! All intellect and no heart! Earnest and eager, but without a trace of empathy! Egoistic with not a single sinew of mercy! Fixated on pleasing self with little concern for neighbors. Ciphers as to substance, but perhaps with large, mortal wardrobes. Perhaps this latter condition is the flip side of "Look, the emperor has no clothes," in which one would say, "Look, the clothes have no emperor!" People have so many trappings that cover the absence of substance of a spiritual nature--it's all about us in the world's passing parade: "Princes come and princes go; an hour of pomp, an hour of show" (lyrics from<i>Kismet</i>).<br><br>Of course, our actual degree of inward, spiritual symmetry is somewhat hidden--at least until we get to know each other and to experience each other! So, the lingering question should not be "How many imperfections do I have?" but, rather, "Is my discipleship sufficiently serious that I am working patiently and steadily to overcome those weaknesses, perhaps even changing some of them into strengths?" (See Ether 12:27.)<br><br>Sometimes our outward selves are no better indicators of what we're really like than the mortal résumés that are feverishly circulated in the academic and business worlds. Usually these résumés give little reflection of character or conduct. Similarly, one's bibliographies seldom hint as to what kind of neighbor one actually is.<br><br>If, however, discipleship becomes a daily duty, this genuinely helps us in developing our spiritual symmetry and character. We then have much less concern, for instance, with things of the moment. The banter in the cafeteria with peers or at the office round table with colleagues would so reflect, and, likewise, family discussions around the dinner table. We would also be much less concerned with our public image and with what "they" think, being, instead, much more concerned with having Jesus' image in our countenance. The one-upmanship we typically see connected with intellectual prowess and other forms of prowess is opposite to what discipleship calls for. Jesus' aim is to lift us up, not to put us down.<br><br>Given all you and I yet lack in our spiritual symmetry and character formation, no wonder God must use so intensively the little time available to develop each of us in this brief, second estate. One's life, therefore, is brevity compared to eternity--like being dropped off by a parent for a day at school. But what a day!<br><br>For the serious disciple the resulting urgency means there can be few extended reveries and recesses and certainly no sabbaticals--all this in order to hasten God's relentless remodeling of each of us! Parenthetically, I don't know how it is for you, but though the reveries, the special moments come, they are not extended. Soon the drumroll of events, even difficulties, resumes. There is so much to get done in the brief time we have in this mortal classroom.<br><br>Considering what we are, compared with what we have the power to become, should give us great spiritual hope. Think of it this way. There are some very serene, blue lakes on this planet situated in cavities that once were red, belching volcanos. Likewise, there are beautiful, green, tropical mountains formed from ancient, hot extrusions. The parallel transformation of humans is much more remarkable than all of that--much more beautiful and much more everlasting!<br><br>So it is, amid the vastness of his creations, God's shaping personalness is felt in the details of our lives--not only in the details of the galaxies and molecules but, much more importantly, in the details of our own lives. Somehow, brothers and sisters, God is providing these individual tutorials for us while, at the same time, he is overseeing cosmic funerals and births--as one earth passes away, so another is born (see Moses 1:38). It is marvelous that he would attend to us so personally in the midst of those cosmic duties.<br><br>Are we willing, however, to be significantly remodeled even by his loving hands? Enoch was. He marveled over God's vast creations, but when deeply reassured, he fervently exclaimed, "Yet thou art there." God is ever "there"! (See Moses 7:30.) Significantly, Enoch also exclaimed over three attributes of God's character, declaring that God is just, merciful, and kind forever! You and I are counting on those attributes every day, aren't we! And God's using those qualities to bless us should stir us to develop them to operate in behalf of others.<br><br>God is very serious about the joy of his children! Why should we be surprised? God desires us to become more like him so we can go home to him. He is a perfect Father!<br><br>Where would we be, in fact, without God's long-suffering? Given the divine sorrow each of us here has caused our God and our Savior, what a divine comfort to know that when we "get it all together," it will be mercifully said, "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). No more reassuring and important words could be said to any of us than these.<br><br>What ineffable love! What stunning patience! How wrenching it would be otherwise, having been resurrected, to be forever wincing over having displeased him. Oh, the marvel of his divine mercy and his plan of happiness!<br><br>One day, if we are like Enoch, we will, as the man or the woman of Christ, know that we, too, please God. Discipleship's enlarged capacity to serve will bring enlarged joys. No wonder we read lamentations from the Lord about those who do not accept his invitation to discipleship.<br><br>O<i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</i>[Matthew 23:37]<br><br>Or, from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord!</i>O<i>ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!</i>[Mormon 6:17]<br><br>These lamentations measure the deep love Jesus has for us. They underscore the importance of our accepting his invitation to discipleship.<br><br>Even so, Jesus prayed for us and for all of his followers not to be taken "out of the world." But instead, he desires that we might be kept from evil (see John 17:15). We stay in the classroom until school is out, and there appears to be "none other way."<br><br>It is left to each of us to balance contentment with what God has allotted to us in life with some divine discontent as to what we are in comparison with what we have the power to become. Discipleship creates this balance on the straight and narrow path.<br><br>Only a few of you here will remember the old Popeye cartoons in which he proclaimed self-contentedly, "I yam what I yam, and that's all I yam. I'm Popeye, the sailor man." We are beckoned by a very different call--by the Master who asks us to become "even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>Though most of you are young, I continue to be heartened by how far along so many of you already are in your discipleship for your age. I mingle with you, hear about you, and sometimes counsel you. In these and other ways I become aware of your quiet, spiritual triumphs.<br><br>An example would be these next words that were spoken recently by the husband of just a little over one year of Jennifer Cracroft Lewis. Her funeral was held here in Provo several months ago. Though grieving over his wife of such a short season, Brother Lewis spoke at the funeral with composure as well as courage:<br><br><i>I have a testimony of this gospel. I know that the ordinances in the temple that I have partaken of with Jennifer are eternal. This gospel is so great that I will be with her again and I will hold her flesh again as she is resurrected. I have a testimony of this Church, and Jennifer has a testimony of this Church which she bore with me, that Jesus is the Christ. . . . He was resurrected as we will be.</i><br><br>He continued, saying,<br><br><i>One of our favorite songs, which we will now sing as a congregation, was "Called to Serve." I believe, as the scriptures have pointed out, that Jennifer, one of the best missionaries I ever had a chance to witness, is called to further service. She has been called home to preach the gospel to those who have not yet received it. I ask that this song be sung with meaning.</i><br><br>Then, as invited, we all sang "Called to Serve." Weeping and singing were several of Jennifer's missionary companions and her mission president and his wife. I always love to hear that song sung, but I've never heard it sung like that before! Not far from here, on a new headstone, are these words: "Jennifer Cracroft Lewis, September 13, 1968–January 26, 1994, Called to Serve."<br><br>This is emblematic of the strength I see and feel in so many of you. God's work here does proceed--here and on the other side of the veil, where those like Jennifer continue to "build up" the kingdom.<br><br>Discipleship turns on our spiritual sensitivities. It increases the "aliveness" in each of us. These sensitivities are enhanced, not diminished, with discipleship. It is part of what the scriptures call becoming "alive in Christ because of our faith" (2 Nephi 25:25). In contrast, there's a dullness and a sameness about sin. With discipleship we learn to "act for ourselves," rather than merely letting ourselves be "acted upon" by circumstances.<br><br>One of the dangers we face in discipleship is drifting. This can occur when we become "wearied and faint in [our] minds," to use Paul's phrase (Hebrews 12:3). This is one of the tragedies of failing to be serious disciples--not that we become necessarily wicked, but, rather, that those who drift merely exist; they are not truly alive.<br><br>No wonder the doctrines must be kept pure. No wonder they must be taught again and again! Furthermore, some doctrines, like faith and repentance, are both principles and also vital processes. Other important doctrines, like dispensationalism, for instance, inform and instruct us, but these do not necessarily develop us personally.<br><br>Paul warns those of us on the path of discipleship to be diligent, "lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you" (Hebrews 12:15). Travel on the straight and narrow path occurs in company with other disciples, imperfect as we all are. Side by side, as we all are, means that there are ways in which we can become offended or even embittered. Given the imperfections of all of us in the Church, offenses will come and disappointments will occur. How we handle these is so crucial. We must be quick to prune any personal sprig of bitterness so that our wills can be truly swallowed up in the will of the Father. When we put off the natural man and the natural woman, we put off jealousy, resentment, and self-pity.<br><br>Now, may I close on a personal note to illustrate a dimension of discipleship. Regarding you as graduate students, not as lower-division students, in discipleship, I will speak to you about something we don't usually speak about in the Church.<br><br>We sometimes speak of defining moments. These defining moments in our lives usually focus on single episodes that can sometimes be outwardly, as well as inwardly, quite traumatic. Yet these defining moments are usually preceded by small, subtle preparatory moments. Moreover, the defining moments are also followed by many smaller moments that are shaped by the preceding and defining moments.<br><br>Here's an illustration. In a long ago May, in 1945, there was such a moment for me on the island of Okinawa at age eighteen. There was certainly no heroism on my part, but, rather, a blessing for me and others during the shelling of our position by Japanese artillery. After repeated shellings that overshot our position, their artillery finally zeroed in. They should have then fired for effect, but there was a divine response to at least one frightened, selfish prayer. The shelling halted. The prayer was accompanied by my pledge of a lifetime of service--a pledge that, though imperfectly, I've tried to keep. With this blessing and pledge, I was nudged toward discipleship without realizing what service would be required. I knew I had been blessed, and I knew that God knew that I knew. I remembered the pledge after the war when my overseas savings gladly went to finance a mission. This mission, of course, was yet another step in the direction of discipleship.<br><br>Now, having described for you that defining moment, I want to certify to many subsequent and subtle moments that are at least as important. Unlike the roar and crash of artillery, followed by a delivering silence, these smaller moments involve the Lord's periodic whisperings to my mind. Over the years, and even on this very day, these guide me. They reassure me. They give me, from time to time, in the words of the Prophet Joseph, "sudden strokes of ideas" and, occasionally, the pure flow of intelligence (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 151). These moments are as real for me as what happened on Okinawa. These are inward things, often taking the form of a directing phrase or even a one-liner. I have found with experience what I think you will find: The Lord gives more instructions than he gives explanations.<br><br>Probably ten years ago I received a letter from a sensitive and thoughtful missionary in the MTC, asking if I would write his companion a letter of encouragement because his companion was determined to quit and go home, having trouble with the language. Because my secretary was absent, I put the letter down on my desk and thought to myself, "I'll send a letter down in a couple of days."<br><br>The Spirit said, "Write the letter now."<br><br>I borrowed a secretary, who kindly typed as I dictated. I signed the letter, and I said, "I don't know what's going on, but please go mail this letter right now."<br><br>Several days later, another letter came from the MTC from the same earnest companion who had written me before, saying in effect,<br><br><i>Dear Brother Maxwell:</i><br><br><i>I think you ought to know what happened today. My companion had his bags packed. He was having his exit interview. I went to sit in the outer office and said, "Please, Heavenly Father, let that letter come today," and then I ran down to where the missionaries get the mail, and there it was. I ran back up and knocked on the door and dropped the letter in his lap and said, "I think you ought to read this before you go home." Dear Brother Maxwell, my companion stayed.</i><br><br>Now, what if I had waited a day? Too late. Promptings often come in short, crisp phrases, impressing upon us a certain duty. They come in other ways to each of us. We know what's happening to us, but we don't know all the implications of it. But God knows. It's a sacred process. We know more than we can tell other people--not only for reasons of confidentiality but for what I will call "contextuality." Those who are not a part of the process are not likely to value and understand its significance. They're not apt to appreciate fully.<br><br>The whole process of subtle inspiration and revelation is like this metaphor: An inspired painter working on a large canvas does not report to or ask patrons or friends to react to each brushstroke. Nor does he exclaim after each stroke of his paintbrush well before the canvas reflects any emerging pattern. Yet each stroke the painter registers on the canvas is a part of an inspired whole. Without those cumulative, individual strokes, there would be no painting. But each stroke, if examined by itself, is not likely to be appreciated by itself, least of all by those who stand outside the process, outside of the contextuality.<br><br>Our personal spiritual experiences are much like this. They are personal. They are spiritual. Often they are not sharable. Some may be, but it takes inspiration to know when to share them. I recall hearing President Marion G. Romney, who combined wit and wisdom, say, "We'd have more spiritual experiences if we didn't talk so much about them."<br><br>So we ponder discipleship tonight. Be assured that God is "in the details" and in the subtleties of the defining moments and the preparatory moments. He will reassure you. He will remind you. Sometimes, if you're like me, he will sometimes reprove you in a highly personal process not understood or appreciated by those outside the context.<br><br>In the revelations the Lord speaks of how the voice of his spirit will be felt in our minds. For me, the message is not a whole discourse, but a phrase or a sentence. The Lord says also if we read his words, meaning the scriptures, we will hear his voice. Many here have had private moments of pondering and reading the scriptures when the words "come through" in a clear, clarion way. We know Who it is speaking to us! We've all had the experience of going over a scripture many times without having it register. Then, all of a sudden, we're ready to receive it! We hear the voice of the Lord through his words.<br><br>So it is in the process of discipleship. There are more meaningful moments than we use profitably, just as in terms of Christian service there are more opportunities around us than we now use. God is ever ready, if only we were always ready.<br><br>Brigham Young taught, "There is not a single condition of life that is entirely unnecessary; there is not one hour's experience but what is beneficial to all those who make it their study, and aim to improve upon the experience they gain" (<i>JD 9:292).</i>I hope we realize that. We may fritter away our time, but life is always drenched with more opportunities for discipleship than we use. Therefore, all the minutes and the hours and the moments can be, at least incrementally, defining moments.<br><br>As one wisely considers the reality of the years, the days, and the moments available to each of us, instead of discipleship being a hectic, anxious thing, it actually causes us to be more calm, more meek and trusting, and more open to God's tutoring of each of us.<br><br>He is "in the details" of your lives. He knows you perfectly, just as Jesus knew the woman of Samaria whom he quizzed as to her belief in the Messiah. She said, "I know that Messias cometh . . . : when he is come, he will tell us all things."<br><br>And Jesus said, "I that speak unto thee am he."<br><br>And she went back to her village all excited and said she'd found the Messiah, and then, significantly, she said to the villagers, "He told me all that ever I did." (See John 4:25–26, 39–42.)<br><br>God knows you perfectly. He loves you perfectly. His Only Begotten Son, Jesus, has asked you, "Come, follow me." Thus, in a real and majestic sense, each of us here tonight has been "called to serve"! Of this I testify, in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen!<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>ng Many, Are One” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
These are the last few hours of classes for winter semester, giving yet additional meaning to the phrase "endure to the end!" The end of a semester, for many of us in the university community, invites as much attention to resolutions as the end of the calendar year--to study more, eat right, change a major, etc.<br><br>I remember a poem I wrote in high school titled "Procrastination." It described the conditions under which I resolved to initiate actions to move my intention into behavior. It was a series of if/then episodes depicting more ideal conditions that were "worthy" of my waiting.<br><br>Certainly not all of our interest in the future is a product of procrastinating. We look to the future anticipating the results of the day-to-day effort required to achieve goals. We also look forward desiring blessings or experiences that are in the Lord's timing. The fact that some experiences cannot (or should not) be ours until conditions change can, however, become a rather large umbrella under which we stack too many of our intentions--and therefore procrastinate what can be changed now.<br><br>Are there not ways in which we withhold effort, waiting for better conditions in which we could live the gospel more fully--the better ward, the right spouse, more resources, after we move, etc.? Are there not ways we attempt to make others accountable for our responsibility to live the gospel?<br><br>Postponing repentance or pondering what we need to give up or give more of to follow our Savior delays realizing what is possible now.<br><br>I want to focus on the possibilities that are ours as a community of Saints. I know there are times when waiting is required--individually and as a people. I know that individual righteousness and family relationships are very important. I want to testify of that which each of us can do now, independent of our immediate circumstances, to create in our collective lives more that is possible from fully, joyously seeking and struggling together to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>"We, being many, are one" is a statement of both diversity and inclusion--a description with us from the beginning and about us as a people. Romans 12:4–5 states:<br><br><i>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</i><br><br><i>So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and everyone members one of another.</i><br><br>Our common gospel ground begs our attention as the container of the many who are one. Each of us has "gifts differing" (Romans 12:6), and each of us is required to "always remember" that the gifts are "given unto the church" (see D&amp;amp;C 46:10).<br><br>Continuing in D&amp;amp;C 46:12: "To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby."<br><br>How may all profit? First, I'd like to present a definition of oneness that serves us now. Then I will highlight three aspects of being many that accelerate our being one. Although there is a oneness that is as yet beyond our common experience, there is a oneness that each of us can nourish now. Were our eyes not veiled, we would clearly see that the full spectrum of the many are already one with us--those we like; those who irritate us; those we want to talk to; those we admire; those we want to avoid; those of all shapes, sizes, colors, and incomes. We are already one in seeking to return to a heavenly home we once knew. We are already one in our imperfect state. We are already one in that each has spiritual gifts. We are already one in each having the capacity--whatever our circumstance--to grow. We are one already.<br><br>Though we may be ranked, divided, graded, and rewarded by secular measures, by a common spiritual measure, you and I know each of us is as valued as the person next to us by a just and merciful Savior--a value that surpasses any worldly appraisal. We can simultaneously know of the Lord's great love for each of us and for all of us--a knowledge that enables us to place our difference in his service, seeing oneness rather than competition. John 21:20–22 contains a conversation between Peter and Jesus illustrating that we need not be in competition for experience, since we are equally asked to follow our Savior:<br><br><i>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following. . . .</i><br><br><i>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</i><br><br>Being many is not a threat to our individual gospel livelihood. It is a necessity for us to demonstrate obedience to the two great commandments on which "hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:40):<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i>[Matthew 22:37–39]<br><br>Can we manage being many and being one? What does it take to love the Lord and our neighbor as ourself? Each of us knows the frustrations of not having sufficient time or resources for the things we want to do or the assignments we have been given. In our secular tasks it is possible that the behavior of someone else will block an opportunity: the book we needed is checked out, the computer lab isn't open twenty-four hours, too many tests are scheduled in the same week. Such is the limited and imperfect nature of temporal resources that can generate both competition and comparisons.<br><br>However, to help us obey the first and second commandments, we have unlimited gospel resources--twenty-four-hour access through obedience, prayer, fasting, and faith to guide all our actions and achieve salvation. Others around me, instead of being seen as competition for an opportunity, can now be seen as the source of my opportunities to serve, to love with all my heart, soul, and mind. As Saints, whether we are in Belgium, Beijing, or Bountiful, we have the same assignments and one Shepherd: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Seeing our oneness, we see our relationship to one another.<br><br>The lyrics of Ron and Carol Harris say:<br><br><i>In this very room, there is quite enough love for one like me;</i><br><i>In this very room, there is quite enough joy for one like me;</i><br><i>Quite enough hope, quite enough power to chase away any gloom.</i><br><i>For Jesus, Lord Jesus, is in this very room.</i><br>["In This Very Room," Ron Harris Publications, 1979]<br><br>The next verse affirms there is quite enough for all of us, and the last verse tells us there is quite enough love for all the world.<br><br>Each of us is an ingredient in that oneness we will know as a Zion people and can know in this very room.<br><br>We know some of our oneness as we experience the unfolding of the gospel in missionary work and as we collectively respond in times of need. But what about day-to-day possibilities? Even Mondays? What is possible?<br><br>Peter Senge writes about the "learning organization" in organizational behavior literature and describes a current state and a desired state or vision of what is possible. He, as have others, indicates that seeing both is very important. The distance between the two he labels "creative tension," a required zone that energizes organizational members to stretch toward what is possible while they are aware of their current situation (Peter Senge,<i>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</i>[New York: Doubleday/Currency, 1990], p. 150). Creative tension is an interesting term for what can be a vast area between what we currently do and what we are capable of doing. But as a descriptive term it is way ahead of "zone of guilt."<br><br>Areas of creative tension exist for us as a community of Saints--they are opportunities for our mutual development and progression. We have many resources. I am impressed, almost overcome, with the increasing presence of goodness, which is not governed by ego, inequity, or evil. It is the spiritual companionship the Saints are promised to match these times. The same Spirit affects our many lives differently; the quality of our collective response will "make ready a people prepared for the Lord" (Luke 1:17).<br><br>I would like to comment on three things that can accelerate our being one.<br><br>First:<i>Doubt not that your contribution matters.</i><br><br>We may think of doubt as a personal condition, but doubt is contagious. Seeing ourselves as one of the many--hundreds in a ward or thousands in a community--we may doubt the importance of our individual effort. We may wait for a better opportunity or look to someone else in another capacity or with other gifts to make a contribution. Yet each of us contributes to the spirit in a meeting or the feeling in a ward.<br><br>Have you seen a wonderful mosaic--individual pieces of tile carefully placed together creating a wonderful whole? We notice when one is missing.<br><br>On other occasions we notice what just one contributes and how each contribution accumulates.<br><br>The Relief Society General Board adopted a stretch of I-215. We have become very acquainted with that portion of our interstate. Walking along the road and collecting items ranging from soda-straw wrappers to empty paint cans, a few of us got into a conversation imagining how this situation was created. We knew we were not at the scene of a single garbage truck rollover. No, here was visibly the moment-by-moment, day-by-day product of individual actions, some, unfortunately, intentional and some unintentional that created the whole.<br><br>As Saints our oneness is a product of our day-to-day interaction with each other. Intentional comments that label each other and behavior we judge with certainty--these contribute with greater magnitude than we may see at the moment. Our single acts of kindness, prayer, and love also accumulate. What do we individually contribute to the whole?<br><br>President Hinckley's message "Our One Bright Hope" talks about our Savior and our contribution:<br><br><i>As His followers, we cannot do a mean or shoddy or ungracious thing without tarnishing His image. Nor can we do a good and gracious and generous act without burnishing more brightly the symbol of Him whose name we have taken upon ourselves.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Our One Bright Hope,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1994, p. 5]<br><br>What we do matters to the Lord and to each of us.<br><br>I have the opportunity to hear from some of the many among us in information-gathering meetings on Church assignment with Relief Society wards or stakes. Participants talk about their experiences of living the gospel. Each time it is visibly apparent that although we are committed to living the gospel, we are vulnerable to each other's behavior. We have a great capacity to influence each other, either helping or hindering. If our commitment to the gospel is less certain, we may be even more vulnerable to how we are treated.<br><br>Some of us may be insensitive to how we treat others. Some of us may be too attentive to what others do and use our interpretations of their behavior as the explanation of our experience in the Church. Some of us are so sensitive to the needs of others that we do not care well for ourselves. And some of us may intentionally misinterpret the contributions of others.<br><br>It is important to remember that among us, collectively as a people, we have the resources and divine guidance to manage differences of experience while at the same time affirming the truthfulness of principles. If we only examine our differences, we may lose the opportunity to apply the love, patience, and service that gathers difference into the whole.<br><br>Doubt not that you have an important role in our common effort to demonstrate the profound effect of the Savior's teachings within our common ground as well as in our homes and individual lives.<br><br>When we do look more closely at what we individually contribute, we will see that there is more to do--almost more than we can do--that will keep that creative tension alive. Where we focus our attention can determine what we contribute.<br><br>I decided to learn to ski with my niece and nephew. They were quite young. Their whole attention was on the joy of skiing. When we worked with an instructor, they were quite animated about what they could learn and were quick to want more instruction. Theirs was the end goal, and they wanted more information on how to get there as soon as possible.<br><br>I, however, was focused on determining whether or not this instructor knew that I was a competent person in other arenas--being a beginning skier was not my sole identity. Looking back I see that I wanted my good intention to ski to be acknowledged more than my current performance. It would have been more useful for me to honestly acknowledge my current ability and focus on the goal.<br><br>It is our agency to choose the focus in relating to others. Our choices have immediate and long-term effects. I have talked with members of my community who wanted to be sure that I knew of their assessment of my "place" as a woman. I have talked with those in my community who wanted to be sure I knew my worth as a daughter of God. The quality of these relationships differed dramatically. I know also that I behave in ways that affect others. What we do matters to each of us and to all of us.<br><br>Doubt not that humility is an important part of becoming one, especially since the promptings that would instruct us--that ask us to stretch our performance, to be more kindly and affectionate toward one another, to look past our own needs--come from an Instructor who already knows us individually and collectively and who wants us to succeed.<br><br>We, being many, will be varied in our experience and yet can be one in our willingness to create Zion among us. We may not be able to predict individual needs, but we can heed the promptings of the Spirit. We may suggest someone talk with his or her bishop; we can offer time, materials, or other specific resources; we may comfort someone whose experience is unlike ours but whose worth is as great as ours to him who loves us all; we may signal a thumbs-up acknowledgment of someone else's accomplishment. Our choices let others know what happens to them matters to us whether or not we think we matter to them.<br><br>Do you remember the example Elder Ballard gave in the recent general conference of a ward council discussion on reverence? He reported the council's discussion of reverence and the bishop's request for suggestions on how to improve. One woman suggested there was one member who could do a lot to change the reverence before meetings. When asked who, she said, "You, Bishop." The bishop and his counselors set a goal to be seated on the stand as the meeting began. It made a difference. (See M. Russell Ballard, "Counseling with Our Councils,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, p. 25.)<br><br>What if she doubted that she should speak, hoping someone else would? What if her comments were not heard? I believe it is the quality of the relationships that each of us contributes to that enables information to be exchanged whereby we all may profit.<br><br>We need each member's gifts. When Bill Dyer was my stake president, he addressed a leadership session and asked that the measure of our relationships reflect the scripture in D&amp;amp;C 20:53, to "be with and strengthen."<br><br>I know there is information about our individual and collective experience that can be difficult to share and to hear. I am concerned when the effort to report an experience is used by others to put further distance between us. For example, learning of some of the perceptions of minority students (both U.S. and international) in my college concerned me. Hearing the reactions to their perceptions concerned me even more. We, being many, have much to learn from each other so we can be one. In each situation the same principles can apply: earnestly seek to be one, humbly commit ourselves to demonstrate the gospel in our daily interactions, desire to be with and strengthen, and be open to spiritual instruction. These principles serve both the simplicity and the complexity of our personal and congregational lives.<br><br>We will be known as his disciples if we have love one to another. Doubt not that we have the day-to-day opportunity to be among those who start that expression of love as well as to be among those who are so in need of it.<br><br>There is a second dimension that will accelerate a oneness we can know now:<i>Offer daily to be of use to the Lord.</i><br><br>Being many, there are multiple circumstances where we could be of use. The largest area of creative tension between what we actually do and what we could do may not be in the extraordinary moments, but in the ordinary. What can we learn when we inventory our readiness in our daily interactions to be of greater use to the Lord in establishing his kingdom?<br><br>This image of being of use to the Lord is conveyed quite vividly in this scripture:<br><br><i>The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</i><br><br><i>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</i><br><br><i>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</i>[2 Timothy 2:19–21]<br><br>Our obedience in keeping his commandments, our willingness to be tested, our willingness to progress spiritually shape us as a vessel for his further use. Let us each take full responsibility for the condition of the vessel we are for every good work of our Master. Because agency is a fundamental principle--in addition to our preparation--it is our opportunity and blessing to offer. No doubt we can be useful to the Lord by our righteous living and genuine concern for others. Might we be of more use if we repeatedly initiate the request to be of use--even in ways we may not know?<br><br>Offering is a statement of our willingness to do his will; it is not a state of passivity. We know there are many things to do.<br><br>King Benjamin's message in Mosiah asked the many who had gathered to "impart of the substance that ye have one to another" (Mosiah 4:21). Substance can have both a temporal and a spiritual meaning. Consider two things we can daily offer to impart: our attention and encouragement.<br><br>What do we notice about those around us? Do we see a community? Do we listen? Do we inquire? Do we respond to their questions--even when we disagree, or maybe especially if we disagree?<br><br>Do we feel inconvenienced when asked to respond to someone else's needs? I trust the Spirit will help us discern when we are not the person to respond, but I want to focus on those times when we know we could. Attention need not mean we are responsible for their experience, it means we can respond--share our reactions, feelings, offer opinions.<br><br>Attending to the experience of someone else should not be confused with the process of judging someone else. Watching my neighbor to see what she is doing can quickly become a judgment about what<i>is</i>she doing?--a judgment I may then pass on to others as fact rather than offering to discuss it more with her.<br><br>There was a time in my life when my circumstances as a single, working woman created more interest in those not of my faith than in those in my religious community. The attention and genuine interest in who I was by my friends who were not Mormons was compelling and began to affect my activity in my ward. I was drawn to those who were interested in me, rather than to those whose comments indicated that their focus was primarily on what I wasn't--not married, not dating enough, and not available because of my work schedule. However, one visiting teacher paid attention to me. She learned about my interests, about my schedule, and asked that I teach a specific Relief Society lesson on a Sunday when she knew I would be in town. Her attention changed my experience in the Church. Later I could see better how my contribution could have been different. I could have been more forgiving, I could have articulated my needs, I could have judged less, I could have been more accepting of my own difference within my ward community. I could have offered to be of more use to the Lord. But at that time, it was her attention that enabled me to regenerate my growth.<br><br>Encouragement is another tangible dimension of love that we each can offer--especially when we take the time to encourage those who already do something better than we do or those who appear to have more. It is not hard to encourage someone whose test scores are lower than yours. But what about someone who does something better than you do who could do even more with his or her talent? Do we seek to comfort those who have materially more comforts than we have?<br><br>Remembering we are already one, we can see more clearly the effort of another daughter or son of God and see where our attention and encouragement can be of use.<br><br>There is a particular tension between encouraging talent and presuming the conditions necessary for the expression of that ability. Our encouragement need not be conditional on our judgment of what we think the other's circumstances may be. Assumptions can cause discouragement--assumptions like "He's the least attentive student in my class," "He can't do better," or "She doesn't need to be a research assistant. She ought to be married." Our encouragement can certainly be about specific talents and gospel responsibility. Encouraging someone to do very well in school or to make careful choices about the development of their talents can be coupled with the encouragement to offer all that they are for the Lord's use. Encouraging the intelligence and talent of each young man and woman is an investment in the growth of the kingdom. We may not know when and how what they accomplish will serve the Lord.<br><br>This kind of prayerful attending and encouraging can also be called ministering. It is not driven by a desire to be right or to be popular. Think of the times when you knew someone cared about who you were. Think of the words that reminded you of your primary worth. Think of the actions that demonstrated love. We can daily offer these to others.<br><br>How is it that we can offer to be of more use--even to offer that which we may not have felt in our lives? There are day-to-day demands on all of us. How is it we can encourage and give our attention to the experience of the others around us?<br><br>When we accept more fully the attention of our Savior to our life and to our every need, when we acknowledge that he knows the desires of our hearts, when we remember to seek first the kingdom of God, we will have ample substance to impart. As my testimony of his redeeming love grows, I further seek to be his disciple. Being so attended, I can transcend my needs in a moment and offer more.<br><br>I have been humbled by another encompassing dimension of our Savior's life that continually prompts me to serve and encourage others. In Romans 15:1–3 we read:<br><br><i>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</i><br><br><i>Let everyone of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</i><br><br><i>For even Christ pleased not himself.</i><br><br>For even Christ pleased not himself. Multiple times during a week I have chosen my pleasure over service. This verb<i>pleased</i>is quite compelling. Even though I seek to love the Lord and serve my neighbor, much of my discretionary time is still organized to "please myself."<br><br>There are those around us who do not seek to please themselves and whose daily offerings mirror our Savior's. Let us follow their lead.<br><br>There is a third and final aspect that can link us now:<i>Believe all things work together for good to them that love God.</i><br><br>This is a gospel of love that enables us to be many as we are one. The quality of our personal offering to our collective life makes a difference and moves us toward Zion.<br><br>Some days I need to remind myself that what I can do or have is an "offering"--not the best thing that should have been done, or the right course of action, but an offering. The most challenging aspect of serving together may be when we do know we can contribute, when we are offering and encouraging, and then we learn that another direction or idea is wanted. I am amazed sometimes that my best idea is not the one accepted.<br><br>Our contribution to oneness, then, will echo in a small way that of our elder brother: "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).<br><br>All things will work together for good. Each of us contributes now to that which we will become as a people.<br><br>I pray that we may every day align our will so that "we, being many," may be "one body in Christ, and everyone members one of another." I pray this humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Kate L.

<h1>in the Community of Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I recall participating in a workshop on campus about a year ago in which the invited presenter was attempting to establish the idea that all things are better understood if thoroughly studied and defined in detail. I raised my hand and said, "Some things are ruined by trying to explain them." I feel that way to some degree today about my topic: "Charity in the Community of Saints."<br><br>I know it can be sensed. I have sensed it, felt it, seen it many times, but whenever I try to say it, somehow it falls a bit short. Nevertheless, I invite you to "read between the lines" and see if you, like me, can sense and know it in another language recognized as familiar by our eternal selves.<br><br>A beautiful description of the love of God is given to us by Father Lehi. He writes:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted.</i>. . .<br><br><i>And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.</i>[1 Nephi 8:10–12]<br><br>The fruit that was so delicious to Lehi that he deeply desired to share it with his family was the love of God, which he had personally felt. Once we experience its embracing power, we have an insatiable desire to experience it again and again. We want it always to be with us. Though some choose to deny it, most will make any sacrifice to gain it.<br><br>I will never forget the shock I felt the first time I became aware of someone in our own community who actually had called time and temperature to experience the comfort of hearing a human voice! They would often call in the middle of the night to relieve their loneliness. I thought, "How can this be in this community?"<br><br>Several years ago, while serving as bishop of my ward, I pulled out of my driveway very early on a dark, cold winter morning to go to the chapel. As I started down the street, I saw a familiar light on in the living room of an elderly neighbor. I knew he was suffering, as he did night after night, day after day, from a serious illness that caused excruciating pain in his aging legs, only receiving a small amount of relief by walking back and forth in his living room whenever the pain was unbearable. While most of us slept, he walked. I wondered how he faced it and how his wife faced it. I knew of several others who suffered likewise from illnesses and despair that defied sleep. I drove through the ward that morning to see if other lights were on, or if they had somehow found a few extra moments of peace in sleep. I knew they needed the loving embrace of the Saints--I wondered if they felt it.<br><br>Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, a nineteenth-century English novelist, once captured this great human desire as she wrote:<br><br><i>Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all right out, just as they are, chaff and grain together; certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and then with the breath of kindness, blow the rest away.</i><br><br>This exists to its greatest degree in a community of Saints who know the Savior--not casually but intimately. It exists most completely in those who have studied his life and know him deeply. Too many of us know him by definition only. We know<i>of</i>him, but perhaps we do not sufficiently know him. Frederic W. Farrar wrote the following of Christ:<br><br><i>All that the human frame can tolerate of suffering was to be heaped upon His shrinking body; every misery that cruel and crushing insult can inflict was to weigh heavy on His soul; and in this torment of body and agony of soul even the high and radiant serenity of His divine spirit was to suffer a short but terrible eclipse. Pain in its acutest sting, shame in its most overwhelming brutality, all the burden of . . . sin . . . this was what He must now face in all its most inexplicable accumulation.</i>[Farrar,<i>The Life of Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994), p. 575]<br><br>How could such be born without the purest love for his brothers and sisters being at the root of his sacrifice?<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie, in<i>The Mortal Messiah,</i>writes of Jesus' suffering in Gethsemane:<br><br><i>What has been preserved for us is only a sliver from a great tree, only a few sentences of what was said, only a brief glimpse of what transpired. . . .</i><br><br><i>There is no language known to mortals that can tell what agony and suffering was his while in the Garden.</i>[McConkie,<i>The Mortal Messiah,</i>vol. 4 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981), pp. 124, 126]<br><br>As King Benjamin wrote, "For behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people" (Mosiah 3:7).<br><br>I cannot fathom the love that served as his motivation.<br><br>The ultimate effect of the saving principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to change the heart! When this occurs, and it is usually a process that occurs through a series of significant spiritual experiences, we love more deeply and consistently. We love all that is of God more completely, and, thereby, we love his children and his work.<br><br>But we must seek this change of heart! We must desire it above all else!<br><br>To do so, we must struggle to give up the chains of the telestial world we live in. Often we must give them up more than once because they have a cunning way of returning to us even when we feel we are finally free of them! I believe this means we give up pride, winning, victory over others, and competition with each other--not victory and competition in the sense of personal enjoyment on a field of play or in the driveway but the destructive winning and dominating of brothers and sisters in which we seek to be above them. To free ourselves of these things, a stark change must finally occur. It takes lots of hard work. It truly requires a fundamental change of heart.<br><br>Frederic W. Farrar, in a sermon preached in Trinity Church in Boston, November 1, 1885, exclaimed,<br><br><i>Self is the all but universal idol; selfishness is for millions the sole law of existence. Men jostle each other, and struggle in the press, and trample savagely on fallen rivals, and show the poor spectacle of that perverted life which lives and dies only for itself. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Let us set our affection on things above, not on things on the earth; for, you see, a life spent in brushing clothes and washing crockery and sweeping floors--a life which the proud of earth would have treated as the dust under their feet--a life spent at the clerk's desk, a life spent in the narrow shop, a life spent in the laborer's hut--a life of poverty, a life of struggle, a life of obscurity and unsuccess--may yet be a life so ennobled by God's loving mercy, that for the sake of it a king might gladly yield his crown.</i>[<i>Sermons and Addresses Delivered in America</i>(New York: E. P. Dutton &amp;amp; Company, 1886), pp. 193–94, 200]<br><br>C. S. Lewis said it powerfully and beautifully:<br><br><i>Christ says "Give me All. I don't want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I don't want to cut off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down. . . . Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked--the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours."</i>[C.S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1984), p. 167]<br><br>He will give us himself. Then what happens? What do we hope to see? I would like to share with you a beautiful human experience that greatly helped me to answer that question.<br><br>Sharon Tennyson, a registered nurse, wrote the following during a sixteen-hour shift with a forty-year-old patient in very grave condition.<br><br><i>The room was quiet. . . . curtains pulled to reduce sensory stimulation. . . . the environment is a tense peace, if that is possible. A little Basque priest comes in making his usual rounds. He inquires quietly about my patient's condition with real concern. I am touched as he walks to the bed rail, holds his hand--palm down--about twelve inches over this man's head, and begins to pray silently. Minutes later he makes a sweeping slow cross over the top part of my patient, and quietly fades out of the room.</i><br><br><i>I am aware of tears in my eyes. Why does this touch the heart and soul within me so? This little priest, looking to be in his sixties, salt and pepper hair, no taller than five foot three inches, walks around the hospital comforting the grieving, encouraging the sick and praying for the dying. And here he is today, praying over and loving a sleeping man who doesn't even know him or know he is there.</i><br><br><i>And this is his work in the world. He does it with great dignity and compassion. How many times are there those who are silently holding us in loving thought and prayer when it is completely unknown to us?</i><br><br><i>And my mind slowly comes back from its journey into timeless possibilities, to the bed of this beautiful man, and I take up where the little Basque priest left off, and am so touched and humbled by the possibility that we can enter into each other's lives in this silent way.</i><br><br>[Gerald G. Jampolsky,<i>Teach Only Love</i>(New York: Bantam Books, 1983), pp. 73–74]<br><br>After reading this experience, I remembered a very late night when I knelt by the bedside of one of my own children who was having a very hard time with life. I prayed fervently for him. I believe the love I felt for him that night was of the same origin as was the love Sharon Tennyson, the little Basque priest, and Lehi felt--it came from heavenly sources.<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. . . .</i><br><br><i>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. . . .</i><br><br><i>Charity never faileth.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:1–2, 4, 8]<br><br>I do not want victory over anyone who is my sister or brother--which includes all. I want harmony, and I want to serve you--to give to you. I want those characteristics of charity in me so that I can give them to you.<br><br>I have come to believe that the gifts of the Spirit are most available to us when we reach heavenward to obtain them in order to give them away, in Christlike love, to our beloved brothers and sisters.<br><br>The Savior taught us this in a most poignant way. In<i>The Life of Christ,</i>we read of the apostles:<br><br><i>Their feet must have been covered with dust from their walk along the hot and much frequented road from Bethany to Jerusalem, and under such circumstances they would have been refreshed for the festival by washing their feet after putting off their sandals. But to wash the feet was the work of slaves; and since no one had offered to perform the kindly office, Jesus Himself, in His eternal humility and self-denial, rose from His place at the meal to do the menial service which none of His disciples had offered to do for Him. . . . It is probable that in the utterness of self-abnegation, He entirely stripped His upper limbs. . . . Then pouring water into the large copper basin with which an Oriental house is always provided, He began without a word to wash His disciples feet, and wipe them dry with the towel which served Him as a girdle.</i>[Farrar,<i>Life of Christ,</i>p. 557]<br><br>It has always amazed me that this Man of Humility, who was the Creator of the Earth and the Savior of Mankind,<i>even chose to wash the feet of Judas!</i>Judas was the traitor himself, the betrayer of the Lord. He had felt the touch of those kind and gentle hands. He had seen that sacred head bent over his feet. And while the Savior washed them, he knew Judas' betraying heart would yet send him to Calvary's hill!<br><br>The apostles rightfully called Christ the Master and Lord--for so he was. Yet he washed their feet.<br><br>It was a kind and gracious act, and such ought to be the guiding principle in all our dealings with each other. Humility requires that we set ourselves aside for a bit to make place for the needs of others.<br><br>As this remarkable human, yet sacred drama came to an end, Jesus taught his apostles a lesson he knew would be recorded for you and me to read and hopefully embrace.<br><br><i>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. . . . Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.</i><br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:33–35]<br><br>Love was now the test and condition of discipleship--not the conditional love of this telestial world but the pure, true, unfeigned love exemplified by Christ as being without condition. It was known to be without condition because he offered it to all sinners, even Judas.<br><br>I have spent the majority of my professional life working with people who have troubled hearts and lives. I have known many who grew up as children in troubled families. They generally did not feel love. They felt alone. As I have worked with so many troubled spirits, I find that they are often painfully lonely. Aloneness is one of the great maladies of our day. Even active Latter-day Saints, busily working in the midst of so many others, at times report being lonely--feeling an absence of love.<br><br>We must correct that through hard work--making sacrifices to notice and to reach out to others and to love one another, as he commanded us to do.<br><br>I have always enjoyed<i>The Magic of Being in Touch</i>by Smiley Blanton, M.D.:<br><br><i>As a psychiatrist, I have good reason to know how often human problems are caused by the simple failure of people to make contact with other people. . . . Love is the climate in which all living things flourish and sometimes a single touch can evoke the atmosphere. . . . A mother ruffles her child's hair lightly . . . a husband, helping his wife on with her coat, rests his hands for a moment on her shoulders--and this says, "I love you" as clearly as if he had written the words in letters of fire. I have always had a warm feeling for the father of the prodigal son in the Bible parable. When the prodigal son finally came home, the father did not wait in the door with a prim word of welcome and reluctant handshake. He "ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him."</i><br><br><i>Marta Korwin-Rhodes, a concert pianist, was in Warsaw when that city was besieged by the Nazis in World War II. She volunteered to work as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded.</i><br><br><i>"Late one night," she wrote, "going through the wards, I noticed a soldier, whose face was buried in a pillow. In his agony, he was sobbing and moaning into the pillow so that he would disturb no one. How could I help him? I looked at my hands. If I could transmit vibrations in harmony through the piano, why could I not transmit harmony directly without an instrument? When I took the boy's head in my hands, he grabbed them with such force I thought his nails would be embedded in my flesh. I prayed that the harmony of the world would come to alleviate his pain. His sobs quieted. Then his hands released their grip, and he was asleep.</i><br><br><i>"The magic of being in touch. It can express love and ease pain and can give mankind its humanity."</i><br><br>Notice that in all these instances there is a setting aside of oneself. Though this is crucial in all of our human relationships, I hope we particularly remember it in our families where lives may be nurtured and spiritually fed in dramatic ways. President David O. McKay once wrote:<br><br><i>Homes are made permanent through love. Oh, then, let love abound! If you feel that you have not the love of your children, live to get it. Though you neglect some of the cattle, though you fall short in some material matters, study and work and pray to hold your children's love.</i>[Clare Middlemiss, comp.,<i>Man May Know for Himself: Teachings of President David O. McKay</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1969), p. 227]<br><br>One of the most beautiful descriptions of the setting aside of self--a defining characteristic of charity in the community of Saints--is found in the story of Macarius, the hermit.<br><br><i>St. Macarius, the hermit, lived in the desert in a little community of solitaries. One day there was brought to him that which, in the hot desert, is the most tempting and exquisite of all luxuries--a bunch of fresh purple grapes, with the bloom and mist of their delicious ripeness upon them. Macarius hated the thought of taking them himself he preferred that another should enjoy the boon, and handed it to one of the brothers; but the same motive was strong in him, and he gave it to another. But again this other preferred the enjoyment of a companion to his own; and so, in the absolute unselfishness of that little community, the untouched, tempting grapes, which would have been so cool, so refreshing in the burning day, were handed from one to another, none wishing to keep what would be pleasant to his fellow, till at last they were handed back to Macarius again. Unselfishness, you see, had become as completely the law of that little brotherhood as selfishness is the law of the common world. Oh, how infinitely lovelier is the spectacle presented by these saints of God, and their love for one another, than is daily presented in this hard, modern life.</i>[Farrar,<i>Sermons and Addresses,</i>p. 194]<br><br>The love of Christ knew no boundaries and had no conditions. It was and is offered to any and all who seek to experience its soothing, healing effects.<br><br>In October of 1990 our neighbor's daughter was involved in an automobile accident returning home from college. I was the bishop at the time and received a phone call about midnight from Kim's father, Ralph Johnson, asking if I could go to the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City and be with her because they were stranded in California, where they had driven that weekend, unable to get a flight back to Salt Lake City until the next morning. Brother and Sister Johnson wanted someone to be with their daughter, whose condition was critical. My wife, Sherri, and I, and my first counselor, Dick Beeson, traveled to the hospital. Kim was in a coma. Her uncle and boyfriend were already present. All during the night we prayed, waited, hoped, and cried. Sometime during the nigh t, feeling very bad, I decided to walk down to the area where Kim lay unconscious. It must have been three or four a.m. Much to my surprise I found my wife, Sherri, sitting by Kim, talking to her and stroking her arm softly. I said something to Sherri about coming back to the waiting room with me, to which she responded, "In a while. Someone who knows her and loves her should be with her. This is where Ralph and Nancy would be if they were here. She needs a mom. I will stay with her."<br><br>I do not know if Kim knew of my wife's care, but I hope she felt it even if she could not see it. Sherri gave Kim pure love unfeigned in the middle of that night while she lay dying. I learned that night that love is most pure when there is no consideration of a response from the person receiving it.<br><br>That is the pure love we should offer to each other in large quantities. Everyone loves to be loved. It feels good. I believe we respond to it as we do because it was so much a part of our premortal lives--it must have filled the celestial courts on high as we lived in the presence of our heavenly parents. As we experience such love here, it carries with it some soft and subtle memories of the pure love we basked in there in our heavenly home.<br><br>There is always the question of how these correct principles related to Christlike love are actually to become a part of our lives in a day-to-day fashion. I have thought about that a great deal because if we cannot get from principle to practice, then our daily lives remain unaffected. I once fashioned a concept called "The Blue Line" that I would like to share with you. The idea is that we draw a blue line around any group of individuals with whom we choose to work--a family, a ward, a class we teach, a priesthood quorum, a Relief Society, a Scout troop, a social group--literally any group. For example, you take a written list of students in your Primary class of five-year-olds and draw a blue line around it. The blue line becomes a symbol. What happens when a child crosses the blue line and enters your class? What happens when a person crosses the blue line and enters your ward? We then raise the question, What do we offer to anyone who crosses the blue line and enters our group? What do they come seeking? What will we give to all who join us? I always have felt that we have certain basic needs that seem to be eternally a part of us--the need to be loved, to feel important, to feel valuable, to feel worthwhile, to feel significant, to mention a few. As a person crosses the blue line to enter your Relief Society, for example, you make a commitment to help them in every way to feel loved, significant, worthwhile, important. You make plans and decisions to do all you can to help all who have crossed the blue line and entered your group to experience those vital feelings of significance, worth, value, importance, and love. It will bring a sense of spiritual aliveness to all with whom you work and serve.<br><br>At the conclusion of the movie<i>The Chosen,</i>patterned after the book by Chaim Potok, we hear the following story:<br><br><i>There is a story in the Talmud about a king who had a son who had gone astray from his father. The son was told, "Return to your father." The son said, "I cannot."</i><br><br><i>Then his father sent a messenger to say, "Return as far as you can and I will come to you the rest of the way."</i><br><br>Oh, how I wish we would not wait for each other to come asking for love, for the nourishment of charity! Go to each other! Seek to love one another!<br><br>If such is the heart of the community of the Saints, the world will throng to us to share in it with us.<br><br>Alma teaches us:<br><br><i>Let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</i><br><br><i>And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing.</i>[Alma 34:27–28]<br><br>Sometimes I fear we are so well organized to assist and help that we miss many marvelous opportunities to spontaneously bless the lives of many around us through completely voluntary acts of service.<br><br>Please don't forget the quiet and unnoticed. Also, don't forget the strong ones. They seem not to need your embrace--but, they do! Some carry silent, heavy burdens, and they are people, too. Your simple inquiry as to their welfare may make the difference for them in being able to continue to carry their heavy responsibilities. The strong need to be loved and cared for as do those who struggle and strain. The needs of one may simply be more obvious than those of the others. We all need the touch of the Savior's hand.<br><br>Though the peoples of the earth are gladly embracing the true doctrine of the restored gospel in our day, do you know what will quicken their pace even to a run? The pure love of Christ in the hearts of the people. Do you know what will get them to stay in and among the community of Saints? The pure love of Christ in the hearts of the people.<br><br>I was a seventeen-year-old convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Coronado, California, attending a small branch of the Church with about eighty members. I remember that I used to go, even midweek, and stand on the street outside the Masonic Lodge where our small group met on Sunday and wish I could be inside with those eighty Saints who loved me with a type of love I had never before experienced in my entire life. I can feel it now as I speak to you about it. It is his love that I felt. I am also grateful that over the time of my Church membership, there have been some who have loved me enough to help me change my life and improve it. It has required that their love of me take a tough front at times, but it has been love that helped me to grow and change in important ways. Sometimes love has to be tough to help us pursue important life changes. I am grateful to those who loved me that much.<br><br>Moroni taught:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.</i>[Moroni 7:48]<br><br>Love, the pure love of Christ, is called charity. It is the only thing I know of that seems to increase in quantity as we offer it, unto the filling of all who seek to drink at its well. Let's listen more, try to understand each other a little more, hold hands more, put ourselves second a little more, comfort more, lend a few more helping hands when it might be inconvenient, just care more.<br><br>So, what am I hoping for? I would like to hear us say the words<i>I love you</i>more. I would like to see more of us in family home evenings where it is less of a class but a place where we sit with our arms around each other and talk of the Savior's gospel, expressing love for one another. I hope for more parents taking walks with their children hand in hand; more games where we laugh and play together because we like each other; more gratitude expressed in abundant love for one another; more love letters; more of us kneeling together in prayer, expressing our love for our Heavenly Father and for each other; less judgment, and more understanding ears for one another; more love expressed that is heavenly rather than dutiful. Love really has a hard time being based in duty! I look for more acceptance and understanding of those who are in their worst moments of life--so that they can reach out for help rather than fearing to allow anyone to know of their personal dilemmas. I pray for fear to subside and for love to grow in our relationships with one another.<br><br>Charity in the community of the Saints--may it be in the hearts of who we are as his servants, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James D.

<h1>y of Prophets: Presidents Benson and Hunter - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a joy for me to be here and also to be mindful of those young people joining us for the first time since their graduation from high school. The message today is going to be one of a testimony of prophets and why we should listen to a prophet's voice. Yesterday the drive by the cortege to Whitney, Idaho, was a touching tribute to a prophet of God.<br><br>There was a tribute by members of the Church as they lined the highway and stood on the overpasses along the road. Some were dressed in their Sunday best on a Saturday afternoon. Others paused in respect, stopping their cars and standing reverently, waiting for the prophet to pass. Farmers stood in their fields with their hats over their hearts. Probably more significant were the young boys taking their baseball hats off and putting them over their hearts. Flags waved good-bye as the prophet went by as well. There were signs that read, "We love President Benson." Others said, "Read the Book of Mormon."<br><br>As we spontaneously sang "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" at the closing of the graveside service in Whitney, the beautiful refrain bore record of the privilege we have to be led by prophets in these latter days. I'd like to read the words:<br><br><i>We thank thee, O God, for a prophet</i><br><i>To guide us in these latter days.</i><br><i>We thank thee for sending the gospel</i><br><i>To lighten our minds with its rays.</i><br><i>We thank thee for every blessing</i><br><i>Bestowed by thy bounteous hand.</i><br><i>We feel it a pleasure to serve thee,</i><br><i>And love to obey thy command.</i><br><br><i>When dark clouds of trouble hang o'er us</i><br><i>And threaten our peace to destroy,</i><br><i>There is hope smiling brightly before us,</i><br><i>And we know that deliv'rance is nigh.</i><br><i>We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.</i><br><i>We've proved him in days that are past.</i><br><i>The wicked who fight against Zion</i><br><i>Will surely be smitten at last.</i><br><br><i>We'll sing of his goodness and mercy.</i><br><i>We'll praise him by day and by night,</i><br><i>Rejoice in his glorious gospel,</i><br><i>And bask in its life-giving light.</i><br><i>Thus on to eternal perfection</i><br><i>The honest and faithful will go,</i><br><i>While they who reject this glad message</i><br><i>Shall never such happiness know.</i><br>["We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 19]<br><br>With the passing of President Benson, our prophet, on Monday, May 30, at 2:35 p.m., the events that have transpired have presented me with solemn, spiritual experiences and personal participation as a witness in sacred priesthood governance.<br><br>When the president of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, and the counselors take their place in seniority of calling in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Quorum of the Twelve then presides over the Church until the First Presidency is reorganized. The president of the Quorum of the Twelve is automatically the presiding officer of the Church when there is no First Presidency.<br><br>On Tuesday morning, May 31, the Quorum of the Twelve met with President Hunter presiding as the senior member of the Quorum. It was a beautiful meeting with honor and testimony given in brotherhood for the loving memories of President Benson.<br><br>On Thursday morning all the General Authorities who were in Salt Lake City attended a fast and testimony meeting in the temple in honor of President Benson. The testimonies were rich in expressions of love and gratitude for the teachings and example of President Benson's life of service. It was interesting that each one of us had been touched in our lives as we had served with him.<br><br>Thursday evening we had the opportunity of bringing our families to pay homage to our dear departed prophet at the Church Administration Building, where President Benson lay in state. My choicest experience was an opportunity of being able to bear testimony to my children and grandchildren of prophets in these latter days.<br><br>Friday, for twelve hours, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., thousands of devoted members of the Church and citizens of the community paid their respect as they filed by President Benson's casket in the rotunda of the Church Office Building. I took some time to observe those who came. The love and devotion they expressed for President Benson as they reverently waited and filed slowly past was touching. Many expressed to one another in hushed tones their personal witness of the prophet's goodness.<br><br>Saturday's funeral services expressed a rich outpouring of the Spirit being manifest in honor of one of the great servants in this dispensation. The Quorum of the Twelve and the seven Presidents of Seventy served as honor guard as the casket entered and departed the Tabernacle.<br><br>After the funeral the honor guard drove as a cortege to Whitney, Idaho, to participate in the graveside service. President Benson's loving son dedicated the grave site. President Benson was then placed to rest beside his beloved Flora--reunited with his companion of sixty-five years.<br><br>It was an eventful week, one I shall never forget because of the spiritual experiences that strengthened my testimony of the truthfulness of this great work.<br><br>A solemn assembly will be held during October conference. Each of us will have the opportunity to sustain the officers of the Church. President John Taylor taught us regarding the sustaining of officers:<br><br><i>We hold up our right hand when voting in token before God that we will sustain those for whom we vote. ... For when we lift up our hands in this way, it is in token to God that we are sincere in what we do, and that we will sustain the parties we vote for. ... If we agree to do a thing and do not do it, we become covenant breakers and violators of our obligations, which are, perhaps, as solemn and binding as anything we can enter into.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:207]<br><br>A sustaining vote is a public commitment of our own willingness to be obedient and to consecrate our lives to furthering the work of the Lord. The sustaining of officers is called<i>the law of common consent.</i>Sustaining is a principle of agency. Church officers are chosen by the spirit of revelation resting upon those priesthood holders set apart to call and ordain.<br><br>Sustaining is the public affirmation of our acceptance of priesthood authority as stated in the fifth article of faith:<br><br><i>We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:5]<br><br>Yes, this has been a historic week for the Church. The passing of President Benson marks the end of an era. How appropriate that the death of our patriot prophet came on Memorial Day, when we honor those who served our nation defending our constitutional freedoms.<br><br>President Benson devoted his life to testifying about Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. Here are my personal remembrances of President Benson:<br><br>First was his ability to sincerely communicate one-on-one directly with each of us who served with him. He would sit at his desk. I would be seated just to his right in a chair facing his large swivel chair. He would sit there with his large from-plowboy-to-prophet hands, our knees almost touching, and look me directly in the eyes with a depth of inner feeling that touched my very soul and tell me what was important for me to know or to do in my life or calling. When I left his office there was no doubt in my mind that I had been instructed by a prophet of the Lord.<br><br>Second, President Benson was fearless in the cause of truth and right. He was a living example of the words of the hymn "Do what is right; let the consequence follow" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 237). God bless his memory.<br><br>On one occasion in Europe I remember kneeling in prayer beside President Benson when we were at the point of selecting a stake president. What a great joy to participate with him in prayer and understand the true order of prayer and what it means to be able to call upon the Lord for revelation.<br><br>Apostles of all ages have had the character traits of courage and fearlessness. President Howard W. Hunter demonstrated his courage at this very pulpit. When faced by a terrorist threat to read a statement to which President Hunter could not agree, President Hunter calmly said, "No, I can't read that statement"--even though his assailant stood next to him, threatening him with what he said was an explosive device. Would that each of us would have the courage to say no when we are faced with making choices that we know are not right.<br><br>Another example of President Hunter's courage and determination to complete a task given him by the First Presidency is demonstrated by the completion of the Jerusalem Center. President Hunter purchased the land, supervised the architecture and construction of the center, and negotiated with government and religious leaders the teaching objectives for the center. During the years it took to complete the Jerusalem Center, President Hunter demonstrated a steadfastness and courage against opposition. He told those who worked with him, "Go ahead, move forward. Don't take counsel from your fears." How often we don't even try, and we fail simply because of our fear of failure.<br><br>Thirty years ago President Hunter bore testimony that we should turn to the prophets of this dispensation for counsel and direction in our lives. He said,<br><br><i>To peoples of past dispensations and ages, the most important prophet was the one then living, teaching, and revealing the will of the Lord in their time. In each of the past dispensations, prophets have been raised up by the Lord as his spokesmen to the people of that particular age and for the specific problems of that age.</i><br><br><i>It is the present living prophet who is our leader, our teacher. It is from him we take direction in the modern world. From all corners of the earth, we who sustain him as a prophet of the Lord, express our appreciation for this source of divine guidance. We are grateful for his life, his example, his teachings, his leadership....</i><br><br><i>As the prophets from the beginning to the present day pass in review before our memory, we become aware of the great blessing which comes to us from the influence of a living prophet. History should teach us that unless we are willing to heed the warnings and follow the teachings of a prophet of the Lord, we will be subject to the judgments of God</i>. [<i>CR,</i>October 1963, p. 101]<br><br>President Hunter's miracle recoveries from death's door have been a testimony to all of us that the Lord has a mission for him to fulfill.<br><br>President Hunter, like President Kimball and President Benson, met adversity with a spirit of quiet, resolute determination that has strengthened and blessed all who have been close to them.<br><br>The testimonies of the Savior given by prophets are eloquent and bold in challenging each of us to bear witness. President Hunter has been an example to me since I have been in the Quorum. Here is one great testimony he gave:<br><br><i>Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, pupil of Aristotle, conqueror of most of the known world in his time, was one of the world's great young leaders. After years of exercising military pomp and prowess and after extending his kingdom from Macedonia to Egypt and from Cyprus to India, he wept when there seemed to be no more world to conquer. Then, as evidence of just how ephemeral such power is, Alexander caught a fever and died at thirty-three-years of age. The vast kingdom he had gained virtually died with him.</i><br><br><i>Quite a different young leader also died at what seems such an untimely age of thirty-three. He likewise was a king, a pupil, and a conqueror. Yet he received no honors from man, achieved no territorial conquests, rose to no political station. So far as we know, he never held a sword nor wore even a single piece of armor. But the kingdom he established still flourishes some two thousand years later. His power was not of this world.</i><br><br><i>The differences between Alexander and this equally young Nazarene are many. But the greatest difference is in their ultimate victories. Alexander conquered lands, peoples, principalities, and earthly kingdoms. But he who is called the Perfect Leader, he who was and is the Light and Life of the world--Jesus Christ the Son of God--conquered what neither Alexander nor any other could defeat or overcome: Jesus of Nazareth conquered death. Against the medals and monuments of centuries of men's fleeting victories stands the only monument necessary to mark the eternal triumph--an empty garden tomb.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1986, pp. 17–18]<br><br>I give my testimony of the Savior and that empty tomb and what it means to us to be able to pray to the Savior when we have a problem and to be able to get an answer. President Hunter challenges us that we cannot secretly be a disciple:<br><br><i>The world needs men who are willing to step forward and declare themselves. The world needs men who will lift the load of responsibility to their shoulders and carry it high under the banner of Jesus Christ--men who are willing to defend the right openly....</i><br><br><i>How can men of conscience ignore the teachings of the Master in their daily affairs, in business, or in government? We stand by and wink at many things because we fear to do anything about them. We may be against crime ..., but what do we do about it? We may be against corruption in government or against juvenile delinquency, but what do we do about it? We may have a belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ, but what are we doing about it? We need to push fear into the background and come forward with a definite, positive declaration, and assume responsibility....</i><br><br><i>... Now is the time for those who have been noncommittal or who have had a halfhearted interest to come out boldly and declare belief in Christ and be willing to demonstrate faith by works.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1960, pp. 108–9]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us how to overcome fear, declare belief in Christ, and be willing to demonstrate faith by works, even by giving his very life.<br><br>This month, June 1994, marks 150 years since the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and his brother Hyrum Smith, the patriarch of the Church, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844.<br><br>Section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants was written by Elder John Taylor of the Council of the Twelve, who was a witness to the events of the Martyrdom. Joseph Smith prophetically and willingly gave his life to certify his testimony and faith in this great work.<br><br><i>When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME--HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD."</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:4]<br><br>The Prophet's martyrdom was a voluntary acceptance of death at the hands of evil hirelings, "To seal the testimony of this book [the Doctrine and Covenants] and the Book of Mormon" (D&amp;amp;C 135:1) and to bear holy witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel in this dispensation. Christ himself was a martyr who, through his atoning sacrifice, voluntarily laid his life down; according to our Heavenly Father's plan, that immortality and eternal life would become available to all who came to dwell on earth.<br><br>Jesus, too, prophesied of the events that were to happen in his life and went willingly, giving testimony of who he was:<br><br><i>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep....</i><br><br><i>As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep....</i><br><br><i>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</i><br><br><i>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</i>[John 10:14–18]<br><br>For both the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., and our Savior Jesus Christ it can be said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>True religious martyrs are part of an eternal gospel plan and earn an eternal reward: "Whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name's sake [and the gospel's], shall find it again, even life eternal" (D&amp;amp;C 98:13; see also Mark 8:35). The pioneers who gave their lives in the westward trek are martyrs also, but not in the same way as the prophet who held the priesthood keys and willingly gave his life in testimony to seal his work in this dispensation. Brigham Young gave this teaching about the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>For they killed the prophets ...; and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against them....</i><br><br><i>Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might be condemned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 136:36, 39]<br><br>Elder John Taylor writes of the "innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw" (D&amp;amp;C 135:7).<br><br>In Revelation 4 and 5 the apostle John records that a door was opened in heaven. He saw the Lord, Jesus Christ, seated on a throne with a book in his right hand and "a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book?" (Revelation 5:1–2).<br><br>John was told he was worthy to see the book. And when the Lord had opened the fifth seal, "I [John] saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held" (Revelation 6:9).<br><br>Throughout the teachings about the Martyrdom, testimony is one of the central themes. What was to become of the Church and the priesthood that the Prophet restored and of the Saints who believed in Joseph's testimony? Elders Parley P. Pratt, Brigham Young, and most of the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve were on missions throughout the Eastern States. In Parley P. Pratt's autobiography (<i>PPP,</i>chapter 42, pp. 290–96), he writes of the mood of the day at the time: "A day or two previous to this circumstance [the Martyrdom] I had been constrained by the Spirit to start prematurely for home, without knowing why or wherefore." Parley, with his companion and brother William Pratt, followed the prompting of the Spirit and booked passage on a canal boat from Utica, New York, to Buffalo, New York. Parley wrote,<br><br><i>As we conversed together on the deck, a strange and solemn awe came over me, as if the powers of hell were let loose. I was so overwhelmed with sorrow I could hardly speak. ... I ... exclaimed--"Brother William, ... let us observe an entire and solemn silence, for this is a dark day, and the hour of triumph for the powers of darkness."</i>[p. 292]<br><br>William and Parley then separated, and Parley took a steamer for Chicago.<br><br><i>The steamer touched at a landing in Wisconsin, some fifty or sixty miles from Chicago, and here some new passengers came on board and brought the news of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Great excitement prevailed on board, there being a general spirit of exultation and triumph at this glorious news, as it was called....</i><br><br><i>Many passengers now gathered about me and tauntingly inquired what the Mormons would do now, seeing their Prophet and leader was killed.</i><br><br><i>To these taunts and questions I replied, that they</i>[the Mormons]<i>would continue their mission and spread the work he had restored, in all the world. Observing that nearly all the prophets and Apostles who were before him had been killed, and also the Saviour of the world, and yet their death did not alter the truth nor hinder its final triumph.</i><br><br><i>At this reply many of them seemed astonished....</i><br><br><i>Landing in Chicago I found great excitement, and the press had issued extras announcing the triumph of the murderous mob in killing the Smiths.</i>[pp. 292–93]<br><br>It took Parley two or three days to go to Peoria, Illinois. He then had a distance of 105 miles to go on foot to Nauvoo. He "walked along over the plains of Illinois, lonely and solitary," and reflected on what he would find in Nauvoo. His thoughts turned to the grieving widows of the two martyrs:<br><br><i>How shall I meet an entire community bowed down with grief and sorrow unutterable? What shall I say? ... I walked onward, weighed down as it were unto death. When I could endure it no longer, I cried out aloud, saying: O Lord! in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Thee, show me what these things mean, and what I shall say to Thy people? On a sudden the Spirit of God came upon me, and filled my heart with joy and gladness indescribable. ... The Spirit said unto me: "Lift up your head and rejoice; for behold! it is well with my servants Joseph and Hyrum. My servant Joseph still holds the keys of my kingdom in this dispensation, and he shall stand in due time on the earth, in the flesh, and fulfil that to which he is appointed. Go and say unto my people in Nauvoo, that they shall continue to pursue their daily duties and take care of themselves, and make no movement in Church government to reorganize or alter anything until the return of the remainder of the Quorum of the Twelve. But exhort them that they continue to build the House of the Lord which I have commanded them to build in Nauvoo."</i>[pp. 293–94]<br><br>Parley went on his way rejoicing and arrived in Nauvoo ready to spread his message to the people.<br><br><i>In confirmation that the message was right, I found them already renewing their labors on the Temple, under the direction of John Taylor and Willard Richards, who were members of our quorum, and were in jail with the prophets when they were murdered--Taylor being wounded with four bullets, and Richards escaping uninjured.</i><br><br>Parley Pratt concludes this chapter with the following:<br><br><i>President Brigham Young was unanimously chosen and upheld in the Presidency of the whole Church; the keys of which he held by virtue of his apostleship, being the senior and President of the highest quorum</i>[the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]<i>of the Church then living in the flesh.</i>[p. 296]<br><br>In closing, may I remind each of us that we don't give our testimony and lives in death in the manner that Joseph Smith, the martyred Prophet, gave his life because that was part of his mission. Rather, we give testimony by devoted service in our lives each day to lift and to strengthen others.<br><br>In the same manner that the people sorrowed at the death of Joseph Smith, we sorrow in this day for the loss of President Benson. But, also, I bear witness that in the same manner that Brigham Young led the Church after following a great prophet, our next prophet will do the same in our day. I give you my testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. This talk today has been a testimony of prophets and of the importance that we know of their divine calling as leaders in this dispensation. That each of us may be able to be obedient and follow the teachings of our prophets, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<h1>Great Promises - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Bruce, for those kind comments and, Lenore, for that beautiful number that so effectively sets the stage for this devotional. I would like to speak about "The Two Great Promises," but before I do that, I'd like to reflect briefly on some of the past.<br><br>As Provost Hafen indicated, I'm in the process of completing my service as dean of the College of Engineering and Technology. I've been at BYU this time around for twenty-seven years, since 1967, and twenty-four of these years I've been engaged in administrative work along with the wonderful work that professors do at the university.<br><br>When I first was called to be an administrative person, a department chair, Ernest Wilkinson was the president of the university--that dates back some time because that's four presidents back. Our college counted about eight hundred student majors; now it's over 3,000. When I first arrived on campus we were located in the Fletcher Building, south of the Bookstore. There were three of us in Chemical Engineering then. We taught all of the classes that were taught in the discipline, and we had just one part-time secretary.<br><br>President Wilkinson's secretary called me when I first arrived and asked me if I would come over for an interview with President Wilkinson. It was his practice to interview all new faculty. In those days his office was at the Maeser Building. The Smoot Administration Building hadn't been built. I said, "Yes," and she set an appointment for the next day.<br><br>If you haven't taught before, especially when facing new preparations for a first class experience, then you won't fully appreciate this. I taught everything I knew the day I was teaching, and then I had to get ready for the next day by preparing all new material. I had three or four new preparations, and all I did night and day was prepare and present lectures. Well, when the next day came, you may have guessed, I worked right through that appointment. Nobody reminded me; I just worked right through it.<br><br>The secretary called and, of course, I was greatly embarrassed. She said, "Well, it's okay. We'll schedule it for tomorrow." I accepted that appointment. Now, if you didn't believe the first part, you'll never believe this part. I worked right through that appointment the second day. After my second failure, the secretary called and said, "Brother Smoot, do you suppose that you could remember long enough to come now?"<br><br>Well, amazingly, I did. I do remember being in the upper area of the Maeser Building and talking to President Wilkinson, but I don't remember so much about the conversation as I do about my efforts to arrive there.<br><br>That experience goes back to my first teaching days as a university faculty member. So much has changed since then. So much has changed in the physical plant and in the student body and in the faculty and in the university as a whole. We used to play football in a stadium where the Richards Building is now placed, and the seats were on the hillside. It held, if I recall, about ten thousand. A good neighbor and friend, Ab Swenson, was invited to speak at the Alumni Banquet several years ago in conjunction with his retirement. In reminiscing some, he said, "You know, when I first came to the university, Ott Romney was coaching the football team, and he also was assistant coach in basketball, and he coached the track team and assisted with baseball, and he taught history and he taught health." Then he said, "How things have changed at the university. Now in football we have one coach for punting into the wind and another for punting with the wind." That's what you call a great transition. That may be an extreme, but it does paint the picture of the remarkable change at the university.<br><br>The Marriott Center wasn't here. We played basketball--I played basketball for BYU in those days--in the Smith Fieldhouse. I had the experience of being on the team that played against Bill Russell and Casey Jones. Now the amazing thing is that BYU won that game against San Francisco. I haven't forgotten the team--Boyd Jarman was our center; he teaches in physical education now--and I could name all of the players that played the key roles in that game. The Smith Fieldhouse also held about ten thousand fans. The Clyde Engineering Building wasn't there, nor the Martin, Widtsoe, Tanner, Harris, or Talmage Buildings and others. This campus was a different place. And the enrollment--I don't remember exactly what it was in 1967 when I returned to BYU. I'll suppose about 13,000. It was about 6,000 when I was first a student here in 1952, and I wandered this campus well before that when there were only four permanent buildings on Temple Hill. What a remarkable transition. They used to whitewash the Y each year. Now they've found a more permanent way to manage that, and to even power the lights.<br><br>Well, I don't mean by reflecting and reminiscing for a minute that I'm retiring. I'm just changing my position. I have the opportunity of returning to that marvelous position as a member of the faculty in our college, and I look forward greatly to that opportunity.<br><br>I've also had some anxiety about this particular presentation. This is not my first talk in a religious setting or on a religious topic. It is not my first talk in this auditorium or on the campus to the campus community. And it is not my first opportunity to speak in a professional setting. I've had the privilege of speaking around the world in one setting or another, but somehow this talk causes me more anxiety than other talks. I tried to determine the reasons for this feeling. It's a different experience. I've never, to my recollection, given a talk on a religious or spiritual topic to my colleagues and students in a university setting. I'm not professional in the area of religious instruction, and yet there is something very special about this Church where lay people can seek to understand the scriptures and the intent of the Lord and not have to be a professional in the discipline in order to find testimony.<br><br>I have two simple objectives in talking to you this morning. One is to share with you my conviction about the sacred mission of this university, and the second is to share with you an equally strongly held conviction about the divinity of the Savior and the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>A word about BYU then and about heritage and sacrifice. The university has elected to honor Abraham O. Smoot, my great grandfather. I take absolutely no credit for his contributions to the university, but I'm driven and motivated by his remarkable contributions here. This honoring will take place on Founders Day during Homecoming this fall, and all the Smoots are looking forward to a large family reunion. We held a reunion here in 1983 with nearly five hundred people in attendance. We look forward to helping the university honor him.<br><br>Abraham Smoot died in 1895, nearly a hundred years ago. In 1892 he said to his wife:<br><br><i>Annie, I haven't a piece of property that is not mortgaged.</i>[And he was quite wealthy for his time.]<i>I have had to do it to raise money to keep the Brigham Young Academy going. That was given to me as a mission and I would sooner lose all, than fail in fulfilling this responsibility. I love that school and I can see what it means to our youth to have a spiritual as well as book learning. It must live.</i>[C. Elliott Berlin, "Abraham Owen Smoot, Pioneer Mormon Leader" (master's thesis, Brigham Young University, 1955), p. 161]<br><br>Well, live it did, through sacrifices of giants who have gone before us and made contributions like his. Why was it that Abraham Smoot thought of this as a mission? Well, I can tell you that story, too. It's written in history (Marilyn McMeen Miller and John Clifton Moffitt,<i>Provo--A Story of People in Motion</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974], pp. 27–28). I've often wondered how true or how apocryphal it was, but it is written and documented. Brigham Young, in the 1870s, called A. O. Smoot into his office. He had been the mayor of Salt Lake and a Church leader in the Sugar House area and was very busy in the Church and in his business. Brigham Young said, according to the documented history,<br><br><i>"I'm going to call you on a mission. There are three places, all on a par. One is as good as the other. They are Hell, Provo or Texas. You can take your choice." A. O. replied, "I would sooner go to Hell than to Provo." Apparently he didn't give a second thought to Texas.</i><br><br>And Brigham Young is said to have responded, "Brother Smoot, if you don't go to Provo, that's exactly where you will go."<br><br>Well, he went to Provo and gave away his personal fortune to save the Academy, which had struggled for years. He died in 1895, and the Academy was still struggling financially. Yet somehow, based on such sacrifice, we see about us a unique and remarkable institution.<br><br>When I walk this campus as I have done for over thirty-five of my fifty-nine years (I like to say "fifty-nine" because it changes soon into another decade), I imagine that I see the images of these giants who have gone before-- great teachers, great scholars, faithful members of the Church, and benefactors who have made this place what it is now. Yet there's so much to do.<br><br>I'd like to spend the balance of my time talking about the two great promises. From 2 Nephi 2:25 comes a very commonly known scripture among members of the Church--that "men are, that they might have joy"--and I presume that applies to all of God's children. And it says in Mosiah,<br><br><i>Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>There are remarkable promises for faithful members of the Church in Deuteronomy 7, starting with verse 11. I read such scriptures and then I look at my experiences over the last couple of decades of service in the Church and I see wonderful, faithful, worthy members of the Church who face challenges in their lives.<br><br>What kinds of challenges? All kinds of challenges. For some it is financial difficulty and setback. For others it may be disharmony in their relationships among family members. For still others it is that they can't bear children. Some may have a wayward child. Others may lose a child or a partner through a premature death or accident. Such challenges that occur in people's lives seem unlimited. I think about these things, and I see them among my neighbors and friends in the Oak Hills Stake and here at the university and in our family, and I think, "How can this be? If men are, and women are, that they might have joy, where is the joy in this kind of difficulty and challenge in life?"<br><br>Let me consider some specific examples, some from the scriptures, some from among my neighbors and friends, and some that have been reported in the news. First, you will recall in Alma 14 that Alma and Amulek had gone to the land of Ammonihah to call the people to repentance and to contend with Zeezrom. They were thrown into prison, and then scripture continues with verse 8:<br><br><i>And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire. . . .</i><br><br><i>And . . . they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.</i><br><br><i>And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? . . .</i><br><br><i>But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory.</i>[Alma 14:8–11]<br><br>Here is a key about one of two great promises, that "the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory." The scripture continues:<br><br><i>And he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</i>[Alma 14:11]<br><br>Now that answers a part of the question for me, but not all of it. I can understand that these people who did this terrible crime and caused the innocent women and children to be consumed at the stake would indeed face justice in the last day. But still I don't find an answer in that scripture as to how come these, the innocent in life, must suffer so, if people are to have joy and if they have a blessed and happy state when they keep the commandments.<br><br>Let me next mention an Idaho family, Jeff and Joy Underwood, the parents of six children. You may recall, as vividly as I do, last July when it was reported on the television that their daughter Jeralee, age eleven, had gone out to collect for her paper route. Jeralee never returned, "not that day, nor the next day, nor the next, nor ever" to her family in Idaho (see James E. Faust, "Five Loaves and Two Fishes,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, p. 6). After two thousand joined in the search, eventually Jeralee was found, abducted and brutally murdered. How does a family cope with this kind of tragedy? These are faithful members of the Church. Is that what you call joy, a state of happiness? The parents thanked the searchers and offered forgiveness.<br><br>Let me talk about a third example. One of the great passages of scripture to me that I just love, and that I recently read again from front to back, is the story of Job. As it says in the scripture, he was "a perfect and an upright man" (Job 1:8). Let's think about Job for a minute. I love this interesting passage, too:<br><br><i>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</i>[Job 1:6–7]<br><br>Well, I believe that even now the adversary goes to and fro and walks up and down in the earth.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</i>[Job 1:8]<br><br>And then you'll recall that the Lord gave Satan rights to everything but Job's life to test his faith. And you will remember that Job lost his property and his prosperity--and he was a very wealthy man. He lost his personal health, being covered with boils, and suffered greatly, even to the point that his family abhorred his breath. And he lost his family, through death or accident, and his friends--and even God's presence was taken from Job. His wife told him to curse God and die. Job's friends told him that his suffering came from God as a punishment for his sins. Can you imagine the extent of his suffering? It doesn't seem like a blessed and happy state. But Job said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord" (Job 1:21).<br><br>Now let's turn to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It does seem an appropriate time to mention this great prophet because the 150th commemoration of his martyrdom in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, takes place this month. President Monson wrote a beautiful article--you may have read it already in the June 1994 issue of the<i>Ensign--</i>about the examples that the Prophet Joseph set for us in so many ways. Think about his life. He was pursued. He was persecuted. He was tarred and feathered. He was imprisoned, and he was murdered. That doesn't seem, somehow, like a blessed and happy state for one who kept the commandments.<br><br>What did the Lord tell Joseph Smith in prison in the Liberty Jail in March of 1839, 155 years ago? He said this:<br><br><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee. . . .</i><br><br><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</i><br><br><i>. . . and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i><br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:1–7]<br><br>It reminds me of 2 Nephi 2:2, where it says, "Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain." Somehow from these scriptures we obtain further insight that this blessed and happy state doesn't mean a perfect joy in this life, because of the trials that are a natural part of our existence.<br><br>We don't have to look into the scriptures or in our history for stories of this sort. There are countless examples in our own lives and among our friends, family, and acquaintances--possibly not of the magnitude of those that I've reported. Certainly not in my life, but possibly among some of you, stories and difficulties may reach those kind of challenges.<br><br>I think of the Briggs family, our loved neighbors, who a handful of years ago were journeying during the Christmas season up Spanish Fork Canyon. Their car slipped into the way of a large, oncoming truck, and four were killed. These were faithful members.<br><br>I think of my first counselor in the stake presidency, Bob Hales, when I was called to be a stake president seven-and-a-half years ago. We'd only served a year or so together when the winter season came. Bob, husband of President Janette Hales of the Young Women presidency, couldn't sit for long periods at the desk as we did our work in the church. He blamed his old football knee. As the winter wore on and we all coughed from flu, his cough didn't get better; then came that inevitable and sad time when he learned he had incurable cancer. He only lived for about three more weeks. Now, to me, he was a person without guile. He was a remarkable, faithful person, and yet his life was taken.<br><br>How can this be? How is it that our "Father which is in heaven," as it says in Matthew 5:45, "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust"? Is the answer in Alma enough that this provides a judgment for those who help to commit these transgressions? Not all of these difficulties are caused by others through their sin and transgression. Some just seem to happen, and people ask the questions "Why this?" and "Why me?"<br><br>Well, I've struggled with this issue myself and sought to counsel members, and when you're in a position of counseling you want to bring some kind of comfort and reassurance to these people. Let me share some additional views with you about this issue. I found some insight regarding the two great promises from the scriptures that I've shared already, but there is more that brings me comfort and, I hope, to those of you and others who face trials, because they are in all of our lives.<br><br>In D&amp;amp;C 101:36, we read, "In this world your joy is not full." Well, you don't have to conduct a research project for your college class to demonstrate that. You just look around in the lives of people to see that that is the case. The Savior goes on to say, "In me your joy is full." Somehow, this fullness of joy doesn't come in this particular existence but through the Lord and, presumably, through exaltation.<br><br>We read further in the second chapter of 2 Nephi about the necessity of having opposition in all things in that great message from Father Lehi. To me, this chapter is one of the greatest in all of scripture. I've already referenced it twice for other purposes, and it includes Lehi's marvelous message on opposition. Light with darkness, pleasure with pain, and life with death are a natural part of our existence in this life. Now in Ether, Moroni says, where he inserts a thought, "For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>Let me return briefly to D&amp;amp;C 121, again referring to the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Here again is reference to one of the two great promises, the fact that we have the prospect of resurrection and exaltation if we just endure to the end. Then, as it says, "God shall exalt thee on high." That seems clear. Such testimony is borne by those who have come back after being clinically dead. Several books now document the overwhelming feeling of light and peace that people testify to about this joy of being in the presence of a perfect being.<br><br>But how about this life? What about the first great promise? Well, there's a scripture I like particularly well that, to me, brings peace and comfort. It is Alma 36:3. There Alma counsels his son Helaman, "Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions." Now, it doesn't say there in the scriptures--and I don't know where to find it in the scriptures--that if you put your trust in the Lord, he will eliminate the trials and the challenges and the afflictions and the troubles of life. I just don't seem to find that in the scriptures. So we accept this--this opposition, the good with the bad, the light with the darkness, the pleasure with the pain, and the life with the death--as an inevitable part of this wonderful life. Alma 36:3 then finishes with "and shall be lifted up at the last day." Here, in one scripture, we see recorded the two great promises: support in trials and exaltation.<br><br>Now please don't misinterpret just how glorious life on earth can be, and what opportunities there are here for us, and how thrilling it is to see the sunshine and the clouds and to see the rain and the water and the mountains and everything that makes our life meaningful, and to have families and to share love--all are enriching experiences. But there is opposition, and with all of this come the challenges of life as well.<br><br>So I sense, brothers and sisters, that the promise of life is not that you will, even as faithful people, be exempted from the trials and the troubles and afflictions of life. Such will be a natural and inevitable part of our existence in this life. I do see that we can cope with these challenges in life according to the promise if we put our trust in the Lord. Now, to me, that means to do his bidding, to do his will, to keep his commandments. That is, to me, what it means to trust in the Lord.<br><br>Let me go back to these people of whom I spoke earlier. I saw this trust in the Lord in Bob Hales. He said this to me as I had the privilege to give him a blessing just prior to his passing: "Doug, I am not afraid to die. I've put my hand in the hand of the Lord, and I know that he could make me well if he willed it, but it doesn't matter." And then, with a courageous sense of humor, even amidst the pain, he said (and he was a physician), "I guess I will not worry so much about my cholesterol level."<br><br>I saw this trust in the Underwood family. Sister Underwood said,<br><br><i>I have learned a lot about love this week, and I also know there is a lot of hate. I have looked at the love and want to feel that love, and not the hate. We can forgive.</i>[Faust,<i>Five Loaves,</i>p. 7]<br><br>Now, do you have this much trust in the Lord? Could you say that if you had just lost a child to a violent murder, and could you make that statement in the same week?<br><br>The Prophet said in a letter to his wife Emma:<br><br><i>God is my friend. In him I shall find comfort. I have given my life into his hands. I am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ. I count not my life dear to me, only to do his will.</i>[Dean C. Jessee, comp.,<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984), p. 239; spelling and punctuation modernized]<br><br>And Job said,<br><br><i>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</i><br><br><i>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</i>[Job 19:25–26]<br><br>It does seem possible, brothers and sisters, to find peace amidst sorrow. Look at these remarkable examples of these four people--some our neighbors and friends, some scriptural, some living in an adjacent state--who somehow found that kind of peace and comfort through trusting the Lord in times of tremendous trial. We can, through trust in the Lord, be strengthened to cope with the challenges of life, and we can be lifted up at the last day to a state of fullness of joy. We can be partakers of these promises.<br><br>Now may I share closing thoughts about the university and the Church. I want you to know that I willingly and gladly support and accept the environment and standards at BYU. Some have suggested that the university cannot achieve a respected place in the academic world under its policies and practices. I am prepared to let the quality and the accomplishments of the university's graduates--you students who will represent this church and this university so well--together with the scholarly and professional contributions of our faculty colleagues, settle this matter. I believe that diversity in academic approaches is a virtue. I believe that the university is unique in its teaching and in its purpose and its mission, and I wholeheartedly support this mission. I want to do everything I can to further it. I love this university, and I am committed to its mission.<br><br>Now, about the gospel of Jesus Christ: I firmly believe and testify that if we trust God by doing his will, we will be strengthened in our trials and our troubles and our afflictions, and we will find happiness and joy, even in this life--though not perfect joy, not a full joy--and we can also be lifted up at the last day in a state of never-ending joy. I leave you this witness, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>Serpents, Swords, Seeds, and Tears - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As you know from the President Lee's introduction, my deep interest academically and humanly is the field of international health and development. The seeds of this passion were planted and rooted during my welfare services mission in the Philippines, and they have grown steadily with each subsequent experience. And, although totally unanticipated, my choice of nursing as a career has also brought the realization of a patriarch's revelation to me when I was fourteen years old and hardly imagined leaving northern Arizona, much less the country.<br><br>It is the fulfillment of this personal patriarchal revelation that directs my thoughts this morning. As my mission and career experiences have taken me to the latter-day growth edges of the Church, I have seen the temporal and spiritual evidence of the establishment and extension of the kingdom of God on earth.<br><br>I arrived in the Philippines soon after the creation of the country's first stake and second mission. That first stake president, Augusto Lim, is now one of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. As a missionary I attended the area conference in Manila when President Kimball announced the construction of the Tokyo Temple, the first in Asia, never imagining that just a few years later my Filipino companions would write to me of the miraculous events surrounding the Manila Temple dedication.<br><br>I left Nigeria just as the first black stake in the Church was created by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. I've had the great blessing and pleasure of long conversations with the first Relief Society president in Romania. Babies I held when I returned from my mission are now serving in Saint Petersburg and what was Yugoslavia. And just three Fridays ago, I was in Amman, Jordan, where I saw the number of Jordanian Melchizedek Priesthood holders double in one day--from three to six!<br><br>As a child I had a wonderful Sunday School teacher. Sister Fay Randall brought gold, silver, and copper foil so that we could create the image of King Nebuchadnezzar's famous dream. The prophet Daniel interpreted that dream saying,<br><br><i>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</i><br><br><i>. . . and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</i>[Daniel 2:34–35, 45]<br><br>As the patriarch promised me years ago, I am a witness to the fulfillment of Daniel's prophetic interpretation of this dream. I testify humbly, but most assuredly, that I have seen the stone rolling to fill the entire earth as the gospel is taken to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.<br><br>This stone--the kingdom of God with its message of the Atonement and the Restoration is unique. It was formed without hands, and its advance is divinely engineered. Though this stone was not a mortal creation, we humans are invited to partake of the blessings that come from being part of the work of rolling this stone throughout the earth. We are offered the precious gift of being part of the Lord's great plan.<br><br>As I have charted my own responses to poverty, disease, and injustice, I have gone through various stages--from "How can God allow this to happen?" to "How can we continue to allow this to happen?" I have seen and felt the pain, anguish, and bitterness of the disenfranchised, the vulnerable, and the poor--in both spirit and bank account. I have studied and observed countless suggestions on how to care with and for others, including socialism, capitalism, single-payer health insurance, trickledown economics, health-care reform, forced redistribution of wealth, human rights, democracy, benevolent dictatorships, amnesty, primary health care, cultural relativity, rehabilitation, government regulation, village banking, liberation theology, and revolving credit. Yet I have also become convinced that the best political, social, and cultural public health and development strategies are doomed when administered without moral insight and character. This reminds us that "where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18). I have seen and felt the tragic trajectory of leadership decisions influenced by greed and selfishness.<br><br>Because of the Lord's divine economy, we construct our eternal souls as we lay the foundations of the dominion of the King of Kings. I know from my experience that changed souls change politics, prejudice, and poverty. Surely, be it in the power of individual repentance and conversion; the strengthening of faithful, healthy families; or the miracle of political and cultural doors opening to allow illumination by the Light of all the world, the building of the Lord's kingdom is the most exciting and addictive work I know. I watched a staunch Catholic nurse in Nigeria build the Lord's kingdom through patient, joyful service to a small leper colony. I helped her distribute food and clothing, kitchen implements, and other items that the lepers were unable to purchase in the markets because the disfigurement of the disease--though now cured--provoked great fear among the shopkeepers. As we danced, ate, and prayed with them, I felt hands of temporal concern guided by the Lord's light.<br><br>As I have contemplated how best to participate in the fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy, how best to be a loyal Lord's kingdom builder, I would like to share four distinct lessons I have learned about how this stone cut out of the mountain without hands gathers momentum from the faithful women and men of the Church. I am not foolish enough to believe that our lack of participation in kingdom building stops the stone's progress, for the same power that could raise children to Abraham out of the stones of Judea could certainly fill the earth with one stone. After all, the elements heed the voice of the Master much better than his children do (see Helaman 12:7–17). This simple truth makes the phrase "stone deaf" a little ironic, doesn't it? I am, however, wise enough to discern the pure joy of those who seek the will of God and do it.<br><br>The first lesson and the key to other lessons I will share with you today comes from the deserts of Arabia, where the children of Israel wandered for forty years trying to shake off their Egyptian perspectives. During a particularly whiny period, the children of Israel complained against God and Moses and the only food available for miles around. Consequently, "the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died" (Numbers 21:6).<br><br>When some of the humbled came to Moses begging for mercy, the Lord commanded him to craft a brazen serpent and mount it on a pole so that whoever might look on it would be healed. But, as Alma explains,<br><br><i>Behold,</i>[the Son of God]<i>was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live.</i><br><br><i>But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.</i>[Alma 33:19–20]<br><br>This is the tragedy of subjugating faith to knowledge or understanding. They did not understand, so they did not believe, and so they perished. By requiring an intellectual understanding as a prerequisite to belief or faith, we remain vulnerable to the world's precepts and proofs. Will we be like the Jews in the meridian of time, who expected a warrior and could not recognize the Healer; who believed in a king and could not recognize the Savior; who understood the Messiah as a ruler but would not listen to the Teacher; who hoped for freedom from the yoke of Rome but were unwilling to free their souls from more eternal chains? Like the wandering tribes of Israel, do we expect our spiritual and temporal illnesses to be cured by a vengeful destruction of serpents, not by faithful gazing upon a brass snake on a raised pole symbolizing the bruised and beaten Savior?<br><br>I can just see the campus discussions around the reports of the miracle of the brass serpent. A few faculty and students, just coming down with a strange flu, discuss the situation, saying, "Did you see that people are actually being healed from this dreadful disease by looking at a brass serpent on a pole? I don't understand how it works. The faculty in nursing, biology, and psychology say there is no scientific reason for it. My cousin in premed doesn't think it really healed anyone; it's just a plot by the administration. My colleague and several other eminent, internationally renowned scientists have been studying these phenomena for years, and our data indicate that this type of healing is impossible. None of the prestigious, peer-reviewed, advancement-in-rank-oriented journals have published anything on this yet. Let's not do anything precipitous like cast a glance in the serpent's direction when we aren't sure of the healing mechanism." I find it quite ironic that this divine, desert type of the Infinite Healer of All Things is today's emblem of a struggling, scientific medical system.<br><br>Deep, abiding faith in the Savior brings a peace that surpasses understanding, but it also creates the environment and the need for the deepest and least-fettered curiosity and inquiry. Because I am so sure of a few eternal things, I am free to explore completely the world before me. I am not advocating spiritual or intellectual complacency; there have been and still are many times when I give vent to numerous "whys"--especially when I pray. And if not a "why," then at least a few "hows" and "whens." But, when framed with faith, those questions seem to bring me closer to God, rather than farther away from him.<br><br>The second lesson I have learned about kingdom building came when I was attending a small branch in Nigeria. A small group of members espoused the philosophy that if you were poor there was no sin in theft, dishonesty, or deception. Your poverty absolved you of any infraction because you were only trying to survive. In other words, behavior is determined by some desperation index, not a set of moral principles. During one of our discussions of the Book of Mormon, the answer came very clearly. That answer was, "Survival is never more important than righteousness."<br><br>In Alma 24 we learn about the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, Lamanites converted by Ammon. They explained,<br><br><i>Since it has been all that we could do, . . . to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, . . . for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain-- . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins. . . .</i><br><br>[So they buried their swords,]<i>vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.</i>[Alma 24:11, 13, 18, 19]<br><br>Consequently, when the rest of the Lamanites came down upon them, they refused to take up their swords and were slain without resistance--slain while praising "God even in the very act of perishing." And we are told that "they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God" (Alma 24:22–23).<br><br>Building the kingdom requires powerful conversion and powerful repentance. I ask myself now, if righteousness is more important than survival, what symbolic swords do I need to bury and covenant to never unearth again? What are the weapons of sin I should be putting away from me--especially things I might consider too small to count? I don't think I have any figurative bloody swords at home in the closet, but, heaven forbid that I would be so excited about lacking a bloody sword that I would refuse to bury a few Swiss army knives I have used for years. Do the blades of deception, rationalization, greed, pride, or envy lay open on our kitchen counters within easy reach? I find I invent far fewer excuses and work much harder at making my behavior congruent with my professing if I imagine trying to explain to one of the 1005 murdered Anti-Nephi-Lehies that the stresses of survival in the nineties made it impossible for me to give up a sinful paring knife when they had given up their swords.<br><br>The father of King Lamoni pleaded with the Lord saying, "And I will give away all my sins to know thee" (Alma 22:18). Once I thought that line humorous, until I recognized that our insecurities, our poor esteem, our pride, our need to appear successful or appreciated, and our desires to accumulate goods or honors make us clutch tightly to our comfortable patterns of sin. I have learned that true conversion is hearing and doing, not just saying--even in the face of tremendous pressure. I would hope that for me, the dignity of thoughtful agency and righteousness will always be more important than the slavery of impulse and survival.<br><br>The third lesson I have learned about kingdom building comes from Church history. I think with great appreciation and fondness of the small Iowa outpost settlements of Mount Pisgah and Garden Grove. In an era where everyone was anxious to get to Zion, the Saints serving in Mount Pisgah and Garden Grove knew they would never be the first to enter the valley, break the first plow, or see Brigham Young mark the location of the temple with his cane. Yet, in order to make the westward migration of the Saints to the Salt Lake Valley as efficient and human as possible, these hardy souls relinquished their desire to be "where the action was" and instead built cabins and planted crops for others. Imagine planting crops you would never harvest. Even worse, imagine<i>weeding</i>crops you would never harvest. However, the faithful Saints of Mount Pisgah and Garden Grove were willing to cultivate seeds without setting up a balance sheet for repayment.<br><br>In common academic terms, I don't think they argued about who was going to be first author. I doubt anyone charged a speculative price to those who were desperate for shelter and food and then shrugged their shoulders, saying, "It's just a matter of market forces." I doubt they thought, "I'll wait until I'm settled permanently before I begin serving." I doubt anyone said, "No one values my service, so why should I put any effort into it? If only Brother Brigham would praise me more for my sacrifices."<br><br>What marvelous principles those early pioneers teach us: To plant the best of seeds without concern for praise or glory; to plant for the use of someone else and not just for ourselves; to contribute something to the lives of people we may never see again; to plant seeds where we are now because it is the right thing to do, even if no one applauds.<br><br>Pioneers who passed through Mount Pisgah and Garden Grove between 1846 and 1852 also showed gratitude for the seeds planted by others. There is great humility in recognizing our dependence on the seed-planting of others. As an undergraduate student I used to imagine that the 70 percent of my tuition paid by the Church came from my faithful, widowed grandmother's tithing. That made it seem personal, and I felt more grateful. Now I imagine that my salary is paid by the tithing of the Saints I know in the Philippines and West Africa. They don't know me, but they provide for me. I am grateful, and I feel a sacred obligation to pass that trusting, loving provision on to others in my work here. The willingness to plant good seeds and the gratitude for those who do are the true secrets of joy.<br><br>The fourth lesson I would like to share with you is one I learned in Nigeria. Part of my work was an analysis of the strategies indigenous nurses used in meeting village health needs. On one occasion I went with a Nigerian nurse to do an initial family-health assessment. I did not speak Igbo and was an observer on this visit.<br><br>I can see clearly the reds of the dusty clay soil, the blues of the plastic water pitchers, the greens of the trees against a late afternoon sky. I can also feel the way the wind announced the coming of the rain that caused us to move our benches inside the small one-room home. I sat mostly in the corner with eyes like vacuums, pulling in every image: the two small cots along one wall, the faded curtain separating the parents' sleeping area from that of the five children, the small cupboard containing all the family belongings. I can see the wedding picture of the happy, young couple who hardly resembled the worried and fatigued parents talking with my Nigerian colleague. I can hear the rain on the corrugated tin roof. My nurse colleague explained that the mother had told her they had not eaten for two days because her husband was out of work and they were out of food.<br><br>As if on cue, the oldest child came in soaked to the skin (which didn't take much, given the thinness of his clothing), holding a rusty tray graced with two bottles of warm soda--gifts for the family's visitors. The parents insisted I take one. I was sitting on a stool so low my knees were in my ears, and directly across from me on the cots were the children, whose eyes were glued to the bottles of soda. I tried to graciously refuse this gift because I understood the terrible sacrifice the family was making in offering it to me. However, the father insisted, telling me that though he was poor and had no work, he still had his identity as an Igbo man and that I must not take that identity away by refusing his gift. Have any of you ever tried to drink something when all you could see over the lip of the bottle were the eyes of five hungry children? Next to giving up my sins, it is probably the hardest thing I will ever have to do. I drank very little and handed the bottle to the children because I was weeping so much I could not swallow. Every part of me ached with concern for this family and thousands like them, a concern that could only be communicated through my tears because I had no other language.<br><br>As we walked away from this visit, my heart was filled with prayers and my mind was filled with possible nursing interventions for this family. My Nigerian colleague said, "Do you want to know what that woman said? She told me that she never imagined that a white woman would come to visit her in her home. Moreover, she never believed that a white woman would cry with her. She said, 'If a white woman can cry with a black one, then maybe there is some hope for the world.'"<br><br>Shedding tears together somehow symbolized hope and understanding, the brother and sisterhood we share with all God's children that transcends our differences. We sing about the blessed "day when the lamb and the lion Shall lie down together without any ire" ("The Spirit of God,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 2). If Isaiah lived now, his metaphors may have been more like "How blessed the day when the republicans and democrats, the positivists and the grounded theorists, those who would go to see<i>Schindler's List</i>and those who would not, the majors and the proponents of general education, those who demand more discipline for Honor Code violators and those who want more charity, and those who favor teaching and those who favor scholarship, could all lie down together without any ire." Imagine the kingdom building, the progress, the hope, the dialogue, and the light that would exist if ire were not part of the equation.<br><br>As I said at the beginning, I know the stone cut out of the mountain without hands is rolling forth to fill the entire earth. I have felt it and I have seen it. My hope is that each of us might participate more fully in building the Lord's kingdom.<br><br>First, we must have an immaculate faith in and a profound reverence for the one stable thing in our lives--the Savior Jesus Christ and his atonement. This steadying faith can, I testify, carry us through all manner of challenge, disagreement, difficulty, and hurt.<br><br>Second, because of that faith, let us bury the swords of sin that keep us from full commitment and valiant covenant keeping.<br><br>Third, because of our commitment and covenant, at every opportunity let us plant and nurture the seeds that nourish the bodies and spirits of those around us or who will follow us.<br><br>Fourth, through faith, covenant, and service let us shed a few tears of understanding with one another, not as "strangers and foreigners," but as fellow citizens in "the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19). President John Taylor's motto was, "The Kingdom of God or Nothing." May we as students, faculty, administrators, and staff constantly seek to be about our Father's business, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Sandra Rogers was dean of the College of Nursing at BYU when this devotional address was given on 28 June 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Mistakes - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am glad to participate in this BYU Campus Education Week.<br><br>This year's theme, "Education: Refined by Reason and Revelation," is both appropriate and challenging. The idea that education should be based on both reason and revelation is a true gospel principle. It is rooted in the divine direction that we "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). It is an immensely important principle that some good persons do not understand and apply. Some who have refined their application of reason reject revelation, and some who understand revelation seem to misunderstand its relationship with reason.<br><br>We can be edified by the example of great Latter-day Saints who honor and apply both reason and revelation. Arthur Henry King, a distinguished British civil servant who became a professor at BYU and then president of the London Temple, is such an individual. I quote from his book<i>The Abundance of the Heart</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986):<br><br><i>Conversion is not a matter of choosing what we like and ignoring the rest, but of whole-minded acceptance. . . . When we have performed this act of faith, . . . all the difficulties are resolved by it. When we have laid down at Christ's feet all our scholarship, all our learning, all the tools of our trades, we discover that we may pick them all up again, clean them, adjust them, and use them for the Church in the name of Christ and in the light of his countenance. We do not need to discard them. All we need to do is to use them from the faith which now possesses us. And we find that we can.</i>[p. 30]<br><br>Those words are both a challenge for all of us and an appropriate introduction for my subject today.<br><h2><b>I</b></h2><br>In this devotional message I wish to reason about a basic principle given in modern revelation but not as well understood or applied as it should be. This principle was given to guide us in our relationships with one another. It is especially important for parents with teenage children.<br><br>Three verses of the Doctrine and Covenants identify an important contrast between sins and mistakes. I had never noticed these verses until about one year ago, when I was reading the Doctrine and Covenants for the fifteenth or twentieth time. Their direction came to my mind with such freshness and impact that I thought they might have been newly inserted in my book. That is the way with prayerful study of the scriptures. The scriptures do not change, but we do, and so the old scriptures can give us new insights every time we read them.<br><br>The twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, given the same month the Church was organized, is the basic revelation on Church government. It contains one verse giving this important direction: "Any member of the church of Christ transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct" (D&amp;amp;C 20:80). The clear implication of this verse is that<i>transgressing</i>is different from being<i>overtaken in a fault,</i>but that either type of action is to be dealt with as the scriptures direct.<br><br>The scriptures contain various directions for dealing with members, but the key direction for present purposes is contained in two verses in the November 1831 revelation given as the preface to the book that is now the Doctrine and Covenants. These verses follow the Lord's explanation that he has given his servants the commandments in that book "after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding" (D&amp;amp;C 1:24). Succeeding verses clarify the difference between error and sin, and give distinctly different directions for the correction of each. I quote verses 25 and 27:<br><br><i>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known. . . .</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:25, 27]<br><br>Under these verses<i>transgressing</i>is different from being<i>at fault,</i>and<i>to err</i>is different than<i>to sin.</i>Here I need to define some terms. I believe that in these scriptures<i>sin</i>and<i>transgression</i>mean the same thing. Similarly,<i>to err</i>or to be<i>at fault</i>are also equivalent. In referring to this second category, I will use the more familiar description: "to make a mistake."<br><br>The subject of this talk is the contrast between sins and mistakes. Both can hurt us and both require attention, but the scriptures direct a different treatment. Chewing on a live electrical cord or diving headfirst into water of uncertain depth are mistakes that should be made known so they can be corrected. Violations of the commandments of God are sins that require chastening and repentance. In the treatment process we should not require repentance for mistakes, but we are commanded to preach the necessity of repentance for sins.<br><br>That is my message. The rest of this talk is just for purposes of illustration and application.<br><h2><b>II</b></h2><br>My first illustration uses words I learned as a young boy reading the Sears Roebuck catalog. In those days, each item of merchandise in the catalog was offered in three different qualities: good, better, and best. Sears didn't use the word<i>bad,</i>but if I add that word I have four words that permit me to illustrate my first point with clarity. For most of us, most of the time, the choice between good and bad is easy. What usually causes us difficulty is determining which uses of our time and influence are merely good, or better, or best. Applying that fact to the question of sins and mistakes, I would say that a wrong choice in the contest between what is good and what is bad is a sin, but a poor choice among things that are good, better, and best is merely a mistake.<br><br>Mortals make those kinds of mistakes all the time. We can read of some of them in Church history. I believe some of the persecutions our forefathers endured were a result of their sins. The Lord told them so by revelation (see D&amp;amp;C 101:2). I believe some of their persecutions were also the result of mistakes. Thus, Sidney Rigdon's defiant "salt sermon," which contributed to conditions that brought about the Saints' expulsion from Missouri, was probably a mistake. Similarly, some mistaken decisions on Kirtland banking policies plagued the Saints for more than a decade. These financial difficulties were perhaps portended in the Lord's warning to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "And in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy calling" (D&amp;amp;C 24:9).<br><br>On a more personal level, consider the mistake described by Truman G. Madsen in his fine book<i>Joseph Smith the Prophet</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1989):<br><br><i>In a relaxed moment one day the Prophet turned to his secretary, Howard Coray, and said, "Brother Coray I wish you were a little larger. I would like to have some fun with you," meaning wrestling. Brother Coray said, "Perhaps you can as it is." The Prophet reached and grappled him and twisted him over--and broke his leg. All compassion, he carried him home, put him in bed, and splinted and bandaged his leg.</i>[p. 31]<br><br>In teaching the Saints not to accuse one another, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "What many people call sin is not sin" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 193). I believe the large category of actions that are mistakes rather than sins illustrates the truth of that statement. If we would be more understanding of one another's mistakes, being satisfied merely to correct and not to chasten or call to repentance, we would surely promote loving and living together in greater peace and harmony.<br><br>The appropriateness of that approach as applied to mistakes is surely illustrated by the Prophet Joseph Smith's well-known teachings to the first Relief Society. There he taught the sisters to be kind and loving toward those who made mistakes, and also toward sinners. He said:<br><br><i>Suppose that Jesus Christ and holy angels should object to us on frivolous things, what would become of us</i>?<i>We must be merciful to one another, and overlook small things. . . .</i><br><br><i>Nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand, and watch over them with tenderness. When persons manifest the least kindness and love to me, O what power it has over my mind, while the opposite course has a tendency to harrow up all the harsh feelings and depress the human mind. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . There should be no license for sin, but mercy should go hand in hand with reproof.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 240–41]<br><br>The book of Proverbs is filled with advice on mistakes or errors, and the word most frequently applied to the person who fails to behave appropriately in these areas is<i>fool.</i>Our dictionary defines a fool as a person lacking in judgment or prudence. A fool is a fool, not a sinner. Our English writers understood that difference, and used it in their frequent contrast of fools and knaves.<br><br>Proverbs says that "A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards" (Proverbs 29:11). The Old Testament's usage of the word<i>fool</i>is evident in Saul's confession: "I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly" (1 Samuel 26:21). Stimulated by that expression, an English playwright penned these lines, which remind us of mortality's abundant field for foolish conduct.<br><br><i>When we play the fool, how wide</i><br><i>The theater expands! beside,</i><br><i>How long the audience sits before us!</i><br><i>How many prompters! what a chorus!</i><br>[Walter Savage Landor,<i>Plays</i>(1846), stanza 2]<br><br>The Savior used the term<i>fool</i>to characterize the lesson in his parable about the rich man who built greater barns to store his abundant fruits and goods and then said to his soul, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry" (Luke 12:19). Then, the Savior taught,<br><br><i>God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</i><br><br><i>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</i>[Luke 12:20–21]<br><br>The distinction between sins and mistakes is important in our actions in the realm of politics and public-policy debates. We have seen some very bitter finger-pointing among Latter-day Saints who disagree with one another on the policies our government should follow, the political parties we should support, or the persons we should elect as our public servants. Such disagreements are inevitable in representative government. But it is not inevitable that disagreements would result in the personal denunciations and bitter feelings described in the press or encountered in personal conversations.<br><br>When we understand the difference between sins and mistakes, we realize that almost all of our disagreements in elections and public-policy debates are matters of error (mistake) rather than transgression (sin). The inspired direction for such differences of opinion is to try to correct the errors by pointing them out in civil discourse, but not to chasten or denounce as sinners those we think have committed the errors. (Of course, there are some public policies so intertwined with moral issues that there may be only one morally right position, but that is rare).<br><br>In a recent interview with the press, President Howard W. Hunter said that one of our objectives as a church is "to change the world and its thinking." Identifying how we need to go about that task, President Hunter said, "We have an obligation, as Christians--as members of the Church--and we call upon all people to be more kind and more considerate--whether it be in our homes, in our businesses, in our relations in society." Concluding this plea, he said that we have a responsibility to teach "a Christ-like response to all the problems of the world" ("Prophet Focuses on Christ's Message,"<i>Church News,</i>9 July 1994, p. 3). Understanding and applying the distinction between sins and mistakes will help us fulfill that divinely imposed responsibility.<br><br>The scriptures and our leaders have also taught us principles that require a loving approach to those with whom we have any kind of disagreement on matters of religious belief. In one of the great prophecies that concluded his ministry, the prophet Nephi described the false churches of the last days that would teach "false and vain and foolish doctrines" (2 Nephi 28:9). He denounced many of their followers for obvious wickedness, including robbing the poor and committing whoredoms. Then he referred to another group, an exceptional few who were the humble followers of Christ. Note the words he used to describe these two groups.<br><br><i>They have all gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men.</i>[2 Nephi 28:14]<br><br>Here we see that when humble followers of Christ are led astray by the precepts of men, their offense is error, not transgression.<br><br>Elder George A. Smith applied that principle in an address delivered in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City in 1870. Referring to honest persons in the Christian world at the time of the Restoration who had been led astray as to doctrine, he used the word<i>error</i>and indicated that the Lord would be very merciful to them.<br><br><i>There were, however, honest persons in all of the denominations, and God has respect to every man who is honest of heart and purpose, though he may be deceived, and in error as to principle and doctrine; yet so far as that error is the result of their being deceived by the cunning craftiness of men, or of circumstances over which such have no control, the Lord in His abundant mercy looks with allowance thereon, and in His great economy He has provided different glories and ordained that all persons shall be judged according to the knowledge they possess and the use they make of that knowledge, and according to the deeds done in the body, whether good or evil.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:346]<br><br>Elder Smith's explanation obviously relied on the doctrine that defines the degree of responsibility of persons who have not received the law. The apostle Paul taught that we sin only when we know the law (see Romans 7:7). In a clear elaboration of that principle, the prophet Jacob affirms that "where there is no law given . . . there is no condemnation" (2 Nephi 9:25). As a result, he taught, "the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given to them" (2 Nephi 9:26; see also Alma 42:17). Similarly, the prophet Mormon declared "that all little children are alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law" (Moroni 8:22). This is the principle another Book of Mormon prophet applied in teaching the wicked Nephites that unless they would repent, it would be better for the Lamanites than for them:<br><br><i>For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; . . . even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</i>[Helaman 7:24]<br><br>Under this doctrine, persons who break a law that has not been given to them are not accountable for sins. Of course, all men have been given the Spirit of Christ (conscience) that they may "know good from evil" (2 Nephi 2:5, Moroni 7:16). This makes us all aware of the wrongfulness of certain conduct--such as taking a life or stealing--but it does not make men accountable for laws that need to be specifically taught, like the knowledge that had been received by the Nephites but not by the Lamanites (see Helaman 7:24). Persons who break those kinds of laws when they have not received them are guilty of mistakes that should be corrected, but they are not accountable for sins. They may suffer for their mistakes, just as a smoker suffers for breaking a law of health even if he has never heard of the Word of Wisdom. There are inherent penalties in errors or mistakes, but their perpetrators should not be branded as sinners.<br><br>We understand from our doctrine that before the age of accountability a child is "not capable of committing sin" (Moroni 8:8). During that time, children can commit mistakes, even very serious and damaging ones that must be corrected, but their acts are not accountable as sins.<br><br>Even after children reach the age of accountability, before we parents chasten them as sinners for wrongful actions, we should ask ourselves whether we have taught them the wrongfulness of that conduct. Have we taught them the commandments of God on that matter? This is a profound challenge and lesson for parents. Perhaps this is the underlying principle for the Lord's solemn declaration that<br><br><i>inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 68:25]<br><br>The application of the commandments is sometimes difficult for children to understand. As parents we know that we must be constantly teaching our children how to apply the commandments to the varying circumstances of our lives. For example, without explicit teaching they may not understand that stealing services from a long-distance company is just as much a violation of the eighth commandment as stealing inventory from a retail merchant. In some of these teaching efforts, on matters that are genuinely in doubt, parents may need to treat an uninformed or untaught act as the equivalent of a mistake rather than as a sin. We should correct the youthful offenders and promptly teach them correct principles to guide their future actions. Any repetition would then be a transgression.<br><br>This redemptive procedure also applies in the definition of the adult transgression of apostasy for teaching false doctrine. Knowing that there may be genuine questions about what is false doctrine, the servants of the Lord have specified a procedure for protecting a member who strays over the line innocently. This kind of apostasy is defined as "persist[ing] in teaching as Church doctrine information that is not Church doctrine after being corrected by their bishops or higher authority" (<i>General Handbook of Instructions</i>10–3). In other words, the teaching of false doctrine may be classified as a mistake the first time it happens, but it becomes a sin and a subject for Church discipline after those in authority clarify the application of the law to what the member is teaching.<br><br>Even though they have taught their children all of the commandments and principles they need for righteous and provident living, parents are still susceptible to the serious error of failing to distinguish between mistakes and sins. If well-meaning parents call teenagers to repentance for teenagers' numerous mistakes, they may dilute the effect of chastisement and reduce the impact of repentance for the category of teenage sins that really require it. This point is well illustrated in an experience shared in an interview on Richard and Linda Eyre's television series<i>Families Are Forever.</i><br><br>The subject was the importance of being friends with our teenage children and creating an atmosphere in which they are free to communicate with us. In illustrating that important point, LDS filmmaker Kieth Merrill gave an equally valuable illustration of the importance of distinguishing between errors and transgressions in the correction of teenagers. His sixteen-year-old daughter had just begun to date. After discussion with her, he gave her strict instructions to be in by midnight. She was twenty minutes late. "I was very tired," Brother Merrill said.<br><br><i>I had been suffering for twenty minutes because she was late. When she came in, I immediately read her the riot act. I forgot my policies. I forgot all my positive thinking. I forgot all the great things that I knew I should do. I just simply said, "You promised to be home at 12:00. You were not home at 12:00. I worry about you. We made a call. You weren't where you said you would be. You said you would call." And I went right down the list--bing, bing, bing, bing, negative, negative, negative, negative.</i><br><br><i>"Stop!" she said. . . . "We haven't been drinking, we haven't been smoking, we haven't been immoral or unchaste. We didn't go to any R-rated movie. We haven't been to a party where there were drugs. We weren't out shooting speed or doing anything else. We haven't been making out, we haven't been doing anything bad, Dad. I'm 15 minutes late for curfew, so let's keep this in perspective." And I totally fell on the floor and started to laugh. She totally shot me down because she felt that she could talk to me as a friend.</i>["Building Your Child's Self-Esteem,"<i>Families Are Forever,</i>television series on VISN cable network, 1989]<br><br>That is a marvelous illustration of the importance of the scriptural direction that we only chasten and call to repentance for those actions that are sins. (Of course, at some extreme point or with repetition, the violation of a well-established curfew of dating times could be a sin, though even then it probably would not be as serious as the sins it was seeking to prevent.)<br><br>I hope we can remember these principles in the direction and disciplining of our children. I gave an earlier version of this talk to a small audience of priesthood and Relief Society members. Afterward, a brother whispered to me, "I sure wish I had heard about this distinction between errors and transgressions before I spent a week camping with the Boy Scouts in our ward."<br><h2><b>III</b></h2><br>In the time that remains I will mention a few thoughts about some problems that lie along the uncertain border between sins and mistakes.<br><br>Sometimes it is not easy to tell the difference between a mistake and a sin. The boundary can be uncertain. Take the matter of the beautiful flowering crab tree in our front yard. One spring when the limbs of this tree were getting too long, I pruned them, quite severely. June, my wife, evaluated my pruning and told me she thought it was a sin. I thought the extent of my pruning was a mistake at worst. I was willing to be corrected, but I did not feel I was needful of chastening and repentance.<br><br>My experience with overpruning our flowering tree leads to the observation that there is a large category of undesirable conduct that is surely an error or mistake, and, at an extreme level, can cross over the border into transgression. When we willfully pass up an opportunity to progress toward eternal life, this is surely a mistake that should be corrected. In one way of looking at things, it is also a sin. This would apply to such things as failing to get schooling to prepare us for life, wasting our time, or failing to maintain the good grooming or to acquire the social or communication skills that would help us obtain employment or favorable consideration for marriage.<br><br>Mistakes can also lead to sins. The Prophet Joseph Smith observed that "there are so many fools in the world for the devil to operate upon, it gives him the advantage oftentimes" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 331).<br><br>The violation of special limits like curfews or missionary rules can make one vulnerable to sin. Or a mistake committed by one person can lead another person into sin in attempting to correct it. The pruning of the flowering crab tree, and countless other mistakes that are the subject of communications between husbands and wives and among parents and children, can be mishandled to the point of producing the wrathful, angry behavior the scriptures call contention. Contention is always a transgression. This was the subject of the apostle Paul's warning to the parents in Ephesus: "Provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4). The apostle James reminds us that "the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God" (James 1:20). We must be careful how we point out and correct mistakes in others, lest efforts to correct a small-sized mistake become an overreaction that produces an even larger transgression in us or in those we are attempting to help.<br><br>We should not conclude that a sin is always more serious than a mistake. Almost all sins, large and small, can be repented of, but some serious mistakes (like stepping in front of a speeding automobile) can be irreversible. This shows that a big mistake may have more serious permanent effects than a small transgression. To cite an example more benign than a pedestrian fatality, it is a sin to be insulting or unkind to anyone, but to be insulting or unkind to your boss is a big mistake. In this case, repentance for unkindness may be easier than finding a new job for insubordination.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith identified another kind of error whose consequences may be more serious than those of some sins. He said that ignorance of the nature of evil spirits had caused many, including some members of the restored Church, to err in following false prophets and prophetesses. In an editorial in the<i>Times and Seasons,</i>the Prophet observed that "nothing is a greater injury to the children of men than to be under the influence of a false spirit when they think they have the Spirit of God"<i>(HC</i>4:573). By this account, persons innocently misled by false spirits are guilty of error and can be readily welcomed back into the fold when their error has been made known and acknowledged. That very redemptive teaching rests on the scriptural distinction between errors and transgressions.<br><br>Another thing about the relationship of sins and mistakes is that they often go together. This serious truth is illustrated by some humorous examples in a pamphlet BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School published a few years ago as a tribute to Professor Woody Deem. The companion relationship between sins and mistakes is neatly captured in the title:<i>Criminals Are Stupid.</i>Here are some examples (see pp. 7, 14, 25 in<i>Criminals Are Stupid: A Tribute to Woody Deem,</i>1990):<br><br>A bank robber stuffed $850 in his bag, ran outside, and found he had left his car keys at the teller's window. When he returned to get his keys, he was met by a welcoming committee. Some bank robbers make their demand for cash by writing a note and handing it to the bank teller. Some of these robbers have assured their speedy apprehension by writing their robbery demand on the back of their personalized check or their phone bill. Another robber used the back of a letter that notified him of the time of his next appointment with his parole officer.<br><br>For sheer stupidity it is hard to match the mistake of the robber who put his demand note through the automated teller machine at the bank. When nothing happened, he shouted, "This is a stickup; give me the money quick." When this was ignored, he whipped out his revolver, pumped two shots into the belly of the machine, and drove off. A policeman who heard the shots arrested him for attempted robbery and drunk driving.<br><br>Bank robbing sinners seem prone to mistakes, but no more so than the parolee who entered a florist shop and ordered flowers sent to his girlfriend. After this order was put in writing, he pulled a gun and held up the shop. The shop had the address of the girlfriend, so she got the flowers and the police got their man.<br><br>Finally, I cite the case of the burglar who ran away from a burgled house, forgetting that he had parked his car in the victim's driveway. The next morning he missed his car and reported it stolen. When the police located the car, they were immediately aware that they had also identified a burglar.<br><br>Sometimes the same act can be an error or a sin according to what is in the mind of the actor. Something like an automobile collision that does great harm to another can be an error if it was unintended or a transgression if it was intended. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., highlighted the distinction between an unintended act and an intended one in his famous observation that "even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked" (O. W. Holmes,<i>The Common Law,</i>p. 3 [1881]).<br><br>The central message of this talk is that we should always seek to distinguish between sins and mistakes, in our own behavior and in the conduct of others. When we do so, the scriptures direct us to the proper corrective.<br><br>Sins result from willful disobedience of laws we have received by explicit teaching or by the Spirit of Christ that teaches every man the general principles of right and wrong. For sins, the remedy is to chasten and encourage repentance.<br><br>Mistakes result from ignorance of the laws of God or of the workings of the universe or of people he has created. For mistakes, the remedy is to correct the mistake, not to condemn the actor.<br><br>We must make every effort to avoid sin and to repent when we fall short. Through the atonement of Jesus Christ we can be forgiven of our sins through repentance and baptism and by earnestly striving to keep the commandments of God. Being cleansed from sin and receiving forgiveness and reconciliation with God through the atonement of Christ is the means by which we can achieve our divine destiny as children of God.<br><br>We should seek to avoid mistakes, since some mistakes have very painful consequences. But we do not seek to avoid mistakes at all costs. Mistakes are inevitable in the process of growth in mortality. To avoid all possibility of error is to avoid all possibility of growth. In the parable of the talents, the Savior told of a servant who was so anxious to minimize the risk of loss through a mistaken investment that he hid up his talent and did nothing with it. That servant was condemned by his Master (see Matthew 25:24–30).<br><br>If we are willing to be corrected for our mistakes--and that is a big if, since many who are mistake-prone are also correction-resistant--innocent mistakes can be a source of growth and progress.<br><br>We may suffer adversities and afflictions from our own mistakes or from the mistakes of others, but in this we have a comforting promise. The Lord, who suffered for the pains and afflictions of his people (see Alma 7:11; D&amp;amp;C 18:11, 133:53), has assured us through his prophet that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2, D&amp;amp;C 98:3). We can learn by experience, even from our innocent and inevitable mistakes, and our Savior will help us carry the burden of the afflictions that are inevitable in mortality. What he asks of us is to keep his commandments, to repent when we fall short, and to help and love one another as he has loved us (see John 13:34).<br><br>I testify that he is our Savior and that this is what he would have us do, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1>e Spirit of the Army&quot;: Self-Study and Planning Initiative - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I welcome the BYU community to this gathering. All of us come here each year in prayerful anticipation, seeking the renewal of our perspective and our commitments. I am especially glad to see those who have just joined the BYU staff and faculty. We need you and we welcome you. Among you new ones, I welcome Brad Farnsworth and Alton Wade to their respective responsibilities as administrative vice president and Student Life vice president. I'm also thankful for R. J. Snow's willingness to accept his new appointment as Advancement vice president after having served in Student Life with exceptional insight and affection these past four years. I express, too, my unbounded appreciation to Dee Anderson and Ron Hyde for their years of conscientious service to BYU, the Church Educational System, and the Church itself. We will miss Dee and Ron. For many productive years they have blessed and helped us all.<br><h2>Accreditation Self-Study and Long-Term Planning Initiative</h2><br>My assignment today is to introduce a major innovation at BYU--our accreditation self-study and long-term planning initiative. During the 1994–95 school year, this initiative will involve the entire university community at every level in a fresh and complete reexamination of our assumptions, our current strengths and weaknesses, and our future plans. The self-study portion of this project is required of us every 10 years by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. However, the long-term planning portion is self-imposed. I will try to explain in a general way the origins, the process, and the purposes of this comprehensive undertaking.<br><br>I acknowledge at the outset that some people, and I've sometimes been in this category, view self-examination and strategic planning processes as at best a promise of boredom and at worst an occasion for cynicism (if not outright harm). After all, any realist knows that our ability to plan--let alone control--the future is dauntingly limited. As Joe Bob Briggs put it, "Hey--you're born; you make up a bunch of goals and plans; you don't do any of them. A bunch of stuff you didn't think of comes along and makes you into something you didn't want to be. You whine about being dysfunctional. You eat a lot of Mexican food. You die. This isn't anything new. This is the way it's always been. Get over it, OK? I don't want to have to explain this again."<br><br>Our interest in thinking strategically about BYU's future reaches back to 1990, when President Lee and I gave the BYU Board of Trustees a very long memorandum entitled "Refining BYU's Mission." This document sought the board's advice about such issues as the enrollment ceiling, admissions, academic freedom, timely graduation, employment standards, rank and status policies, the special needs of freshmen students, the need for a fund-raising campaign, and many other matters. In subsequent discussions, the board has also indicated to us its strong interest in developing a longer-term approach to budgeting at BYU--that is, a 3-to-5-year, or in some cases even a 10-year, projection of our budget needs rather than our traditional one-year-at-a-time approach.<br><br>As we began working on these issues, we felt the need to have a complete analysis of<i>all</i>our programs, so that our vision of the university's future would be both comprehensive and informed by reliable data. We found that a number of departments had already undertaken such zero-based reviews, often with great success. (Incidentally, in this year's project, past efforts of this kind should simply be utilized and updated reasonably. We would not ask departments to duplicate or to ignore their relevant past work.) So we organized a committee on long-term planning in the fall of 1991 and then announced here in 1992 the beginning of an informal planning process that was designed to help us learn how to develop a more coherent idea of our institutional direction and priorities. As a first step that year, we encouraged department-level discussions about the university's religious foundations. To that end, we distributed packets we called "founding documents" that contained prophetic teachings about BYU's most basic purposes. We consciously left the process of structuring these dialogues to departmental discretion, hoping to maximize voluntariness and spontaneity, which seemed to us essential. I hope you will revisit this same material as a source of perspective in this year's self-study.<br><br>We then decided to delay implementation of further comprehensive planning until now, when we knew that all units would need to do a self-study for our 10-year accreditation. We did ask departments last year to review the credit hours required in their academic programs because the timely graduation initiative had become so urgent. But we knew those would be limited reviews. Now it is time to begin the self-study to prepare for the accrediting team that will visit here in early 1996. In addition, we announce today the beginning of a university-wide initiative designed not only to answer the questions required by our general accrediting body, but also to refine our collective visions of BYU's purposes and the role of each academic and academic-support unit in achieving those purposes.<br><br>We have appointed Jim Kearl of the Economics Department to chair what is turning out to be a very strong self-study and planning committee. The committee reports to the Academic Vice President's Council and the President's Council through a three-person coordinating team composed of Jim Kearl, Associate Academic Vice President Alan Wilkins, and myself. Bob Webb will continue in his role as BYU's official liaison with our accrediting agency. Jim, Alan, and I have spent a good deal of time together over the past several months in literature reviews and consultations that have informed the process we have recommended. We will continue to consult with the best experts we can find, but this will be BYU's own project, directed by appropriate university officials who are fully engaged in the process. Each vice president, dean, director, and chair is the person responsible for managing the self-study and planning matters within his or her own unit, with ongoing support from the university committee.<br><br>Tomorrow Alan and Jim will explain our project to the faculty, then the university committee will distribute the review instruments to the appropriate campus leaders. During fall semester, each academic unit will analyze its historical origins and current status. During winter semester, the academic units will then develop a well-informed concept about their future role. Under the committee's direction and with broad faculty input, we will concurrently develop a list of criteria to use in evaluating academic programs. Then we will evaluate each program according to those criteria--first a self-analysis by each unit, then a review by the university committee. We will take these evaluations into account in developing our future institutional priorities. The academic support units will also begin their self-studies now, but won't need to complete their longer-term plans until they have a chance to see the academic priorities that emerge next spring. Despite differences in roles, we regard the work of all university departments, academic or academic support, as having equal significance in this process.<br><br>We are also taking two steps to join these unit-level efforts with some institution-level analysis. First, at the urging of the academic deans and drawing on successful planning processes at other universities, we have developed a brief statement of existing board and institutional policies that define the general parameters--the "givens"--within which this year's self-study and planning will proceed. During 1994–95 we will amplify this statement until it becomes a complete, even if still general, statement of the university's priorities for the next five years and beyond. This statement will then act as something of a "functional" or "operational" university mission statement that reflects the outcome of the self-study and planning efforts of the entire campus. In developing this statement we will seek extensive input from both the university community and the BYU Board of Trustees.<br><br>As a second university-level step, we are creating a task force on institutional priorities that will assess BYU's external environment along with its institutional strengths and weaknesses. During fall semester, this group will find meaningful ways to involve the campus community in its deliberations. This dialogue will feed into our drafting of the operational mission statement. This task force will include members of the self-study committee and selected administrators, among others. We will report the work of this group to the campus at a midwinter meeting in early January. Then, during winter semester, within the framework that by then exists, we will assign several additional task forces to develop recommendations in key institutional areas, such as religious and general education, organizational structures, programs that reach out to the entire Church membership, admissions, international directions, and possible new program areas. The reports from these groups will then be combined with the evaluations of the academic programs to form an overall set of priorities that we will recommend to the board of trustees.<br><br>Now, I realize that all of this activity will consume a great deal of precious energy and time. I know that it will impose significant new burdens; so why are we doing it? I expect four specific results. One result will be a serious and orderly dialogue all across the campus about the distinctive nature and purpose of the university and its programs. That conversation, in all its variations, will itself be among the best fruits of our collective efforts.<br><br>A second result will be a thoughtfully articulated statement of priorities that will influence decisions about space, budgets, hiring, enrollment, and other resource allocation issues for the next several years. Some of this reallocation process will be internal to specific units, which will eventually be asked, with appropriate financial incentives, to improve the fit between their resources and their newly clarified priorities.<br><br>The third result will be a framework against which future evaluations will occur, thereby enabling a process of continuous improvement in everything we do. The initiative we launch this fall will thus create not just a snapshot of BYU, but a motion picture--a continuing "MRI" of the university's inner workings that will establish greater accountability, more rational institutional decision making, and--in short--a more excellent university.<br><br>As a fourth result, this process allows us to define and control BYU's future destiny. We will do this by creating, as a community, a set of shared and coherent expectations between the board, the faculty, staff, students, and external BYU audiences. This level of harmony and increased communication can help develop the unity we need to invite the Lord's spirit more fully into our campus life. It will also help ensure that Brigham Young University becomes a thriving part of the Church's future and not just a relic of its Great Basin past. By the turn of the century, BYU must be the Church's newly reborn child of promise, not a withered image of Father Time whose era has come and gone.<br><br>Against this background, I would now like to sketch the conceptual framework within which our self-study will begin. The first element in that framework is the current BYU Mission Statement, published in our catalogs and widely available. It was developed under the able direction of President Jeffrey Holland and Provost Jae Ballif and approved by the board in 1981. We today reaffirm that eloquent description of BYU's basic purposes.<br><h2>1994 Policy Summary</h2><br>The second element of the conceptual framework is an important new university statement that we're calling the "1994 Policy Summary," which summarizes five key areas of university policy that have been developed or clarified within the BYU community under the direction of the BYU Board of Trustees since 1989. Because this summary provides primary institutional context for the entire self-study and planning process, we will distribute it in printed form with the University Mission Statement and the self-study documents. I will now share its language with you as a way of launching our institutional self-study. As I do, it should be obvious to you that not every phrase here applies in the same way to everyone who works at BYU. This language is deliberately general, and it will be expanded and illustrated as we develop a longer operational mission statement during the coming year. Also, the Policy Summary focuses for now primarily on faculty and student issues, because our project's natural sequence begins with the academic units and then invites the academic support units to respond to the clarified academic priorities. I will read each of five statements, followed in each case by a few subparts.<br><br><i>1. BYU aspires to excellence in both its religious and its academic missions. To compromise either part is to undermine its institutional purpose.</i><br><br>a. The presence of the best-prepared students, faculty, and staff in BYU's history creates an environment of high spiritual and intellectual quality. Both anti-intellectual and anti-Church attitudes are misplaced here. Neither a mediocre university nor a spiritually half-hearted one will help the church fulfill its expanding mission. We are conscious of the history of many other church-related universities, where growing academic aspirations have often become associated with reduced denominational loyalties. We are also conscious of the history of many smaller church-related colleges that have minimized their academic aspirations as a way of emphasizing their religious priorities. BYU will choose neither of these paths. Rather, we embrace the difficult but promising task of combining genuine religious faith and serious intellectual effort. This combination of commitments represents the best possible way to teach and learn.<br><br>b. Therefore, all faculty, staff, and students should engage their academic and professional tasks with a sense of rigor and intensity that represents the very best in the historic role of American universities.<br><br>c. Scholarly work at BYU should frequently integrate religious perspectives with the perspectives of a faculty member's discipline. However, integration of this kind requires real rigor in both the religious and the disciplinary dimensions, lest the integration appear to devalue either the religious or the academic field, or both.<br><br>d. The university community should model the attributes of Zion, seeking a spirit of charity and mutual respect in all personal and professional relationships, including those between students and faculty, staff and faculty, men and women, members and nonmembers of the Church, and people from differing national, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.<br><br><i>2. BYU is a national, academically selective, undergraduate teaching university offering both liberal arts and occupational degrees, with sufficiently strong graduate programs and research work to be a major university.</i><br><br>a. The ratio of undergraduate to graduate students will be maintained at approximately 90-10 for the entire university, although there will necessarily be variations within individual units. We expect both the graduate and undergraduate programs to be very strong.<br><br>b. The enrollment ceiling of 27,000 full-time students is fixed.<br><br>c. BYU aspires to be a leading teaching university that cares deeply about the quality of its faculty scholarship. Thus it firmly supports research and creative work and intends to maintain substantially the present proportion of university expenditures devoted to support for research, whether in space, equipment, personnel, or general overhead.<br><br><i>3. The continuing support of the Church for BYU when an ever-diminishing proportion of qualified LDS students can attend underscores the need for BYU to remain very close to its sponsoring Church.</i><br><br>a. Tithing will continue to supply most of the university's operating budget, consciously creating a sense of accountability to the tithe payers and leaders of the Church.<br><br>b. Admissions and hiring policies will emphasize Church loyalty. We want to admit and hire those who are most likely to contribute to and draw from BYU's unique religious and educational purposes. Non-LDS people who are admitted or hired have equal value with all others in the community.<br><br>c. Admissions criteria will emphasize both religious and academic preparation. We then will select from among those best prepared the ones who are most likely to use a BYU education to influence others for good.<br><br>d. BYU will attempt to teach and graduate as many students as possible within its enrollment ceiling while at the same time improving its educational quality. Toward that end, we will attempt to make more effective use of our year-round academic program.<br><br>e. BYU will seek to share its educational and spiritual resources with the Church.<br><br>f. The university's academic freedom policies are essential to preserve the freedom to explore and learn within a context that supports the mission of the Church.<br><br><i>4. The most important responsibility of faculty and staff is to enhance each student's BYU experience. Adding to the student's understanding and personal growth is the university's highest purpose.</i><br><br>a. No task will have higher priority than good teaching. The best teaching is informed and stimulated by continuing scholarship.<br><br>b. The university will have a special concern for freshmen and other inexperienced students.<br><br>c. Our concern will be for the total development of each student, neither just the academic nor simply the religious dimension.<br><br>d. All faculty should be concerned with the quality of religious education, general education, and student life. Academic departments should not focus narrowly on their major students at the expense of these broader needs.<br><br><i>5. Faculty are the soul of the university. We must continue to improve our ability to hire and develop faculty who are highly qualified to foster BYU's distinctive mission.</i><br><br>a. Ideally, each faculty member will combine mutually invigorating teaching and scholarship with a strong commitment to and understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Such faculty offer unique gifts to students, the university, their discipline, the Church, and society. BYU will continue to encourage and reward high-quality teaching.<br><br>b. Excellent scholarship helps faculty members strengthen their teaching, giving it life, currency, and perspective. All faculty should engage in demanding intellectual activity that satisfies this purpose. Many faculty will also do original scholarly and creative work of such quality that it produces new knowledge, enhances the reputation of BYU and the Church, includes students in superior research projects, and attracts other strong faculty to seek affiliation with us. BYU will continue to encourage and reward high-quality scholarship.<br><br>c. Because disciplines differ and faculty members have diverse gifts and are in varying seasons of their careers, we will accommodate reasonable differences in approach to scholarship among the disciplines and among individual faculty. The degree of appropriate variation in individual faculty assignments increases when one has earned continuing status.<br><br>That concludes the Policy Summary. I now want to invite your support for a few specific points about this year's initiative.<br><h2>Eight Points About This Initiative</h2><br>First, the accreditation process deserves to be taken seriously. American colleges and universities have been criticized more harshly in the last few years than in many prior decades. Former Harvard President Derek Bok has accurately described the primary reason for this criticism: "The public has finally come to believe that our leading universities are not making the education of students [their] top priority." One sign of this inattention to the student experience is that higher education has failed to "examine the effectiveness of [its] educational programs. . . . [U]niversities are eager to do research on every institution except themselves" (Bok, "Reclaiming the Public Trust,"<i>Change,</i>July/August 1992, p. 13). Hence, we are seeing a new national interest in the "assessment" of educational outcomes. This is a new and major component in our own impending accreditation review. Moreover, when they ask about teaching loads, research support, or rising tuitions, the public and many governing boards (including our own) are no longer satisfied with what Bok calls academic "platitudes." Our self-study is an important opportunity to explain and assess our work in substantive and well-documented ways.<br><br>The public's confidence has been further reduced by a few proprietary colleges and other schools that have abused federal student aid programs. As a result, the U.S. Department of Education has recently adopted new guidelines designed ostensibly to regulate such abuse. But the federal approach clearly suggests that the responsibility for accrediting higher education could shift from a private, peer-review process to public governmental regulation. As many educational leaders have noted recently, and we join our voices with theirs, such a shift would be a devastating change in national policy. It would be especially dangerous for Church-related higher education. One way to resist the arguments for this kind of change is to show that higher education can keep its own house in order. Taking accreditation seriously helps to do that.<br><br>As a distinctive university, BYU has nothing to fear from the current approach to its general accreditation. From my experience as a former member of the body that accredits us, I know of the esteem in which our educational program is held. Ours is clearly one of the best-regarded institutions in the entire region. I have also seen firsthand the genuine respect that group holds for our religious nature and affiliation. Those people see BYU as an exemplary source of educational strength, not as a place that needs to apologize for itself. I welcome the chance to verify the soundness of our programs--not only for BYU's sake, but to help demonstrate that higher education can regulate itself.<br><br>Second, we begin this year's process with the enormous advantage of a widely shared general vision about Brigham Young University. For that reason, some parts of the 1994 Policy Summary describe what BYU is<i>not,</i>in addition to describing what it<i>is.</i>Since we can't move in 360 directions at once, restating a few present boundaries that establish our 90-degree quadrant leaves departments and colleges free to develop their own aspirations about the roles they can best play within that preexisting sphere. Knowing what the university<i>won't</i>do allows greater focus for a unit to describe what it<i>will</i>do.<br><br>Third, I ask you to engage this process in ways that move beyond traditional frameworks. One of higher education's serious contemporary challenges is that the boundaries between the disciplines are breaking down, and new approaches are cutting across academic fields with surprising speed. In addition, changes within particular fields are occurring so rapidly that many seasoned faculty have a hard time staying current in their narrow subfields, let along in an entire discipline. Moreover, much of what BYU seeks to do for its students--and for society--extends well beyond specialized boundaries. Departmental faculties simply must think about the broad experiences of our students, whether in inter-disciplinary endeavors, in General Education, in Religious Education, in cocurricular experience, or in the experiences that await them when they leave us and the disciplines keep changing. Only by thinking on this scale will we understand the issues that could persuade us to undertake significant structural change as we organize our future curriculum and academic programs.<br><br>In this regard, if you identify areas of concern during these next few months that clearly call for the involvement of an interdisciplinary or institution-wide task force, you should make a proposal to the Self-Study and Planning Committee. As mentioned earlier, we already plan to organize several task forces on major university issues, and we invite your help in contributing to the work of those groups.<br><br>Fourth, we need to examine not only the content of our programs but also the quality of our basic organizational processes and personal interaction, formal and informal, all across the campus. We can't review every process at once, but we can begin by identifying a few significant process areas, review their history, examine our record, plan for improvements, and then monitor our future progress. Just to take one example, as the Policy Summary suggests, the university has long since assigned high priority to concerns about gender and about men-women relationships. In what I hope will initiate our self-study on these issues, we recently asked the BYU Equal Employment Opportunity Office to summarize all of the recommendations that have been made in the last 20 years by university committees dealing with gender issues. When this summary was completed, we asked for a report on all of the action the university has taken to implement these recommendations during those same two decades. As Carolyn Lloyd-Henrie, Darlene Kelly, and Charleen Cutler helped us review our past record, we learned a great deal that was very helpful to us. Our analysis of this report is not yet completed, but we can already see that an approach of this kind will help us isolate specific needs we want to address.<br><br>A fifth observation--good planning at any level identifies the key current factors in an organization's internal and external environment. For academic departments, these factors include such obvious things as what is happening with student interests, employment markets, the professions, and the academic disciplines. Institutionally, no environmental factor is more important than the historical development of the Church. Much of what we have done for years at BYU grows out of historical assumptions that may not always apply in the future, so we must examine the assumptions on which current programs are based to see if they are still relevant to the Church's future.<br><br>For example, at a time of unprecedented Church growth, our BYU Board of Trustees has determined that it will maintain a 27,000-student enrollment limit here and it will not establish other campuses. As a result, the old Church academy model of educating all the young people who wish to attend a Church college is no longer relevant, not only here but throughout the Church Educational System. For years BYU was able to turn away student applicants who weren't prepared to succeed in university work. But now we must turn away many who are fully prepared, spiritually and academically. This circumstance forces us to clarify the BYU mission. If the Church can have only one university as it enters the 21st century, what kind of university will help the Church most and why? Dean Clayne Pope has argued persuasively that this recent shift from an open university to a restrictive one heightens BYU's symbolic role in demonstrating the consistency between religious faith and intellectual achievement. As Clayne put it, "We cannot fill this role if we are second-rate academically. What symbolic point do we make if we combine faith and second-rate scholarship?" Stated another way, Elder Neal A. Maxwell has stated that a mediocre university cannot help the Church enter the nations of the world the way a superb university can.<br><br>Sixth, I wish to underscore the point made in the Policy Summary that we should be concerned above all with what our students experience here, especially our freshmen. John Tanner and Todd Britsch recently reported to the board of trustees on some initiatives we have been developing here to strengthen our programs for "the freshmen year." You'll be hearing more about that as time goes on. As John described for the board the incredible potential as well as the poignant vulnerability of BYU freshmen, I felt the entire board resonating deeply to our desire to improve the experience of those young men and women on our campus. In what was for me an especially tender moment at the end of this meeting, the Apostle who was called upon to say the closing prayer offered the Lord a heartfelt plea. He said something like this: "Please bless the BYU freshmen. And please bless the faculty and the staff that they will care about the freshmen." I'm thankful that so many of you have caught this same spirit by joining our new freshmen mentoring program this fall and demonstrating what so many have long done so well at BYU in nurturing and reaching out to every student who comes here.<br><br>Seventh, we need to adopt a truly inclusive, comprehensive approach if we are to improve the quality of our teaching, our learning, our scholarship, and our working environment. I don't know where to place this issue in a self-study instrument. It cuts across all the other issues on the list. For some years now I have felt, as I think many of you have, that too many of us at BYU are preoccupied with just one side of several narrowly drawn and often false dichotomies: teaching vs. research, elitism vs. populism, Church values vs. academic values, student interests vs. faculty interests, the interests of the academic areas vs. those of the support areas. After puzzling over the tensions so often created by these arguments and concerns and the claims of mixed institutional messages about them, I believe it will help us if each member of the university community could look beyond his or her self-interested view toward a broader, institutional perspective.<br><br>In a related vein, as we undertake this significant exercise in constructive self-criticism, we must also learn to be both honest critics and loyal critics, rather than believing as some have seemed to do that we must choose between being honest about BYU and being loyal to BYU. Consider these lines from John W. Gardner: "Twentieth-century institutions were caught in a savage cross fire between uncritical lovers and unloving critics. On the one side, those who loved their institutions tended to smother them in the embrace of death, loving their rigidities more than their promise and shielding them from life-giving criticism. On the other side, there arose a breed of critics without love, skilled in demolition but untutored in the arts by which human institutions are nurtured and strengthened and made to flourish." I look forward to a self-examination this year and beyond that is both very honest and very loyal.<br><br>Eighth, we expect this to be an open, participatory process that will significantly influence future decisions. We plan to share with the campus community what is going on at each stage, and we ask each department to engage all its members in the year's discussions. In addition, please know that the administration is deeply committed to using the outcomes from this process in its policy and operational decisions. The administration has taken the initiative on this matter. This isn't something that others are trying to persuade us is worth doing. We think it's worth doing and have thought so for some time. This will not be a hollow exercise.<br><h2>The Spirit of the Army</h2><br>Now a final perspective, not only on the self-study initiative, but on life at BYU in general these days. If I might turn the phrase we heard from this pulpit recently from Justice Sandra Day O'Conner: Now that I've given my talk, I'd like to say something. During the past year or so I have found myself in private conversations with many close BYU friends about the university and its future. Among other things, we have talked about the rumors and the news stories that have swirled around the campus and the Church. One friend captured a common theme of these conversations when he said to me, "All of my professional life I have believed in the possibility and in the blessings of building a truly first-rate university that is fully dedicated to the leadership and the values of the Church. But today I don't know if the idea of BYU can really work."<br><br>He and I exchanged glances that somehow reflected the weight of our both having invested so much of our careers, our time, our means, and our energy in this place we care about so much. Then in various ways we said to one another, I suppose that whether the idea of BYU works is basically up to us, to people like you and like me. The "grand experiment" of which President Hinckley spoke isn't going to happen all by itself. Sometimes it feels like there is some adverse force at work, trying to pull our dreams apart. Perhaps that is because we are often dealing with the contrary elements of a large and powerful paradox--elements in apparent contradiction and natural tension, elements like personal freedom and submission to authority, the life of the mind and the life of the spirit, an educational world colored red and a Church world colored blue. But when we actively wrap our arms around this paradox and lovingly but knowingly hold its forces together in productive equilibrium, the BYU idea works. We have seen it work time after time, and its blessings are worth every ounce of strength it takes to clasp our arms around the dream and hold on to it--if need be, when we "stretch forth [our arms] all the day long" (see Jacob 6:4).<br><br>Not long after this conversation, another friend asked how much I thought the BYU administration could do to hold together our collective paradox. I told him I could see only a modest role for any administration in a university so large and so complex. Then he asked about my confidence in BYU's future, and immediately I saw a connection between his question and a strong impression I had had just the night before. I replied to him with honest serenity that I have never been more optimistic about the future of BYU. And then I described for him the idea that made me feel as I do. Leo Tolstoy called it "the spirit of the army."<br><br>For my late-night escape reading over the last several months I've been enjoying<i>War and Peace.</i>After several nights of following Napoleon's seemingly irresistible advances deep into Russian territory, the part I read the night before I saw my friend described a furious struggle not far from Moscow in which the Russian army battled the French army to what looked at best like a bloody draw. This was the Battle of Borodino, which Tolstoy saw as the turning point of the great 1812 war because it effectively broke the back of Napoleon's army, shifting the overall momentum to favor the Russians.<br><br>When the Russian commander, Kutuzov, was deciding whether to launch a new attack immediately after this battle, Tolstoy wrote about the old general: "When [he listened] to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the words being spoken, but rather in something else--in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting. By long years of military experience [Kutuzov] knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it insofar as that was in his power."<br><br>Both armies had lost thousands of men at Borodino. Kutuzov's top advisors believed the battle was lost, and they pressed him to retreat, as his men had done after every previous encounter with Napoleon. But Kutuzov, informed as much by intuition as by reports from the field, announced his intention to attack the next morning. He sensed that his men knew their backs were against the symbolic wall of Moscow, and he had felt them rally in some profound inner way. So Kutuzov stunned his military strategists with his order to attack the next day: "'[The French] are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of Russia,' said Kutuzov, crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears."<br><br>Then, writes Tolstoy, "[B]y means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper, known as 'the spirit of the army,' and which constitutes the chief sinew of war, Kutuzov's words, his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of the army to the other.<br><br>"It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutuzov had said, but the<i>sense</i>of his words spread everywhere, because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in [his] soul as [it did in the soul] of every other Russian.<br><br>"And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited" (Norton Critical Edition, Maude Translation [New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1966], pp. 898–902).<br><br>Tolstoy's theory of history was that we "must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved" (p. 920). Thus Tolstoy believed it was not superior strategy or charismatic leadership but the all-pervading "simplicity, goodness, and truth" of the Russian people and their army--even amid their weaknesses--that "defeated a power that did not respect simplicity and that acted out of evil and falseness" (p. 1382, commentary by Nikolai Strakhov).<br><br>J. Reuben Clark reflected a similar conviction when he paid tribute to the Mormon pioneers in a classic address given in 1947--the hundreth anniversary of the pioneers' entering the Salt Lake Valley. He spoke of those of "the last wagon," who came to these valleys after 1847: "I would not take away one word of praise from the mighty men [who directed] the conquest of [this] wilderness. [But] the building of this empire was not done in a corner by a select few, but by this vast multitude flowing in from many nations. These humble souls measured to their calling and to their destiny as fully as Brother Brigham and the others measured to theirs, and God will so reward them."<br><br>The pioneers had the spirit of the army. So do the faculty, the staff, and the students who are here and now coming to BYU--not just selected, but also self-selected, from among the Saints of the Most High all across the globe, moved by a heavenly power to gather to this educational Zion. Recently a non-LDS professor from a Japanese university spent a week on this campus, talking with, eating with, and watching our students and our faculty. As he left here he said to me, "I have never seen such a place. I must know the mystery behind all their shining eyes." That mystery is the spirit of the army of Israel, a spirit of simplicity, goodness, and truth that animates this community every day. Those who criticize the Latter-day Saints for blindly following their leaders have no idea about the origin and meaning of this spirit. They simply cannot understand that those shining eyes are not "the outcome of cunning calculations" but are the fruits of intensely personal convictions developed through thousands of private stories and struggles.<br><br>When I read Tolstoy that late evening, I sensed that his description of the spirit of the army was a description of the BYU community, and I thanked God for my association with you. And when my friend asked me the next day for my feelings about BYU's future, what I had read the night before rushed back to me. He probably wondered why I was so moved. My enormous confidence in the future of this place derives from my confidence in the individuals who form this community. As was always true at BYU, the most important things that happen here are not just the visible events and speeches; they also include the private, even sacred, experiences of individuals, often in interaction with one or two other people: moments of discovery, moments of meaning, moments of love.<br><br>Now that doesn't mean that leadership is irrelevant at BYU--of course we need our leaders' guidance. We need their support and institutional judgments. Especially from our board of trustees we need Church perspectives and divine revelation. But one of a leader's primary tasks at BYU, I believe, is to be worthy of, to watch, to guide, and to sustain the spirit of the army--"insofar as that is within his [or her] power." The new self-study project is just one way of trying to do that. I want you to know that I can understand and feel myself at times the mild skepticism that others feel about the limitations of organizational jargon and planning projects. But I am not skeptical about the ultimate purpose and opportunity of this process, which is to help build a better BYU, a place that is worthy of its association with the Latter-day Saints and the kingdom of God.<br><br>Whether the subject is strategic planning or some other institutional need, I agree with Tolstoy that "the differential of history" consists in "the individual tendencies of men" and women. And it is only in "finding the sum of these infinitesimals" that we will ever discover the community's sense of direction (p. 918). Thus, in our self-study or anything else, nothing matters more to me than simply discerning, developing, and wisely supporting the collective vision of BYU that already lies embedded within each of our souls. That was Kutuzov's hope, and it is mine.<br><br>We will always be buffeted by our communications failures, our personal weaknesses, and the influence of those who misunderstand what we're trying to build here. But, brothers and sisters, there really is a spirit that connects us. It is a powerful, deep, brooding, elevating spirit; and it is worth whatever effort it takes to discern and nourish it. I can't imagine Tolstoy's notion of the spirit of the army ever meaning more than it means right here. And when I consider everything I know about the sum of the personal parts of this community, I feel like singing for joy: "Hope of Israel, Zion's army, children of the promised day!"<br><br>When those familiar words come to mind, I also remember another source of support for whatever we try to do at BYU in righteousness--the spirit of that army that bolsters us from beyond the veil. You will recall the frightened young servant who asked Elisha, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?" And Elisha answered, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:15–17).<br><br>Who are those horsemen? When do they come, and where do they go? Would they support the spirit of the army at BYU? They must not be very far away, for they have come again in the modern age. Not long before the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith's scribe saw "in a vision, the armies of heaven protecting the Saints in their return to Zion." The next day, the heavens were opened to Elder Sylvester Smith, and he exclaimed, "The horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof" (<i>History of the Church</i>2:381, 383).<br><br>I testify that as long as we individually with all our might hold the dream of BYU together in our arms, in simplicity, goodness, and truth, then in our personal lives and in the life of this community, the spirit of the armies of heaven will always be with us. Perhaps in part through them, may the Lord always "give us strength according to our faith" (Alma 14:26). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>est and Mt. Zion: BYU in the 1990&#039;s - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am so pleased to be with you this morning, and I extend to each of you my warmest welcome as we begin an exciting new school year. I have learned from our friends in Hawaii that the single word that expresses it best is "aloha," a greeting which I extend to everyone, especially those who join us this year for the first time. I also understand that the word means both hello and goodbye. Accordingly, I extend a warm welcoming aloha to our two newest vice presidents, Alton Wade and Brad Farnsworth, and a fond farewell aloha to Dee Andersen and Ron Hyde, who have been wonderful colleagues and will always be dear friends. And just on the off chance that aloha also means "I look forward to working with you in your new responsibilities, especially as we undertake a capital campaign," I will bid a fourth aloha to R. J. Snow.<br><br>Over this past summer I have found myself reflecting on the fact that as president of BYU I have been doing things for the sixth time. For example, I have attended my sixth annual meeting of the Western Athletic Conference Presidents' Council, ridden in my sixth Fourth of July parade, participated in my sixth August graduation, and now I'm doing the single most important thing that I do during the sixth or any other year: address the faculty, staff, and administration of the university in our annual fall conference assembly. Because it is the most important talk I give each year, it is also the one responsibility over which I agonize most acutely.<br><br>In many ways, it really doesn't seem like five years have gone by since I assumed my current employment. I have enjoyed it far more than I ever thought I would. There are aspects of what I do that if I had any choice I would do without, but those occupy only a small part of the complete package, and, on the whole, I love my job, I love the institution we serve, and I love the people with whom I work (which includes all of you).<br><br>At the outset, I want to pay particular tribute to two groups of people. They have quite different responsibilities, but they share one characteristic in common: We often take for granted and even overlook the indispensable importance of what they do for our university and for us as individuals.<br><br>The first group to whom I refer are the members of our board of trustees. With each passing year I have come to love and admire them more. I appreciate their devotion to Brigham Young University and the great trust that they place in us as individuals and in and in our exercise of the stewardship they have given us. They are men and women who understand the challenges of higher education generally--particularly the unique opportunities that we enjoy at this university--and who are dedicated to working with us in a united effort to take maximum advantage of these opportunities. It has been a personal privilege for me to work closely with, and do my best to implement policies crafted by, those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. They are people who care deeply, who strive diligently, whose efforts have directly contributed to the significant progress of recent years, and who have great confidence in us as we work together with them in what President Hinckley so aptly characterized as this grand "Experiment" at BYU.<br><br>The second group I single out for particular tribute and appreciation are the members of our supporting staff. I want you to know how much I appreciate, both personally and also on behalf of the university, the many extra-mile services that you so effectively render. Our business is the business of education, and we sometimes tend to think of that in terms of what goes on in the classroom. Such a focus is not only too narrow, it is also simply wrong.<br><br>What we do here in attempting to educate our students in an environment of great faith involves a total effort by all of us, and just as Paul observed about the indispensability and inseparability of the various parts of the body, so it is also true that our university could not function without the efforts of all of us. None is more important than the others. I agree with Commissioner Henry B. Eyring that everyone among us is a teacher. And so to those of you who type our letters and scholarly papers, maintain our grounds, prepare our food, repair and maintain our buildings, clean our offices, keep us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and safe during all seasons, pay our bills, issue our traffic citations, prepare our paychecks, and perform the myriad other tasks without which the classroom and scholarly effort could not go forth, I say, on behalf of all faculty members and administrators: Thank you. And thank you particularly for being here this morning. I do not overlook the importance of what you do, and I invite all those who benefit every day from the services of our staff and auxiliary workers to join with me in expressing appreciation.<br><br>The end of five years seems like an appropriate time to attempt to put a few things in historical perspective, looking back over the past five years and also looking forward toward what our aspirations and efforts should be for the next five years and beyond.<br><br>About seven months into this five-year period, in February of 1990, I went through a couple of weeks during which I seriously feared that I might not complete even one year. Would that I could have known then what I know now: the lymphoma that I have is not a recurrence of the earlier one, but a very indolent form that can be controlled. In my case it not only has been controlled, but is probably under better control than at any time since first discovered. During our last visit, my principal oncologist in Chicago told me that he looked forward to celebrating my 75th birthday with me. I told him I thought that was a perfectly plausible suggestion, since he is in his midforties and appears to be in good health.<br><br>My other physical challenge is a source of irritation and some discomfort but poses no threat either to my life or my ability to perform my responsibilities as your president. I want to give a brief explanation to those of you who are not aware of what it is, because when you observe some of its symptoms, I want you not to be unduly concerned.<br><br>It is called peripheral neuropathy, which means a damage to the nerves in my arms and legs. I can no longer run. I have to walk a bit more slowly and deliberately, especially when I first stand after I have been sitting. The neuropathy is accompanied by some pain, which for some reason that no one can explain, is positional. When I stand, I feel practically no pain. Accordingly, when you and I are in a meeting and you see me stand, don't automatically assume that I do so in disagreement with what you say, I may in fact disagree, but if so I will find some other way to express it.<br><br>There have actually been some positive aspects to go along with the aggravations of this neuropathy, as several realities have come into sharper perspective for me. I am now very conscious of and grateful for the fact that for 57 years I had two normal legs that carried me along some of the world's most beautiful running paths and through 13 marathons, and that for 52 years I enjoyed practically perfect health. To be sure, I wish that I could still bound up the stairs three steps at a time, or run with Janet and my children along the Provo River on a Saturday morning. But far more important is the fact that whereas if I were a dentist, or an architect, or practiced any one of a majority or the physician specialties, or any other calling that required any extensive or specialized use of my hands or legs, I would be unemployed. And that is something that would be much more difficult for me to accept right now than the fact that I will never run another marathon. The only conceivable way that my present employment, which I dearly love, is affected by peripheral neuropathy is that it now takes me about 45 seconds longer to walk from the Smoot Building to the Wilkinson Center. Best of all, whatever its effects, this neuropathy has no potential to affect the real me, which remains very much intact. And what do I mean by the real me? The person who believes, feels, thinks, speaks, makes decisions, travels, and loves life and the work in which I am presently engaged.<br><br>Many of you who have known of my neuropathy have asked if there is anything you can do to help. I have appreciated the offer, because it shows that you care. And, as a matter of fact, there is something you can do to help. I want nothing more than for the balance of this decade, which also happens to be the balance of the 20th century, to be the best years that BYU has ever had. For reasons I will discuss in more detail, I have every confidence that they can, should, and probably will be the best years of our first 125. And nothing would help me personally--both physically and otherwise--quite like seeing us achieve such a standard of excellence in our citizenship, our teaching, our scholarship, our support services, and in everything we do.<br><br>Let me turn, then, to some specific ways in which I think we can make these next few years the best in BYU's history.<br><br>When I refer to our history, I am sobered by the realization that the period of my own association with this place covers more than a third of our total years from Warren Dusenberry to 1994. There are many differences between today's BYU and the on in which I enrolled as a freshman living in converted army barracks known as the "D" dorms in the fall of 1953.<br><br>While in most respects this is a much better university than the one in which I enrolled four decades ago, there are some parts of the BYU of the 1950s that I wish we could bring back. And there is one of them that we are in fact going to make a major effort to revive during this coming year. We invite your participation in that effort, because without your participation, it will not succeed. It has to do with our attendance at devotionals and forums. For those of you who were not here during those earlier times, let me tell you how it was in "the good ol' days." Two principal features are relevant.<br><br>The first is the regularity with which those assemblies were held. Every Tuesday at the same hour, I believe it was 10 a.m., we held a devotional or forum assembly. And the second feature was, I think, at least partially attributable to this regularity. The great majority of us--students, faculty, staff, everyone--simply assumed that attendance at these devotionals and forums was what we did at that particular hour every week. When a devotional or a forum was held, we were there in attendance at the Fieldhouse. I can see now in retrospect even more clearly than I could at the time that there were some significant benefits to the university and its people beyond the most obvious and important one, the substantive spiritual and intellectual development that we gained from the content of those addresses. It gave us a sense of community, a sense of belonging. In addition to being members of a ward or a social unit, and students sharing majors in a particular department, we were also participants in, and even owners of, the entire larger enterprise, Brigham Young University. I recognize that that sense of university community is not absent from the BYU of the 1990s. It is here, stronger than at most other universities, and probably stronger than at any other of our size. But it is not what it used to be. More importantly, it is not what it can be. We are convinced that one of the most important things we can do to strengthen this sense of oneness that reaches across 27,000 students and 5,000 faculty and staff is to join together in greater numbers and with greater purpose in the only university-wide events under university sponsorship, our devotional and forum assemblies.<br><br>As you know, in recent months we have broadened our devotional program to include campus devotionals, featuring members of our own faculty, with each particular campus devotional sponsored by the college from which the speakers comes. They are held in the de Jong Concert Hall. Like the university devotionals and forums, of which there are five or six a semester held here in the Marriott Center, these campus devotionals have been held Tuesdays at 11 a.m. We have been very pleased with them, and we plan not only to continue them, but also to expand their number. The result will be that when combined with the forums and university devotionals held in the Marriott Center, and a few other programs of selected interest, we will meet as an entire university every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Our hope is that across the entire campus, all of us will simply come to assume that the thing to do--and what we in fact do--every Tuesday at 11 a.m. is to attend the devotional or forum or other program that is being offered that week.<br><br>If the effort is to be successful, more will be required than simply regularizing the schedule. There are things that every one of us can do, but the key players will be the faculty. There are so many ways that those who teach our classes can enhance not only the attendance at these events, but also the quality of the learning experiences they offer. Some of you are already doing some things that I would like to see become much more widespread. For example, there are some of you who assign students to attend the devotionals and forums and to report on what was said, including their reactions and responses. Others of you have made arrangements to attend the devotionals with your students.<br><br>Most of you will be serving this year as faculty mentors for a small number of students. This faculty mentor program, in my opinion, will be highly beneficial to our freshman students in so many respects, including, principally, helping them to adjust to a new life at BYU. I hope that you will include these students for whom you serve as mentor in your plans to attend forums and devotionals.<br><br>Different ones of you may elect different approaches, whether attending with your classes, attending with the students you mentor, making assignments for reports, or some other. But whatever the method, I hope that every one of us will do something that will involve not just our own attendance, but our students' as well.<br><br>Over the coming year I would like to hear from you concerning your efforts to improve our forum and devotional attendance. Nothing would please me more than to receive so many reports that it becomes difficult for me to respond to each. The first of these Tuesday-at-11:00 a.m.-events will be on September 6, which will feature a special performance by the Young Ambassadors in the de Jong Concert Hall. The following week, September 13, will be our first university devotional.<br><br>Last year the subject to which I gave most attention in this address was our effort to enhance the quality of our students' learning by assisting them in their efforts to graduate in four years. I reviewed a variety of initiatives to be pursued during the 1993–94 school year, most of which involved nonfinancial efforts. I also reviewed some possible financial reforms. Under the general leadership of John Tanner, and with cooperation from the faculty that can only be described as remarkable, very impressive progress has been made over the ensuing 12 months. This has included curricular reform; mandatory counseling, including the filing of graduation plans for students in certain categories; articulation agreements with certain feeder schools; increasing the number of sections of certain required courses after the existing sections have been filled during the registration process; and increased scholarships for students attending spring and summer. And for the coming year our spring/summer tuition will be reduced by 27.5 percent. It will be the most extraordinary tuition change in BYU's history.<br><br>One common feature of several of these initiatives involves an attempt to shift more of our students and more of our classes into the spring/summer terms, when we are well below the 27,000 limit, and away from the fall/winter semesters, when our airplane is full. I fully expect another quantum increase in this respect during this coming school year because of the tuition decrease. This will necessarily require some planning on our part and yours, as well as a certain amount of guesswork and good luck as we anticipate the degree of those increases and the consequent surge in the required number of course offerings and teachers. We have already seen some results from the graduation initiative. For example, the average number of semesters for our April and August graduates has declined from just under 12 semesters to just over 11. I strongly doubt that these results are pure coincidence. And most of our positive effect surely lie ahead of us, because most of the steps we have taken will require more than a year to yield their results.<br><br>Our efforts to improve our graduation time will, of course, continue over the coming year, as will several other efforts presently underway. May I now devote the rest of my time to discussing two initiatives that are new this year. While each of them has been on the drawing boards for three or four years and is the product of substantial previous investment, each was actually launched during 1994; the coming school year will mark the first full 12-month term for each. The two are related in that each involves an attempt to achieve objectives that will last beyond our present decade. One of them, the capital campaign, will involve substantial numbers of us. The other, our strategic long-range planning, will involve virtually all of us--staff, faculty, administrators, everybody. I would like to discuss our long-range planning first.<br><h2><b>Long-Range Planning</b></h2><br>Our every common sense instinct tells us that long-range planning is something that has to be done and that it is especially crucial for an organization as complex, as resource-consumptive, and as diverse from one department to another as is our university. Actually, to one degree or another, we all do strategic planning. Whether consciously or unconsciously, we do it for ourselves personally, for our families, and for our employment. We pay attention not only to what is happening here and now, but also what the future may hold and what we can do now to make our future better. Equally clearly, long-range planning works better if it is done systematically and is itself the result of a planned effort.<br><br>As obvious as are the need and potential benefits, carrying it out is not always correspondingly simple. Many times adjustments have to be made to the original plans in light of subsequent events. Let me give you two examples that illustrate the point, one taken from the early history of our country, and the other from my own personal history.<br><br>In the early part of the 16th century, there was a map (prepared initially by Spanish cartographers) that was used throughout Europe. It portrayed California as an island, and, indeed, labeled that part of the Americas as the Island of California. Here is a copy of that map. [slide] It was widely used and regarded as unquestionably authentic. With each passing year, the degree of its assumed authenticity increased. The cartographers who developed the map relied on two established facts. One was that Spanish navigators had sailed up what we now refer to as the Gulf of California for many miles and found no end point. Similarly, other navigators had sailed down Puget Sound with similar results: no end in sight. The logical conclusion: California was an island. Accordingly, when the time came for inland exploration from California, the explorers concluded that of course they would have to carry with them necessary materials and equipment to build a ship. The absolutely amazing part of the story, as I heard it from Peter Schwartz, an expert on long-range planning and author of a book called<i>The Art of the Long View,</i>is that when the explorers--after having carried all those tons of extra weight across the Sierras and into the desert--sent word back to Spain that the map was wrong, the response was that the map was not wrong. It had been in existence for many years, and it was therefore the explorers who erred.<br><br>The other example is my own. Undoubtedly, all of us engage in some form of personal long-range planning, and I am no exception. Once I finished law school and a one-year judicial clerkship, I laid out for myself a broad, general long-range plan: I would practice law in Phoenix, raise my family in Tempe, serve the Lord in whatever capacity I could, and be active in Arizona political and civic matters. That plan worked for eight years. Since then I have had four separate and quite different professional experiences, two of them here at BYU and two at the United States Department of Justice. Each of the four, standing alone, has been more fulfilling and more interesting than anything that was included in my 1964 personal long-range plan. And in 1964 I had no way of knowing that events might lead to any of those opportunities.<br><br>The message that evolves from each of these examples is not that long-range planning doesn't work or is something not to be undertaken because the costs outweigh the benefits. Quite the contrary. Strategic planning is not only a good idea, we all do it--it will happen. The only real issue is whether we do it consciously and systematically, devoting to it the amount of time, attention, and other resources that it deserves because of its potential benefits. But it is necessarily iterative. It must include the ability to adapt to new facts and new circumstances as they develop, and will necessarily involve much dialogue and broad participation. Indeed, the process itself will be a principal source of such new information.<br><br>Many details of BYU's long-range plan, including the background out of which it arose and how we intend to implement it, have been reviewed by our provost; have been matters of discussion with vice presidents, executive directors, and deans this past week; and will be discussed with the faculty tomorrow morning and with department chairs tomorrow afternoon. To those discussions let me offer a few additional thoughts.<br><br>1. My first observation is that nothing is more important to the university than to plan today for what we want to be in the future, and what it will take to get us there. The initiatives that are already underway, such as the efforts to improve our graduation time and our capital campaign, have not only been important preparation for, but will also become part of, the long-term planning effort we now begin. Already completed projects, such as our academic freedom statement and our standards for employment and for promotion and tenure, are established premises on which we will build our long-range planning discussions and work.<br><br>2. Two years from now, 1996, is the year of our decennial accreditation inspection, in connection with which we are required to prepare an institutional self-study. That self-study will be integrated with our strategic planning, and certain efficiencies will be achieved by combining the two. We want to emphasize, however, that our long-range planning will not end in 1996, and the accreditation self-study is only a part of the larger whole. And 1996 is also the target date for beginning to reflect the institutional priorities developed through our planning efforts in our budget planning, preparation, and submission.<br><br>3. What we are dealing with here is not an undertaking by the university administration, but by every one of us, faculty, staff, and administration. And the success of the endeavor depends on our recognition of that fact. The premise from which the entire effort must proceed is that each of us will participate in the process, and each will benefit from its results. The process will involve three basic phases: assessing what we have become; determining where we want to be in the next five years to ten years and deriving criteria for achieving those goals; and applying those criteria to our critical decisions. We need to be thinking now and planning for the future with regard to such important issues as, for example, (a) how we allocate our 27,000 admissions slots to maximize our ability to provide a better education and better serve the worldwide kingdom; (b) how we can, through our continuing educations efforts and otherwise, extend BYU's influence and blessings beyond our two campuses; and (c) what we ought to do to assure that our capacity and understanding regarding non-English languages and non-American cultures fit more beneficially within the broader Church that is expanding so rapidly, so broadly, and so effectively throughout the world. We are not a Utah university, and our sponsor is neither a Utah nor an American church. How can we more effectively join our boxcar to the Church's international train? These are only examples. It will not be easy, but if we do it right the benefits will far outweigh the costs. It was Abraham Lincoln who said, "I will prepare myself, and when the time comes I will be ready."<br><br>4. This strategic planning initiative necessarily deals with the kinds of issues concerning which the members of our board of trustees are not only intensely interested, they also must make the final decisions. Accordingly, throughout its entire course, the board will be involved in this process. In the meetings to be held tomorrow with the faculty and department chairs, you will be given further details concerning the timetable for involvement by the board and others.<br><br>5. If we succeed in this effort, one of the results will be that by the turn of the century our resources will match up better with where we as a university and each of our constituent units have unitedly determined we want to go. Much of the important realignment of resources with carefully specified and articulated goals will occur within departments and comparable administrative units. That is, the realignment will be<i>internal.</i>While there are important institution-wide elements in the planning process, we are inviting each of you in your respective departments and administrative units to clarify objectives and to use the resources--human and financial--now available to you to advance those purposes and objectives. At the university level, we intend to enhance intradepartmental reallocations. We will invest in programs, activities, and areas consistent with university-wide priorities where there is the promise of the greatest payoff for our students and where we can best advance our long-range goals and purposes. Some of the resources for these enhancements will come from reallocations within the overall university budget. But we are also launching a capital campaign, concerning which I will have more to say in a moment, whose purpose is to make funds available to advance clearly articulated institutional priorities.<br><br>6. There are some important linkages between our strategic planning initiative and our capital campaign. One is that the development of our capital campaign priorities was itself an example of classic long-range planning, and those priorities should figure prominently in our strategic planning. Moreover, during the silent phase of the campaign, which I will describe in just a moment, we will clarify and solidify those priorities through further planning efforts that will involve many of you and will be part of our total strategic planning. And the "public phase," which I will also discuss in a moment, is scheduled to begin after this year's self-study, whose planning efforts will have further clarified our institutional priorities. Thus, the timing between the public phase and the completion of our statement of priorities should coincide quite nicely. Finally, the funds that we will raise during the campaign will be important in enabling us to implement the strategic plan we develop.<br><h2><b>Capital Campaign</b></h2><br>I turn, then, to a discussion of our capital campaign. Planning for this campaign began a little over three years ago, when Ron Hyde and Dennis Thomson interviewed the leadership in each college in order to prepare what we called a financial needs assessment. The purpose of that assessment was to ascertain how, where, and for what purposes additional funds could be most effectively utilized if such funds were available. It is not surprising that the total amount of money which would have been necessary to satisfy that initial needs assessment far exceeded our fund-raising capacity. Accordingly, the next step involved determining which of those needs had greatest priority, in order to bring the total figure within our reasonable reach.<br><br>The priorities that emerged were tested by independent consultants, through extensive and intensive interviews that they conducted last summer and fall. Based on their study, they advised that a properly conducted campaign over the six remaining years of this decade could feasibly raise over $200 million. And that is our goal. It is, by some margin, the largest such campaign ever undertaken at BYU. With commensurate substantial benefits, both over the near term and into the next century. We project that over the six-year period some 325,000 donors will contribute. Over half of the funds will come from less than 50 of those people, but participation by all of the larger number will be essential. Particularly important, in my view, will be the participation by every one of us. I hope that through our Together for Greatness contributions and otherwise we will lead the way, if not in the size of our gifts, at least in our willingness to make a sacrificial participation. Beginning with this year, the opening year of the capital campaign, I plan to increase my own Together for Greatness contribution, and I invite each of you, in light of your own particular circumstances, to consider doing the same. I am convinced that a significant increase this year in our Together for Greatness contributions will yield returns far beyond the amount of those increases, because other donors will be impressed by the fact that we are leading the way toward the success of this campaign.<br><br>For the next two years, sometimes called the "silent phase" of the campaign, we will concentrate on large "lead" gifts and on planning for the second phase, sometimes called the "public phase." We will publicly announce this second phase in 1996, at which time we will begin our concentration on larger numbers of people. I felt it appropriate to share with you today information about the campaign even though we are still in the preliminary silent phase, because many of you will be involved in the planning and other activities that will occur over that time, and also because I want all of our BYU community to have a knowledge now of this campaign that will affect all of us in such important ways.<br><br>The campaign priorities include three broad categories: (1) teaching more students, (2) enhancing our educational quality, and (3) securing future opportunities. The first relates to our graduation initiative. Most of the steps that need to be taken in this respect involve nonfinancial efforts as discussed earlier. But there are also some ways in which additional funds can help, including financial aid to students, particularly those who are willing to attend spring and summer; additional faculty and other teaching resources necessary to accommodate anticipated increases in spring/summer loads; and an increase in the number of high-demand General Education sections. It came as no surprise that our consultants' study revealed that the areas of gift opportunities that drew the most enthusiastic comments were those projects that would increase access for more students to the BYU experience.<br><br>The second priority category, improving the quality of our teaching and generally enhancing the value of our educational offering, includes such things as our library expansion, building BYU's primary role as a superior teaching institution, supporting faculty scholarship that enhances teaching and serves Church interests, endowing operation of the Museum of Art, and extending practical and supplementary education to the members of the Church through distance learning and opportunities.<br><br>The third category--securing future opportunities--includes building our endowment and enhancing our international mission. Very simply, the gap between our potential and what we have done is probably greater with regard to our international opportunities than in any other area. Because of the extensive language capacity of our students, and because of our sponsorship by a Church that is expanding so rapidly into so many areas of the world, international opportunities constitute our great potential comparative advantage, and to date we have only scratched its surface. In this area as in others, our capital campaign should enhance our capacity to come closer to realizing our potential.<br><br>Through the course of this six-year campaign, we should all keep in mind three general considerations.<br><br>First, as we will be explaining to each of the deans in individual meetings, every college should participate in and benefit from this campaign. Some of the specific priority subcategories pertain to particular colleges, such as the Religious Studies Center, the Center for Studies of the Family, the Center for Entrepreneurship, the Institute for Language Studies, and scholarships for students committed to teaching as a career. Others, such as funds for the Faculty Center, the libraries, and the Museum of Art, are committed for particular purposes, but their benefits will be felt throughout the entire university, affecting every college. But the most important point to note is that over half of the funds to be raised have not been earmarked for any particular college or department. An important part of the planning process that will take place over the next two years will involve consultation with the deans and others concerning how each college, and the programs in those colleges, will be involved in and can benefit from our capital campaign.<br><br>Second, not all of the funds from this campaign will be available either immediately or even at the end of six years. The principal reason is that many of these donations will be in the form of deferred gifts. That is, while the obligation is fixed and vested, the receipt of the proceeds will be deferred until the occurrence of some future event.<br><br>Finally, if it is to succeed, the entire effort must be carefully coordinated and confined to the stated campaign priorities or to those few additional needs that may arise during the course of the campaign for which a compelling case can be made for a midcampaign adjustment to the priorities. Experience and common sense teach that the effort must be a unified one, which does not permit independent, non-coordinated efforts by particular units within the university. In short, over the next six years, if anyone at BYU is going to raise money, it must be done as part of the capital campaign.<br><br>Both of these initiatives, our strategic planning effort and our capital campaign, have as their principal and common objective to bring us to the kind of university that we want to become and that we can become. May I close with just a couple of general thoughts concerning the university for which we strive.<br><br>An article in a recent edition of the<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>discussed the renewed interest in and debate over whether religion has any role to play in higher education. Relevant to that issue, George Marsden, professor of history at Notre Dame, in an article entitled "Pluralism, Yes. Religion, No!" recounts a conversation with a political scientist who opined that "if a professor proposed to study something from a Catholic or Protestant point of view, it would be treated like proposing something from a Martian point of view." Professor Marsden then expresses his own contrasting opinion:<br><br><i>One of the great strengths of American academic life is its diversity of opinion. Unfortunately, with respect to religion in academia, "pluralism" and "diversity" have become code words for their opposite--exclusion and uniformity. While universities say they welcome diverse cultures, they do not welcome the distinctly religious dimensions of those cultures.</i><br><br>There is, of course, no question where we come down on that debate over the value of religion in higher education. And we have much that we can contribute, precisely because our religion is different. We are unalterably committed to carrying out our conviction that not only are faith and intellect not mutual antagonists, they are synergistic. Each provides a source of knowledge and a means of learning.<br><br>We have not and we will not depart from President Kimball's great vision stated in his Second Century address that among universities BYU must become a Mount Everest. That does not mean, of course, that our mountain will look exactly like everyone else's. Most importantly, our mountain must include not only elements of Mount Everest, but also Mount Zion. Mount Everest is notable because of its height and size, things we can measure, things that the world can see, and things that the world recognizes. Mount Zion is distinctive because of the nobility of the hearts and souls of people who live there. The two are not inconsistent, and each is important. They complement each other nicely, and that is what makes our university both unique and valuable.<br><br>The first sentence of our mission statement proclaims that our mission is "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." The second sentence further clarifies that "that assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued." I am convinced that our ability to accomplish these objectives and more generally to contribute to the building of the kingdom in ways that we are uniquely qualified to offer is directly proportionate to our establishing ourselves as an excellent university, measured by the same rigorous standards applicable to all good universities. And it is just as clear that if we concentrate only on those objectives important to other universities, we will have sacrificed our unique opportunity to contribute to the restored gospel and to American higher education and indeed will have given up our very reason for being. If we are to do our job right, we must be both competent and faithful. Neither alone is sufficient.<br><br>What wonderful years lie ahead of us. I think that never in my life have I been quite as excited and enthused as I am right now about what lies ahead, both for me personally and for the institution with which I am affiliated. The excitement reaches across a broad range of things that I see on our horizon carrying such large potential for the future of our university. And because the future promise for our university is so significant, it is equally significant for the broader restored kingdom of which we are an integral part. The years to come will be years of strategic planning, of a capital campaign that will help bring to reality key aspects of that planning--years in which we will continue to build on established accomplishments of the past and years in which we will increase the number of students we an admit each year while still working within our 27,000 student enrollment cap.<br><br>There is so much good that we can do for our students, for our Heavenly Father's children throughout the world, and for ourselves in our efforts to achieve eternal life. We cannot realize those potentials unless we are very good at what we do--good teachers, good scholars, good in carrying out our support services, and totally dedicated to the principles of the Restoration and the integration of those principles into everything we do. I hope that you share my excitement and my enthusiasm for the task as we come closer to Mount Everest and Mount Zion. That the Lord himself may be our partner in this effort, that he may in fact, in the words of Alma, "give us strength according to our faith," is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was the president of Brigham Young University when this Annual University Conference address was delivered on 22 August 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ce, Charity, and the University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Speaking to the faculty always frightens me, and so I have approached this task with the technique that I almost always use when I am scared--by putting it off. Thus, as always, you will hear thoughts that have been put together at the last moment. But the topic I will address has occupied my mind a good deal for the past year. It has been stimulated by events in my personal life that have required me to think quite soberly about how I spend my time and about my association with Brigham Young University. Because my personal experiences have stimulated my reflections, this talk will refer to these events. I apologize for this approach, but it is the only way that I can get to some of the things that I want to say. Moreover, much of the tone of these remarks will be somewhat like a Church address, but I assure you that even my high council talks are a bit more coherent than this is going to be.<br><br>Last year, just as we were beginning our fall semester, my father discovered that he had cancer. His surgery, in September, was followed within about six weeks by the deaths of our son and my mother-in-law. Then, in early July, weakened by his struggle with his lymphoma and its treatment, Dad's heart and other organs quit functioning, and he too passed away. In experiencing these losses, I joined many of you who have undergone sorrow and struggles in recent times. For me, these events forced a reexamination of much of what I do, including my professional life. Also, in very different ways, I associate each of those I lost with BYU. If I may be allowed to use my experiences in a somewhat paradigmatic way, I would like to talk about some of the principles that I think really matter at BYU and then discuss some specific issues within the context of these principles.<br><br>My mother-in-law, Alicia Crofts, was one who never would have allowed herself even to dream about attending college. She walked across Salt Lake City to attend West High School because there was a commercial program there, and employment in an office was all she hoped for. But when her four daughters reached college age, she and her husband made sure that they could all attend here. The girls' graduation tassels still decorate their parents' bedsteads. After moving to Utah, Alicia became a BYU sports fan, experiencing genuine sorrow when we lost--even though she had no interest in sports. But BYU was her university, and she celebrated every triumph and mourned every setback.<br><br>My dad, on the other hand, did study here--transferring after two years at Snow College. Except for a few years teaching high school, he spent the rest of his life at BYU. In his early days on the faculty, Dad taught four or five composition classes per quarter. Some of my earliest memories are of him sitting at a card table in the middle of the living room, red pencil in hand, going through immense stacks of what he then called "themes." And he never really recovered financially from the $1,500-per-year salary that he began with; he was near 80 when he first owned his home outright. But he could not understand anyone who did not think that working for BYU was the greatest privilege in the world. He showed no interest or amusement when I would tell him of job offerings in the<i>Chronicle of Higher Education.</i>Across more than 60 years, BYU was his true vocation.<br><br>Like these two fine, devoted people, I too have a passion for Brigham Young University. I have a deep desire for it to be excellent, for everything about it to be exemplary. But as I have been forced by circumstances to think beyond football victories, academic prizes, important publications, or brilliant lectures, I have returned to the conviction that for BYU to be excellent, it must first be good. That is, that we will never maintain or improve any important standard of academic achievement if we do not first attain the Lord's standards of virtue. This also implies that we must do what would be shocking to many other institutions: acknowledge the Lord's hand in all of our accomplishments. Ultimately, I am convinced that our value as a university is dependent on our capacity to live together in charity.<br><br>Three times in the scriptures, in the 12th chapter of 1 Corinthians, in the 10th chapter of Moroni, and in the 46th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord's servants give us a list of the gifts of the Spirit. In each case, God makes it clear that no one of us will receive all of the gifts. In the Doctrine and Covenants version we read: "For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby" (46:11–12). What is clearly indicated here is that if we wish to enjoy all of the gifts of the Spirit, we will have to receive them through each other. Thus Paul continues his discussion of these gifts with his famous analogy of the Church as one body, and he reminds us: "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" (1 Corinthians 12:21).<br><br>On a number of occasions, yesterday included, our leaders have likened the university to this same body. I believe that this comparison is apt. As I have had increasing opportunity to become acquainted with the incredibly complex diversity of just the academic operations of this institution, I have come to believe that we simply would be incapable of functioning if we did not acknowledge each other's unique contributions to the whole body. We will benefit from all gifts as we take advantage of what each can offer.<br><br>But Paul extends his discussion of spiritual gifts with the following: "But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31). It is interesting that Paul has just enumerated such gifts as tongues, prophecy, miracles, and healing, and instructed us to all benefit from and share them, yet he tells us that greater excellence must be sought in another way. This way, of course, is charity. Paul makes it clear that having even the greatest gifts is insufficient if we are lacking in the basic quality of love. (The Greek word for "charity" in the Nestle edition is<i>agape,</i>which is translated most other places as "love." Mormon extends the concept to the "pure love of Christ" [Moroni 7:47].) In 1 Corinthians we read of the characteristics that make charity more excellent than even the greatest spiritual gifts: "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things" (1 Corinthians 13:4–7). As I reflect on these characteristics of charity they do not seem to match well with those of most universities I have known. Although some of the greatest scholars in my experience were people of profound kindness and humility, such virtues are not generally associated with the best-known institutions of higher education. But I believe that if BYU is to become excellent it must be the Lord's, and that if BYU is to be the Lord's we must be that in his own way. I am convinced that even if we had unlimited resources we could not go out and purchase the excellence that the Lord wants. Instead, I believe that he would wish us to become great by becoming one in charity. In saying this I do not wish to imply in the slightest diminution of rigor. Discipleship demands discipline, and I fear that too often when we talk of not doing something the world's way we are really asking to be evaluated by some lower standard. But despite this caveat, I believe that our excellence will closely parallel our capacity to develop charitable relations with our students and colleagues.<br><br>Since I have had the opportunity to look at the structure of our institution from a college- or university-wide basis, I have been able to identify a few units whose successes clearly exceed the sum of their individual parts. Faculty of these departments, because of their concern for each other and for their students, often subordinate personal desire to the good of the whole. Their scholarship is often collaborative; when not, it is frequently focused on topics that will contribute to the department's areas of emphasis or curriculum. They don't complain when a good, streamlined set of requirements does not include a course that matches their dissertation topic. They nominate their colleagues for awards and are genuinely delighted by the successes of others. They counsel at length with their students. They feel comfortable praying about hiring decisions or expressing their deepest religious beliefs to each other. They attend forums and devotionals, college and university lectures, and honor their students at commencement and convocation exercises. They read each other's work and make helpful suggestions. In short, they have learned to live in charity. But remarkably, this charity has given their units such a high degree of excellence that it can be recognized by those who would never understand its origins. I invite you to think about your own relations to your colleagues and academic units and how greater charity might help you develop a higher degree of excellence.<br><br>I will return to this matter as I conclude my remarks, but I turn now to a number of specific matters that concern us at present. I think that they all have at least some relationship to charity, but I will leave it to you to think of how this is the case.<br><h2><b>Salaries</b></h2><br>As you no doubt will have observed, salary increases awarded this past academic year were, on average, somewhat smaller than in previous years. Some rather far-fetched things have been said about this matter, but generally those who have expressed themselves have simply asked for more information. I would like to try to explain our procedures for those of you who are new and remind the others of the rather lengthier discussion of this issue given in a fall conference a few years ago by Robert Webb.<br><br>The budget for Brigham Young University is proposed by the board of trustees and approved by the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the Church. (Some members sit on both boards.) The primary source of funding for our budget, including faculty salaries, is the tithing of Church members. Those funds that are designated for BYU diminish the amount of money available for other Church purposes. A number of years ago, the board decided to try to bring faculty and staff salaries into a proper relationship with those in peer organizations. The so-called "Hay" study was undertaken, in which BYU salaries were compared with those of ten large universities in the Rocky Mountains and on the West Coast. At that time a number of adjustments were made--some of them rather substantial--particularly in the upper ranks, which had lagged behind the others. The Hay comparisons were employed for a number of years, undergoing a couple of adjustments in the institutions used. But because the universities in the study were from one region and subject to localized economic conditions, it was decided several years ago to employ a survey of 44 large universities that is compiled by Oklahoma State University. Some of the universities in this group are not particularly well known, but more of them are strong academic institutions. These better-known institutions include the Universities of Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Texas at Austin, Michigan, Florida, Indiana, Utah, as well as Purdue and Texas A&amp;amp;M. Salaries at BYU are compared with the averages of these institutions, and this information is given to the board, whose members then set a general increase for the university. During the past five years, ending with 1993–94, salary increases at BYU have exceeded those of the comparison group by 6.4 percent. (We do not yet have data for 1994–95.)<br><br>When the general increase comes to the university, we distribute this funding on the basis of the information that we have received. This information includes comparisons by rank, and, as you know, we had a substantial adjustment a few years ago for many full professors. Salary comparisons are also made, where possible, on a college-by-college and department-by-department basis. I say "where possible" because universities are not all structured the same way. Some, for example, have a modern languages department, whereas we have four departments covering modern languages. But we try to achieve a close comparison. To this point we have distributed salary monies on a collegewide basis. The result of such distribution, however, has something to make everyone unhappy. As it happens, the three colleges that have the highest average salaries are also the three that are furthest behind their comparison groups. Those of us in disciplines that do not fare as well in the marketplace probably are disturbed that we are behind other fields, whereas those in the most competitive areas may feel that they should not be behind their market group. We have felt that it is important to try to respond both to market forces and to a need for some cross-university equity. We obviously cannot succeed completely at both.<br><br>We now have enough data about departmental comparisons that we will be able to provide deans information that will help them distribute salary increases between their units. It should be clear, however, that in the case of individuals as well as that of units, evaluations of performance are even more important than averages. (I should add, parenthetically, that the funds we use for special purposes, such as promotion increments, are taken from the annual appropriations we receive from the board. there is no special budget category for such raises.)<br><br>In years of smaller increases, we are faced with the dilemma of trying to bring some colleges nearer into line while providing close to a cost-of-living increase to others. In addition, we have been trying at least to understand the reason for any individual outliers, and we have undertaken a careful, discipline-by-discipline study to make sure there are no gender inequities. In short, we are attempting to be as careful and fair as possible with the salary monies we receive. When we consider their source, we want to treat them with respect and justice.<br><br>I would like to mention one other thing about the financial status of the university. I have recently been studying the 1994 edition of<i>Campus Trends,</i>the annual survey of American universities published by the American Council on Education. This publication reports that while the financial crises of universities have lessened somewhat, 100 percent of public institutions and 92 percent of private institutions report financial issues as one of their major challenges for the next five years. Forty-five percent of those surveyed report across-the-board budget cuts, and an additional 13 percent report cuts for some units. Travel budgets have been cut at 51 percent of the institutions reporting. When we look at our overall situation, we find we are most fortunate. Each year we have received increases in our general budget, and we have never been forced to make cuts in important items. I am deeply grateful to our board of trustees and to our supporters that our situation is so stable.<br><h2><b>Promotion and Continuing Faculty Status</b></h2><br>One of the matters that causes the greatest stress at almost all universities centers on the processes used to evaluate candidates for promotion and for continuing faculty status. We share much of this stress. These processes are also topics about which some of our most unfortunate misunderstandings have developed. Several years ago, in order to clarify and normalize our expectations and practices, Dennis Thomson and many others spent hundreds of hours developing a new document for the university. After using the document for a couple of years, we asked Alan Wilkins to request faculty and administrators on all levels to help refine the initial work. Several committees of the Faculty Advisory Council were particularly helpful in this process. The final version was recently sent to all of us.<br><br>Let me make just a few comments about these processes. First, despite rumors to the contrary, the faculty council on promotions is not an insurmountable barrier, stopping promotions that have sailed through their departments and colleges. During the past five years, the university council<i>agreed</i>with the promotion decisions of departments 85 percent of the time, and when compared with college decisions, the agreement was a higher 90 percent. Agreement in the case of continuing faculty status was even higher: departments and the university agreed in 96 percent of the cases, and colleges and the university in 98 percent. When one considers the fact that in a few instances of disagreement the university committee recommended<i>for</i>advancement when a previous committee had not, the myth of an unsatisfiable university committee pretty well disappears.<br><br>Nonetheless (I'm to my second comment here), the review experience is causing unnecessary discomfort and pain. In a study done by our Faculty Center, we have found clear verification of the assumption that these processes are not only difficult, but also quite hurtful to many people. Part of the difficulty is, of course, a natural consequence of evaluation. When I was a bishop I sometimes saw the most righteous and pure individuals shake a bit at a temple recommend interview. In this respect, I wish that we could make evaluation a more normal part of our professional experience. I commend the J. Reuben Clark Law School for their practice of periodic evaluation of all faculty, regardless of rank or continuing status. But some pain could be alleviated through more careful mentoring, earlier preparation of materials, and closer adherence to our standards. As to the last of these, let me simply mention that university documents frequently acknowledge differences in discipline, assignments, and scholarly method; I fear, however, that some who are evaluating occasionally apply their own standards rather than those of the university. Candidates should be able to count on being evaluated in relation to the standards that we publish.<br><br>Chairs and candidates should also work together to assure that individual assignments and expectations follow our documents. While we encourage flexible expectations, these must still conform with general standards. In other words, lead guitar playing in a rock band, even if world-class and approved by the chair, will not count much toward promotion in the Chemistry Department.<br><br>Let me turn to one related issue, that of peer review. Whenever greater flexibility is granted, the need for even more thorough review is heightened. This is also true when we are trying to demonstrate teaching excellence. While teaching is difficult to evaluate, this task is far from impossible. Multiple evaluations--from students, colleagues, supervisors--along with analysis of course outlines, handouts, examinations, etc., provide the strongest cases for excellent teaching. (One further comment: Poor teaching, even when done in abundance, does not make up for a lack in scholarly productivity.)<br><br>At this point let me insert one related comment. We are a university that emphasizes teaching while realizing the critical importance of research and other scholarly and creative activities. Bevan Ott and his associates have spent a good deal of time clarifying the role of such work at BYU. The Research Model that was recently published gives us excellent guidance on this matter and should be read in conjunction with our promotion document.<br><br>I would like to summarize my thoughts on this matter: evaluation will always be with us. We can make it less painful by careful mentoring and preparation, conscientious adherence to standards on the part of candidates and evaluators, and an elimination of the myth of adversarial relations between different levels of the university.<br><h2><b>Combating False Ideology</b></h2><br>When we talk about the future of Brigham Young University, we rarely fail to mention the two talks given by Spencer W. Kimball--"Education for Eternity" (1967) and the "Second Century Address" (1976). It is from these talks that we have taken the term "educational Everest" and heard the challenge "I am both hopeful and expectant that out of this university and the Church Educational System there will rise brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, sculpture, painting, science, and in all the scholarly graces." Here he let us know that we must match, even exceed, the good qualities of other institutions of higher education.<br><br>Sometimes, however, we fail to remember that it was also in these talks that President Kimball warned us that a gap was widening between us and other universities. He said: "BYU, in its second century, must become the last remaining bastion of resistance to the invading ideologies that seek control of curriculum as well as classroom. We do not resist such ideas because we fear them, but because they are false. BYU, in its second century, must continue to resist false fashions in education, staying with those basic principles that have proved right and have guided good men and women and god universities over the centuries." President Kimball did not specify which ideologies would challenge us, but in his next paragraph he warns us not to "counsel the Board of Trustees to follow false ways." After inviting all to make suggestions about improving BYU, he continues: "I hope none will presume on the prerogatives of the prophets of God to set the basic direction for this university" (all from "Second Century Address"). It seems clear, then, that prophets will continue to point out the errors and false teachings of the world and that this university should take its direction from those prophets.<br><br>I expect that this prophetically required resistance to false ideology will occasionally be challenging for us--separating us from professors, colleagues, and institutions whose approbation we have sought in the past. But in my view such resistance will increasingly become a mark of our excellence, an excellence, I add, that will eventually be recognized by many others of good will and honesty. That which is good and true has a way of emerging in time.<br><br>May I add my hope that at least 90 percent of our resistance to false ideology will take place within our own minds. It is our individual responsibility to weigh the principles we are teaching and discover whether they are found wanting when compared with eternal gospel truths. Another 50 percent or more of this resistance should take place when faculty, carefully remembering the mote-and-beam principle, talk privately and compassionately with colleagues who may be struggling with ideological challenges. Only on rare occasion should chairs, deans, and university officers (in that order) be required to take any official action.<br><br>This is a matter that will require considerable courage on the part of some. It will be rewarded by the Lord's blessings on this institution. As then Elder Kimball said in his "Education for Eternity" address, "This institutions and its leaders should be like the Twelve as they were left in a very difficult world by the Savior: 'The world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil'" (John 17:14–15).<br><h2><b>Self-Study</b></h2><br>In our meetings this week, we have heard a good deal about the university-wide self-study we are undertaking. Ten years ago, as we embarked on our last full-scale accreditation study, I was a member of the faculty team that coordinated our efforts. The amount of work we put into the project was considerable, yet the scale of this year's undertaking exceeds that of past studies by a good deal. This study will result in strategic plans and planning methods that will guide the university into the next century. It is easy to become cynical about such undertakings. They take immense effort, and expectations for change that develop often outrun resources.<br><br>I would urge a positive attitude toward this work. Just as we need occasions on which to measure our own individual performance, so, too, do we need the opportunity to evaluate our programs, disciplines, and general effectiveness. We really need to know how well we are doing and how we can improve our performance. I am particularly concerned that we not let the increasingly high quality of our students become a crutch that supports less effective university performance. All of us have many reasons to be optimistic: in most areas (I find writing skills to be an exception), our new students are well prepared, and they certainly have impressive native capacities. No doubt we will continue to see an increase in the number or our national merit scholars, students with AP course preparation, highly gifted artists and musicians, etc. After all, this past year we had 580 qualified students who applied for Benson Scholarships, and the minimum requirements for that aware are a high school GPA of 3.85 and an ACT score of 31 (this is in the first percentile nationally). And our graduates will undoubtedly continue to win prestigious scholarships, gain admission to excellent graduate and professional schools, and be employed by the best American and international firms.<br><br>What we need to understand and improve is the contribution we make to our students' growth and development. Are our curricula coherent and demanding? Do we have end results in mind? Do our graduates gain mature faith and understanding of the gospel? Can they write English with some skill? Do they have the quantitative abilities required to deal with increasingly complex problems?<br><br>Answers to such questions will not only help us to evaluate our present position, but will provide a basis upon which we can plan how best to employ our resources in the future. We should not expect the study to result in vast new resources or to see massive shifts between major units of the university. Most of these changes will be small. But colleges and departments may wish to make rather substantial<i>internal</i>changes. I expect that most of the departments who take the study seriously will find at least a few areas where they will wish to shift emphasis.<br><br>I have long felt that five-year plans and other kinds of planning need to be looked on with some degree of caution. President Kimball also said, "It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the Lord would have occur in the second century of BYU are hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond" ("Second Century Address"). We will certainly have to anticipate surprises, many of which will be pleasing, some of which will not. No doubt we will want to vary many plans as we are confronted with unanticipated opportunities and problems. But it is exciting to think of a whole university reflecting seriously on what it is really about. Please join this effort with whole hearts.<br><h2><b>Final Comments</b></h2><br>In the beginning of my remarks, I mentioned how I have thought of my mother-in-law and father in relation to BYU. I would like to be allowed to say something about my son. When Dan died at conference time last year, shortly after his 20th birthday, we held his funeral on a Friday. The next Monday, as you would have done, I returned to school and to a busy schedule. But family, Church, and BYU responsibilities so occupied my time that I felt I had not really had a chance to mourn his death. Finally, in November, I caught a mild case of flu that forced me to stay home on a Sunday. After a morning filled with reflection, I fell asleep and had the following dream:<br><br>I was in a parking lot (probably by the JKHB) walking with my arms full of books and other materials. As I approached my 1967 Volvo, the car I drove to campus for 23 years, I noticed that exhaust was coming from the tailpipe. This concerned me, because I knew that the car keys were in my pocket. I opened the front passenger door because I wanted to put my books on the seat. As I did so, I saw Dan in the back seat, surrounded by his books, writing in a notebook. I told him that I had been surprised that the engine was running, and he replied that he wanted to heat the car while he was studying because it was cold to him. After an exchange about car keys, Dan said, "Just sit down there, I'll come up and drive." As he moved from the back seat and opened the driver's door, I realized that he was dead. I leaned forward, and we embraced. I felt his whiskers against my cheek and said, "I miss you so much." With that, I awoke, weeping but strangely and deeply comforted.<br><br>As I described this comfort to my wife, she remarked that it was very natural: "It's because he was at BYU. For years, one of your strongest wishes was for Dan to be a student here." Dorothy was right. Like many of you, I longed for the time that circumstances would be such that my son could enroll at BYU. It was here that I wanted him to learn the beauty of mathematical formulæ. It was at BYU that I hoped he could develop a profound understanding of the scriptures. It was from you that I wanted him to study humanities, biology, the fine arts, sociology, and all of the other wonderful things we get to deal with every day. I believed that his whole life could be changed if he could be a student here. For a moment, at least, it seemed that this had happened.<br><br>Now when I look across the campus, I see tens of thousands of students whose parents' wishes are much the same as mine. They see in BYU the one place where their children's eternal education can take place. I hope that we will never take casually the extraordinary faith they place in us.<br><br>In the fourth chapter of his first epistle, John tells us of God's love. (The original term here is the same as is translated "charity" in other places.) John says: "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love" (1 John 4:7–8). Those who love each other learn to do things that otherwise seem impossible. A number of years ago I was moved by an account of the French mountain village of Le Chambon. The inhabitants there were ordinary people, but during the Nazi occupation they saved the lives of many Jews--keeping a number of them in their own homes, smuggling others across the Swiss border, sheltering young Jewish boys in their boarding school. Day after day and night after night they risked extreme danger to help people who were complete strangers to them. What is most amazing is that they never seemed to realize the extraordinary nature of their acts. A whole community apparently believed that it was commonplace to perform acts of love. Above the entrance to their church were the same words of John: "Let us love one another." They could have followed this inscription with John's later passage, "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).<br><br>We are not asked to do the heroic tasks accomplished by the people of Le Chambon. Theirs were the acts of extreme goodness done in the face of unmatched evil. But we can be filled with the same spirit when we undertake what the Lord asks of us. Much of that is clear now, some will emerge as we study ourselves in the next years, and important parts will be revealed to us only as we have climbed the hills that are directly ahead. I pray that we may climb those hills together in love, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Todd A.

<h1>g Secular Knowledge With Spiritual Knowledge - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a delight to be with all of you. I have enjoyed very much the fellowship and companionship that is here. This is quite a sack lunch that we have had. I am glad that President Lee has the high regard for my Ruth that he expressed; I am never more honored or grateful or appreciative than when she is seated by my side, and I am grateful that she is here with us tonight. We are honored to have Elder and Sister Eyring with us, and we appreciate their presence very much. I want to say that I consulted Elder Eyring with respect to what might be appropriate to be said tonight. I take full credit, but I want to acknowledge and thank him for his help. We are grateful to be with President Lee and all of these at the head table. Looking at the head table and having heard the remarks with reference to lawyers, I want to say--just remember who the president of the Church is, and I hope we will be a little more circumspect about what we say about lawyers.<br><br>The informal nature and setting of this occasion makes me think that perhaps my message is a little on the heavy side. Sister Faust read it and says it's too short; I hope when I get through you feel the same way. I have entitled my message "Enhancing Secular Knowledge Through Spiritual Knowledge and Faith," and I have accepted the theme that was suggested from Alma 14:26, "Give Us Strength According to Our Faith."<br><br>I am greatly honored by the presence of each one this evening. As one of the newest members of the board of trustees of this university, I think it augurs well for me to approach this assignment with much humility and even some trepidation. My anxiety is enhanced because I believe that I am addressing, in many ways, the most remarkable university administration, faculty, and staff in the world. Your work and that of your predecessors has made Brigham Young University a uniquely honored and respected university worldwide. We teach the gospel of Jesus Christ explicitly at Brigham Young University. We also pursue secular learning according to commandment.<br><br>"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; . . . seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>I should like to focus my brief comments on how I perceive Brigham Young University and how those associated with it can have an even greater influence in the cataclysmic social, economic, and spiritual events in the world and the role of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in that world. I speak to myself as well as to you. This focus is also the basis of our eternal salvation. I begin with a true story. Our youngest son, Robert, studied law at this university and took a class in trusts from a distinguished legal scholar, Dallin H. Oaks. My son told me that on the first day of the class the teacher said to the students, "As we begin this course, I want you to know where I am coming from. I believe that Jesus is the Christ and the Savior and the Redeemer of the world. I believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and restored the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness to the earth in our day. I believe that all of the presidents of the Church since Joseph Smith have been successors in interest, keys, and authority to that held by Joseph Smith. Now please open your books and we'll study trust law."<br><br>I believe that the first day's instruction was more valuable to Robert, and more useful in his life, than the rules of trust law set forth in Ex Parte-Pye and other decisions, important as they are in the law of trusts.<br><br>As we look to the future, I wonder if it will not be more important for you to know what you are than what you know. Dr. C. Roland Christensen of the Harvard Business School, wrote:<br><br><i>Faith in the fundamental worth of our vocation, in the values that govern our relations with individual students and classes, . . . To me faith is the indispensable dimension of teaching life. Why, then, is it so rarely mentioned? Perhaps because academicians may feel more comfortable with hard facts, logical analysis, and readily observable skills than with intangibles like belief. But without the intangibles . . . technique becomes mechanical, skills manipulative, and attitudes suspect.</i>[<i>Education for Judgment,</i>Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Massachusetts, 1991, pp. 116–19]<br><br>He continues:<br><br><i>I believe teaching is a moral act . . . I believe that what students become is as important as what they learn . . . I teach not only what I know, but what I am.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>There is so much important teaching by the administration and staff that does not take place in or in connection with a classroom. Some 10,500 students are employed part-time at BYU. Through the years BYU has made a conscious effort to employ students wherever possible, and thus help them finance their educations. In the students' daily association with administrators and staff who are their "bosses," these students are not only taught to clean and to garden but also to post grades. They not only man the desks and the libraries, fry the hamburgers, service computers, and sell school supplies, but also host visitors, repair vehicles, paint buildings, manage theaters, and usher at events. There is also the magnificent service that is performed by so many of the administration, staff, and faculty as spiritual leaders. This is done on Sundays, in firesides, personal interviews, where guidance is given and testimonies are borne. Without this devoted service, the students at BYU would be less prepared for life than they are.<br><br>The Lord said, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). I believe the influence from this institution will be like that of the Portuguese navigators who, in the 14th and 15th centuries in the Age of Discovery, went to the ends of the earth. And those who go will take the unique essence of this remarkable institution worldwide. This has already begun to happen. My wife and I, with Bruce Olsen and Randy Boothe, were privileged to take the first group of Young Ambassadors from Brigham Young University to China in 1979. This provided the opportunity to rededicate that ancient land. Our students were so outstanding that they were almost mobbed in several places. The performances were televised and rebroadcast over and over again all through China. So very much has happened since that event in the contacts with members and leaders of the Church with China.<br><br>Many of you have been and will be part of this dissemination of secular knowledge and spiritual truth, either in person or through the students that you teach. This will also be true not only of the scholarly disciplines, but also of members of the Brigham Young University administration, staff, athletic teams, and touring groups who go into the world representing the university. I think this will happen because while other institutions of learning have classes of secular scholarship and knowledge equal in many ways to that of this university, I am certain there are none in your class in spiritual knowledge and commitments. This university is a continuing experiment in the concept of there being a first-class academic community of scholars led by a board of trustees consisting mostly of prophets, seers, and revelators. This presupposes that the administrators, faculty, and staff accept those prophets, seers, and revelators as a principle source of ultimate truth. It is also presumed that there is loyalty to their leadership and the policy they set. No other university has ever been quite so positioned.<br><br>Other great institutions in the world have moved from a spiritual underpinning to a completely secular footing, perhaps thus feeling more secure in their acceptance in the academic world of intellectual elitism. There is so much secular knowledge for mankind to learn, but all of it together is only the smaller part of the learning challenge. I do not believe that the administrators, scholars, teachers, or students of this university can rise to their full potential of knowledge without the larger part of the challenge, which is an increase in the full enjoyment of the inspiration of heaven. With these blessings, both teacher and student and secular knowledge will be greatly enlightened. To do this, we must become more certain of spiritual enlightenment than secular knowledge.<br><br>The test of faith for those of this university is, in my opinion, more important than any peer review for faculty or any examination in the classroom for students. When the ultimate spiritual power of heaven is fully invoked by the administration and faculty at this university, God can pour out his blessings upon all in a transcending way. He is the fountain of sure knowledge of all truth. As this spiritual competency increases, great and marvelous things will be accomplished by ordinary people.<br><br>I feel secure in my statement of this because the Lord has said that "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5) and "know all things" (see D&amp;amp;C 11:14). There can be a greater breakthrough of knowledge by the teacher and scholar at this university beyond imagination by tapping into the divine foundations of truth.<br><br>Alma reminds us: "And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God" (Alma 18:35). We are all familiar with the statement of James:<br><br><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i><br><br><i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</i>[James 1:5–6]<br><br>I believe the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ are more important than any professional disciplines at this university. The interests of the Church have to be paramount over the interests of the university so that the university may qualify for that added spiritual power which it must receive to rise to its full potential. By this I mean there should be a loyalty to the sponsoring institution and a willingness to subordinate reason to revelation.<br><br>Perhaps in conclusion it might be appropriate for me to say a word about President Howard W. Hunter, the new chairman of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees. Some of you faculty, and many of the students, were present on February 7, 1993, in the Marriott Center for the 19-stake fireside and CES broadcast. You will recall that when President Hunter was at the pulpit, an intruder carrying a briefcase in one hand and something black in the other stepped on the stand and shouted, "Stop right there." He then ordered everybody to leave the stand but President Hunter. Many did leave, but President Hunter quietly and resolutely stayed at the pulpit. The assailant then demanded that President Hunter read aloud a prepared statement. President Hunter firmly declined to do so. The assailant picked the wrong man. I know of no man in this world that is more resolute, unflappable, and courageous than President Hunter. You will recall that when the assailant was momentarily distracted, he was pushed from the stand. President Hunter was lowered by the security guards and others to the floor to safety. After the incident, I am told that President Hunter's pulse was seventy beats per minute!<br><br>You will recall that President Hunter collected himself and then began his prepared message saying, "Life has a fair number of challenges in it." And then his irrespressible sense of humor surfaced and he added, "As demonstrated." He then went on with his message as though nothing had happened.<br><br>President Hunter's nobility of character was never better expressed in the long years when Sister Clare Hunter began to deteriorate. It became necessary for him to lovingly help dress and feed and tend to her every want. This he did over a period of more then ten years, besides carrying on his heavy apostolic load. The strain almost took his life. He suffered a very serious heart attack at which time he was told that he could no longer carry this heavy burden and live. He replied, "I cannot put her away." Some time later, she became noncognitive and had to be fed artificially. Only then, with great reluctance and heartbreak, did he let her go from his loving care and home. I have never seen a more caring and devoted husband than President Hunter.<br><br>We are all so grateful that he now has Sister Inis as his wife to give him comfort and support, solace and loving care. Sister Hunter is a person who meets people well because she is warm and gracious, with a radiant smile that draws people to her. She is indeed a fine companion for President Hunter, having adapted quickly and quite easily to her role as the wife of a General Authority.<br><br>President Hunter is a man of flesh and bone but also of steel. It is a miracle that President Hunter walks. He has fought back from such crippling and debilitating health challenges. He has had as many operations as many of us have had collectively. The Lord could have taken him so many times when he was at death's door, but it is my testimony that he has been preserved to be our president in this time. He is the personification of courtesy, consideration, graciousness, thoughtfulness and kindness. It could well be said of him as it has been of Moses, that he is "very meek, above all the men . . . upon the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3).<br><br>As a Moses-like man, President Hunter has been a scholar-saint in the work of the mind. His broad gauge of expertise has been focused around the law but has gone far beyond. His interest in business, archaeology, geography, horticulture, and all things mechanical are but a few. I think all of us connected with the university can rejoice in having a great chairman of the board who understands faith and reason so well.<br><br>We are grateful that the wives and husbands of the administration, faculty, and staff are here. Your quiet service is far more important than is realized in sustaining your companions, not only in the activities directly related to the university, but also sustaining your companions as spiritual leaders, counselors, and friends to the choice young men and women who are privileged to come to this university.<br><br>The board of trustees are aware of some of the personal sacrifices that so many of you have made to be part of this great institution. We know that none are without some worries and challenges. We know you have bills to pay, missionaries to support, teeth to have straightened. A friend of ours wrote after a tragic death in our family, "The quiet little deaths of every day existence are mourned as much as those of ascending magnitude. For quiet makes no comparisons or judgments and has no understanding of degree." We hope that you feel that there are compensatory blessings beyond the personal sacrifices required to be part of this university.<br><br>This continuing experiment of teaching the learning of mankind, in light of the teachings of God, must succeed. The stakes are so great, and too much of the widows' tithing is spent here that could be spent on new missions, temples, chapels, etc, for it to fail.<br><br>I have had a close relationship with only one of the functions of the university--at the Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. You are well aware of the long struggle that it took to establish that presence in the Holy City. You may not be aware of the miracles that took place to bring it into being. Yet the greatest miracles of the Jerusalem Center experience occur in the lives of the young men and women who are able to attend there. The monument there is not the magnificent building in the prime location of Jerusalem, nor in the world-class architecture, but in the lives of those who are able to go there.<br><br>We see so many lives that are changed through that special program and realize that it is only a small part of the good that flows from this great university. My heart aches because Church-wide so relatively few can enjoy the blessings of this great institution. When someone you love and are close to is rejected for admission to the BYU, you will have a greater awareness of what a privilege it is to attend this institution.<br><br>Brethren and sisters, we love and trust you. We have complete confidence in your ability, in your character, and in your faith. You are exemplary in your example and integrity. Please be reassured of our absolute faith in you.<br><br><i>[Elder Faust then bore his testimony and left his blessing upon those assembled.]</i><br><br><i>James E.

<br>
Welcome back! All of a sudden, summer's over, and it's time to head back to school. The long, warm, delightful days are left behind as the invigorating brisk, fresh air of autumn begins. To all of you here in the Marriott Center at BYU and to all of you joining us via satellite in meetinghouses throughout North America and the Caribbean, I extend to each of you the abiding love and warmest greetings of the First Presidency and the Twelve. All of the General Authorities pray for your continued growth and success in life. Joining our faith with that of your local Church leaders, we pray that you will find happiness and joy through strict obedience to God's loving commandments.<br><h2><b>New School Year Brings New Experiences</b></h2><br>While September sees the calendar year growing old, this back-to-school time is, nevertheless, a season of new beginnings. Many of you are starting new chapters in your young lives. Look around you. You will see brand new freshmen still somewhat dazed as they leave high school behind and begin their adjustment to university life. You will also find the seasoned college graduate settling into new challenges of graduate school or other professional training. Recently returned missionaries who are now resuming their studies or returning to the work force are here, along with future missionaries who are anxiously awaiting their call from the Lord's prophet to serve a full-time mission. Some of the married couples who are here tonight are newlyweds who are just learning to share their lives together, and some are new parents who are just learning to share their lives with very demanding new arrivals.<br><h2><b>Experience Develops Wise Use of Agency</b></h2><br>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ powerfully teaches that a loving Father in Heaven has placed us here upon this earth to learn from our experiences, both good and bad. The Lord spoke with tender reassurance to a tortured, disheartened Joseph Smith suffering in the cold, dark dungeon of Liberty Jail to remind him that "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). In order to maximize our education, our Father has given us the gift of agency to learn to use wisely during our sojourn on earth. The power to choose, to control our own destiny, was so important that a war in heaven was fought to preserve it. Our Father bore the grief of seeing one-third of his spirit children lost to Satan as casualties of the evil one's determination to destroy the plan of life and exaltation. Your choice to follow the Savior saved you from being cast out and brought you to this mortal probation.<br><br>Reflect for a moment upon how you have used the tremendous power of agency in your life thus far. Consider the choices you have made. You have chosen wisely to pursue an education or a vocation.<br><h2><b>Blessings and Challenges of Education</b></h2><br>You will come to understand more profoundly than you possibly can today that education has eternal worth. It bears repeating that the Lord has revealed that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18).<br><br>President Brigham Young taught that education should "improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family" (<i>JD</i>14:83). "Education," he said, "is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], p. 831).<br><h2><b>To Be Learned Is Good If We Hearken unto the Counsels of God</b></h2><br>Your education should include courses in religion to teach you the importance of seeking knowledge in light of revealed truth. Hence, religion courses are required for graduation from Church schools. I hope that you who are enrolled at other centers of learning will take advantage of the institute of religion classes that are offered in your area. These courses are open to all young adults, whether or not you are attending any specific school. The Church institute program is for everyone. Don't miss this great opportunity to expand your knowledge of the gospel, to deepen your faith, and to strengthen your testimony while enjoying the association of others who share your beliefs and support your chosen commitment to high standards.<br><h2><b>Three Principles for Making Wise Choices</b></h2><br>To help you "graduate successfully" from the college of life, to help you "earn some honors" in the rigorous curriculum of adult mortality, to help you "choose the right when a choice is placed before you" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 239), may I suggest three simple guidelines. Though simple and familiar, these three principles are eternal and will serve you as well as they have served your ancestors and as they will yet serve your descendants.<br><br>First, Follow the Christ.<br>Second, Follow the Prophet.<br>Third, Follow the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Follow the Christ</b></h2><br>The Savior lovingly beckons to everyone, to all of our Father's children everywhere throughout all time. His invitation to "Come, follow me"<i>(Hymns,</i>1985, no. 116; see also Matthew 4:19) is universally extended to all people across all eras of human history.<br><br><i>He marked the path and led the way,</i><br><i>And ev'ry point defines</i><br><i>To light and life and endless day</i><br><i>Where God's full presence shines.</i><br>["How Great the Wisdom and the Love,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 195]<br><br>That which Christ declared in the meridian of time stands as unassailably true today as it was nearly 2000 years ago when he proclaimed, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). In 2 Nephi, Jacob powerfully exhorts us to come unto Christ and to follow the Lord's straight course:<br><br><i>O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.</i>[2 Nephi 9:41]<br><br>Jacob's elder brother, Nephi, queried, "Can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments?" (2 Nephi 31:10). The resounding response is found in the Redeemer's own words: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15) and "For the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do" (3 Nephi 27:21).<br><h2><b>To Follow Christ, We Must Obey His Commandments</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, I am reminded of the compassionate words of Father Lehi when he declared, I "exhort [you] with all the feeling of a tender parent, that [you] would hearken to [my] words" (1 Nephi 8:37). With all my heart I echo the Savior's admonition that you choose to hear and heed the word of God. "Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 303). In our world today the only protection from "all the fiery darts of the adversary" (D&amp;amp;C 3:8) is to choose to "Put on the whole armour of God, that [we] may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil" (Ephesians 6:11).<br><br>And Satan is certainly wily. He is cunning--the master of deception and the father of all lies. Only by keeping<i>all</i>the commandments are you protected by "the whole armour of God" from Satan's incessant, insidious efforts to lead you carefully into his power. Peter taught us of Satan's ferocious devotion to our destruction when he wrote to the Saints of his day:<br><br><i>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.</i>[1 Peter 5:8]<br><br>And so we must keep all the commandments. You cannot approach the gospel as you would a buffet or smorgasbord, choosing here a little and there a little. You must sit down to the whole feast and live the Lord's loving commandments in their fullness.<br><br>You have been taught the commandments. You know what to do:<br><br><i>Pray.</i><br><i>Study the scriptures.</i><br><i>Fast.</i><br><i>Pay your tithes and offerings.</i><br><i>Attend your meetings.</i><br><i>Partake of the sacrament.</i><br><i>Magnify your callings and serve others.</i><br><i>Sustain your Church leaders.</i><br><i>Do your home teaching and visiting teaching.</i><br><i>Make and keep sacred covenants.</i><br><i>Share the gospel.</i><br><i>Be honest, true, chaste, benevolent, and virtuous.</i><br><br>The righteous King Benjamin, who loved his people dearly, gathered his people together near the end of his righteous life to share with them the deepest feelings of his heart. After reviewing the basic beliefs and commandments of the gospel of Christ with his beloved people, he offered this simple but powerful exhortation near the conclusion of his great sermon: "And now, if you<i>believe</i>all these things see that ye<i>do</i>them" (Mosiah 4:10; emphasis added).<br><h2><b>Stay Morally Clean</b></h2><br>As you strive to follow the Savior by keeping his commandments, please be aware of Satan's powerfully persuasive efforts to confound and frustrate the plan of happiness by tempting you to misuse the sacred powers of procreation that our Father in Heaven has entrusted to you. Satan would have you believe that chastity and virtue are outmoded traditions of the distant past, that you can indulge yourself in immorality and not suffer the consequences. Such are the lies that he spreads by any and by all means possible. In contrast to Satan's deception, ponder the following words from President Spencer W. Kimball, who spoke plainly on this subject:<br><br><i>That the Church's stand on morality may be understood, we declare firmly and unalterably, it is not an outworn garment, faded, old-fashioned, and threadbare. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and his covenants and doctrines are immutable; and when the sun grows cold and the stars no longer shine, the law of chastity will still be basic in God's world and in the Lord's church. Old values are upheld by the Church not because they are old, but rather because through the ages they have proved right. It will</i>always<i>be the rule.</i>["President Kimball Speaks Out on Morality,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 96; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Be Lifelong Missionaries</b></h2><br>May I take a moment here to speak to those who have completed full-time missions. Like no other experience, a mission prepares you for a lifetime of faithful service in preaching the gospel. You have learned eternal truths and strengthened your testimony as you vigorously proclaimed the message of the Restoration. You have learned to serve and sacrifice, to be exacting in your obedience to the commandments, to set and achieve challenging goals. Do not allow Satan to lull you into an apathetic stupor with such superficial returned-missionary rationalizations as "I've served my time; it's time to relax." If such thoughts have crossed your mind or similar words have escaped your lips, please take a moment to ponder these words from 2 Nephi:<br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 28:21]<br><br>Don't let an apathetic attitude rob you of the progress you've worked so hard to achieve. Choose, instead, to remain stalwart and true. Choose to follow the Savior.<br><br>Continue to be missionaries. May I suggest that you set a lifelong goal to bring at least one individual or family into the Church every year. Live lives that will attract people to the gospel of Jesus Christ. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Seek to emulate the works of our Great Exemplar. The Lord could not have been more direct in seeking our allegiance than when he taught the Nephites during his ministry in the Americas. He asked, "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?" Then came this response of awesome magnitude: "Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><h2><b>Don't Delay Marriage</b></h2><br>And to you returned missionary elders, let me remind you of your responsibility to seek and find a worthy eternal companion. This is a sacred obligation. Marriage is nothing to rush into, but neither is it to be overly delayed or unduly postponed. After you complete your mission, you are charged with the responsibility to diligently prepare for temple marriage and for the duties of serving as a husband and father.<br><br>From the beginning of time on this earth, eternal marriage between a man and a woman has been fundamental to God's plan for the happiness and joy of us who are his children. In the early years of the Church, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that marriage began in the Garden of Eden. In the<i>History of the Church,</i>we read the Prophet's own account of his teachings regarding the marriage of our first parents that he proclaimed while solemnizing the marriage of Newel Knight and Lydia Goldthwaite:<br><br><i>I requested them to rise, and join hands. I then remarked that marriage was an institution of heaven, instituted in the garden of Eden; that it was necessary it should be solemnized by the authority of the everlasting Priesthood. . . . I then pronounced them husband and wife in the name of God, and also pronounced upon them the blessings that the Lord conferred upon Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:320]<br><br>We cannot "follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments" (2 Nephi 31:10). For you returned missionary elders, entering into the new and everlasting covenant of eternal marriage is a step forward in your lives in obedience to a divine commandment that should not be unwisely postponed.<br><br>No more powerful invitation to follow the Savior can be found in scripture than Moroni's valedictory admonition to "come unto Christ" found in Moroni 10:32: "Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness."<br><br>Follow the Christ to a rich, full, abundant life of peace and joy. When we are from time to time "heavy laden," his promise of soul-refreshing rest is sure (see Matthew 11:28–29). Follow the Christ to life eternal to dwell forever with him and with our Father who is in heaven.<br><br>In a powerful message entitled "He Invites Us to Follow Him," published in this month's<i>Ensign,</i>President Howard W. Hunter explains what it means to follow the Savior:<br><br><i>Christ's supreme sacrifice can find full fruition in our lives only as we accept the invitation to follow him.</i>. . .<i>To follow an individual means to watch him or listen to him closely; to accept his authority, to take him as a leader, and to obey him; to support and advocate his ideas; and to take him as a model.</i>. . .<i>Just as teachings that do not conform to Christ's doctrine are false, so a life that does not conform to Christ's example is misdirected, and may not achieve its high potential destiny.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>September 1994, p. 2]<br><br>I commend President Hunter's complete message for your prayerful study. I exhort home teachers to ponder it and to present it to your assigned families with all diligence. This is the word of God that the Lord's prophet wants the entire Church to hear and heed today.<br><h2><b>Follow the Prophet</b></h2><br>The Savior has declared that whether we receive the word of God "by [his] own voice or by the voice of [his] servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38). If we are to follow Christ, we must follow the prophet, the Lord's mouthpiece on earth. As you know, this past summer saw the passing of President Ezra Taft Benson, a great and stalwart man of God whom we dearly miss. The Lord has prepared and chosen President Howard W. Hunter as the "prophet to guide us in these latter days" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 19). May I share a personal experience that taught me a great deal about the Christlike man who now leads the Lord's Church?<br><h2><b>Elder Hunter Journeys to Hammerfest</b></h2><br>While I was serving as president of the European area, Sister Wirthlin and I traveled throughout Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway holding meetings and conferences with members and missionaries in these northern lands. As we neared the end of our rigorous travels, we arrived, along with President and Sister John Langeland, in the small city of Alta, Norway. We held a meeting with the members and afterward climbed a beautiful mountain and at midnight enjoyed a picnic with them. It was as light as noon-day. At that time of the year there was no sunset in Alta, which is located near the top of the world, lying well inside the Arctic Circle. We watched the sun hover in a straight line as it moved across the horizon, and we marveled at the precision and exactness that the Savior employed in creating the earth in all its majesty.<br><br>As President Langeland and I reviewed our many meetings and travels, we were happy that we had made the extra effort to meet with the members in such a remote part of Norway. Over the years there had been few General Authorities who had visited these small and widely scattered branches. But, while chatting with the local Church leaders, we learned that there was yet one more small branch even further north. We learned that in the city of Hammerfest, which is located on the other side of a high mountain north of Alta, a branch of the Church had been established, a small branch that was not on our itinerary. Hammerfest is one of the world's northernmost cities, making its tiny branch one of the most remote units of the Church. To our surprise, we learned that several years earlier, Elder Howard W. Hunter had been the first General Authority to visit the Hammerfest Branch, a visit that was accomplished with considerable difficulty. The story of that visit is worth telling because it says so much about the man who the Lord has now chosen as his prophet, seer, and revelator:<br><br><i>"Hammerfest is difficult to reach by normal transportation. It was originally planned that the visitors would fly . . . by seaplane. A change in the weather eliminated any possibility of using a plane, as is often the case. It was decided that they should travel by car from Alta, the closest city to Hammerfest with a commercial airport. Snow had started to cover the roads. Several times en route Elder Hunter and Pres. [Leo M.] Jacobsen had to push their car through the snow. When it seemed as if further progress was impossible, a truck came by and towed the car over the summit to Hammerfest."</i><br><br><i>They finally arrived at ten-thirty that night for a meeting that was to have started at seven o'clock, and found that most of the members had waited. 'They had come from a number of places along the north cape and from as far as Kirkenes near the Russian border."</i>[Eleanor Knowles,<i>Howard W. Hunter</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1994), pp. 175–76]<br><br>The members in Hammerfest, anxious to meet an apostle of the Lord and to hear the voice of one called as a special witness, waited three and a half hours for Elder Hunter's delayed arrival. Their faith, hope, and prayers were rewarded as he shared with them his powerful testimony of the Savior. Despite great hardship, Elder Hunter, with God's blessings and protecting care, kept his commitment to minister to the Lord's sheep in that faraway small branch.<br><br><i>As a result of</i>[his]<i>visit, "missionaries report[ed] a more friendly attitude among the people of the town and a new feeling of strength among the local members."</i>[Knowles,<i>Hunter,</i>p. 176]<br><br>While impressive and moving, this is not an extraordinary event in the life of him who now serves as the Lord's mouthpiece on earth. Rather, it is quite typical of President Hunter's wholehearted devotion to the work of the Lord. He has traveled in nearly every corner of the earth. He possesses an indomitable zeal for preaching and proclaiming the gospel. He is ever undaunted in his determination to encourage the members of the Church to be faithful in obeying God's commandments.<br><br>We all remember President Hunter's experience at this podium as Cody Judy rushed him and threatened him with a bomb. President Hunter would not flinch or read the message demanded by his attacker. The students began to sing "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." A doctor came up and took President Hunter's pulse following this frightening incident. His pulse read seventy, which is normal. This is another good example of a man with a purpose who was not distracted from his sacred calling regardless of danger. He resumed his speech by saying, "Life has a fair number of challenges in it." He stopped, looked over the audience, and added, "As demonstrated."<br><h2><b>Follow the Prophet by Showing Compassion</b></h2><br>President Hunter has asked us all to "live with ever more attention to the life and example of the Lord Jesus Christ, especially the love and hope and compassion He displayed." President Hunter wants us to "treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, more humility and patience and forgiveness" (in Jay M. Todd, "President Howard W. Hunter,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1994, p. 4). In short, he is asking us to develop and demonstrate Christlike attributes in all our dealings with others. He is reminding us that we have been commanded to love our neighbors as ourselves (see Matthew 22:39). To show compassion, we must possess charity, "the pure love of Christ" that the Father bestows "upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ" (Moroni 7:47–48).<br><br>Recently the Church has rushed humanitarian aid to flood victims in Georgia and to refugees fleeing the carnage and tragedy of Rwanda. We are, as a Church, working to heed our prophet's counsel to show Christlike compassion toward our neighbors in all parts of the earth. But what are you doing individually to follow the prophet's call to provide compassionate service to your fellow beings?<br><br>John Walsh is known to most of you as the latest in a long line of outstanding BYU quarterbacks. John had an impressive sophomore season in 1993, and we are all hoping for his continued success this year. He is an outstanding football player and a fine young man. More important, however, I want to congratulate John for his patient and caring labors with Ryan, Amanda, and Varun. Some of you may not know that John Walsh is majoring in special education. Ryan Wright, Amanda Leners, and Varun McDonald were in John's class last year during a student teaching assignment at Westridge Elementary. These children were the beneficiaries of John's determination to do great things off the football field as well as playing football. When asked about his work with these second graders, John responded, "Working with these kids gives me the opportunity to give something back to the community, and it is important to me that I do that" (<i>Daily Universe,</i>13 April 1994, p. 13). I hope that all of you will likewise choose to follow the prophet and find meaningful ways to give of yourselves to show compassion toward others.<br><h2><b>Follow the Prophet to the Temple</b></h2><br>President Hunter has also asked us "to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of [our] membership and the supernal setting for [our] most sacred covenants," and he encourages us to draw closer to the Savior in his holy house as "a temple-attending and a temple-loving people." "Let us hasten to the temple," he says, "as frequently as time and means and personal circumstances allow" (Todd, "President Hunter," p. 5). I hope that those of you who are of age and are eligible to do so will take the time to attend the temple regularly. Even if a temple is not close by, work to become and remain temple worthy. President Hunter has said that it is the "deepest desire of [his] heart to have every member of the Church temple worthy."<br><h2><b>Read, Hear, and Heed the Word of God as Given by His Prophets</b></h2><br>Just as you must seek a healthy balance in your temple attendance, you must "see that all . . . things are done in wisdom and order" (Mosiah 4:27) in regard to your gospel study and especially in regard to hearing and heeding the counsel of our prophet and of the others whom the Lord has called to lead his Church. I hope that you will not grow so busy in your studies that you thoughtlessly fail to "feast upon the words of Christ" (2 Nephi 32:3). These firesides are recorded and sent out on video tape so many young adults throughout the world can be taught by the Brethren. Participate in whatever additional programs your local institute may sponsor to bring you desired messages.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley, speaking in April's general conference, said:<br><br><i>The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles, called and ordained to hold the keys of the priesthood, have the authority and responsibility to govern the Church, to administer its ordinances, to expound its doctrine, and to establish and maintain its practices. . . . All incumbent members of the Quorum of the First Presidency and of the Council of the Twelve have been the recipients of the keys, rights, and authority pertaining to the holy apostleship.</i>["God Is at the Helm,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, p. 54]<br><h2><b>Don't Miss Devotionals</b></h2><br>For you who are students here at BYU, you should attend the weekly 11:00 a.m. Tuesday devotional hour and set aside the temporary cares of the world to devote your full attention to the things of eternity. The lasting values and the permanent things that will never go out-of-date or fall out of fashion are taught and discussed and presented for your consideration and edification.<br><br>What you learn in the weekly devotionals will surely stand the test of time. Why would you trade away the unequaled opportunity that these assemblies provide to hear Church leaders teach eternal truths? The blessing of attending these assemblies is one of the principle distinguishing elements of the unique learning environment available only on these few campuses. You who do not take advantage of the gospel-based learning environment found at these institutions are wasting the precious resources that are expended to ensure your knowledge of the gospel. Failure to take full advantage of these unique learning opportunities significantly diminishes the spiritual element of your overall education. And for those of you who are not at BYU, you should know that many of the devotionals offered here are sent out on videotapes to institutes of religion throughout the world. These tapes are then replayed at Friday Forums so that young adults throughout the Church can have the opportunity to be taught by General Authorities. In addition, regular devotional assemblies are held at Ricks College, BYU--Hawaii, and LDS institutes at many colleges and universities.<br><h2><b>Follow the Spirit</b></h2><br>All who teach in the Church should teach by the power of the Spirit. We have been instructed that "if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach" (D&amp;amp;C 42:14). The prophet Nephi testified that the Holy Ghost "will show unto you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:5). Follow the Spirit. Heed its quiet promptings. Learning to follow the Spirit requires considerable effort and ongoing attention. Let me tell you of how I was reminded to always be alert to the quiet whisperings of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>Sharing the Gospel on Molokai</b></h2><br>Recently while on Church assignment in Hawaii, Sister Wirthlin and I visited the island of Molokai. One of the world's few remaining leper colonies is found there. We drove into the mountains to a trail that leads to an overlook where the colony can be seen in the distance below. After laboring up the trail, we were disappointed to discover that rain and fog obscured the valley beneath us, and we could not see the colony. As we walked back to our car, we came upon a young man headed toward the overlook. I offered a polite greeting. From his answer, I could tell that he was from Germany.<br><br>I served a German-speaking mission in Austria and Switzerland in my youth. Here was a young man whose countenance bespoke a sincere heart and an approachable personality. And I spoke his language and understood his culture. The Spirit prompted me to open my mouth and introduce the gospel to him. However, due to other people being around us, our brief encounter was interrupted, and we went our separate ways without my having said a word about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I failed to be the missionary that every member of the Savior's Church ought to be.<br><br>As we drove away, I had the disturbing feeling that I had failed in my duty to proclaim the gospel. I remembered the Lord's words in section 60 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2]<br><br>I was then troubled and ill at ease while we drove around the island to see Molokai's beautiful waterfalls. After many miles, the road came to a dead end. We got out of our car to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. We had been there only a few moments when another car drove up and stopped. The young man we had seen on the overlook trail got out of his car, smiled, and gave me a warm handshake. As I grasped his outstretched hand, I thought to myself, "This time I will do my duty!"<br><br>In a few brief moments we introduced ourselves. I learned that he was a university student in a small city south of Dusseldorf, Germany. We spoke of my experiences in his country, of my fond memories of Germany, and of my admiration for the German people. Speaking of my work in Europe gave me an ideal opportunity to explain some of the basics of the gospel. As we parted, I asked for his address and telephone number, which he gladly shared with me. I felt that he was truly a newly found friend and an interested investigator.<br><br>Upon my return to Church headquarters, I promptly wrote to President John F. Charles of the Germany Dusseldorf Mission. I explained how Sister Wirthlin and I had met this outstanding young man and gave him his address. I asked President Charles to immediately send missionaries to continue the gospel discussion that I had begun on a dead-end road on Molokai.<br><br>I don't believe that it was happenstance that my wife and I met this young man twice. Our meetings were not chance encounters or mere coincidence. But the Lord doesn't always give us a second chance to share the gospel. I failed to follow the Spirit the first time that the still small voice unmistakably spoke to my heart and mind to prod me to action. I didn't do what I was being directed to do. When I saw that young man get out of his car that second time, I was relieved and said to Sister Wirthlin that I had been given a second chance. I quickly made up my mind that I would not fail a second time and that I would open my mouth as the Lord so emphatically commands in revelations that apply to all of us. In section 33 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord commands us three times in three verses to "open [our] mouths." In verses 8,9, and 10 of section 33, we read:<br><br>Open your mouths<i>and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of old. . . .</i><br><br><i>Yea,</i>open your mouths<i>and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.</i><br><br><i>Yea,</i>open your mouths<i>and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</i>[Emphasis added]<br><br>In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord reveals that one of the principal purposes of the Restoration is to proclaim the gospel--to bring truth and priesthood authority back to the earth so that missionary work can be organized and carried out as a mighty effort upon the earth in the last days. In verse 23 of section 1, the Lord explains that one of the reasons why he called Joseph Smith to his prophetic work was "that the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers."<br><br>Each one of us has the sacred responsibility to proclaim the gospel. The Savior's commandment applies to all members of the Church, not just to full-time missionaries or to returned missionaries. Whether or not we are serving or have served a full-time mission, we have the responsibility to follow the Spirit when it prompts us to share the gospel so that others can come to follow the Savior.<br><h2><b>Move! When Moved upon by the Spirit</b></h2><br>We must act when the Spirit speaks! When I hearkened to the Spirit, the young man responded positively to my message. But it wasn't really my message. It was God's message, brought to my mind by the Spirit of the Lord. I was but an instrument in the Lord's hands, led by his Spirit to open my mouth and proclaim the message of the Restoration. In opening my mouth, I became, as the Lord promises in section 33 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "even as Nephi of old" (D&amp;amp;C 33:8). Father Lehi gives this explanation of why his son was so adamant in proclaiming the gospel:<br><br><i>But behold, it was not</i>[Nephi],<i>but it was the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, which opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.</i>[2 Nephi 1:27]<br><br>I would emphasize that the Spirit will always guide and direct aright. It will protect you from temptation, enlighten your mind, and comfort your heart. In verse 12 of section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord directs, "Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit." He then goes on to promise in verses 13 and 14:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i>And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive.</i><br><br>The Holy Ghost will keep you ever vigilant, always remembering that Satan desires to have you, to "sift you as chaff before the wind" (Alma 37: 15). Listen to the still small voice and "suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing" (Alma 39:11). Avoid Satan's siren song, his alluring attractions to get you to spend your labor and money "for that which cannot satisfy" (2 Nephi 9:51; see also Isaiah 55:2). Follow the Spirit to focus your energies on that which matters most and to avoid wasting your life laying "up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt" (Matthew 6:19 and 3 Nephi 13:19). Do not trade away your eternal spiritual birthright for a mess of materialistic pottage.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Eight years ago, when I spoke in the October 1986 general conference, where I was called to serve and was sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, I shared some fundamental feelings of my heart that the Spirit brought to my mind. On that occasion, greatly humbled by the sacred trust that the Lord and his prophet President Ezra Taft Benson had placed upon me, I shared these thoughts:<br><br><i>This truth, like a towering mountain, stands out. Our religion is really the only thing we will have left ultimately, and we must love it dearly. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The gospel of Jesus Christ is more enduring than fame, more precious than riches, more to be desired than happiness. Understanding and living the gospel leads to the possession of a Christlike character. The aim of each of us is to live a great and exemplary life. A noble character is needed especially in this age when evil is rampant. . . .</i><br><br><i>Our Heavenly Father has endowed us with hearts of courage and faith, with strong wills, and with the ability to understand and to see clearly the difference between right and wrong. He has mercifully clothed us, each member, with the gift of the Holy Ghost, which gives us insight and personal power. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The light that emanates from our Savior beckons us on, undismayed. A righteous self-discipline can and will rule our lives.</i>["Pulling in the Gospel Net,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, pp. 60–61]<br><h2><b>Personal Testimony</b></h2><br>The truths of the gospel do not change. The words I spoke eight years ago ring just as true today as then. As one who has been called as a special witness of the Lord, I leave you my love and blessing. If you will follow the Christ, follow his prophet, and follow his Spirit--you will always choose the right. And as a result of your wise choices, your testimony of our Heavenly Father's plan and purpose for your life will grow stronger and great blessings of joy, happiness, and peace will be yours.<br><br>I testify to you that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. Joseph Smith was the prophet who brought in the Restoration. We have a living prophet in our midst, President Howard W. Hunter. I so testify in humility, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B. Wirthlin was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 September 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ng Discouragement - President and Sister Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rex:</b>Welcome. For some of you it's welcome back, and for others it's welcome for the first time. But for all it's welcome to BYU.<br><br>You're going to learn a lot here, including things you had not thought you would be learning. For example, I have found that BYU improves your eyesight: You can sit on the very top row of this building, or for that matter at the top of Cougar Stadium, and spot a foul that a referee standing five feet away from the action cannot see.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>It always amazes us as we look out over this large group in the Marriott Center at the beginning of each semester to see how happy and well adjusted all of you appear to be. But we know that behind each glowing countenance there are countless stories of required classes that were too full, rearranged schedules, overdrawn or nonexistent bank accounts, homework overload, feelings of inadequacy, and people you would like to date who have not yet had the good sense to see what a perfect match you would be. How do we know these things? Because we've been there before, and we have three children who are here on campus this semester.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>It is because we understand much of what you're going through that we want to talk with you today about discouragement. We are not talking about clinical depression, or anything approaching it. That is a completely different subject, and one which we are not qualified to discuss. We are talking about garden variety discouragement that we all feel and that, if not dealt with properly, can seriously impede our learning and our happiness.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Discouragement doesn't have to mean defeat, and there are ways to deal with it. It can and does happen at any age, but the more times we can work through it, the more strength we have to fight it off when it happens again. Discouragement can't be entirely avoided; it creeps up on us in a thousand little insidious ways. Often our defenses are already down. We are tired or weakened by other experiences that have robbed us of our confidence. Perhaps we have let things slide and have gotten behind in our work, or exchanged harsh words with someone. Then boom! The inevitable happens.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>So, if it's inevitable, what do we do about it? Any challenge as important and as complex as discouragement does not lend itself neatly to a simple checklist approach, and the ideas we plan to discuss with you today are certainly not exhaustive. But let us give you three ideas that we have developed and that have been helpful to us over the years. Coincidentally, the key words for all three happen to begin with the letter<i>p.</i><br><br>The first key word is<i>perspective.</i>We need to see discouragement for what it really is. Don't blow it out of proportion. And try not to worry about the things that may never happen. As Mark Twain said, "I'm an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened."<br><br><b>Janet:</b>On my first night at BYU, I fell asleep in a daze of excitement for what was ahead, nostalgia for things left behind, and apprehension about the new chapter in my life. It is always hard to close the door on a segment of our lives until we find a window and catch a glimpse of the future.<br><br>During those first few weeks, I didn't just love my classes, the mountains seemed to be closing in on me, I wondered where all the cute boys were, I missed the familiar food from home, my bed didn't feel right, I had a hard time deciding how much time to devote to each class, there were ten thousand people in my biology section (imagine what I would have thought today), and my roommates didn't like to go to sleep to my music.<br><br>I remember few times in my life when I was so discouraged. I used to walk from my dorm to the Eyring Science Center for my first class each morning almost on the verge of tears, thinking of how lonely and how far from home I was. "Was the fun part of my life over?" I used to wonder.<br><br>So many times now when I drive across campus I go past Heritage Halls, where I used to live. I think about the "me" of long ago, and I think about each one of you. Sometimes I drive slowly and try to see your faces. Occasionally, when I think I see a forlorn face, the motherly instinct in me wants to jump out and give you a hug and tell you it will be all right. I wouldn't lie to you and tell you that life doesn't have its disappointments. I would just talk with you about this all-important principle of perspective, and I would tell you what I wish I had known that first year: that life doesn't have to be perfect to be perfectly wonderful.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Student discouragement is not limited to entering freshmen, or even to undergraduates. By far my worst experience with discouragement occurred during my first year of law school. It was caused by my losing perspective.<br><br>Day after day I would put in long hours of preparation and then sit in class and be amazed that seemingly everyone of my classmates could come up with all kinds of brilliant insights while all I could do was sit there and say to myself, "Gee, I wish I'd thought of that." I honestly wondered during those first few months if I was destined to flunk out. I have since discovered that this is a common phenomenon, and it is not limited to law students. From conversations with some of you, I've learned that many face the same challenge: today's BYU students are very well prepared, and some often sit in class thinking that everyone else is getting it better than they are. My own experience taught me that another important antidote for discouragement is to never give up on yourself. Remember the fundamental principle that for any really top quality school--and BYU clearly qualifies--if you're good enough to get in, you're good enough to get out.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Keeping things in perspective as it relates to dealing with discouragement affected our own relationship early on and in a very important way. When Rex and I were dating at BYU, he surprised me one night by indicating that he felt our relationship was getting serious. But I had just begun to come to terms with my own feelings, and he was way ahead of me. All of my logic told me Rex had everything I could ever want in a husband, yet I needed that bolt of lightning to strike me and say, "This is the one!" Well, it came in a very unexpected way. For one entire week my concern was that he was getting too serious. Then one evening he suggested that we should date other people again. I was stunned, but I agreed and said good night. I was not prepared for the emotion I was about to feel. As the door closed behind me, the fear of losing him was more than I could bear. I stood frozen in the dark, leaning against the door for support. The world seemed to have stopped, and I wasn't sure that I wanted it to start again without Rex there with me. I cried as though my heart would break. How clearly now I could see the priceless gem that was almost mine, but it seemed to be slipping away from my grasp. What other girl did he have in mind when he mentioned dating "others"?<br><br><b>Rex:</b>The answer is simple: I really didn't have anybody in mind.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Yeah, right. I think he's lying.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>That's nonsense and she knows it. She can't give you the name of anyone else because there was no one else. Actually, I was sure she was the one, and quite frankly I can't explain why I suggested maybe we ought to date some other people for a while. It was probably just an irrational stalling technique.<br><br>During the intervening week I felt pretty good about the new "date other people" arrangement until she actually did what I suggested we do. That next Friday night, after having been away for a few days, I<br><br>came back to town looking forward to seeing Janet. I was stunned to learn that she was actually on a date with someone else. Apparently she had recovered from a broken heart and a world that had come to an end with amazing speed. At first I felt betrayed, then angry, and then within five minutes I realized I had brought the circumstance on myself and began to worry. When her roommates told me who her date was, my worry turned to panic. I knew the guy. How would she dare go out with someone like him? He was better looking than I, had a lot more money, and a lot better car. In terms of intelligence and righteousness, we were about dead even. But he definitely had a more engaging personality. The bottom line: On a ten-point scale, he beat me by three points. Was I now to lose out on the best deal that ever came into my life? So desperately I wanted to turn the clock back seven days, because I could see much more clearly than I had one week earlier how lucky I was to have what I had previously taken for granted.<br><br>I came back the next night. She wouldn't come out of her room. The reason, she said, was that she had washed her hair and was blowing it dry. I never could figure that one out. In the first place, I wanted to see her--whether her hair was wet or dry didn't matter two cents worth. Moreover, I'd washed my hair before. Drying time? A minute thirty seconds max.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Yes, but don't you remember that during those days you had a crew cut? You could dry your hair with a towel.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>All right, so you had more hair. But not even Samson and Rapunzel back-to-back should have taken the whole evening. Anyway, I did what any red-blooded American boy would do. I stood outside her dorm and threw rocks at her window. But all was not lost. By the next night she was ready to talk and for some reason was willing to overlook my three-point deficit.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Through that experience Rex and I came to the realization that we had brought about our own discouragement because we had lost perspective by not appreciating what we already had.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Our second suggestion for dealing with discouragement is<i>people involvement.</i>Let me tell you of a recent simple example that brought home to me how other people can help us cope with discouragement. In the BYU barbershop there is a framed picture that bears the caption<i>F-117.</i>I was told it was three-dimensional. For six months, in two-week intervals, I would look at that thing and could not see in it a picture of an airplane or anything other than a bunch of squiggly colored lines, and there was nothing three-dimensional about it. As the number of times that I looked at it without being able to see an F-117 increased, so did my frustration. Then one day, my barber, Gary Dayton, told me to stand back about ten feet and look at my reflected tie in the glass that covered the picture. It worked. The 3-D picture of the stealth bomber came into my view, and my frustration vanished. Now every time I go to get my hair cut, I stand in front of that picture with a sense of grand accomplishment, and within two or three seconds the airplane appears. And I owe it all to a friend who was willing to help me see what had already become obvious to him. He is also a fairly decent barber.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>We don't have to go through discouragement alone--nor should we even try. There are others who can help, who want to help. By the same token, there are others whom<i>we</i>can help.<br><br>When our neighbor, Jimmy, was four, he was not happy in preschool. No one could determine why. The school offered him the best toys and paints and smiling teachers. But still Jimmy cried every day. So Jimmy's mother and the director decided it would be best for him to withdraw. After a few weeks, Jimmy decided he wanted to go to a different preschool. His mother was skeptical but enrolled him in the new school. When she left him the first day, she was careful to leave a phone number, feeling certain she would receive a call. But it never came--not that day or all that week. He was happy every day and when asked what he did there, his usual reply was, "I help Bobby."<br><br>Then one day when Jimmy's mother suggested taking him out of school for the day, he burst out crying, "I can't be gone. I have to be there. Bobby needs me." It was then that she learned the source of her son's new found happiness in school. He was helping a boy with impaired muscular coordination, and both boys benefited from the relationship. Shiny red trucks, swings, or finger paints could not make Jimmy's day happy at preschool. Amidst those toys he could only think of how miserable he was and how much he missed home. But giving service to someone in need directed his interests away from his problems, gave him purpose, and made him happy.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Anyone who has learned to serve has discovered the positive effects such effort has on our own sense of well-being. Often our own discouragement can be forgotten when we are helping someone else. It is easy to understand why when we remember King Benjamin's words: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br><b>Janet:</b>After my first year here I wasn't certain I wanted to return, but within days after I arrived for my second year, I was very happy. I owe at least my initial good adjustment to some very thoughtful roommates. They were great at making other people, including me, feel good about themselves. They had learned the art of honestly looking for people's best qualities and knew how to point them out sincerely and at just the right moment, without any ulterior motive. It is often difficult for us to see what we do well without the perspective of another view. Yet we see our faults so easily. Wouldn't it be great if our days could be filled more with looking for the good in others and drawing their attention to it rather than in looking for things to criticize? Thank you Emma Jean, Kay, and Margaret for that wonderful blessing. I will always remember you and what you did for me.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Among the more obvious people to whom we can turn for help are our Heavenly Father--through scripture study and prayer--families, roommates, friends, bishop or other church leaders. And we faculty members also want to help. I will never forget the impression made on me by a particular professor when I was a student here. We used to register by standing in long lines in the Fieldhouse to enroll for each class. At the end of each line, the teacher for that particular class handed out an IBM card, if there were any left. If there weren't any left, you got in another long line. Believe me, whatever its minor disadvantages, telephone registration is a great improvement.<br><br>On my first registration day, when I finally reached the front of the line for a political science class, I found a thoroughly congenial faculty member who, to my amazement, called me by name. I had never seen him before. He knew that I was a prelaw student and said how much he was looking forward to having me in his class and giving me any help that I needed in preparing for law school. To this day I have no idea how he knew who I was or what my interests were, but that was the beginning of a relationship with Stewart Grow that would last all of his life. He not only guided me during my BYU days, but also through law school and my professional career. His advice was helpful, but even more helpful was the sure knowledge that there was always someone there who cared about me. Stewart Grow is no longer with us, but there are other faculty members just as conscientious. Take advantage of their willingness to help. In fact, the reason for the new mentoring program is that we want to help create more relationships like the one I enjoyed with Professor Grow. One of BYU's goals is to be "user friendly."<br><br><b>Janet:</b>We often don't realize the positive influence we can have on others, or how even simple acts of kindness can cheer another's day. Let me tell you of an incident that happened in our home several years ago. To set the stage, it had been a long, hard day. The keys were locked in the car, the washer overflowed, the baby had colic, the dog had thrown up on the carpet, our two-year-old had flushed her shoe down the toilet, and Rex called to say he would be late for dinner. Finding the only safe sanctuary a frazzled mother has, I closed the bathroom door behind me to cry for a minute. I thought it was a silent cry, but in no time at all a piece of red construction paper came sliding under the door. I picked it up and there, in bright blue marker, was a smiley face drawn by a perceptive eight-year-old. I couldn't help but smile, dry my tears, and reenter my wonderful, yet sometimes hectic world. How often a small gesture of hope, encouragement, and humor can cheer a day of discouragement.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Now to our third<i>p.</i>The final antidote for discouragement subsumes all the rest. Any discussion about overcoming discouragement would be totally lacking without talking about it. It is prayer. I echo Abraham Lincoln's words: "Without the assistance of the Divine Being I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail."<br><br>My own first experience with prayer on this campus occurred the very first day I arrived--or better said, the first night. Because four of us made the trip from St. Johns in a 1943 Chevrolet whose top speed was fifty miles per hour, we didn't arrive until late at night. The housing office for our dorm was closed, and so we slept that night without the benefit of mattresses, sheets, blankets, or pillows. And for some reason the electricity had not been turned on, so the place was almost pitch dark. But those slight inconveniences were not the heart of the discouragement that I felt. My world seemed to be closing in around me, and my outlook was as dark as the room I occupied. Here I was, 600 miles away from home for the first time, about to become a member of a freshman class three-and-a-half times the size of the total population of my town, and full of misgivings whether a boy from St. Johns could make it at a big university. Instinctively, I got down on my knees, put my elbows on the wire mesh that served as the springs for my unmattressed bed, and began some of the most earnest pleading with my Heavenly Father that I have ever undertaken. It helped. I knew that I was not alone, that I had a partner who was interested in me and willing to help. Though my earthly parents were located hundreds of miles to the south, my Heavenly Father was very much there with me. As I look back on it now, I'm reminded of President Thomas S. Monson's counsel that "prayer is the passport to spiritual power." In this case, my misgivings did not completely disappear, but the stifling discouragement gave way to a healthy anxiety. Used properly, this prayer passport is our most powerful possession, yet it is not an Aladdin's lamp to grant us our every desire. Our Father in Heaven knows what is best for us always and will help if we ask.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>When my sister was five, she wanted a horse, and one night as she was saying her prayers she asked for one. At the end of the prayer, she was gently advised that we do not ask our Heavenly Father for things we want to<i>have,</i>only for what we want to<i>be.</i>Properly chastised, the next night she pleaded with the Lord that if she could not have a horse, could she then<i>be</i>one?<br><br>So, how can we best use our prayer passport to cope with discouragement? One way may be to begin our prayers by first expressing gratitude. When I have been down on my knees in prayer, remembering to begin by expressing appreciation, I have been humbled and gladdened as I have enumerated blessings already in my possession. When I forget that procedure, my burdens seem greater and my cry for help dominates my thoughts. My discouragement often blocks my ability to enjoy the blessings of peace the Lord would have me feel.<br><br>Sometimes when our lives are going along just fine and we are very busy, we skip praying only to reach out occasionally when a real need arises. Yet President Howard W. Hunter reminds us, "If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our emergencies."<br><br>Our Father in Heaven<i>is</i>there for us in times of emergencies, as always. But our own ability to listen to his counsel is heightened by frequent prayer. As we pour out our hearts in gratitude as well as supplication, we humble ourselves and see things from an eternal perspective. It is with this celestial attitude that we begin to put our own temporal solutions aside--such as more money or more recognition--and in faith submit to the principle "Thy will be done." When we begin to understand eternal solutions to our problems, we find peace in being given strength to meet our challenges.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>This does not mean that we cannot express our needs through our prayers, but as in all requests, thought needs to precede the plea. After we have assessed our blessings, it will be in humility that we pour out our hearts and make known our needs. It is then in great reverence, with gratitude fresh on our lips, that we more fully realize to whom we are speaking, and in whose name we pray.<br><br>As Rabbi David Backlock said, "God not only forgives our failures, he sees successes where no one else does, not even we ourselves. Only God can give us credit for angry words we did not speak, temptations we resisted, patience and gentleness that have been little noticed and long forgotten by those around us. Such good deeds are never wasted and not forgotten, because God gives them a measure of eternity."<br><br><b>Janet:</b>In times of real discouragement and despair, I try to remember one foolproof method of coping. This method cannot be perfected in a day or in this lifetime, but giving it our best effort pays<i>big</i>dividends. What is this secret formula? It is living daily the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is this we must always remember: No matter how alone or discouraged we may feel, our Father in Heaven is always there to help us.<br><br>Recently, during a late-night visit, our daughter Melissa shared this thought with me: "The peaceful feeling I have when I go to bed each night depends much more on how I have lived my day than on anything else that's happened. If I have read my scriptures, said my prayers, written in my journal, and been kind to others, I can still feel happy and at peace even when I have had a bad day."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>The peace that comes from living the gospel as completely as we know how in every facet of our lives cannot be attained by any other means. Even in the midst of enormous problems, the peace of mind that comes from doing the will of our Father in Heaven will carry us through and make life worth living. And at the end of the day, that is the ultimate perspective that governs everything else. That we may all work toward this end, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>e Know - Truman G. Madsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A friend of mine who has spoken more than once at this lectern said to me one day, "There are no great speakers, there are only great audiences." I consider this one of the great audiences in the world, and I'm overwhelmed with a sense of destiny. I believe the world's future is being made right here.<br><br>A little boy, I'm told, wrote a letter to God (this is published in a collection of children's letters). It said, "Dear God, How do you feel about people who don't believe in you? A friend of mine wants to know." Recently I was invited to sit in on a graduate class elsewhere--a group most critical and equipped with jaw-breaking terminology and bone-breaking arguments against religion. At one point I said, "So I'll know where you're coming from, would each person here consider: If you had only one question to address to Jesus Christ, what would you ask him?" Well, most of those in the room had a grievance and said that they would ask a kind of "pick-a-fight" question. But one lad, in the corner, didn't respond, and, having been urged, finally said with a thoughtful smile, "Well, if I had only one question, I would ask, 'How am I doing?'"<br><br>Brothers and sisters, over a period of forty years I have worked in the area of "how one knows." And I can report, in a comparative mood, that there are really only five main modes that have been appealed to in all the traditions, philosophical or religious: an appeal to reason, an appeal to sense experience, to pragmatic trial and error, to authority--the word of the experts--and, finally, to something a bit ambiguous called "intuition." I can report, too, that from my judgment those five modes are harmonized and balanced in our living tradition more effectively than in any other tradition I know.<br><br>Is there a religious way of knowing? Do these modes leave anything out? To answer that, I want to speak of a religious undergirding experience and not just of religious experiences. Let me tell you that there are evidences now, widely recognized, that religious experiences are far more common than has been observed in the recent past and that they are not simply the projections of infantile regression, which is what some reductive psychological theories say. It is at least possible that the sense of God originates in God himself.<br><br>Let me begin with a few quotations from an almost-forgotten poet, historian, and eventually member of the Council of the Twelve--Orson F. Whitney. Listen.<br><br><i>Why are we drawn toward certain persons, and they to us, as if we had always known each other? Is it a fact that we always have? Is there something, after all, in that much abused term "affinity"? . . . At all events, it is just as logical to look back upon fond associations, as it is to look forward to them. We believe that ties formed in this life will be continued in the life to come; then why not believe that we had similar ties before we came into this world, and that some of them, at least, have been resumed in this state of existence?</i><br><br><i>After meeting someone whom I had never met before on earth, I have wondered why that person's face seemed so familiar. More than once, upon hearing a noble sentiment expressed, though unable to recall that I had ever heard it until then, I have found myself in sympathy with it, was thrilled by it, and felt as if I had always known it. The same is true of some strains of music</i>[some perhaps heard today];<i>they are like echoes of eternity. I do not assert pre-acquaintance in all such cases, but as one thought suggests another these queries arise in the mind.</i><br><br><i>When it comes to the Gospel, I feel more positive. Why did the Savior say: "My sheep know my voice?" Did a sheep ever know the voice of its shepherd if it had never heard that voice before? They who love the Truth, and to whom it most strongly appeals--were they not acquainted with it in a previous life? I think so. I believe we knew the Gospel before we came here, and that is what gives to it a familiar sound.</i>["The Undiscovered Country,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 23 (December 1919), p. 100]<br><br>Now put with that the lines from Eliza R. Snow that we sing and feel, "Oft times a secret something whisper[s], 'You're a stranger here.'" That's what a friend of mine calls "celestial homesickness." But it is also, I will add, a feeling that we are here on purpose--that we haven't just wandered "from a more exalted sphere," but that we are where we ought to be (see "O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292). That sometimes comes through in a sense that we have seen it or felt it or experienced it before. We are at home at sea. And so I suggest that, as a premise, rather unique to our tradition, recognition, spiritually speaking, is indeed<i>re</i>cognition, that some discovery is<i>re</i>covery, that recollection is the<i>re</i>collection of images from before.<br><br>B. H. Roberts once said that "Faith [and he meant faith in Christ or trust in Christ] is simply trust in what the spirit learned aeons ago." Behind that statement are two sovereign truths from our modern revelation. One is that "Man is spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33). Yes, also embodied, but man is spirit. It is even said that man<i>is</i>the spirit of truth from the beginning (see D&amp;amp;C 93:23). Hence, says modern revelation, all intelligence, being independent, can either welcome or suppress and repress the Spirit. And if we do not receive it, we are told, we are under condemnation (D&amp;amp;C 93:30–31). On the other hand, if we do receive it, then we are told that light grows "brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><br>The other truth is that<br><br><i>the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:45–46]<br><br>Question: Is it then the case that this beginning light is in everyone? Is it a universal experience? There is enough impact, even in the so-called secular world, that Jung, for example, posits a collective unconscious. You don't just remember your own autobiography. You remember somehow the whole racial experience. And thus, he says, a fourteen-year-old girl can have dreams of all the archetypes of human consciousness though she has never experienced them directly in this world. Or again, Joseph Campbell, the great student of comparative religion and myth, wants to say that myths express the depths of man more effectively than so-called prosaic or propositional truths. Some Eastern philosophers, convinced that we have more in our minds than can be accounted for by this life, have concluded that reincarnation or even transmigration is the only explanation. William James once argued that, because of this same phenomenon, there may be a reservoir of spiritual insight which not just exceptional persons but the ordinary man can occasionally break into and recognize. Rudolph Otto has written about the idea of the holy and calls it the "numinous," just as the word luminous refers to light. This is the sense of the sacred that he holds is universal and isn't discovered or learned, but somehow given. Many of the theists among modern writers in existentialism have talked about a "depth-self" that even our own best introspection cannot reach.<br><br>Now let me quote from the Prophet Joseph Smith leading into reason for a moment. He says,<br><br><i>Every word.</i>. .<i>of Jehovah has such an influence over the human mind--the logical mind--</i>[And I interrupt to say that I think he doesn't mean simply one trained in formal logic--Aristotelian or Russellian--but a mind that hasn't been cluttered by the notion that in religion the more contradictions you find the better, that piling paradox on paradox somehow indicates truth. No.]<i>that it is convincing without other testimony. Faith</i>[or trust]<i>comes by hearing</i>[the word]. [<i>The Words of Joseph Smith,</i>comps. and eds. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon Cook (Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980), p. 237]<br><br>Many of you will encounter, if you haven't, traditional rational arguments for the existence of God. They are all of them afflicted with fallacies. They presuppose in the premises what they claim to demonstrate in the conclusion. And, further, they presuppose in their premises something about the very nature of God.<br><br>I suggest that little is given in holy writ that can be called an argument for the existence of God. I suggest that instead of argument there is witness--witness to experience. God is not at the end of a syllogism. But rationality and a mind illumined enable us to follow certain clear inferences from proper and authentic premises.<br><br>What about witness? That leads us both to the question of authority and the question of our own testimony. Said the Prophet again, "No generation was ever saved or [for that matter] destroyed upon dead testimony" (<i>Words of Joseph Smith,</i>p. 159). I think he means by "dead" the record of the remote past. We're not fully accountable to that, but we are accountable to a living witness who bears living testimony to our living spirit. That's when we reach the zenith of responsibility. We recognize that and perhaps run from it. When a child runs away with hands over ears, what is happening? Doesn't the child already pretty well know the message? Do we cover our ears while saying, "I didn't hear you"?<br><br>Heber C. Kimball, without being grammatical, put the point elegantly after the outpourings of the Nauvoo Temple. He said, "You cannot sin so cheap no more."<br><br>Many students have said to me over the years, "I'm afraid to pray because I'm afraid I won't get an answer. I'm not sure I could handle that."<br><br>I have sometimes said, a little cruelly, "The problem may be exactly the reverse. You're afraid to pray because you are afraid you will have an answer, and you already have a shrewd guess as to what it will be." So if we know what's bad for us, we will neither listen to nor bear testimony. But if we know what's good for us, we will. And our spirits know.<br><br>Hence, Brigham Young once said, "More testimonies are gained on the feet than on the knees"--by which he meant that when you are on record and in the presence of others, and are trying to be truthful, and you consult the depths of your own soul, you yourself may learn how profoundly you know.<br><br>Zina D. H. Young once walked into a room where there was a copy of the Book of Mormon on a windowsill. She had never seen it and, therefore, of course, had never read it. She walked over and felt a certain warmth and aura and held it and then hugged it, murmuring, "This is the truth, truth, truth!" (<i>Young Woman's Journal 4:318).</i>I would call that an "a priori" testimony. (Later she read it.)<br><br>I know a man who knelt down to say, "Oh, God, is this book true?" and then interrupted himself, "Oh, never mind. I already know. It's true."<br><br>A marvelous woman who read part of a chapter in my<i>Eternal Man</i>(a chapter really not all mine--I was only citing scripture) shook my hand to thank me. "You know," she said, "I read almost all night, and I laughed all night."<br><br>That changed my expression. She said, "I don't mean that the way it sounds. You see, I would say to myself, 'I've always known that. But I didn't know I knew (laugh).'"<br><br>She said, "It wasn't the 'Ho, Ho, Ho,' and it wasn't the 'Ho hum' either. It was the 'Aha' experience."<br><br>Whenever that happens, there is an accompanying lift. It is exhilarating, and even things that you've heard over and over have new zest and tingle and deepen understanding. Students have said to me and to my colleagues here, "Thank you for teaching me so and so." But the "so and so" was something I did not know, or at least did not attempt to teach that day. A better voice than mine was whispering under my voice, something that they were then ripe and ready for, and it came. Said the Prophet Joseph again,<br><br><i>All things whatsoever God in his infinite wisdom has seen fit and proper to reveal to us, while we are dwelling in mortality, in regard to our mortal bodies, are revealed to us in the abstract, and independent of affinity of this mortal tabernacle, but are revealed to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies at all</i>[like a laser beam, I suggest];<i>And those revelations which will save our spirits will save our bodies.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 355].<br><br>On the senses, a colleague at an eastern university said to me one day, "Yes, I've heard you Mormons have a sixth sense. You do. It is the sense that enables you to swallow this nonsense called Mormonism." Even if you conclude with certain scientific naturalists that anything that is nonsensory is nonsense, that is an endorsement, in a measure, of your heritage. Said Erastus Snow, referring to the Prophet,<br><br><i>Joseph taught that the Spirit of the Lord underlies all our natural senses, that is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. The Spirit communicates with the spirit of man and enlivens all the other senses.</i>[BYU Special Collections, MSS. 44, Folder 5]<br><br>We are almost unique in this view.<br><br>Creative, as well as scientific, people prize accurate observation and all the instruments that have presently become available to intensify it, in the macrocosm and the microcosm. And they also strive to express what they have learned in either the mathematical forms or in the creative arts, a fullness of expression in another language. This is the platform for scientific and aesthetic effort. The senses, far from being disparaged and denied, are as eternal as the spirit.<br><br>A famous example of logical positivism is, "Can you verify that there are mountains on the other side of the moon?" (which are presently unseeable).<br><br>"Yes," they say, "in principle they are verifiable. One can conceive of the conditions under which they could be seen." True. Some who came back from space--cosmonauts, I believe--were reported in the press to have said that they didn't find God out there. President Spencer W. Kimball commented that if they had stepped outside their space capsule, they might have.<br><br>God and angels and spirits are observable, and in due time we will have the opportunity for confirmation of the very senses as we now have of the spirit. Jesus Christ did say, "Handle me, and see" (Luke 24:39).<br><br>Now from Lorenzo Snow,<br><br><i>We were selected, ordained, and set apart there</i>[Where? In the prior life]<i>according to our worthiness and preparation and training to come forth when our preparation fitted clearly into the great plan of our Father. And as we live worthy</i>[and perhaps not otherwise]<i>the Holy Spirit brings this knowledge to this body, and that is the only way we become acquainted with the knowledge of our spiritual understanding. This body must get acquainted with former pre-existent experiences through being revealed to, and made a part of, this flesh.</i>[<i>Journal of John Whitaker,</i>6 April 1894]<br><br>Said Joseph F. Smith,<br><br><i>If Christ knew beforehand</i>[and he's talking about the certain foreknowledge that Jesus must have had in order to volunteer for his mission],<i>so did we. But in coming here, we forgot all, that our agency might be free indeed, to choose good or evil, that we might merit the reward of our own choice and conduct. But by the power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ, through obedience, we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former home.</i>[Yes, the spark. Someday the whole flame.] ["Spirit Memories,"<i>GD,</i>pp. 13–14]<br><br>Elder Parley P. Pratt, who gave this considerable thought, once wrote that it is when we are off-guard that some of these insights spring up unbidden. You need to pay attention to them and try to remember them because they are fleeting and elusive. But, said he, for example, at night as you are approaching quiet slumber, when the outward organs are resting, then "some faint outlines, some confused and half-defined recollections of that heavenly world" may come, "and those endearing scenes of their former estate" enable spirit to commune with spirit. "Soul blends with soul, in all the raptures of mutual, pure and eternal love" (see "Dreams,"<i>Key to the Science of Theology</i>[Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon &amp;amp; Sons, Co., 1891], p. 126).<br><br>Said Brigham Young,<br><br><i>The spirit is pure, and under the special control and influence of the Lord.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Recollect, brethren and sisters, everyone of you, that when evil is suggested to you, when it arises in your hearts, it is through the temporal organization. When you are tempted, buffetted, and step out of the way inadvertently; when you are overtaken in a fault, or commit an overt act unthinkingly; when you are full of evil passion, and wish to yield to it, then stop and let</i>[that's different than make; it presupposes that the spirit wants this]<i>the spirit, which God has put into your tabernacles, take the lead. If you do that, I will promise that you will overcome all evil, and obtain eternal lives. But many, very many, let the spirit yield to the body, and are overcome and destroyed.</i>[<i>JD</i>2:256]<br><br>So the spirit has a mind of its own, and it is strong, and it speaks with authority. The spirit is saturated with intelligence. The spirit is what prevents you from sinning wholeheartedly.<br><br>Now what about authority? Do you want to hear the party line of those of us who get a little bit paranoid because of abuse from a person who has clout and is over us? (I've often wanted to say that Jesus Christ never lords it over us but under us. He comes down and lifts from below. What about that authority?) We sometimes say in the party line, "Be independent. You don't have to listen to anyone else. What is this stuff about 'Take my word '?" But you belong to a tradition where the word of the prophets is,<i>"Don't</i>just take my word for it. That is blind." How do you know a prophet is a prophet? Only when you are one. Only when you are actuated by the same Spirit. And that's the way you prove the prophetic mantle and how it applies to you.<br><br>Said the Prophet Joseph Smith after one of the most revelatory meetings in his life, "There was nothing made known to these men [the Twelve] but what will be made known to all the Saints of the last days, so soon as they are prepared to receive" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 237). This is the religion of every man. Not "Take my word for my experience," but "Duplicate it in your own life." How far do I go with this? All the way.<br><br>Let me then come to a close. I have hiked, with my wife and at night, all the way from the base of what is known as Mt. Sinai to the top. (Incidentally, with a very sore toe. Climbing hurts, and the more you climb, sometimes the more it hurts.) We went up to where the air is thinner and the veil thinner. There isn't time to describe the feeling, but we were able to recollect that Moses, there, had face-to-face communion with God. He came back down and said to the children of Israel, in the name of the God whose name he knew, "Now, you are invited to go back up with me."<br><br>And they said, "Thank you. No. That's for prophets. That's for people who are a bit fanatical. We will stay here and you go up, Moses."<br><br>In his absence they built an idol. The power of religious impulses goes in many directions. They built an idol--a thing--and were denied the privileges of Moses (D&amp;amp;C 84:23–25). That is what our generation is now doing again. We are staying down below and then claiming superiority for our judgment in doing so.<br><br>I bear my testimony that the ways of knowing are true. I bear testimony that there is locked in you, under amnesia, power greater than you can presently imagine. And I bear my testimony that if it is true, then you don't need to leave this room and go anywhere else to investigate, for it has reverberated in your souls. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Truman G. Madsen was a BYU professor emeritus of philosophy when this devotional address was given on 20 September 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>gy and Repentance - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm happy to be here today to speak of faith in our divine Redeemer. I feel close to him, and the music has enhanced that feeling. I am pleased that so many of you came today. I plan to speak on repentance, and it is good to have so many sinners here to preach to.<br><br>As we approach the weighty matters of repentance, let us remember the positive side of our nature as well. To quote President Hinckley:<br><br><i>You are an inspiration, in every sense, and a bright and glowing hope for the future of this work in all the earth. ...</i><br><br><i>I hope ... that ... there will be in each of your hearts a resolution to live nearer to the limitless self that lies within you. I am not asking for perfection; I am asking for greater effort. ...</i><br><br><i>You are ... of God, each of you, endowed with something of his divinity. . . . You cannot afford to live beneath that portion of divinity. You cannot afford to hide it or to set it aside.</i>["The Wonderful Thing That Is You and the Wonderful Good You Can Do," Young Women Fireside, 10 November 1985, pp. 1–3]<br><br>That is why I speak of repentance today. It is the glorious means provided by our Heavenly Father through his Son, Jesus Christ, for us to overcome the world that we may ultimately stand before him, pure and noble and deserving of the exaltation he desires to bestow upon us.<br><br>While assisting individuals who want to overcome their moral weaknesses, I have noticed problems in how they approach the repentance process. In analyzing these problems, I have found it helpful to organize the elements of repentance under three broad categories.<br><br>First is<i>self-confrontation.</i>This involves recognizing that a sin has been committed and that repentance is needed. Also, experiencing sorrow or remorse, making confession, and suffering the consequences of having broken the moral law are involved.<br><br>The second category concerns<i>self-control.</i>This requires forsaking the sin and developing a pattern of self-regulation that is incorporated into a new and morally benevolent lifestyle.<br><br>The third category concerns<i>self-sacrifice.</i>Under this heading I include restitution and reconciling, restoring, forgiving, obeying, and serving.<br><br>Today I will focus primarily on the first,<i>self-confrontation,</i>and the third,<i>self-sacrifice,</i>because these are the two areas in which I have frequently noticed deficiencies in our understanding of repentance and in our ability to implement it. To the extent that we fail to fully apply these two phases, we become vulnerable to moral relapse and to repeating the behaviors we had temporarily forsaken. We seem to do a better job of self-control by forsaking immoral conduct for periods of time while we are under the pressure of the repentance process and feeling the direction of the Lord or of a Church authority.<br><br><i>Self-confrontation</i>seems difficult for many of us. It requires understanding how we avoid the truth about ourselves and what is needed to overcome that avoidance. It is said that we must recognize our errors, feel remorse or sorrow, and make confession; but this creates an immediate threat to our self-image--and by nature we tend to protect ourselves from full disclosure of our faults or, when exposed, to justify or rationalize our misconduct.<br><br>Evidences of the fears and conflicts that are provoked by<i>self-confrontation</i>arose in a study of sixty BYU students that some of my colleagues and I did with support from the BYU Counseling Center and the BYU Comprehensive Clinic. We found it encouraging that a majority of the students reported abiding by the standards of the gospel. On the other hand, we found among those who had deviated that many avoided the repentance process as outlined in the scriptures and the writings of General Authorities.<br><br>Their ways of handling deviations were diverse, such as simply waiting until their feelings of guilt subsided; attempting to convince themselves that what they had done was really not that bad; doing something righteous to balance their account; promising themselves (and God) that they would avoid it the next time; punishing themselves by calling themselves worthless and feeling bad for one or two days; trying not to think about it; and avoiding spiritual contexts because they felt unclean.<br><br>These practices represent defense mechanisms (denial, suppression, and rationalization)--their purpose is to defend self-esteem. The students had defined themselves as righteous, and evidence to the contrary threatened their self-images. To follow the practice of confession and repentance would have required them to acknowledge their unrighteous actions. This reflects the problem of emphasizing an external image so much that honest self-disclosure is avoided (see page 97 of Bergin, A. E., Stinchfield, R. D., Gaskin, T. A., Masters, K. S., Sullivan, C. E., "Religious Lifestyles and Mental Health: An Exploratory Study,"<i>Journal of Counseling Psychology 35 [1988]: 91–98).</i><br><br>It is ironic that we fear disclosing to him who already knows what we have done. We perhaps punish ourselves more by withholding than the Lord would ever do.<br><br>This lack of a frank and full confession precludes lasting change because the person fails to fully recognize and confront the sinful conduct. In addressing this problem in<i> The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>President Spencer W. Kimball asserted that the treatment for sin must be commensurate with its seriousness. A Band-Aid is not sufficient for a deep wound. In some cases spiritual surgery is required--this begins with a confession that lays open the spiritual wound so it is exposed to the view of the self, the Lord, and, in the case of serious transgressions, to the Church leader as well. If this is not done, complete repentance is impossible.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated that repentance "is too little understood, too little applied by us all, as if it were merely a word on a bumper sticker." The Lord requires more of his disciples than "cheap repentance" or "superficial forgiveness." (See "Repentance,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, pp. 30–31.)<br><br>One of the most difficult situations I face while walking with members through the process is to realize that they confessed and repented at one time--perhaps as they prepared for a mission or to enter the temple--and then, after a period of righteous conduct, relapsed and fell. I have asked myself whether these individuals had truly repented. They seemed sincere and seemed to go through the spiritual steps required for worthiness. Were they overwhelmed later by new circumstances? Were they too weak to persist when the external controls of Church leaders and family were withdrawn? Were they rebelling against authority? Were they playing a social role in order to please others? Were they not truly converted to the inward principles of repentance? Many of these people eventually recognized that their reconciliation with the Lord required a more profound self-examination.<br><br>In order to overcome their self-justification and denial of consequences, it was necessary for them to do some self-analysis. As Sigmund Freud said, a major purpose of psychoanalysis is to "help people face unpleasant facts about themselves." Sometimes they had to follow assignments carefully and thoughtfully to review every detail of what they had done, to face the unpleasant facts about themselves in a profound way, and to understand the ripple effect of their behavior, not only on themselves, but also on their partners, their families, friends, and so forth.<br><br>As they went before the Lord in mighty prayer and confessed fully and frankly exactly what they had done, step-by-step, intention by intention, they began to realize more deeply how they had betrayed the Lord who loves them; how they had violated their own ideals as followers of the Savior; and how they had betrayed, in many cases, sacred covenants. This self-examination is like psychotherapy in that the process of spiritual reform requires overcoming defenses and accepting painful self-awareness. It is an exercise in honesty, guided by the spirit of truth. This is not an easy thing to achieve. It is approached best by confiding deeply in a trusted confidante--sometimes a therapist, sometimes a friend, but ultimately a Church leader and our Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. This process involves suffering, and we have a natural inclination to shrink from it. Like psychotherapy, it requires us to walk in the valley of sorrow and to suffer for a time before we can reorient ourselves. President Spencer W. Kimball reminded us that "if a person hasn't suffered, he hasn't repented" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 99). Elder Dallin H. Oaks similarly stated, "The repentant sinner who comes to Christ with a broken heart and a contrite spirit has been through a process of personal pain and suffering for sin" ("Sin and Suffering,"<i>BYU 1989–90 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1990], p. 149).<br><br>Paul, Enos, and Alma the Younger certainly understood that easy and painless sorrow was not a sufficient basis for repentance. Alma said that he was "in the darkest abyss ... racked with eternal torment" (Mosiah 27:29). "Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell" (Alma 36:13). After three days and three nights of what he called "the most bitter pain and anguish of soul," he cried out to the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, and he received "a remission of [his] sins" (Alma 38:8). The Lord has said, "Every man must repent or suffer" (D&amp;amp;C19:4).<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered ... for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God ... to tremble because of pain. [D&amp;amp;C19:16–18]</i><br><br><i>Although our suffering may be intense, if we are repentant it is temporary and merely a taste of the suffering that the Savior endured for us. Suffering reminds us that faith in his atonement is the key to our release, our rejuvenation, and our redemption.</i><br><br><i>Such temporary remorseful suffering helps us learn the full nature of our immoral dispositions, and it makes our memory of misdeeds vivid. Having exposed the disease process, cleansing can then occur. When we have been thus washed clean, we are less likely to repeat the error. We learn from such profound experience that recognition, remorse, and confession are all part of a single process requiring the submission of one's way of being and living to the will and grace of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>In Christ we have a glorious hope that the sun will rise again upon our despair and reveal the glory of our eternal possibilities. Alma put it this way:</i><br><br><i>There could be nothing so ... bitter as were my pains. ... On the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i>[Alma 36:21]<br><br>It has been my privilege to walk through the valley of sorrows with many individuals as they have faced the enormity of their sins and their effects upon the lives of others. These individuals have been involved in all forms of misconduct.<br><br>Consider the person who has betrayed the trust of the Lord and of his girlfriend by pressing for and getting physical pleasure. He is a returned missionary who has been endowed in the temple and made solemn covenants regarding virtue. He is devastated but cannot face reality. He makes excuses. He hides his sin and may even prepare or go through a temple marriage without disclosure. What can be done for people who are afraid, who fear punishment, who worry about rejection by family, or social slights, or Church discipline, and may be accustomed to being honored and admired?<br><br>Where would such a person get the extra motivation needed to face the pain of accurate self-assessment? Numerous things can help, but there are three fundamental keys to change: faith in the Lord, the courage to act, and a feeling of being loved. Even if discipline or rebuke is involved, it is never optimal unless the person being disciplined feels loved by the one disciplining.<br><br>It is crucial when we are into self-confrontation that our courage be encouraged. We need someone we can cry out to in pain, remorse, and full emotional expression. But such exposure of the tender and vulnerable aspects of ourselves does not usually occur unless trust exists. The sinner needs the confidence of knowing that the listener is not there to hurt but to hear, to understand, to console, and to resonate to our sense of guilt and despair.<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter has encouraged us to bear each other's burdens. He said:<br><br><i>To those who have transgressed or been offended, we say, come back. To those who are hurt and struggling and afraid, we say, let us stand with you and dry your tears.</i>["President Howard W. Hunter: Fourteenth President of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1994, p. 5]<br><br>Surely the Good Shepherd will also hear our pleas and know of our suffering. We must never think that we are unworthy to approach him in prayer. To him we can pour out everything if we know he loves us beyond measure and gave himself for us. I recall the little song I learned as a child in Protestant Sunday School: "Jesus loves me, this I know / For the Bible tells me so." I hope that each person here knows this--that the Lord loves you. With confidence in that love, you can bare your soul to him, knowing that his tender care will prevail and that he will help you face the difficult steps that must be taken as you become a better person.<br><br>Then, if we persist in doing his will, his healing endows us with a newness of life. He said:<br><br><i>Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C19:23]<br><br>Many individuals have come to terms with their own defects and have succeeded in experiencing the joy of forgiveness, the exalting feeling of being reconciled with the Lord. I rejoice with these individuals because they have faced themselves. Some, knowing that they would be disciplined by the Church, even excommunicated, have said boldly, "I will do whatever it requires to be reconciled with the Lord and to be on good terms with the Church once again and to be free from the affliction that my own actions have caused." Others have said, "If it is necessary for me to be dismissed from the university, then I will accept it." They have chosen the course of righteousness and have dropped out for a period of time while repentance became complete. I have been happy to see other individuals involved in same-sex attractions and opposite-sex addictions overcome their problems. They have married, had families, and now for many years have lived fruitful lives within the framework the Lord has set. Some have overcome severe temptations that were complicated by disturbances within their families and their childhood development. They have gone through therapy that has helped reduce the intensity of their motives to do the wrong thing, and as a result they have become not only clean but mentally healthy. Their efforts have been blessed. They have been healed!<br><br>I recall a person who was in despair because she could not seem to stop patterns of relating that continually got her into morally compromising situations. She had tried hard to repent and to achieve self-understanding. I learned that she had seen many therapists, but none had helped sufficiently. As we talked, I realized that she was suffering from complex emotional conflicts. If such emotional conflicts are untreated or not properly diagnosed and skillfully treated, they can repeatedly undermine efforts to change. This can cause relapses in efforts to repent.<br><br>I explained to my friend that her problem was complex and that her reports showed her previous counseling was inadequate for her case. We then arranged for therapy with a person skilled in treating her type of problem. A few months later she appeared at my office aglow with optimism. She was working hard and succeeding in unraveling the strands of emotional dysfunction that had impaired her ability to gain self-control. She is on the way to a more fulfilling life because her self-understanding and her knowledge of the gospel are no longer clouded by the pathology of the past. Counseling can be very helpful if the technique is correct, the counselor is skilled, and the method is in harmony with gospel principles. But, as Elder Richard Scott has pointed out, after all we can do, it is the Lord who heals us and blesses us to go forward in a new way of life (see "To Be Healed,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, pp. 7–9).<br><br>Another problem is that some of us engage in overrepentance. Such individuals feel perpetually guilty about things that were not their fault or about very minor matters. They imagine they have sinned when they haven't, or they anticipate that they will sin in the future. Such obsessional preoccupations and depressing self-criticism is not in keeping with the spirit of the gospel. Such individuals need to liberate themselves from their agenda of self-punishment.<br><br>Elder Oaks has stated that<br><br><i>one of Satan's most potent techniques of discouragement is to deny the power of the atonement by persuading a sinner that God cannot or will not forgive him or her. ... We should teach the discouraged that part of the process of repentance is to let go of our sins, to yield them up to God and follow his example by forgiving ourselves as he forgave us.</i>[<i>Sins, Crimes and Atonement,</i>address to CES Religious Educators, 7 February 1992, p. 12]<br><br>I once interviewed a young woman who believed she had grossly sinned. She had done some things that were not right though they were not grossly deviant. She had corrected them and lived a good life for several years. The passage of time is a good test of repentance; nevertheless, she continued to feel guilty for the past. In the midst of our interview I felt inspired to tell her that I believed the Lord had forgiven her. That moment of inspiration was felt by her as well, and she felt completely relieved from her sense of guilt. It was a miracle of forgiveness. Others in the ward remarked later about what a changed person she was, though they knew nothing about our interview. A light had turned on in her, and it did not go out again. She became a joyful individual because she was truly free from guilt and she knew that the Lord loved her.<br><br>Recognizing that healthy self-confrontation lays the basis for effective self-control and willing self-sacrifice, let us now examine the specific role of self-sacrifice.<br><br>In this third aspect of repentance we become truly allied with the Savior. Prematurely concluding repentance in a self-satisfied feeling of having confessed and forsaken our sins prevents us from solidifying our personal reform and limits our capacity to develop a truly Christian lifestyle. Self-sacrifice depicts the broad range of elements in the repentance process that are necessary to make repentance complete. This is not only a matter of restitution in the sense of returning a stolen item, but also of extending the necessary effort to alter the fabric of relationships, the negative consequences, or mistrust and broken covenants that need to be corrected. We often shrink from the effort required to make these corrections, but such self-sacrificing effort is an essential part of redeeming the situation. The Savior has said: "Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit" (3 Nephi 9:20). This obligation is fulfilled in part by self-confrontation and self-control because we suffer in humility and we give up needs, habits, or indulgences as we forsake sinful ways. But self-sacrifice is not completed until we reconcile, restore, forgive, obey, and serve in love.<br><br>To reconcile and restore requires an analysis of our relationships--the harm, alienation, bad examples, and so forth that we have participated in. Like the analysis of self, this analysis of the social consequences of our actions requires the courage to face unpleasant facts about our conduct and unpleasant feelings people may have toward us. Making contact with some of the individuals one was involved with in the past is not always wise, but often a great deal can be done to correct the past relationships. If they have been partners with us in sin, we must help them reform their lives by taking appropriate steps. Assignments can be given and reports made. If they suffer innocently due to our actions or bad example, we must make personal contact and help make up for losses of faith, friendship, position, or possessions. What was broken should be fixed. What was lost should be restored.<br><br>One young man donated to a victim reparation fund. Another met with family members to make amends for afflictions produced by her abuse of one family member. Another has written letters to persons offended and others influenced by his bad example. Another contacted his home stake president to explain how he had lied to him before his mission, and a reconciliation followed. I've been pleased with the reports I've received from family members, friends, and associates, who have been encouraged by the healing effect of an individual who has sincerely attempted to make restitution. This requires going back and making amends in a way that is more profound than simply saying, "I'm sorry." Where there are amends that cannot be made personally, individuals have the opportunity to compensate for the past by serving others in a profound and extensive way.<br><br>All of these are efforts to alter the negative effects of actions that tend to ripple through the lives of people affected by our deviations from the Lord's standards of conduct. Sometimes we do not realize how widespread the effects of our actions become--including our impact upon clerks, employers, police, insurance agents, parents, church leaders, extended families, siblings, and peers.<br><br>We also need to sacrifice our inclination to judge others who have sinned. As we are forgiven, we must forgive: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12). As we feel loved by and reconciled with the Lord, we also must love and reconcile with those who may have harmed us.<br><br>Finally, we are asked to take up the cross of Jesus and walk in a new life. Our spiritual capabilities are fully restored as we keep the commandments that define a Christian Latter-day Saint lifestyle and as we serve the needs of others. This may be via formal callings such as home or visiting Teacher or missionary, or it may be through informal sustaining of others in times of special need. And we may help others in the larger community and in world service. Some have assisted others in Deseret Industries, schools for the handicapped, the Food and Care Coalition, crisis lines, and the BYUSA community service programs. All such efforts help to anchor personal reform in a new pattern of faithful and fruitful living. This needs to be done for a lifetime, with service built into one's lifestyle. Individual and community service of various kinds can help a person develop empathy for the needs and suffering of others and also develop a great desire to avoid doing any of the things that cause harm to the social fabric, to the love and trust of the Lord, to the Church, and to the family. When the new pattern is well established, sinful indulgences and negative actions become so foreign as to be unthinkable. Virtue then garnishes our thoughts, and our confidence becomes strong in the presence of the Spirit of the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C121:45). Reform is completed, and relapse is prevented. The heart is changed mightily (see Alma 5:12–14).<br><br>I hope you feel close to the Lord today, as I do. I ask you to recognize that the themes of repentance--<i>self-confrontation, self-control,</i>and<i>self-sacrifice--</i>are all undergirded and overarched by faith in the example, teachings, commandments, and atonement of Jesus Christ. Please remember again the words of President Hinckley: "You are [the offspring] of God, each of you, endowed with something of his divinity. ... You cannot afford to live beneath that portion of divinity."<br><br>And remember the words of the Savior himself:<i></i><br><br><i>Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world . . . , to save the world from sin.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved. [3 Nephi 9:21–22]</i><br><br>Let us then, brothers and sisters, make our repentance complete so that when we come unto him we are worthy to be saved by his loving sacrifice. I know that he lives and that he is near, perhaps nearer than we think. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Allen E.

<h1>d Covenants: The Honor Code - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be here this Tuesday when all of us are basking in the afterglow of Saturday's victory. I congratulate Coach Edwards and his associates. I compliment most warmly the members of the team. I remind the coaches of the words of Casey Stengel, who, after winning the 1958 World Series, said, "I could'na done it without my players."<br><br>Our special elation is understandable. BYU beat the team that over all the years of football has been considered most formidable. Notre Dame is the university that won seven Heisman trophies and eleven national championships. It is the school of the Knute Rockne tradition of the Four Horsemen, of Joe Montana and other greats--the Fighting Irish of South Bend. Last Saturday's contest was a particularly interesting one. Here were the teams of two great universities, each sponsored by a religious institution. Notre Dame can take consolation from the fact that they have won two out of the three games BYU has played with them. But it was sweet victory on Saturday, and I think the sports pages of every major newspaper in the country must have carried something on Sunday of the name<i>Brigham Young.</i><br><br>It was a great victory. But it was one game in a series of many. With that one behind us, we face the future. What we do in the weeks ahead will determine whether we are champions or also-rans. For as Ecclesiastes says, "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong," but to them that endure to the end (Ecclesiastes 9:11). And this brings me to the message I have this morning. This is Honor Week at BYU, and it has been suggested that I say something concerning the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards.<br><br>I suppose there are many who wonder why a great university need have an honor code. Isn't it rather childish, you may think, to require at a university that men and women with your maturity should be asked to subscribe to a code of conduct and a code of dress? Admittedly, it is a rather rare thing in this day and time. But codes of behavior are not new, nor are they out-of-date.<br><br>Athens in Greece was once recognized as the great and unique city of the world. Edgar Allan Poe wrote of "the glory that was Greece, And the grandeur that was Rome" (<i>To Helen</i>[1831], stanza 2). It was not only a seat of government but of learning and commerce, of art and science. Each young man of Athens, when he reached the age of eighteen, took this oath:<br><br><i>We will never bring disgrace on this our City by an act of dishonesty or cowardice.</i><br><br><i>We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the City, both alone and with many.</i><br><br><i>We will revere and obey the City's laws, and will do our best to incite a like reverence and respect in those above us who are prone to annul them or set them at naught.</i><br><br><i>We will strive increasingly to quicken the public sense of civic duty.</i><br><br><i>Thus in all these ways we will transmit this City, not lessened, but greater and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.</i><br><br>[Adapted from the ephebic oath, cf. Phillip Harding, ed. and trans.,<i>Translated Documents of Greece and Rome 2</i>:<i>From the End of the Peloponnesian War to the Battle of Ipsus</i>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 133–35 (109A)]<br><br>That solemn commitment and its subsequent expression in the lives of the young men of Athens became the foundation of principle and behavior that made Athens the cultural capital of the world.<br><br>Presidents of our nation, justices of the Supreme Court, our legislators, and public officers of many levels raise their arms to the square and solemnly pledge to uphold the laws of the land and prosecute their responsibilities with fidelity and honor.<br><br>The marriage ceremony of many faiths, including our own, is a covenant made in solemnity.<br><br>All of us in this country who are citizens of this nation salute the flag and pledge our allegiance to it and to the nation for which it stands.<br><br>Jehovah of old made a covenant with Abraham and his posterity that he would be their God and they would be his people.<br><br>Codes and covenants are as old as mankind and as contemporary as marriage.<br><br>I remind you that the Honor Code of Brigham Young University was not initiated by the board and the administration. It is an outgrowth of the action of a group of students who felt strongly that the acceptance of a code of honor by those who attended this school would have a salutary effect upon all.<br><br>By an evolutionary process it has continued, with modifications, until it has become the standard behavior of those of the university and has been endorsed by its board of trustees. It is for all students to accept and agree to live by--a statement of principle concerning honesty, charity, purity, modesty, and commitment.<br><br>It is not an inflexible law written in tablets of stone. It is a code of conduct. It is a statement of principles. It is a guide and a reminder concerning expected deportment. It is no more than might be expected of any good Christian, and no less than might be required of one who comes to this great institution sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The code is a guide, not a rigid set of rules. It does not address every specific issue. It is a table of standards, set forth clearly enough that there can be no question concerning what is expected and yet flexible enough to allow some freedom in application.<br><br>It represents an attempt to express, in terms of expected behavior, the principles set forth in the thirteenth article of faith:<br><br><i>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. ... If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</i><br><br>That, I submit, is a remarkable statement. I know of none other that, if followed, will more surely lead to behavior that is ennobling, reasonable, practical, and uplifting. Perhaps we may not always be able to measure up to all of its implications, but we can make the effort. As Robert Browning said, "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?" (<i>Andrea del Sarto</i>[1855], lines 97–98).<br><br>Is observance of the code too much to expect from any of us? I think not. Every one of you who is enrolled in this great institution and everyone who is a member of its faculty or its staff is part of a family unique and unusual. You are, in a very real sense, a chosen people. You have been selected through a rigorous process and found to be deserving of what this institution has to offer. That offering includes the opportunity for a first-class education for the students and a wonderful teaching environment and challenge for the faculty.<br><br>Much has been given; much is expected; and I am grateful to be able to say that the response on the part of most of the faculty and students is overwhelmingly in full and complete accord with the principles of the Honor Code, as well as the Dress and Grooming Standards.<br><br>I thank you for the manner in which you confront the intellectual challenges you meet every day. I thank you for making this institution a city set upon a hill whose light cannot be hid (see Matthew 5:14). I am sorry that we cannot accommodate all who wish to come here. But I am grateful that the university is so successful in accomplishing its twin objectives--of imparting first-class secular education combined with the teaching and advocacy of the gospel of Jesus Christ--that many more than we can possibly accommodate wish to come and drink at these waters.<br><br>Now, I am going to take the risk of talking briefly about each of the five general elements that go into the Honor Code. I hope you will not think I am simply moralizing. I hope you will not feel that I am just one more in a long procession of preachers advocating today a return to old values. No! We are not returning--these values have always been taught here and are now being taught here. I anticipate they always will be. And you have become, by the goodness of your living, the shining example of the virtue of such values.<br><br>1. I begin with the simple word<i>honesty.</i><br><br>We believe in being honest and true.<br><br>Walter Lippmann once said:<br><br><i>You don't have to preach honesty to men with a creative purpose. Let a human being throw the energies of his soul into the making of something, and the instinct of workmanship will take care of his honesty.</i><br><br><i>... A genuine craftsman will not adulterate his product. The reason isn't because duty says he shouldn't, but because passion says he couldn't.</i>[<i>Elbert Hubbard's Scrap Book</i>(New York: Wm. H. Wise &amp;amp; Co., 1923), p. 62]<br><br>It is interesting to me to note that five of the Ten Commandments deal essentially with honesty in its broadest sense.<br><br>"Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13). It is an act of the worst kind of dishonesty to take away the life of another.<br><br>"Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14). Adultery involves rank dishonesty. It becomes a betrayal of the solemn covenants of marriage.<br><br>"Thou shalt not steal" (Exodus 20:15). Stealing is obviously an act of dishonesty. It covers the whole broad field of theft, of cheating, of plagiarism, of lying, of deceit, of taking to oneself that which belongs to another. It is reprehensible, inexcusable, and a violation of a standard of conduct that lies at the bedrock of civilization.<br><br>"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour" (Exodus 20:16). Falsehood is dishonesty. The malicious spreading of untrue accusations in an effort to injure another is one of the most vicious kinds of dishonesty. Said Shakespeare:<br><br><i>Good name in man and woman,...</i><br><i>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</i><br><i>Who steals my purse steals trash;...</i><br><i>But he that filches from me my good name</i><br><i>Robs me of that which not enriches him,</i><br><i>And makes me poor indeed.</i><br>[<i>Othello,</i>act 3, scene 3, lines 155–61]<br><br>"Thou shalt not covet" (Exodus 20:17). Coveting is dishonest in its nature. It partakes of the greedy desire to have that which belongs to another. It is evil because it leads to evil consequences.<br><br>Can there be any question why those who partake of the blessings of this great institution should not subscribe to a code of honesty?<br><br>2. The same question may be raised concerning<i>charity.</i><br><br>"Charity," as Moroni reminds us, "is the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47). It embraces kindness, a reaching out to lift and help, the sharing of one's bread, if need be, and a spirit of civility in dealing with others.<br><br>As Paul reminds us, "Charity never faileth" (1 Corinthians 13:8).<br><br>I rented a house once to a graduate student from the Midwest who had come to work on a doctorate in physics under Thomas B. Parmley at the University of Utah. Dr. Parmley is still alive, now in his nineties. This student said to me:<br><br><i>Dr. Parmley is the most remarkable teacher I have ever known. He has a sense of charity coupled with an expectation of excellence. He will not let a student fail.</i><br><br><i>When he has a student who is having a difficult time, he assigns an A-grade student to work with him. The result is that the one who was stumbling comes to understanding and proficiency. And the one who serves without fee as tutor gains a better knowledge of the subject and develops a wonderful sense of service and kindness toward others.</i><br><br>This is the essence of charity--to extend without price a helping, lifting hand to those in need.<br><br>Charity also includes the element of civility toward others. Civility is the root of the word<i>civilization.</i>It carries with it the essence of courtesy and politeness and consideration of others. How very much of it we have lost in our contemporary society. The lack of it is seen in the endless barrage of faultfinding and criticism spewed forth by media columnists and commentators. Lack of civility is often the cause of death and injury on the highway. It is the smirk of arrogance worn by many who think themselves superior in intellect, in riches, in station in life. Oh, how we need to cultivate a greater measure of civility in our society.<br><br>3. I move to the element of<i>purity</i>in the Honor Code. I need not belabor it. Every man and woman here knows what is expected. Each of you knows that with the strength that comes from prayer and the self-discipline that comes of practice, you can hold to the standards that you know to be right.<br><br>Among the most provocative books I have read through the years is one published back in 1968, authored by Will and Ariel Durant. They had previously written ten large volumes of the story of civilization. This little book--their last--contained the wisdom distilled out of that vast acquaintance with history. Speaking out of that experience, they wrote:<br><br><i>No one man, however brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society, for these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.</i>[<i>The Lessons of History</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968), pp. 35–36]<br><br>I need not say more on that.<br><br>4. I move to the standard of<i>modesty</i>described in the code. We live in an age of sloppy dress, sloppy grooming, and sloppy manners. We live in an era when much of dress and behavior are provocative, intended to invite curiosity and stir carnal desire.<br><br>I recognize that some have strong feelings concerning standards of dress and conduct. I can only say that in every game we play, we play by the rules. I hope you will not look upon the Dress and Grooming Standards as repressive. They have been designed with another objective in mind. Our leaders have taught through the generations that "cleanliness is ... next to godliness" (John Wesley,<i>Sermon 93, On Dress,</i>c. 1780). Neatness in dress, modesty in dress, cleanliness in person--are these too much to ask of a student body of this kind of young men and women who carry in their hearts a conviction that you are indeed sons and daughters of God, our Eternal Father?<br><br>I want to tell you that it is a refreshing experience for visitors who have been on other campuses to come here and note the difference in you, the students of Brigham Young University. Whether it be in the length of your hair, in the laundered look of your dress, in the modesty of your appearance, you add so much to the remarkable and exceptional environment of this great institution.<br><br>In matters of dress we wish neither silk nor rags. We seek for the clean look--call it a wholesome look--the bright and happy look of young men and women who walk with a sense of who they are, of what is expected of them, and of what they may become.<br><br>5. And now the final item in the Honor Code--<i>commitment.</i>It involves loyalty. It involves duty. It involves determination of objectives and the resolution to meet those objectives. It involves giving oneself without reservation to the accomplishment of a good and great purpose.<br><br>Wrote the poet Emerson:<br><br><i>So nigh is grandeur to our dust,</i><br><i>So near is God to man,</i><br><i>When Duty whispers low,</i>Thou must,<br><i>The youth replies,</i>I can.<br>[Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Voluntaries," III,<i>May-Day and Other Pieces</i>(London: George Routledge and Sons, 1867), p. 82; emphasis in original]<br><br>Everyone of you who has come here has made a commitment to give your time; to give your strength and energy; to work with singleness of purpose; to educate your mind, your heart, your hands, and your spirits so that by coming here to learn you may go forth to serve.<br><br>I know of no greater words of commitment than these given by the Lord:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>What tremendous power there is in commitment. What tremendous strength there is in singleness of purpose. What marvelous results follow commitment made to the glory of God, followed with the promise that that body which is filled with the light of Christ "comprehendeth all things."<br><br>Every returned missionary is familiar with these words that speak of commitment:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 4:2]<br><br>I remind you, yours is the unique and wonderful opportunity to come to this great university, here to learn at the feet of a dedicated faculty that knowledge of a secular nature that will qualify you to fill a place of honor and usefulness in the society of which you will become a part. Further, while in that process, you may draw nearer to God as you increase your knowledge concerning him and his eternal purposes. How great is your privilege. How strong must be your commitment.<br><br>My beloved young friends, I wish to thank you for the goodness of your lives, for your desire to learn, for your willingness to live by the rules, for your commitment to the great cause of which each of you is a part. We speak of standards and codes and principles. I commend to you these great words of Solomon:<br><br><i>These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</i><br><br><i>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</i><br><br><i>An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</i><br><br><i>A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</i><br><br><i>My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: ...</i><br><br><i>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.</i>[Proverbs 6:16–20, 23]<br><br>It is customary for the president of the Church--or at his request, one of his counselors--to speak to you at the opening of the school season. I come with that delegation of authority and responsibility. President Hunter sends his love and blessing to you. You will hear from him later in the season. I assure you of my love and of my blessing that the Lord will smile with favor upon you as you walk worthy of his blessings. May your minds be opened, may your understanding be broadened. May your appreciation and respect for all men strengthen. May your love for knowledge increase. May you walk in virtue, and may these be days rich and unforgettable as you experience the great and wonderful blessings to be had here.<br><br>I know that most of you pray for us, and I thank you for that. Please know that we pray for you and now do so in the name of him who is the light of all truth, the epitome of all goodness, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was the First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 18October 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e From Kirtland - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Ballard and I appreciate, more than words can express, being here with all of you tonight. Please know of our love and concern for each one of you. It's a wonderful thing to reach across the footprint of the satellite and gather close to the young adults of the Church. I pray that the Lord will bless me that I may have his spirit with me tonight. I have worked hard on the preparation for what I'd like to say to you. If we have the spirit of the Lord with us, perhaps we will all learn something that is worthwhile.<br><br>During this past year I was privileged to have two special experiences that have affected me deeply. One was a leadership meeting in historic Kirtland, Ohio, with Church leaders from 109 stakes and districts and 24 missions in the northeastern United States and Canada. The other was being in Nauvoo and Carthage, Illinois, with President Howard W. Hunter and President Gordon B. Hinckley to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum. I cannot adequately express the depth of my feelings of love and gratitude to these great men.<br><br>As we visited Carthage Jail, where Joseph and Hyrum were murdered, and the beautiful Smith Family Cemetery overlooking the wide Mississippi River where they are buried, I stood in reverential awe. I pay tribute to these noble brothers, my great-great-uncle Joseph and my great-great-grandfather Hyrum. I pay tribute to them for their faith and courage to sacrifice all they had, even their lives, by sealing their missions and their testimonies with their blood.<br><br>It is a blessing to know that Joseph and Hyrum, who "in life . . . were not divided, and in death . . . were not separated" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3), were instruments through whom the Lord restored his church in our day.<br><br>Tonight I would like to concentrate on the remarkable events of the Restoration that occurred in and near Kirtland, Ohio, where Joseph and Hyrum lived for seven years and where Joseph spent the majority of his adult life. It is often said that the Kirtland period is one of the least-understood periods in Church history. Kirtland is truly a holy ground of this dispensation. The Church basks in the light of revelation today to a great extent because of the great Pentecostal outpouring that Joseph and the Saints received in Kirtland.<br><br>The heavens literally opened to hundreds of our early Saints there. For many weeks surrounding the Kirtland Temple dedication, the Savior, past prophets, and angels communed directly with Joseph and Hyrum and other great leaders of our dispensation. Joseph prophesied that these Pentecostal events would "be handed down. . . to all generations" and that we should celebrate them as a "year of jubilee, and time of rejoicing" (<i>HC</i>2:432–33).<br><br>It has been said that we may yet discover that Kirtland is our most significant Church history site. Let me describe to you how important Kirtland is to the Church. In Kirtland were revealed basically all of the priesthood offices that we have in the Church today. This was the schooling period for the leaders of the Church. About one-half of the revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants were revealed there, far more than at any other location. There in Kirtland is where the School of the Prophets began. There is where Joseph made his Bible translation. There is where the Pearl of Great Price was largely translated. There is where the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants was printed.<br><br>More heavenly manifestations occurred in Kirtland than in any other place. For example, in Kirtland the Father and the Son appeared or were seen in vision four times, and the Savior was seen at least six more times by Joseph Smith. In Kirtland is where significant keys were given. The Church headquartered in Kirtland longer than in anywhere else except Salt Lake City. We built our first temple and completed our first temple ordinances in Kirtland. Time allows me to review only four sacred spots that we visited one year ago this month.<br><br>We first visited the Whitney store, where about twenty sections of our Doctrine and Covenants, including our Word of Wisdom, were received. This store served jointly as Joseph and Emma's home as well as the Church Office Building from 1832–1834. It was our first bishops' storehouse. I wish you could feel the same spirit we felt in that small School of the Prophets room in the Whitney store. It is just 11 feet x 14 feet in size. The heavens opened to about twenty men in that room as the words of the Lord authorized the organization of the First Presidency in our day. Many saw the Savior. Both the Father and Son were present as well as concourses of angels that day. I stood in the translating room (which is next to the School of the Prophets room) with three other stake and mission presidents whose forefathers were also in that same room with mine in 1832. We contemplated how our ancestors Joseph Smith, Sr., Hyrum Smith, Orson Hyde, Frederick G. Williams, and Newel K. Whitney felt as they watched Joseph dictate section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>The second place we visited was the Johnson farm in Hiram, Ohio, just a few miles from Kirtland. In the revelation room of the Johnson home, the heavens opened and sixteen revelations came to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was in that small room that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph and Sidney Rigdon. They testified of Christ as they exclaimed,<br><br><i>This is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:22–23]<br><br>We contemplated what it must have been like to have been one of the dozen men who were present in that room on that occasion and saw Joseph "in the midst of a magnificent glory." Although they were not permitted to see the vision, they testified they "saw the glory and felt the power" (Philo Dibble, "Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith,"<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>27, 15 May 1892, pp. 303–4).<br><br>Our hearts were touched as we stood in Joseph and Emma's small bedroom in the Johnson home and visualized twelve out of a mob of over fifty who burst into that bedroom and dragged Joseph from his bed on that cold night and carried him to the meadow, where they tarred and feathered him and without mercy beat him. All night the tar and feathers were removed. Joseph suffered great pain, and yet he preached to the crowd the next day and, after preaching, baptized three individuals. We stood in reverence on that same porch and pondered the power and strength of the Prophet Joseph.<br><br>At the third place we walked up the hill behind the Morley farm and stood in a grove of trees, contemplating the vision of the Father and the Son received by Joseph and two other brethren in the little log schoolhouse that used to stand there. Here Joseph ordained the first high priests in our dispensation. The adversary tried to prevent the ordinations that day. As Joseph cast the evil influence out, a great vision opened to him, and he exclaimed, "I now see God, and Jesus Christ at his right hand, let them kill me, I should not feel death as I am now" ("The Life of Levi Hancock," copied from his own journal by Clara E. H. Lloyd, typescript, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, p. 33).<br><br>Wilford Woodruff recorded an experience in that little log schoolhouse as follows:<br><br><i>On Sunday night the Prophet called on all who held the Priesthood to gather into the little log school house they had there. It was a small house, perhaps 14 feet square. But it held the whole of the Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland, and who had gathered together to go off in Zion's camp. . . . The Prophet called upon the Elders of Israel with him to bear testimony of this work. . . . And a good many . . . bore their testimonies. When they got through the Prophet said, "Brethren I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." I was rather surprised. He said, "It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world."</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1898, p. 57]<br><br>Perhaps Joseph saw congregations of priesthood and faithful sisters assembled as we are tonight. It was in Kirtland that he prophesied that we would build temples in the Rocky Mountains (Wilford Woodruff,<i>CR,</i>April 1898, p. 57). Hyrum Smith also prophesied in Kirtland that the Saints would go to the Rocky Mountains (Lorenzo Dow Young, "Lorenzo Dow Young's Narrative," in<i>Fragments of Experience: Sixth Book of the Faith Promoting Series</i>[Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1882], p. 44).<br><br>On that beautiful Morley farm we read inspirational verses from thirteen sections of our Doctrine and Covenants that were given there. We considered what it would have been like to have been present as Joseph dictated those marvelous revelations from the Lord. Can you imagine the feeling the Saints experienced as Joseph dictated these words of the Savior: "I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God" (D&amp;amp;C 45:52) or "I am in your midst, and I am the good shepherd" (D&amp;amp;C 50:44) or<br><br><i>Behold, I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not be confounded.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, and I come quickly.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49:27–28]<br><br>Witnessing this rich outpouring of heavenly instruction in Kirtland bore an unwavering witness to most of those early Saints of this: that the Lord Jesus Christ led this Church!<br><br>Finally, the fourth place was where we had the humbling and overwhelming experience of sitting in the Kirtland Temple, the site of some of the greatest spiritual events of this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Can you imagine what it would have been like for the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery to see "the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son" (D&amp;amp;C 137:3) or to see "the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit" (D&amp;amp;C 110:2) and to hear him say, "Your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice" (D&amp;amp;C 110:5) or to witness the visit of seven prophets of past dispensations? Can you imagine their feelings on dedication day as they saw the apostle Peter come into the upper pulpits and sit between Joseph Smith, Sr., and Frederick G. Williams? The reality of this experience is captured by Heber C. Kimball as he described Peter in detail. He said Peter was "very tall . . . , [had] black eyes, white hair, and stoop[ed] shoulder[s]; his garment was whole, extending to near his ankles; on his feet he had sandals" (Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967], p. 91). Brother Kimball also recounted how John the Beloved appeared to several in the Kirtland Temple near the same time.<br><br>Can you imagine how the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery must have felt as Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared to them and committed keys, dispensations, and sealing powers there--not unlike what occurred on the Mount of Transfiguration about two thousand years before.<br><br>In addition to these experiences, we reviewed some of the sixty-five revelations given in Ohio. I was reminded how boldly the Lord spoke. In section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord straightforwardly declared,<br><br><i>Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me....</i><br><br><i>Search these commandments, for they are true . . . and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:24, 37–38]<br><br>Let me share with you some of the light and doctrine the Lord showered on the Church in Kirtland. These are the words of the Lord on just a few of our important doctrines.<br><br>1. On priesthood:<br><br><i>All they who receive this priesthood receive me....</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:35, 37–38]<br><br>2. On obedience and keeping the commandments: "For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (D&amp;amp;C 1:31) or "Entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean" (D&amp;amp;C 88:86) or<br><br><i>Unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 63:23]<br><br>3. On repentance: "He that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven" (D&amp;amp;C 1:32).<br><br>4. On forgiving others: "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10).<br><br>5. On prayer: "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63) or "Pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:49) or also<br><br><i>If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:61]<br><br>6. On pride versus humility: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10).<br><br>7. On healing the sick:<br><br><i>And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon</i>[the sick]<i>in my name....</i><br><br><i>. . . He that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:44, 48]<br><br>8. On fulfilling our callings:<br><br><i>Let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.</i><br><br><i>He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:99–100]<br><br>9. On God's love and closeness to us:<br><br><i>Ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath . . . prepared for you.</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17–18]<br><br>Almost all the doctrine and the principles of the gospel appear in the revelations received in and around Kirtland.<br><br>In Kirtland the Lord gave us perhaps the clearest and most concise definition of the gospel when he said,<br><br><i>This is the gospel....</i><br><br><i>That</i>[Jesus]<i>came into the world . . . to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;</i><br><br><i>That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:40–42]<br><br>Think of the great charter of the Church Educational System that comes from Kirtland: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br>As we consider "light and truth," let me review with you in more depth what some have termed our most significant revelation to man--section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is often referred to as The Vision.<br><br>I believe that receiving this vision may have been one of the Prophet Joseph's most powerful and significant spiritual experiences. As Joseph and Sidney Rigdon prayed to understand the resurrection of the just and the unjust, this glorious vision--or actually a series of six visions--burst upon them. Joseph and Sidney literally conversed with the Lord for about one and a half hours as the Savior showed them what Joseph later said was "Eternity sketch'd in a vision from God, of what was, and now is, and yet is to be" (<i>Times and Seasons</i>4 [1 February 1843], p. 82). As it commenced, Joseph and Sidney viewed the glory of the Son on the right hand of the Father. They also beheld angels surrounding them. They were moved to exclaim, "He lives! For we saw him" (D&amp;amp;C 76:22–23).<br><br>They next saw Lucifer in the premortal world as he fell from the presence of God because of his rebellion. They then saw the sons of perdition and what will happen to them. Next they viewed visions of the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms. They learned the requirements for attaining each of these kingdoms. They learned that those who qualify "shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 76:62). They also perceived the differences in glory of these worlds. I wonder if in mortality we will ever fully realize the power and significance of this vision. Section 76 includes ten references to the conversations between the Savior and Joseph and Sidney. My dear young friends, can you imagine what you could learn if you spent one and a half hours in the presence of the Lord conversing with him and essentially having him conduct us on a guided tour of the premortal life, this earth life, and life after death? The knowledge Joseph received on the premortal existence has answered unnumbered gospel questions regarding the Council in Heaven and the creation of this world.<br><br>Joseph was commanded not to record everything that he saw in vision. As we look at his later teachings, we see what appear to be bits and pieces of this same great revelation being taught as the Saints were prepared to receive them. You see, the Prophet Joseph was not able to teach the Saints everything that he knew because they were not prepared. That is why education is constantly stressed by the Lord. That is why we encourage you to gain spiritual education by taking institute and religion classes. It is why we counsel you to read scriptures every day. It is why the Lord established the School of the Prophets. The Lord said we cannot be saved in ignorance. Can you see that this great vision described in section 76 was essentially a well from which Joseph drew pearls of knowledge throughout his life and taught the Saints as they were prepared to accept and to understand? Just think what we might be taught even today if we were prepared to receive it.<br><br>One of the key principles in section 76 is that in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding we can be taught individually through "the power of the Holy Spirit." The Lord said that this blessing can come to each of us as we "love him, and purify [our]selves before him" (D&amp;amp;C 76:116). I invite each of you to read section 76 with the spirit of wanting to understand what the Lord is teaching us.<br><br>Can you imagine what it would have been like to watch Joseph Smith receive these great revelations? He often had more than ten people in his presence. Many of these bore witness of the Spirit and the outward manifestations that were present as these revelations came to him. Typically they spoke of a whiteness or brightness that surrounded Joseph. For example, as section 76 was given, Philo Dibble wrote that Joseph "seemed to be dressed in an element of glorious white, and his face shone as if it were transparent" ("Early Scenes in Church History,"<i>Four Faith Promoting Classics</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968], p. 81). Orson Pratt was present when section 51 was received, and he testified that "Joseph's face was exceedingly white, and seemed to shine" (<i>Millennial Star</i>36 [11 August 1874], p. 498). Brigham Young testified,<br><br><i>Those who were acquainted with him knew when the Spirit of revelation was upon him, for his countenance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that influence. He preached by the Spirit of revelation, and taught in his council by it, and those who were acquainted with him could discover it at once, for at such times there was a peculiar clearness and transparency in his face.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:89]<br><br>Many were impressed with how smoothly these revelations from the Lord flowed and how, except for minor corrections such as spelling or punctuation, they required no correcting. Parley P. Pratt said,<br><br><i>Each sentence was uttered slowly and very distinctly, and with a pause between each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded, by an ordinary writer, in long hand.</i><br><br><i>. . . There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did any of these communications undergo revisions, interlinings, or corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each.</i>[<i>PPP,</i>1985, p. 48]<br><br>Those who knew Joseph best were the most astonished at this process. It was beyond Joseph's natural ability and schooling to be able to dictate such revelations from God.<br><br>One of Joseph's companions, an educator, testified to this in amazement:<br><br><i>I have known</i>[Joseph and his scribe]<i>to seat themselves,</i>&amp;amp;<i>without premeditation, ... deliver off in broken sentences, some of the most sublime pieces of composition which I ever perused in any book.</i>[William E. McLellin,<i>The Ensign of Liberty of the Church of Christ</i>1, no. 7 (August 1849), pp. 98–99]<br><br>Emma, the one who knew Joseph best, marveled that during the Book of Mormon translation, which occurred barely three years before most of the Kirtland revelations, Joseph "could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictating a book like the Book of Mormon" (or no doubt the Doctrine and Covenants or Pearl of Great Price). She then testified, "It is marvelous to me, 'a marvel and a wonder,' as much so as to anyone else" ("Last Testimony of Sister Emma,"<i>Saints Herald</i>26<i>,</i>no. 19 [1 October 1879], p. 290).<br><br>Emma's testimony is similar to Parley Pratt's as she continued to be amazed at the process by which revelations came. She said in an interview near the end of her life,<br><br><i>I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe,</i>[Joseph]<i>would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>The revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants were received through the power of God similar to the Book of Mormon translation.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, can you sense how great a miracle it is that we have the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price? They are not man-made books but the literal word of God to us. As the Lord said,<br><br><i>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;</i><br><br><i>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:34–35]<br><br>It was often difficult for those in the 1830s to accept that the Lord spoke to them--as it is for many in our day, especially for those who call themselves intellectuals. It should not have been, but it was. One of the early "intellectuals" of the Church, William McLellin, was humbled when he decided to test Joseph Smith. He wanted some outward proof that these revelations came from God. He formulated in his mind five questions that he wanted answered that only the Lord and he would know. Without telling Joseph Smith the questions, he requested a revelation. We can read the result of this inquiry in section 66 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord gave this section in answer to these five questions that only McLellin and the Lord knew. It may be interesting for you to determine if you can discover what these five questions were. As Joseph dictated that revelation, McLellin got the confirmation he sought. He then recorded his personal testimony of the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph. He said,<br><br><i>I now testify in the fear of God, that every question</i>[was]<i>answered to my full and entire satisfaction. I desired it for a testimony of Joseph's inspiration. And I to this day consider it to me an evidence which I cannot refute.</i>[<i>Ensign of Liberty,</i>p. 61]<br><br><i>Joseph Smith is a true Prophet . . . of the Lord and . . . has power and does receive revelations from God.</i>[Letter from William E. McLellin to relatives, 4 August 1832, RLDS Archives, p. 4]<br><br>In spite of this witness, McLellin left the Church.<br><br>There is a lesson to be learned from the study of the Doctrine and Covenants. Revelations are generally answers to questions. The Lord did not come and tap Joseph on the shoulder and say, "I have a revelation for you." But instead Joseph went to the Lord and asked to receive an answer. Time after time Joseph tells us how he would ask and how, in response, the revelation would come. Elder Russell Nelson recently expanded on this important principle. He said, "The Lord can only teach an inquiring mind." What an important lesson. The Lord doesn't generally come to us--he waits for us to come to him and ask. Then he gives us the answer. How many times have you said, "I have not received direction lately" or "I feel a void in my life." Do we inquire of the Lord? Do we ask, seek, and knock as the Savior directed? As you have problems and questions in your lives, do you follow this principle? I testify to you that as your minds are opened and as you truly inquire of the Lord, he will answer you. As we humble ourselves, he will lead us by the hand and give us answers to our prayers.<br><br>These early years in our history literally served as a refiner's fire for early Church members. These were days of great testing when many failed the test. Leaders that survived these early days--such as Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and Heber C. Kimball--were perhaps thereby enabled to survive the almost insurmountable trials of crossing the plains and establishing the Church in the Rocky Mountains. I hope that we never forget the heritage that we have from these early days.<br><br>I also pay tribute to the faithful who followed the early leaders. Think of men like John Tanner. Brother Tanner was probably the equivalent of a millionaire in the 1830s--perhaps the wealthiest man in the whole Church. He sacrificed everything so that the Kirtland Temple could be built and the Church established. After laying all of his worldly goods on the altar, he left Kirtland for Missouri in poverty with a cart, a borrowed wagon, one horse of his own, three borrowed ones, and twenty dollars in cash. When he had spent his few dollars, he begged for buttermilk and other food to sustain his family of eleven. One of his cherished daughters died during the exodus from Kirtland. Apostates taunted John Tanner because he remained faithful. His response echoed the feelings of these early faithful Saints. He said, "Well, if others have come up easier, they have not learned so much" (John Tanner, "Sketch of an Elder's Life," in<i>Scraps of Biography</i>[Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1883], p. 15).<br><br>Consider also the example of Artemus Millet. In 1832 the Church faced a real dilemma. A stonemason was needed to direct the stonework on the Kirtland Temple. No one was qualified. Lorenzo Young suggested that they recruit Artemus Millet, who was a capable stonemason living in Canada. But there was one problem--Artemus was not a member of the Church. Joseph Smith paused and considered the suggestion. He then turned to Brigham Young and said, "I give you a mission to go to Canada and baptize Brother Artemus Millet and bring him here." If that wasn't enough, he then said, "And tell him to bring a thousand dollars with him" (Millet Family History, "A Brief History of Artemus Millet," manuscript, LDS Archives, pp. 70–71). You prospective and returned missionaries, how would you like to receive such a mission assignment? With the help of the Lord, Brigham Young went to Canada and taught and baptized Brother Millet. When he was asked to leave Canada to supervise the work on the Kirtland Temple, Brother Millet responded that he had a business in Canada and if he left, not only would the business fail, but people who owed him money would never pay their debts to him. Being touched by the Spirit, Brother Millet left his business and moved to Kirtland, Ohio.<br><br>The stately Kirtland Temple is in a large part a monument to Artemus Millet. He lost his business. He lost his money. He lost his prestigious standing in Canada. Later his wife died. But look what he gained. He gained the gospel. He fulfilled an important earthly mission. He gained an eternal family, and today there are thousands of his descendants in the Church who call him blessed. I know some of his descendants who are leaders in this Church and who acknowledge that much of what they count dear in their lives is because of their faithful forefathers in following the prophet of God.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, can you see the importance of the Kirtland period that we have discussed tonight? As I conclude, may I share with you a never-to-be-forgotten experience I had in presiding at a sacrament meeting in the Kirtland Temple. President Wallace B. Smith of the RLDS Church graciously granted permission for us to hold a sacrament meeting in the temple. Not since the 1840s had the sacrament been blessed and passed to Latter-day Saints. We felt a power and a spirit there that may have been comparable to that felt in some of those meetings in the 1830s. When the General Authorities blessed and passed the sacrament, the Lord poured out his Spirit upon all those in attendance. These leaders today are also giving their all to build the Church in our day. The Lord blessed us with spiritual power and renewed testimonies of this work. While singing "The Spirit of God," that great hymn written for the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, all in attendance had feelings that will never be forgotten. Most all were wiping away the tears streaming down their cheeks. We were aware on that occasion of how close those on the other side of the veil are to us.<br><br>Now, my beloved young people, we love you. You have a great destiny in this Church. Study the scriptures. Study the revelations. Anchor your hearts to the great message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As you do this, I promise you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by and through the authority of the holy apostleship invested in me, that you will come to know the Lord, and the more you come to know him the easier your life will become. That may sound strange to you, but as an apostle, I walk the face of the earth, going wherever I am sent, and I know of the power of the Lord to bless his Saints. Sister Ballard and I will leave on Thursday for Brazil. It does not matter where we are. Those who have an unwavering testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the living God know that he, in fact, received revelation from God. They know that those revelations contain all the instruction necessary for us to find peace and happiness in this life. Understand the gospel and keep the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will prosper.<br><br>I testify to you that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Son of God. This is his Church. He has spoken to his prophets. He speaks today. He is guiding the affairs of the kingdom. God bless you to keep your eyes riveted on the leadership of the Church. We will not lead you astray. We cannot. This is my witness and my testimony, and my blessing upon you: that the peace of the Lord will be yours now and always; that you'll find it easy all the days of your life to follow the simple, beautiful teachings that are ours in the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the words of the living prophets. May God grant you the strength and the courage to understand that, and live all the days of your lives by the teachings found in the scriptures. I thank you for who you are and all that you mean to your families and to this Church. You are precious. You are important. You have a great destiny to carry on this glorious work. May you always be worthy, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<br>
I am grateful for my wife, here on the stand with me, giving me her constant support. She really is my hero. I'm grateful for family members and friends who have shared with me the weight of saying something valuable to you during our time together.<br><br>I'm also thankful for colleagues from the College of Fine Arts and Communications, who also are seated on the stand and in the front rows of this assembly. I appreciate their support. They are a remarkably talented, intelligent, and disciplined group. It is a great privilege to be counted among their number.<br><br>A couple of weeks ago Dean Paul Cox and I were having lunch with a prospective student and his father. We were dining in the Museum of Art cafe when Dean Cox told this student that biology was the world's oldest profession. Dean Cox explained that when the Lord put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to care for it, he created the world's first biologists. He added that in doing so the Lord was also the first equal opportunity employer.<br><br>Since the student was interested in coming to BYU to study biology, I didn't interrupt the good dean to let him know that other colleges have laid claim to having older professions than his.<br><br>The dean of the College of Nursing, Sandra Rogers, could argue that when the Lord took the rib from Adam with which to make Eve, he performed an operation; therefore, medicine is the oldest profession.<br><br>Dean Douglas Smoot might take exception with both of these propositions, arguing that the Lord's creation of the heavens and the earth out of chaos was a magnificent engineering accomplishment, making his the oldest profession.<br><br>At this point, I get to put on my journalism hat and ask, "Who do you think created the chaos?"<br><br>It is about my profession, journalism (and the chaos so often attributed to it), that I would like to talk with you this morning. I want to connect my professional experiences with my religious beliefs, sharing what I've learned about both in my thirty years of working in the media.<br><br>My objectives are to<br><br>• define a context for you, by which to better understand the role of the press in a democratic society.<br><br>• identify some myths created by the media, promoted by the father of all lies.<br><br>• compare and contrast the values of the gospel with the media myths that we see daily.<br><br>• suggest the means by which we may use the miracles of technology to accomplish divine purposes.<br><br>What I will say in the next few minutes compresses complex professional issues into concepts that I hope can be easily understood. Some of my colleagues may find my approach simpleminded and perhaps stereo-typical, but nonetheless it represents a summary view of my experience in the media, and its incompleteness is fully acknowledged.<br><br>I am proud of my profession and of colleagues that serve our society with the highest possible standards of personal integrity. My intent this morning is to give both those inside the media and those who are faithful members of the Church a glimpse into each other's worlds. I do so because I think each misunderstands--and therefore mistrusts--the other.<br><br>There are almost as many jokes about journalists as there are about lawyers. I share President Lee's concern about that when he says, "I am deeply offended that the entire reputation of a noble and honored profession can be sullied by two or three hundred thousand bad apples."<br><br>There are bad apples and excesses in every profession. Journalism may have more than its share (although I am not certain about that).<br><br>I perceive the biggest problem lies not in the bad apples but in an extraordinary clash between a journalist's worldview and that of a faithful Church member.<br><br>The clash of worldviews that I refer to can be seen in the following examples:<br><br>• King Henry II's question to his noblemen in reference to Thomas Beckett: "Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?" The result was a clash of worldviews between state and church.<br><br>• Joseph Smith's shutting down of the<i>Nauvoo Expositor,</i>which ultimately led to his martyrdom, demonstrates a clash between theocracy and democracy.<br><br>• Accounts of wars, devastation, and human suffering triggered when one culture imposes its worldview on another or, more accurately, attempts to displace one worldview with another. We have plenty of current-day examples in these categories.<br><br>In his best-selling book<i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus,</i>the author John Gray helps readers grapple with gender issues by talking about differences between the way men and women think and behave as if they came from Mars and Venus, respectively.<br><br>This literary device separates one's personal investment in these differences, making it easier to recognize them when they are placed in the context of the way things are done on Mars or on Venus.<br><br>For our purposes this morning, if men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then journalists are from Pluto!<br><br>Pluto is a cold, dark, tiny, miserable place where everything is suspect. Where everybody lies. Where graft, corruption, malfeasance, self-interest, and greed reign supreme. And where the journalist's job is to tell people about all of this garbage.<br><br>Some wag said that if journalists on Pluto had a Thirteenth Article of Faith, it would read, "If there is anything hateful, despicable, shameful, or rotten, we seek after these things."<br><br>The Church's worldview, on the other hand, comes from the planet Kolob. Most of the conflict and difficulty we have with the press comes from differences between our worldview, our frame of behavioral reference, and our cultural assumptions and those held by journalists.<br><br>The journalist's worldview is democratic. In America, a journalist enjoys an explicit, constitutionally defined, and protected role written by the Founding Fathers.<br><br>When asked what form of government the Constitutional Convention had agreed upon, Benjamin Franklin replied, "A republic, the worst of all political systems, save all others."<br><br>The Founding Fathers believed Lord Acton's statement that "absolute power corrupts absolutely."<br><br>The press plays a potent role in American democracy because it was intended to do so. It is one of the forces that the Founding Fathers balanced against the powers of government. The journalist's duty is to tell about graft, corruption, greed, and malfeasance in our society.<br><br>Journalists are trained to be junkyard watch dogs. They bark at every opportunity, justified or not. It's the best way that the Founding Fathers could find to keep us alert to what section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants explains in these words in verse 39:<br><br><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i><br><br>The Church's worldview doesn't flow from democratic principles (as much as we admire the Constitution for the freedoms it provides).<br><br>Our worldview comes from our belief that the best possible government is a theocracy: "a righteous King, making righteous judgments, ruling a righteous people who live righteous lives." Such a society needs no watchdogs. In a theocracy the media will be used to disseminate pure knowledge, light, and truth! The entire society will seek that which is virtuous, lovely, or of good report.<br><br>Can you imagine how strange that world is to a journalist? Can you understand how difficult it is for these two worldviews to understand each other?<br><br>I often think about the necessary bridges to cross the chasm between my profession and my religion. How do we begin to understand each other and our very different views of the world?<br><br>Steven Covey in his book<i>Principle Centered Leadership</i>says that we must first seek to understand if we would be understood.<br><br>What do we need to know when trying to understand what it is like to be from Pluto?<br><br>• Time has a different meaning on Pluto. Everything is immediate. It's a planet full of deadlines. First and Fast are the gods worshipped there. Nothing is forever, and eternity cannot be considered. On Pluto the race is always to the swift and the battle to the strong.<br><br>An insider joke at CBS News is that if Moses handed down the Ten Commandments and it were reported on the evening news, the lead would be: "Moses came down from the mountain today with Ten Commandments written by the finger of God--the two most important of which were ..." (Use your imaginations to fill in the blank.)<br><br>• On Pluto, provable facts are the means for determining what is relevant or valuable.<br><br>There is no place for "revealed" truth. Faith or belief cannot be admitted as legitimate means of inquiry.<br><br>• People who come from Pluto make different assumptions about authority and obedience. They have seen how authority and power corrupt. The concept of "righteous dominion" is incomprehensible to them.<br><br>In his autobiography entitled<i>Chronicles of Wasted Time,</i>Malcolm Muggeridge wrote:<br><br><i>Journalists follow authority as sharks do a liner, hoping to feed off the waste it discharges, with perhaps someone occasionally falling overboard to make a meal, and once in a way the whole ship going down and providing a positive feast.</i>[<i>Chronicles of Wasted Time,</i>vol. 2,<i>The Infernal Grove</i>(New York: William Morrow &amp;amp; Company, 1974), p. 39]<br><br>• Citizens of Pluto recognize self-worth as demonstrated by rugged individualism. The accumulation of wealth and power is based on the personal freedom to do as one pleases. Obligations to community are valid only when they promote individual rights and liberties.<br><br>This affects the way someone from Pluto approaches questions of motivation. Self-interest is seen as the driving force for all human behavior. Self-sacrifice is an unbelievable concept on Pluto.<br><br>"What's in it for you?" is the primary question of relevance on Pluto.<br><br>The answer "Nothing" is unbelievable.<br><br>Explaining your motivation as obedience to what you believe are God's commandments results in blank stares on Pluto. Its citizens cannot grasp the idea that there is peace of mind and joy in doing so.<br><br>Those who have visited Pluto and experience its culture come back shaking their heads and report that it's a place where "No good deed goes unpunished!"<br><br>* On Pluto, there is no expiation or forgiveness for past sins. Repentance isn't possible. Once a crook, always a crook--even if you were a president of the United States. Computer data files provide the ability to dredge up old copy with errors never corrected in the original text.<br><br>The picture that I've painted for journalists can be expanded, for purposes of this discussion, to the media in general. Here, however, instead of being from Pluto, media owners and producers come from the planet Midas.<br><br>They want everything they touch to turn to gold. The driving force in their culture is making money and lots of it.<br><br>All else is secondary. All else serves the prime directive: More!<br><br>On Midas, too much is never enough. On Midas, you can buy anything for money.<br><br>On Midas, media moguls make money by creating myths that businesses use to sell their goods and services. These myths have become tools of the father of all lies. These myths lead away from truth and light and toward the mist, darkness, and shadows that father Lehi saw in his dream.<br><br>They create the large and spacious building, and from that heap scorn and ridicule on those who would hold fast to the iron rod, and they do it by twisting our most basic needs into something carnal, sensual, and devilish.<br><br>Brother Richard Wirthlin, a world-renowned public opinion expert, recently reported his company's findings from a survey that asked the American people to identify what they value most in their lives.<br><br>Take a moment and think about your heart's desires. What do you desire most in your life and why?<br><br>The three top categories identified by Brother Wirthlin's survey were these: first, self-esteem (a good opinion of one's self and one's actions); second, peace of mind; and third, joy or happiness in one's daily life.<br><br>Self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy or happiness. These represent what the American people want most in their lives.<br><br>Contrast the striking difference between how the gospel of Jesus Christ fulfills these needs compared with the myths created by the media. The media would have us believe that self-esteem comes from owning things, looking and smelling good, or using the right products to make us sexually and socially attractive. The message is that self-esteem itself is a commodity that can be purchased.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that each of us is a child of a Heavenly Father and Mother, who love us and want us to return to their presence. As such, we have intrinsic self-worth. Our value to them is priceless.<br><br>We come from heaven, in the words of the poet, "trailing clouds of glory."<br><br>The father of all lies wants us to believe otherwise. His purpose, in the words of Moses, is "to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will" (Moses 4:4).<br><br>Satan wants us to believe the myths created by the media. He wants us to forget about being children of heavenly parents and to believe that we can buy self-esteem by driving the right car, drinking the right soft drink, wearing the right clothes, putting on the right perfume, and eating the right food.<br><br>Media myths teach that things<i>external--</i>and not<i>internal</i>and certainly not<i>eternal--</i>are all that matter. Peace of mind comes from "following one's bliss." These myths categorize religion as limiting, restricting, and suffocating one's freedom of choice.<br><br>Media myths attribute guilt, personal anguish, and suffering to a belief in God. Absolutes are made relative, and there is no center from which peace of mind can flow.<br><br>How cunning and destructive are the myths that turn reality on its head!<br><br>The liberating, mind-expanding, soul-restoring blessings that come from obeying God's will can never be experienced by humankind as long as they believe peace of mind requires no discipline or obedience.<br><br>God leads his children beside still waters and gives them the sweet peace of mind that only comes from knowing that one willingly and lovingly obeys his commandments.<br><br>Media myths make every individual responsible for achieving his or her own joy or happiness. Their messages focus on individual preeminence. These myths create and perpetuate the Me Generation. They create the idea that we must be constantly entertained, that anything that fails to immediately capture our attention is (according to my fifteen-year-old son, Jesse) b-o-r-i-n-g! These myths make self-gratification the ultimate source of joy or happiness.<br><br>How far from the truth they are!<br><br>The paradox of life is that service to others is the wellspring of joy and happiness. In all human interaction nothing is so rewarding or fulfilling as genuine service to someone other than oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of family life--fathers and mothers sacrificing for their children. It is an eternal pattern, learned from heavenly role models.<br><br>God has defined the context whereby we might have joy in this life, and joy will never be found in the self-indulgent, rapacious myths created for us in the media.<br><br>You can see how different the media myths are from the gospel's message to our Father's children. Our natural desire for self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy and happiness are being used by Satan to make us insecure, bitter, and miserable--just like him.<br><br>If all that I've said about the media this morning is true, and I believe that it is, you might reasonably ask why in the world would I continue to work in it?<br><br>When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act into law in 1967, he said that our society's greatest challenge is to learn to "manage our miracles."<br><br>This year the Church will have about 400,000 convert baptisms. That's about how many people are born on the planet each day. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that we are falling behind in our efforts to reach all of God's children, despite dramatic growth in Church membership.<br><br>How is the Church to meet the mandate in section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants that states: "Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter" (D&amp;amp;C 90:11).<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard has said that the means of achieving this objective requires us to harness the miracles of the media to effectively communicate, in his words, "the greatest message ever revealed, which is that Jesus is the Christ, that we're all sons and daughters of God, and that if we are faithful we will be able to return to him" (Minutes of Church Public Communications Advisory Committee, 19 August 1994).<br><br>Gordon Bowen, former chief creative officer of the advertising agency McCann Erickson Worldwide, told the faculty and students in our college last Thursday that we must be as effective as the devil in getting our message to Heavenly Father's children.<br><br>Brother Bowen's message echoes that of President Kimball's given from this podium nearly twenty years ago, issuing the challenge for us to create the ways and the means to communicate the gospel in all of its glory.<br><br>Managing our miracles is up to us.<br><br>On a recent consulting assignment, one of our team members, Peter Schutz (former president and CEO of Porsche), in talking about our ability to sense the environment around us, said, "We're not certain who first discovered water, but we're pretty sure that it wasn't the fish."<br><br>Watching last week's broadcast of the CLIO awards for outstanding television commercials, I was astounded when the presenter said that the average American viewer sees 250 such messages every day and that by the time an American child reaches age twenty-five, he or she will have seen more than two million television commercials.<br><br>We swim in a media environment, making us largely oblivious to its effects on our behavior.<br><br>The promises of the electronic super highway and interactive media leading to virtual-reality experiences for us and our children require the utmost attention.<br><br>The best things perverted become the worst.<br><br>Miracles of technology and the messages they convey can be what E. B. White called "A saving radiance in the sky," or they can become the mind-numbing, values-distorting experiences desired by the adversary.<br><br>The owners and operators of our media miracles bear a particular burden for their use. One year ago last September, my wife and I were in Rome attending a worldwide conference of the heads of broadcasting networks.<br><br>Our group of about 150 media executives was invited to Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's summer palace just outside of Rome along the Appian Way. We gathered in a small palace courtyard and listened to Pope John Paul's admonition to use the media for better purposes than merely making money. These are his words:<br><br><i>Precisely because the Church is deeply concerned for man and his needs, including those needs that remain unexpressed, she desires to direct the attention of those working in communications to ideals that are at once more lofty and more worthy of man. The Church appreciates the tremendous possibilities offered by the communications media, but she is not convinced that they have to be used as poorly as they sometimes are. For this reason she encourages all efforts to improve not only the technical and artistic quality of radio and television, but also and more importantly, its human quality.</i><br><br>Pope John Paul then went on to say:<br><br><i>The Church appeals to the consciences of individuals employed in social communications and likewise to government leaders and all those to whom radio and television programs are directed. She asks them to make every effort to demand higher quality radio and television programs. Audiences should not be seen as simply the passive recipients of messages that all too often tend to manipulate and exploit.</i><br><br>What an extraordinary message, given to the world's most influential and powerful broadcasters and given in terms that were unmistakably clear!<br><br>What a remarkable experience for me, because earlier that same September, Elder James E. Faust said almost the same thing in his BYU fireside address here in the Marriott Center. Elder Faust told us that we are responsible for our media choices and that we must take great care in making them.<br><br>Other General Authorities have counseled care in our selections of music, film, television and radio programs, and reading material. They see where the deep water is and give clear signals about its danger to us and our families.<br><br>Managing the media miracles in our lives is a daily challenge--one that can be made easier if we understand the role and nature of journalism in our democratic society; if we recognize the myths the media create that lead us away from self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy; and if we are willing take personal responsibility for how media is used in our homes and in our society.<br><br>In other words, to be effective in managing media miracles you must:<br><br>First, learn how the media functions in our society, understand its purposes and how it influences our lives. Blaming the media is not a solution. Understanding it is.<br><br>Second, commit yourself to effectively communicating the principles of the gospel through every means available to you. While your chosen profession may not be communications or the arts associated with creating messages to be delivered through the media, you are not powerless to control the media that you use or to influence its content.<br><br>And finally, prayerfully follow the counsel of the Brethren about the media and how it should be used.<br><br>I believe in a kind and loving Heavenly Father and Mother who want nothing but the best for me as one of their spiritual offspring. I sustain the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and acknowledge their importance in my life and in the intellectual and spiritual lives of all who attend this university.<br><br>It is my prayer that we will have the faith, the wisdom, and the will to build God's kingdom, making us and our society one that would be welcome on the planet Kolob. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce L. Christensen was dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communications at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 8 November 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>o Serve the Lord Without Offending the Devil - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the great universities of the world, one does not often choose to speak of the influence of Satan. Perhaps it is not cool to address this subject, but I choose to do so anyway. Someone said in these few words: "I have heard much about the devil. I have read a great deal about the devil. I have even done business with the devil, but it didn't pay." Your generation lives in a day when many things are measured against the standard of social or political correctness. Today I challenge that false doctrine of human behavior. The influence of Satan is becoming more acceptable. Elizabeth Barrett Browning said, "The devil is most devilish when respectable" (<i>Aurora Leigh,</i>book 7). However, as Shakespeare said, "He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf" (<i>King Lear,</i>act 3, scene 6, line 20).<br><br>It is not good practice to become intrigued by Satan and his mysteries. No good can come from getting too close to evil. Like playing with fire, it is too easy to get burned: "The knowledge of sin tempteth to its commission" (see Joseph F. Smith,<i>GD,</i>p. 373). The only safe course is to keep well distanced from him and from any of his wicked activities or nefarious practices. The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.<br><br>However, Brigham Young said that it is important to "study ... evil, and its consequences" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 257). Since Satan is the author of all evil in the world, it would therefore be essential to realize that he is the influence behind the opposition to the work of God. Alma stated the issue succinctly: "For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil" (Alma 5:40).<br><br>My principal reason for choosing this subject is to help young people by warning them, as Paul said, "lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices" (2 Corinthians 2:11). We hope that young people, unfamiliar with the sophistries of the world, can keep themselves free of Satan's enticements and deceitful ways.<br><br>I owe my text to Elder Marion G. Romney, who, at a BYU devotional in 1955, stated: "Now there are those among us who are trying to serve the Lord without offending the devil." This is a contradiction of terms. President Romney goes on:<br><br><i>Must the choice lie irrevocably between peace on the one hand, obtained by compliance with the Gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and contention and war on the other hand?</i>[Marion G. Romney, "The Price of Peace," Brigham Young University student body, March 1, 1955, p. 7]<br><br>Yogi Berra is reported to have said, "If you come to a fork in the road, take it." But it doesn't work that way. The Savior said,<br><br><i>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</i>[Matthew 6:24]<br><br>Today many of us are trying to serve two masters: the Lord and our own selfish interests, without offending the devil. The influence of God, our Eternal Father, urges us, pleads with us, and inspires us to follow him. In contrast, the power of Satan urges us to disbelieve and disregard God's commandments.<br><br>In another address President Romney continues:<br><br><i>The consequences of</i>[mortal man's]<i>choices are of the all-or-nothing sort. There is no way for him to escape the influence of these opposing powers. Inevitably he is led by one or the other. His God-given free agency gives him the power and option to choose. But choose he must. Nor can he serve both of them at the same time, for, as Jesus said, "No man can serve two masters:</i>...<i>Ye cannot serve God and mammon."</i>[Marion G. Romney,<i>CR,</i>October 1962, p. 94]<br><br>In the October 1987 general conference I made this statement:<br><br><i>I think we will witness increasing evidence of Satan's power as the kingdom of God grows stronger. I believe Satan's ever-expanding efforts are some proof of the truthfulness of this work. In the future the opposition will be both more subtle and more open. It will be masked in greater sophistication and cunning, but it will also be more blatant. We will need greater spirituality to perceive all of the forms of evil and greater strength to resist it.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/11/the-great-imitator?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"The Great Imitator,"</span></a><i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 33]<br><br>Abortion is one evil practice that has become socially accepted in our country and, indeed, in the world. Many of today's politicians claim not to favor abortion, but oppose government intervention in a woman's right to choose an abortion.<br><br>During a national prayer breakfast in Washington on February third of this year, Mother Teresa gave the most honest and powerful proclamation of truth on this subject I have ever heard. She is the eighty-three-year-old Yugoslavian nun who has cared for the poorest of the poor in India for years. She is now aged and physically frail, but courageous, with immense spiritual strength. Mother Teresa delivered a message that cut to the very heart and soul of the social ills afflicting America, which traditionally has given generously to the peoples of the earth but now has become selfish. She stated that the greatest proof of that selfishness is abortion. Cal Thomas of the<i>Los Angeles Times</i>Syndicate reported on her speech. He said that Mother Teresa had tied abortion to growing violence and murder in the streets by saying,<br><br><i>If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill each other? ... Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want.</i>["Mother Teresa Has Anti-Abortion Answer,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>February 15, 1994, p. A–11]<br><br>Then she alluded to the concern that has been shown for orphan children in India and elsewhere in the world, for which she expressed gratitude. But she continued,<br><br><i>These concerns are very good. But often these same people are not concerned with the millions who are being killed by the deliberate decision of their own mothers. And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today--abortion, which brings people to such blindness.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>Cal Thomas, commenting on this powerful message, said:<br><br><i>Why should people or nations regard human life as noble or dignified if abortion flourishes? Why agonize about indiscriminate death in Bosnia when babies are being killed far more efficiently and out of the sight of television cameras?</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>In conclusion, Mother Teresa pled for pregnant women who don't want their children to give them to her. She said, "I am willing to accept any child who would be aborted and to give that child to a married couple who will love the child and be loved by the child" (ibid.). What consummate spiritual courage this remarkable old woman demonstrated. How the devil must have been offended! Her remarkable declaration, however, was not generally picked up by the press or the editorial writers. Perhaps they felt more comfortable being politically or socially correct. After all, they can justify their stance by asserting that everyone does it, or it is legal. Fortunately the scriptures and the message of the prophets cannot be so revised.<br><br>I speak next of the present-day challenge to the words of the Lord recorded in Genesis: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Genesis 1:28). All my life I have heard the argument that the earth is over-populated. Much controversy surrounded a recently concluded United Nations International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, Egypt. No doubt the conference accomplished much that was worthwhile. But at the very center of the debate was the socially acceptable phrase "sustainable growth." This concept is becoming increasingly popular. How cleverly Satan masked his evil designs with that phrase.<br><br>Few voices in the developed nations cry out in the wilderness against this coined phrase "sustainable growth." In<i>Forbes</i>magazine of September this year, a thoughtful editorial asserts that people are an asset, not a liability. It forthrightly declares as preposterous the broadly accepted premise that curbing population growth is essential for economic development. The editorial then states convincingly that "free people don't 'exhaust resources.' They create them" (<i>Forbes,</i>12 September 1994, p. 25).<br><br>An article in<i>U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report</i>entitled "Ten Billion for Dinner Please," states that the earth is capable of producing food for a population of at least eighty billion, eight times the ten billion expected to inhabit the earth by the year 2050. One study estimates that with improved scientific methods the earth could feed as many as one thousand billion people ("Ten Billion for Dinner Please,"<i>U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report,</i>12 September 1994, pp. 57–60). Those who argue for sustainable growth lack vision and faith. The Lord said, "For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17). That settles the issue for me. It should settle the issue for all of us. The Lord has spoken.<br><br>The Church's stand on homosexual relations provides another arena where we offend the devil. I expect that the statement of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve against homosexual marriages will continue to be assaulted. Satan is only interested in our misery, which he promotes by trying to persuade men and women to act contrary to God's plan. One way he does this is by encouraging the inappropriate use of sacred creative powers. A bona fide marriage is one between a man and a woman solemnized by the proper legal or ecclesiastical authority. Only sexual relations between husband and wife within the bonds of marriage are acceptable before the Lord.<br><br>There is some widely accepted theory extant that homosexuality is inherited. How can this be? No scientific evidence demonstrates absolutely that this is so. Besides, if it were so, it would frustrate the whole plan of mortal happiness. Our designation as men or women began before this world was. In contrast to the socially accepted doctrine that homosexuality is inborn, a number of respectable authorities contend that homosexuality is not acquired by birth. The false belief of inborn sexual orientation denies to repentant souls the opportunity to change and will ultimately lead to discouragement, disappointment, and despair.<br><br>Any alternatives to the legal and loving marriage between a man and a woman are helping to unravel the fabric of human society. I am sure this is pleasing to the devil. The fabric I refer to is the family. These so-called alternative lifestyles must not be accepted as right because they frustrate God's commandment for a life-giving union of male and female within a legal marriage as stated in Genesis. If practiced by all adults, these lifestyles would mean the end of the human family.<br><br>I suggest that the devil takes some delight every time a home is broken up, even where there is no parent to blame. This is especially so where there are children involved. The physical and spiritual neglect of children is one of the spawning grounds for so many of the social ills of the world.<br><br>I now turn to milder ways of not offending the devil. Nephi has given to us the pattern or formula by which Satan operates:<br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i><br><br><i>And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</i>[2 Nephi 28:21–22]<br><br>C. S. Lewis gave us a keen insight into devilish tactics. In a fictional letter, the master devil, Screwtape, instructs the apprentice devil Wormwood, who is in training to become a more experienced devil:<br><br><i>You will say that these are very small sins; and doubtless, like all young tempters, you are anxious to be able to report spectacular wickedness. ... It does not matter how small the sins are, provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. ... Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.</i>[<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1961), p. 56]<br><br>So-called small sins include the challenge to the "sin laws" that seek to control forms of gambling, alcohol, and drug consumption. Some who wish to appear broad-minded say, under the guise of not imposing religious belief, "I don't drink or gamble, but I don't think we ought to have any laws to control others that wish to." This completely ignores the health and social costs to society of the vices. They foolishly argue that laws cannot control human behavior. My long legal career has led me to conclude that all criminal laws have a moral basis.<br><br>I now come to some even milder forms of trying to serve the Lord without offending the devil. Having a temple recommend and not using it seems mild enough. However, if we live close to a temple, perhaps having a temple recommend but not using it may not offend the devil. Satan is offended when we use that recommend, going to the temple to partake of the spiritual protection it affords. How often do we plan to go to the temple only to have all kinds of hindrances arise to stop us from going? The devil has always been offended by our temple worship. As President Brigham Young once said about the building of temples, there are Saints who say, "I do not like to do it, for we never began to build a temple without the bells of hell beginning to ring." His answer was, "I want to hear them ring again. All the tribes of hell will be on the move, if we uncover the walls of this temple" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 410). President Howard W. Hunter said that we should "look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol" of our membership (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/11/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Exceeding Great and Precious Promises,"</span></a><i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, p. 8).<br><br>I wonder how much we offend Satan if the proclamation of our faith is limited only to the great humanitarian work this Church does throughout the world, or to our beautiful buildings, or to this great university, marvelous as these activities are. When we preach the gospel of social justice, no doubt the devil is not troubled. But I believe the devil is terribly offended when we boldly declare by personal testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that he saw the Father and the Son; when we preach that the Book of Mormon is another witness for Christ; when we declare that there has been a restoration of the fullness of the gospel in its simplicity and power in order to fulfill the great plan of happiness.<br><br>We challenge the powers of darkness when we speak of the perfect life of the Savior and of his sublime work for all mankind through the Atonement. This supernal gift permits us, through repentance, to break away from Satan's grasping tentacles.<br><br>We please the devil when we argue that all roads lead to heaven; therefore, it does not matter which road we take, we will all end up in God's presence. And when we contend that "we are all God's children; therefore, it makes no difference to which church a person belongs; we are all working for the same place."<br><br>This man-made philosophy--for such it is--sounds good, but the scriptures do not support it. I assure each of you that the road to God's presence is not that easy. It is strait and narrow. Elder Delbert L. Stapley said,<br><br><i>I feel certain that the devil chuckles whenever this false opinion is expressed, for it pleases him that the minds of men have been so blinded to revealed truth by his cunning craftiness and deceit that they will believe any religion to be acceptable to God regardless of its tenets and ordinances or how or by whom those ordinances are administered.</i>[Delbert L. Stapley,<i>CR,</i>April 1958, p. 115]<br><br>We need not become paralyzed with fear of Satan's power. He can have no power over us unless we permit it. He is really a coward, and if we stand firm, he will retreat. The apostle James counseled: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). And Nephi states that "he hath no power over the hearts" of people who are righteous (l Nephi 22:26).<br><br>We have heard comedians and others justify or explain their misdeeds by saying, "The devil made me do it." I do not really think the devil can make us do anything. Certainly he can tempt and he can deceive, but he has no authority over us that we do not give him.<br><br>The power to resist Satan may be stronger than we realize. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not. The devil has no power over us only as we permit him. The moment we revolt at anything which comes from God, the devil takes power.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 181]<br><br>He also stated, "Wicked spirits have their bounds, limits, and laws by which they are governed" (<i>HC</i>4:576). So Satan and his angels are not all-powerful.<br><br>Satan has had great success with this gullible generation. As a consequence, literally hosts of people have been victimized by him and his angels. There is, however, an ample shield against the power of Lucifer and his hosts. This protection lies in the spirit of discernment through the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift comes undeviatingly by personal revelation to those who strive to obey the commandments of the Lord and to follow the counsel of the living prophets.<br><br>This personal revelation will surely come to all whose eyes are single to the glory of God, for it is promised that their bodies will be "filled with light, and there shall be no darkness" in them (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). Satan's efforts can be thwarted by all who come unto Christ by obedience to the covenants and ordinances of the gospel. The humble followers of the divine Master need not be deceived by the devil. Satan does not sustain and uplift and bless. He leaves those he has grasped in shame and misery. The spirit of God is a sustaining and uplifting influence.<br><br>I emphasize that fasting and prayer is a great way to receive the moral strength and spiritual strength to resist the temptations of Satan. But you may say this is hard and unpleasant. I commend to you the example of the Savior. He went into the desert, where he fasted and prayed to prepare himself spiritually for his ministry. His temptation by the devil was great, but through the purification of his spirit he was able to triumph over all evil.<br><br>Work is another deterrent to evil. The symbol of this state is the beehive. Our forefathers fostered industry and work. Elder John Longden quoted Herndon as saying: "Satan selects his disciples when they are idle; Jesus selected his when they were busy at their work either mending their nets or casting them into the sea" (John Longden,<i>CR,</i>April 1966, p. 39).<br><br>I testify that there are forces that will save us from the ever-increasing lying, disorder, violence, chaos, destruction, misery, and deceit that are upon the earth. Those saving forces are the everlasting principles, covenants, and ordinances of the eternal gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. These same principles, covenants, and ordinances are coupled with the rights and powers of the priesthood of Almighty God. We of this church are the possessors and custodians of these commanding powers that can and do roll back much of the power of Satan on the earth. We believe that we hold these mighty forces in trust for all who have died, for all who are now living, and for the yet unborn.<br><br>I pray that we will dedicate our lives to serving the Lord and not worry about offending the devil. I also pray that through the spreading of righteousness, the evil hands of the destroyer might be stayed and that he may not be permitted to curse the whole world. I also pray that God will overlook our weaknesses, our frailties, and our many shortcomings and generously forgive us of our misdeeds. I further pray that he will bring solace to the suffering, comfort to those who grieve, and peace to the broken-hearted, and I leave this witness and testimony and blessing with you in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E.

<h1> of Faith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Tell me a story," I nightly pled of Grandma as a child. Though I wanted to hear of Cinderella, Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty, she would say, "Susan, I can only tell you stories that are true. If you want to hear truth, I have something to say." Not wanting to sleep, I enthusiastically listened to stories of Jesus, the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, and those whose sacrifices created our legacy of faith.<br><br>Though I believed in the truthfulness of Grandma's stories, there was one that caused discomfort. It was of a young pioneer girl named Sarah Ann who was in danger of being trampled by stampeding buffaloes. In this perilous situation she knelt and prayed for protection.<br><br>"In answer to her prayer," said my grandmother, "she remained unharmed, even though hundreds of buffalo stampeded around her."<br><br>Instead of marveling with wonder at the miracle, I emphatically pronounced, "That's impossible!"<br><br>Grandma countered, "It is not impossible to those who have faith, Susan. It was because Sarah Ann had faith and you don't."<br><br>Such forthrightness caused me to ponder then and now. I attended Church, paid tithing, said my prayers, but the essence of faith, the substance of "things which are hoped for and not seen," had eluded me (Ether 12:6). As the years passed my outward demeanor mirrored faith, but my inner faith was lacking. I rationalized faithful events as good fortune, favorable circumstances, and just being "plain lucky." Would I ever have a faith like Sarah Ann's?<br><br>The answer was slow in coming, but in retrospect paralleled my desire for faith. That desire was ignited my freshman year at Brigham Young University. On a whim a girlfriend and I decided to spend the weekend in Salt Lake City. While sitting with suitcases in hand at Temple Square, my friend casually remarked, "The president of the Church, David O. McKay, lives just across the street in the Hotel Utah." Her continual nods of assurance and our curiosity led us to the hotel. Speaking with the bellboy and then the hotel manager about where the famous resident lived was frustrating. Their negative attitude, punctuated with security implications, fell on deaf ears. We left them determined to answer the hypothesis "If I were a prophet of God, behind which door would I choose to live in this hotel?"<br><br>After hours of knocking on doors and greeting blank stares from grumpy hotel guests, we staked out three floors. An innocent chambermaid on one of the floors revealed the answer. Excitedly, we hugged each other as only BYU freshmen could. Our enthusiasm was boundless, until we concluded to see if the prophet was home. Being the smallest of the twosome, I was designated to knock on the door. If the knock was answered, I had been programmed to say, "We are selling early orders for Girl Scout cookies. Would you care to place an order?"<br><br>As I walked toward the door I felt reticent; yet, as my feet faltered and heart pounded, my friend pushed me forward. It wasn't until I reached the door and was knocking that she ran like a "flash of light" to the far end of the hall. I was just turning to run when the door opened, and before me stood the prophet. He looked surprised but didn't say anything. Neither did I<b>,</b>I couldn't. I felt like I had a key to the celestial kingdom but did not belong--I was not worthy to be in his presence. I started to cry and then to sob. He took me by the hand and said, "Won't you come in?" I waved to my friend down the hall--whose open mouth betrayed her surprise--and entered the prophet's home. Our discussion remains personal, but the resulting impact was to change my inner direction dramatically. I resolved, as never before, to not just mirror faith, but to know of faith, to be faithful like Sarah Ann each day of my life so I would be worthy to see again a prophet, my Savior, and my Father in Heaven.<br><br>Oh, that I could say I had always lived up to that resolve. Like Nephi I can echo,<br><br><i>My heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins.</i>[2 Nephi 4:17–19]<br><br>To strengthen my resolve I determined that I would conscientiously study in depth the scriptures, doctrinal discourses, early Church records and histories, and biographies of the righteous. I can say with Parley P. Pratt, "I [have] always loved a book. If I worked hard, a book was in my hand in the morning. . . . A book at evening. . . ; a book at every leisure moment of my life" (<i>PPP,</i>1985, p. 2; p. 20 in earlier editions). After decades of reading and reading and reading more, I learned: "If ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, . . . let this desire work in you" (Alma 32:27). That inner working has now resulted in knowledge of great truths of faith. From the scriptures I learned: "The Lord is able to do all things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him" (1 Nephi 7:12). "Ask in faith, nothing wavering" (James 1:6). "It is by faith that miracles are wrought" (Moroni 7:37). "Jesus [is] the author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2). "Your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters" (Mosiah 5:7). "Because of thy faith in Christ. . . thy faith hath made thee whole" (Enos 1:8).<br><br>These truths are not new but eternal. The followers of Christ in the meridian of time and Saints of the latter days made the discovery of these truths years before and lived enduring lives of faith. But for me and for you, individually, the truths need to be discovered anew to reach an understanding of who we are in the eyes of deity and why Jesus loved us so much he would atone for our sins that we might return to our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Helping me in the process of discovering faith have been the journals and histories of early Saints who knew and loved the Prophet Joseph Smith. I stand amazed at their resolve to tenaciously cling to faith amid the Extermination Order, Haun's Mill Massacre, and the prospects of war. It seems to me they echoed the words of Joshua, that no matter what trial beset them, they resolved, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15). For like Job, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (Job 13:15). And like Joseph Smith, "What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty" and, yes, his faithful Saints from worshiping him (D&amp;amp;C 121:33).<br><br>The names and stories of those who remained faithful and endured in righteousness are not lost. They are told and retold by their thankful posterity from generation to generation. As we remember with gratefulness our legacy, let us recall the faithful declarations of the past. Near Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Samuel Bent was the object of religious persecution. He was tied to a tree and whipped by a mob and saw his wife die from the effects of these privations (Andrew Jenson,<i>Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia: A Compilation of Biographical Sketches of Prominent Men and Women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>vol. 1 [Salt Lake City: Andrew Jenson History Company, 1901–35], p. 368). Yet he nobly declared that "his faith is as ever and that he feels to praise God in prisons and in dungeons and in all circumstances whatever he may be found" (Donald Q. Cannon and Lyndon W. Cook, eds.,<i>Far West Record: Minutes of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830-1844</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1983], p. 222).<br><br>For Titus Billing, his escape from mobocracy in Missouri was plagued with starvation and frostbite. "For three days and nights he had only slippery elm bark for food. His feet were 'frozen so badly the flesh came off in pieces'" (Melvin Billings, comp., "Titus Billings: Early Mormon Pioneer," n.p., n.d., in author's possession, p. 21). Yet, like Samuel Bent, he praised God for his faith.<br><br>When Father Joseph Smith, Sr., was imprisoned for a note of indebtedness against him of fourteen dollars, he was promised he could go free if he renounced the Book of Mormon. His thoughts turned to the apostle Paul:<br><br><i>I was not the first man who had been imprisoned for the truth's sake; and when I should meet Paul in the Paradise of God, I could tell him that I, too, had been in bonds for the Gospel which he had preached.</i>[Lucy Mack Smith,<i>History of Joseph Smith: By His Mother,</i>ed. Preston Nibley (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1958), p. 185]<br><br>Of those who epitomize the faith I wanted to obtain, a faith like Sarah Ann, is John Murdock. At age seventeen John "came near bleeding to death; yea death stared me in the face, but I covenanted with my Heavenly Father that if he would preserve my life, I would serve him." True to his resolve, John turned to prayer and meditation and began his search for the gospel of Jesus Christ that professed and practiced the ancient ordinances (see Journal of John Murdock, typescript, BYU-A, p. 3). He first united with the Lutheran Dutch Church, but "soon found they did not walk according to the scriptures." He next joined the Presbyterian Cedar Church: "I soon became dissatisfied with their walk, for I saw it was not according to the scriptures." He then united with the Baptists, but soon recognized "their walk not to agree with their profession, [and] I withdrew myself from them" (ibid., pp. 3–4).<br><br>Continuing his search for truth, John turned to the Methodist faith, but discovered "when I did not please them I would have to be silent among them awhile." By 1827 he had joined the Campbellites. "It caused me to rejoice, believing that I had at last found a people that believed the scriptures," wrote John. For three years he faithfully attended their meetings, but as the ministers denied the "gift and power of the Holy Ghost," John lost interest and concluded "all the [religious] sects were out of the way" (ibid., pp. 4–5).<br><br>Then, in the winter of 1830, John's prayers were answered. Four missionaries sent to the Lamanites arrived in Kirtland from the state of New York. They preached, baptized, and built up the Lord's church after the ancient order. Curious, John journeyed twenty miles to see for himself the new preachers and rebuffed a Campbellite who tried to dissuade him: "I told him I was of age, and the case was an important one, of life, and death, existing between me and my God, and I must act for myself, for no one can act for me" (ibid., p. 6).<br><br>He arrived at Isaac Morley's home in Kirtland about dusk and was introduced to the four men and presented a copy of the Book of Mormon. As he read the new scripture,<br><br><i>The spirit of the Lord rested on me, witnessing to me of the truth of the work. . . . About ten o'clock</i>[the next]<i>morning, being November 5th, 1830, I told the servants of the Lord that I was ready to walk with them into the water of baptism.</i>[Ibid., p. 7]<br><br>"This was the third time I had been immersed, but I never before felt the authority of the ordinance, but I felt it this time and felt as though my sins were forgiven," wrote John. After being ordained an elder, he returned home rejoicing and endeavored "to bear testimony," and to his joy, "My family gladly received me and my words, thank the Lord" (ibid., pp. 7–8).<br><br>It was John Murdock who, after the death of his wife, gave his surviving twins, Joseph and Julia, to Joseph and Emma Smith to rear. He was the John Murdock who served a mission with Hyrum Smith to Missouri (see D&amp;amp;C 52:8–9). On the trek his feet became wet, "by which I took a violent cold by which I suffered near unto death [but] I could not die because my work was not yet done" (ibid., p. 10). Truly it was not complete. The calls from his prophets would take John from house to house and from village to village and from city to city, proclaiming the everlasting gospel to all who would listen from the eastern United States to Australia (see D&amp;amp;C 99:1). On 14 October 1852 a letter from Brigham Young released John from his final mission: "Return in peace. Your Mission is accomplished and others are on the way to follow up and build upon the foundation which you have laid" (Reva Baker Holt, "A Brief Synopsis of the Life of John Murdock," n.p., 1965, in author's possession, p. 12).<br><br>Who are those sent to build upon the foundation he laid? Is it you? Is it me? For the faithful Saints of yesteryear, when the winds of adversity, the trial of their faith, or an Abrahamic test raged and beat upon their house, it stood because their foundation was faith in Christ (see Matthew 7:27). The faithful Saints accepted the name of Christ by baptism, and their further covenants did not allow their faith to become like the waves of the sea tossed to and fro (see James 1:6), nor were they swayed from the strait and narrow path to the filthy waters or the spacious building (see 1 Nephi 8).<br><br>When they learned truth they willingly embraced it and accepted the gospel in its fullness. They did not view the gospel feast as a smorgasbord with a nibble here, a bite there, a taste, a smell, or even a desire to change the cook's recipe. They accepted the gospel harvest as a feast of thanksgiving and embraced the truth as they came unto Christ and partook. They had through faith found the passageway to eternal life and clung to the rod of iron amid the refiner's fire, the fuller's soap, and the trials that tested their integrity and their grip. For them and for thousands and now millions of Latter-day Saints their faith increased to knowledge, and they knew in whom they had trusted, they knew their Redeemer liveth (see Job 19:25).<br><br>The legacy of faith remembered by this generation needs to be repeated. "Shall the youth of Zion falter?" No, I trust not one. You are our hope. As a faculty member of this great university, I commit myself to share my talents and life to improving yours. Is it worth it to me? Yes, you are the promise of today, the hope of tomorrow. May you choose the path trodden by our faithful forefathers who knew that yesterday's faith needed to be nurtured today. May you partake of the Lord's supper, his feast, his delicious fruit as you learn more of faith and embrace that truth. Then will the hope of eternal brightness be yours as you contemplate an infinite joy with the Saints of the Most High God--Abraham, Joseph Smith, John Murdock, and, yes, I could exclaim to my grandma, even Sarah Ann. May you resolve with me at this Thanksgiving season to retread their legacy of faith. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Susan Easton Black was a professor of LDS Church history and doctrine at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 22 November 1994.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.
