<h1>way of Discipleship - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you for coming to your various assembly points tonight. I feel deeply touched by what has been said and even more by your presence and what you represent. I am not able to respond adequately to the outpouring of love and faith in my behalf except to try to be better and do better. I want you to know how deeply appreciative I am of that love and those expressions of faith in my behalf.<br><br>I am pleased Elder Henry B. Eyring could be here. He is serving as commissioner of Church education, and it will be under his leadership, in my opinion, that the Church Educational System will become even more of a system than it has ever been in the past. The two phrases that come to mind from scriptures are "knit together" as never before and "fitly framed together" as never before (see Colossians 2:2, Mosiah 18:21, Ephesians 2:21).<br><br>For Brother Stan Peterson, who watches over our wonderful seminary and institute system, I express deep appreciation. It is, in my judgment, one of the two or three most effective programs in the entire Church. I am grateful President Bateman is here and for his wonderful leadership of a wonderful university. He will be part of this knitting together in ways that will yet have to be determined, but it will be a special thing.<br><br>I am delighted Sister Janet Lee is here tonight. She is the gallant wife, as you know, of our valiant President Rex Lee, a special man.<br><br>These wonderful stake presidents and their wives on the stand represent so many stake presidencies throughout the Church who love the youth and young adults of the Church in special ways. I am grateful to be in their midst.<br><br>I take note of the fact that Sister Maxwell and I were privileged to meet at the University of Utah Institute of Religion. What a special day it was for me to meet her. I must confess I can't tell you what the lesson was that day, but I will always be grateful for that blessing, among the many, that the Church Educational System has given to me. Colleen has been wonderful as a nurturer and as an encourager--in the last year in particular.<br><br>So tonight as we are bound together by the satellite system, let that be symbolic of how we are bound together in the entire Church Educational System and, even more, in the increasingly expansive brotherhood and sisterhood of the kingdom of God on the earth. So let us focus tonight on our shared discipleship amid this shared mortal experience--a subject dear to my heart and about which I know a little more than I did a year ago.<br><br>When striving disciples reflect deeply upon this mortal experience, certain realities become even more clear. This includes a clarifying and particular reality, which is my theme for tonight: We are immortal individuals whose constant challenge is to apply immortal principles to life's constantly changing situations. Seen in this way, life's varied situations are more sharply defined. With this perspective we can improve our daily performances because we have fixed our gaze on eternity and its great realities.<br><br>Though we share immortality, our individual traits, talents, trials, opportunities, and circumstances vary widely. Even so, it is ever the case that whatever the particular, passing mortal situation, all of the individuals involved are immortals with immense possibilities. C. S. Lewis put this so well when he said:<br><br><i>It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no</i>ordinary<i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilisations--these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1980), p. 19; emphasis in original]<br><br>It is a profound quote.<br><br>I readily recognize that you will be living in an increasingly secularized society in which people simply don't see other humans in this true light. Many don't even believe in an individualized resurrection. I grant, too, that some also assume that there is an absence of immortal truths and absolute principles. As a result, these people prefer to view humans as being without real behavioral boundaries. Given such disbelieving views, it is no wonder that the ways of the natural man quickly prevail. Whether by giving way to materialism or to the things of the flesh, these individuals live without a knowledge of and a commitment to Heavenly Father's plan of salvation.<br><br>An eminent Japanese thinker recently looked at our pleasure-centered Western society and wrote insightfully of a dilemma growing out of this sense so many mortals have of planlessness and purposelessness. He wrote:<br><br><i>If there is nothing beyond death, then what is wrong with giving oneself wholly to pleasure in the short time one has left to live? The loss of faith in the "other world" has saddled modern Western society with a fatal moral problem.</i>[Takeshi Umehara, "The Civilization of the Forest: Ancient Japan Shows Postmodernism the Way,"<i>At Century's End: Great Minds Reflect on Our Times,</i>ed. Nathan P. Gardels (San Diego: ALTI Publishing, 1996), p. 190]<br><br>Nevertheless, as striving disciples, our strategic focus must fall on the interaction of immortal individuals and immortal principles as applied to life's changing tactical situations. It is vital, therefore, for you and for me, in the words of Jacob, to see things "as they really are" and things "as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). It's interesting that those who have eyes single to the glory of God are those who see the most of reality.<br><br>But this road of discipleship about which we are speaking tonight is not easy. It requires sturdy, all-weather souls who are constant in every season of life and who are not easily stalled or thrown off course. Likewise, even with this accurate view of the mortal experience, we still need time and the wise use of our moral agency. We still need God's long-suffering to help us. We need all of these combined in order to gain experience in life amid this ongoing process. And amid this ongoing process you and I can actually come to know for ourselves, like Alma of old, who "fasted and prayed many days that I might know . . . of myself" (Alma 5:46), that these immortal principles are true.<br><br>We can also come to know, through obedience, how much God loves us as his immortal children. It happens just as President Brigham Young said it would:<br><br><i>How shall we know that we obey</i>[God]<i>? There is but one method by which we can know it, and that is by the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord witnessing unto our spirit that we are His, that we love Him, and that He loves us. It is by the spirit of revelation we know this.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:99]<br><br>If we can get that witness for ourselves that we are his and that he loves us, then we can cope with and endure well whatever comes in the varied tactical situations of life.<br><br>Of course, there are going to be puzzling moments. Nephi, paralleling what Brigham Young said, had this reaction when he was perplexed: "I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17). We cannot always fully or glibly explain everything that is happening to us or around us, but knowing that God loves us is absolutely crucial. Then, as immortals possessed of immortal principles, we can overcome the mortal trials and we can put the pressing things of the day in precious perspective.<br><br>Besides, the divine attributes of love, mercy, patience, submissiveness, meekness, purity, and others are those attributes we have been directed to develop in each of us--and they cannot be developed in the abstract (see 3 Nephi 27:27, Mosiah 3:19). These require the clinical experiences--those things through which we are asked to pass. Nor can these attributes be developed in a hurry. Thus the scripture says, "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good," referring to the mix of mortal experiences, immortal individuals, and immortal principles (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). And when that interplay occurs, and we see things through the lens of the gospel, then we can see things more clearly and navigate the road of discipleship.<br><br>Another thing will happen: We will become much more aware of and alive to the many possibilities for doing good that are present in life's daily situations. Even the moments that seem humdrum are full of possibilities. Nothing is really routine.<br><br>I speak tonight, therefore, not only of life's large defining moments but also of the seemingly small moments. Even small acts and brief conversations count, if only incrementally, in this constant shaping of souls, in this strategic swirl of people and principles and tactical situations. What will we, for instance, bring to all of those moments small and large? Will we do what we can to make our presence count as a needed constant in such fleeting moments, even in micro ways? Do you and I not sometimes say appreciatively of individuals who have helped us, "They were there when we needed them"? Will we reciprocate?<br><br>The daily discipleship of which I'm speaking is designed to develop these very attributes that are possessed to perfection by Jesus. These attributes emerge from a consciously chosen way of life; one in which we deny ourselves of all ungodliness and we take up the cross daily--not occasionally, not weekly, not monthly. If we are thus determined, then we are emulating yet another quality of our Lord, of whom we read: "And there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it" (Abraham 3:17). True disciples are meek but very determined.<br><br>To underscore further what is being presented tonight concerning the mortal experience, one way of looking at the "thou shalt not" commandments is that these prohibitions help us to avoid misery by turning us away from that which is enticing but harmful and wrong. However, once we are settled in terms of the direction of our discipleship and the gross sins are left firmly behind--"misery prevention," it might be called--then the major focus falls upon the "thou-shalt" commandments. It is the keeping of the thou-shalt commandments that brings even greater happiness. True, as the scripture says, "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10), but neither is lukewarmness full happiness. Failing to be valiant in Christian discipleship will leave us without significant happiness. Therefore, our active avoidance of wickedness must be followed by our active engagement in righteousness. Then we can come to know true joy--after all, man is that he "might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>It is very often the sins of omission that keep us from spiritual wholeness because we still lack certain things. Remember the rich, righteous young man who came to Jesus asking, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"<br><br>"Keep the commandments."<br><br>"All these things have I kept from my youth up."<br><br>And then came Jesus' searching response: "One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor . . . : and come, . . . and follow me." (See Matthew 19:16–21 and Mark 10:17–21.)<br><br>A customized commandment thus came for that man. It was something he needed to do, not something he needed to stop doing, that kept him from wholeness.<br><br>Furthermore, certain taste buds of our souls may have been burned over by sin, and our Father desires that we regenerate these taste buds of the soul by means of repentance. Our Heavenly Father also desires the development of what are presently the many other neglected taste buds of our souls. These, when they are really developed, will bring even greater happiness and true joy. If it were not so, how could we anticipate with Paul the music and scenery that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard" (1 Corinthians 2:9) and be prepared to enjoy it except we have cultivated these taste buds of great refinement?<br><br>Wickedness is not the only mortal failure. Yes, the avoidance of wickedness remains ever important, but the sins of omission also represent a haunting failure. How often, may I ask you, do we speak about the need for repentance concerning our sins of omission? Or how often do we make personal confessions of them to God?<br><br>There is a memorable scriptural phrase about our need to have "faith unto repentance" (see Alma 34:15–16). Faith unto repentance covers both sins of commission and sins of omission. And so the faith of discipleship about which I speak briefly tonight isn't simply for life's crises, though they will come. Rather, it is especially needed to ensure our regular repentance. After all, the scriptures are filled with thou-shalt commandments and with so many exhortations for us to do good. James, for instance, speaks of pure religion, urging us to visit and bless the variously deprived (see James 1:27). Significantly, James also declares that those who would do lasting good should themselves also<i>be</i>good--"unspotted from the world" are his words.<br><br>This is no small point. We live in a world, for example, in which some individuals do some good but do so while breaking the seventh commandment--chastity before marriage and fidelity after. If we really want to do much good, we must also<i>be</i>good. Instructively, in the Book of Mormon we read about a political leader, Morianton, who dealt justly with his people but not with himself. Why not? "Because of his many whoredoms," the scriptures say (Ether 10:11). This is a fascinating insight regarding the ecology of the soul.<br><br>The promptings for us to do good come from the Holy Ghost. These promptings nudge us farther along the straight and narrow path of discipleship. The natural man doesn't automatically think of doing good. It isn't natural. How many people worry about the car behind them or the person below them? The natural man just doesn't do it. For us, however, these promptings enlarge our awareness of other people's needs and then prod us to act accordingly. This is why, I believe, when the Lord speaks of enlarging the soul, he adds, in the Doctrine and Covenants, that it must be done "without hypocrisy" (D&amp;amp;C 121:42). Our personal righteousness, more than we know, governs how much good we can do.<br><br>It is sadly true, as we all know, that many on this planet hunger for bread, but many also hunger deeply to experience the reassuring eloquence of example. This represents a desperate need that is incumbent upon us to provide as part of our discipleship.<br><br>You and I all know individuals who do much quiet good by following the scriptural injunction about lifting up the hands that hang down (see Hebrews 12:12, D&amp;amp;C 81:5). Some of those hands that hang down once grasped the iron rod and then let go, having simply given up. Hence, those hands need to be reached for because they will not be proffered by such discouraged individuals.<br><br>But it takes faith to persist in doing good, particularly quiet good, for which there is no recognition. Otherwise, why bother? Therefore, faith in Heavenly Father's plan of salvation is needed not just for life's turbulent, traumatic moments but also for daily life's seemingly small but nevertheless defining moments.<br><br>Will we, for instance, remember our true identity as we move through daily life? How much sin occurs because people momentarily forget who they really are?<br><br>Will we, for instance, always remember that our behavior must be connected with our beliefs? It must be done without hypocrisy.<br><br>The unrelenting reality, brothers and sisters, is that we are never very far away from the need for "faith unto repentance," including repentance of our sins of omission. Such faith unto repentance is not just for next year or next month or next week, but also for tomorrow.<br><br>One of the seemingly small things involves being more willing than we sometimes are to give the needed conversational correctives instead of engaging in "conversational cloak holding" by merely going along silently with the prevailing tide of discussion.<br><br>I recall reading of General George C. Marshall, whom President Franklin Roosevelt appointed to be his chief of staff early in World War II. Roosevelt was a very persuasive, informal man. During one of their first meetings, desiring to be friendly, perhaps even palsy-walsy, he called General Marshall "George," to which the reply came, "It's General Marshall, Mr. President" (David McCullough,<i>Truman</i>[New York: Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, 1992], p. 534). Think about the courage that simple act took--but it helped to define a relationship that, by the way, became a rich relationship.<br><br>The small conversational correctives matter so much. If we have that quality, we will appreciate what General Robert E. Lee reportedly did on one occasion. Asked for his opinion of a military colleague, Lee replied candidly but generously, after which the questioner said, in effect, "Well, he doesn't speak so highly of you." General Lee replied, "Sir, you have asked me for my opinion of him, not his opinion of me." Lee had, as one writer described another leader, "furnished his mind . . . with fixed principles" (Walter Bagehot, "Memoir of the Right Honourable James Wilson,"<i>The Works of Walter Bagehot,</i>ed. Forrest Morgan [Hartford, Connecticut: Travelers Insurance, 1889], 3:384). If you and I can process life's tactical situations through a mind furnished with fixed principles, integrity is the result.<br><br>Conversations and decisions in which we engage, even if they seem small, expose the heart and the mind and their furnishings. Brigham Young once said, "You cannot hide the heart, when the mouth is open" (<i>JD</i>6:74).<br><br>We can be of so much service to others in many thou-shalt ways. Of course, the problem is that rendering such service takes time, and we are all so busy. Some situations may call for service that somehow seems to be beneath us. Besides, we have other things to do. The "thou shalts" are so convenient to put off. Who will notice the procrastination anyway? After all, we are not robbing a bank. Or are there forms of withholding that constitute stealing?<br><br>Consider a conversation again--and this conversation was arranged for by an angel:<br><br><i>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go. . . .</i><br><br><i>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</i><br><br><i>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</i><br><br><i>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot."</i><br><br>[Notice the significant language:]<i>And Philip</i>ran<i>thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</i><br><br><i>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</i>[Acts 8:26–31; emphasis added]<br><br>How many times are we too busy to "come up and sit" with someone who needs conversation? You and I have divine promptings all the time encouraging us to do good, but we often deflect them instead of doing like Philip, who "ran thither."<br><br>We sometimes give needed physical cloaks to warm people and to cover them, and it is good that we do. How often do you and I also give what the scriptures call the "garment of praise" (Isaiah 61:3)? The "garment of praise" is often more desperately needed than the physical cloak. In any case, as we all know, these needs are all around us, every day. There are so many ways we can "lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>We can also be generous when there are interpersonal differences of opinion. Generosity and fairness are marks of character. Compared to his early days in Parliament, Winston Churchill later developed his capacity to be generous, including to his rivals. This was seen in his tribute to the just-deceased Neville Chamberlain, whom he had earlier replaced as prime minister. Churchill had once described Chamberlain as looking at foreign affairs through a "municipal drain pipe." Nevertheless, on the occasion of the tribute for Chamberlain, Churchill said, "In one of the supreme crises of the world [our colleague was] contradicted by events." In that same speech Churchill praised Chamberlain, saying, "The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. . . . With this shield, . . . we march always in the ranks of honour" (Tribute to Neville Chamberlain, House of Commons, 12 November 1940). How generous of Churchill. "Contradicted by events" was intended to explain Chamberlain's gross and naïve failures regarding the rise of Hitlerism.<br><br>In each of life's situations, large or small, therefore, if you and I will bring fixed principles and strive to be more like Jesus, including emulating his generosity, then we will be living abundantly and not just existing. The Book of Mormon has those fascinating phrases about our moral agency whereby we are to act for ourselves and not merely be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:16, 26; Helaman 14:30).<br><br>Now, since we are not always free to choose just when and how all of life's interactions will occur, we are nevertheless free to choose our responses to these moments. Since we can't compute beforehand all our responses, it becomes vital to set our course as immortals on the basis of immortal principles to be applied as reflexively as possible. Besides, there may be no time in which to ponder how we will respond anyway. If, for example, one determines that he will keep the seventh commandment, then his applying this fixed principle will result in temptations either being deliberately avoided in the first place or in being quickly deflected. All of this can be achieved without great thought, risk, or needless anxiety. In fact, I would go so far as to say to you tonight, my brothers and sisters, that if we are truly attached to immortal principles, some decisions need to be made only once, really, and then righteous reflexes can do the rest. Absent such fixed determinations, however, one can be tossed to and fro by temptations that then require case-by-case agonizing.<br><br>The same could be said of honesty in business or integrity in human relationships. Each day interactions occur relentlessly, involving people, principles, and circumstances.<br><br>One of the things we can do to help us develop those reflexes is to further develop our scriptural literacy so that, as Nephi prescribed, we can "liken all scriptures unto [ourselves]" (1 Nephi 19:23). Each day challenges arise, responses are given, and decisions are made. Will it be in the setting of fixed principles, however, as has been emphasized?<br><br>To this, the rising generation of youth and young adults in the Church, I say that scriptural memories, spiritual memories, can be lost in a generation:<br><br><i>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</i>[Judges 2:10]<br><br>In just one generation!<br><br>When the scriptures are either not available or are not searched and believed, then two things happen--a loss of belief in God and a loss of belief in the Resurrection: "They had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator" (Omni 1:17).<br><br><i>Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</i><br><br><i>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 26:1–2]<br><br>Those vital things always go first, and they can go within a generation, unless we truly are feasting upon the scriptures. Feasting on the scriptures, combined with the gift of the Holy Ghost, will "show unto you all things what ye should do" (see 2 Nephi 32:3–5).<br><br>I testify to you tonight that the scriptures give us nourishment for every season of life and the Holy Ghost can prompt us in all moments so that we can, in fact, be blessed with insight and reassurance.<br><br>What can deter our feasting on the scriptures? Jesus warned, "The care[s] of this world . . . choke the word" (Matthew 13:22). They surely do. Still worse, those choked with the pleasures of the world have no time for scriptures. Some actually have pleasure in unrighteousness. Here again we see the natural man gravitating toward the cares and the pleasures of this world.<br><br>In that cumulative process, today's small inflection for good adds to what becomes tomorrow's mountain of character. A bad inflection, however, of a defining moment gouges a little more in what later becomes the eroded gully channeling us so swiftly into the "gulf of misery" (see 2 Nephi 1:13). More than we realize, life's experiences of boredom, exhilaration, deprivation, conflict, compromise, mistakes, successes, resentments, loving, excluding, belonging, repenting, and forgiving swirl about us constantly. How will immortal principles be applied by immortal individuals to these swirling situations?<br><br>This is why the plan of salvation, which is so extremely important, came with the Restoration--so we can understand life and the discipleship being described tonight. If people misread life, this leads to murmuring, rebellion, and irreligion. Of Laman and Lemuel we read, "They knew not the dealings of that God who had created them" (1 Nephi 2:12). Decades later in the Book of Mormon, it was said once again, as if it were a part of the institutional memory of the Nephite and Lamanite people, that Nephi's brethren "understood not the dealings of the Lord" (Mosiah 10:14).<br><br>Without gospel perspective in our lives, we just won't "get it" either. Special moments will come and go unused and unnoticed. How we manage those moments in daily life ends up either developing character or disintegrating character.<br><br>These moments of truth may be small, but they give us a chance to express character. Mercifully, when we make mistakes we can recover and learn from them by "faith unto repentance." We cannot, of course, relive a particular moment in our lives, but we can use it as a spiritual spur to remake ourselves. We need not let yesterday hold tomorrow hostage.<br><br>People always matter, of course, but the more I think about this interplay of immortal individuals and immortal principles, it is almost as though the particular tactical situation merely serves as a temporary, focal catalyst for what is really going on. Some other tactical situation might have served just as well. In any case, it is for each of us as immortals to make of these moments in daily life that which eternal principles would have us make of them.<br><br>I am the first to acknowledge that we, as Church members, have a tremendous challenge being equal to our theology and our opportunity. We fall short. If we stumble, let us arise and continue the climb. The Lord will bless us because we are possessed of truths about "things as they really are, and . . . things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). These truths beckon us, even in our imperfections, to be better.<br><br>I share with you tonight, as I near the end of my remarks, what seems to me to be a profound window of divine disclosure through which we are permitted to look. As is the case with many scriptures, there are many multiple meanings. I wish to note one from that moment in which Enoch, in the presence of the Lord, was permitted to see the trauma of the people in the time of Noah. The principle to be noted is that we do not always weep alone:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people</i>[the Noachians],<i>and he wept; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?</i><br><br><i>And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i>[Moses 7:28–29]<br><br>And then came the marvelous response from God:<br><br><i>The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;</i><br><br><i>And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood; . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore,</i>[continued the Lord]<i>for this shall the heavens weep, yea, and all the workmanship of mine hands.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Enoch, and told Enoch all the doings of the children of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook.</i>[Moses 7:32–33, 40–41]<br><br>An absolutely supernal, marvelous insight! Our Father in Heaven is so tender even for his most mistaken children.<br><br>Enoch began to rejoice when God told him of Jesus' coming in the meridian of time and told of the Atonement. He rejoiced again when God told him of the great latter-day Restoration.<br><br>Not always, but more than we know, when we are confronted in the human circumstance with the difference between<i>what could be</i>and<i>what is,</i>we do not weep alone!<br><br>I have felt to add these concluding thoughts in friendship and counsel to you.<br><br>Do not, my young friends, expect the world to esteem the seventh commandment--chastity before marriage and fidelity after. Some people in the world will fret genuinely over the consequences of its violation, such as staggering and unprecedented illegitimacy and marital breakdowns. However, sexual immorality per se will still not be condemned by the secular world as long as the violators have any commendable qualities at all or as long as they are, in some respect, politically correct. We will have to keep the seventh commandment because it is spiritually correct, not because we will get much support from society's other institutions.<br><br>A second suggestion: As you pursue your discipleship and observe the human scene, do not be surprised or unnerved by the natural man's relentless push for preeminence and power. It really reflects the premortal psychodrama. Nor should you be surprised over the efforts of so many to cover their sins or to gratify their vain ambition.<br><br>Be grateful, therefore, for the gospel's emphasis on meekness. Be careful of the natural man's milder expressions--craving for credit and rustling for recognition. Alas, so often the hearts and even the moral agency of others can be crushed in the search for self-glorification.<br><br>We have just celebrated the birth at Bethlehem. Another individual sought the role of Redeemer, saying, "Send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost . . . ; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1). Brothers and sisters, God would have never permitted a different babe to be born at Bethlehem, of course; nor would he have permitted the destruction of the agency of mankind with all its implications for a very different mortal experience. What happened, as you know, is that precious Jesus stepped forward and said, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2). He was the babe who was born at Bethlehem!<br><br>Remarkable restoration windows such as these are provided for our instruction in this dispensation--if we will ponder over them and make their insights a part of our discipleship.<br><br>Lastly, I again express publicly my gratitude for God's having granted me a "delay en route." However long, I know it has not been given merely for loitering or sightseeing along the pathway of discipleship. Perhaps the delay includes moments like tonight, when I can express my love for you, my confidence in you, and my testimony of Jesus, whose work this is. He has shown the meaning of the mortal experience by the eloquence of his example and by his having shown the way to us in every particular, including his gallantry during the agonies of the Atonement, of which he declared, "And would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18). Not shrinking is more important than surviving, and Jesus is our exemplar in every way. I salute him for the eloquence of his example. I express my everlasting gratitude to the Father for the superb plan of happiness and, with you, my appreciation for the promptings of the Holy Ghost and plead that each of us might not deflect these but might receive them as indicators of how much more we could do if we were more serious disciples. For these things I express my gratitude and my desire to give the honor and the praise and the glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I take heart in the rising generation's capacity to move the people of this planet spiritually in ways not achieved before. You are indeed a generation of destiny, young adults of promise. I do so in love and appreciation, expressing my witness to you in the power and authority of the holy apostleship and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<br>
Almost three years ago in a Saturday evening session of a stake conference in New York, I listened intently to a young Hispanic sister bear her testimony. As a recent convert she bore witness of the promptings and feelings that occurred during her conversion. She stated:<br><br><i>When the missionaries knocked on my door, I saw the smiles on their faces and felt the firm grip of their handshakes. They said they had a message that would bring happiness into my life. At the conclusion of the first lesson they turned to Moroni's promise in the Book of Mormon. I was surprised. They did not ask me to believe their words. Instead, the missionaries challenged me to find out for myself the truthfulness of the gospel through prayer and the Holy Ghost. Later, as I listened to the missionaries explain the plan of salvation, I suddenly felt a confirming witness that I was more than a speck in the universe. My life was important not only to me but to a loving Heavenly Father and his Son. They knew me! There was purpose to life, and God had a plan for me to achieve that purpose. I could never feel worthless again!</i><br><br>The truth of the young sister's testimony burned within me that evening. I knew then and know now, as do you, that there is purpose to life, that God has a plan of happiness designed for all of his children. The plan includes a premortal existence in which men and women were begotten spirits, "born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father, prior to coming upon the earth in a temporal body to undergo an experience in mortality" ("The Origin of Man," November 1909, in James R. Clark, comp.,<i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75], 4:205). Individuals were blessed with the gift of agency in pre-earth life just as they are here. Those spirits who were obedient to law gained knowledge and intelligence and were rewarded with a second estate. One's progress depended on the choices made (see Abraham 3:22–26, Moses 4:1–4, Revelations 12:3–9). Agency always has been an integral part of the plan (see D&amp;amp;C 93:30–31, 38).<br><h2><b>Mortality and the Formation of Eternal Families</b></h2><br>The plan includes an earthly or temporal sojourn as well. During this state we receive a physical body with procreative powers and the opportunity to form eternal families of our own. The power to create new life is given to men and women for a season, and they are tested as to how they will use this sacred power. By the time death occurs, the power is removed. For those who are obedient to eternal law, the procreative power is restored in the Resurrection. For those who are disobedient to righteous principles and are unrepentant, the power is never returned (see D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4; 132:22, 25).<br><br>A key purpose of God's plan is the formation of eternal families. It is within the family that exaltation is achieved. My remarks today center on the importance of the family and its eternal nature. I am aware that some individuals do not have the opportunity to marry in mortality. For those who remain single on earth, there is still much that can be done to develop one's talents, to help others, and to prepare for the blessings that will come. For the promise is that no blessing will be withheld eternally if a person is worthy (see Clyde J. Williams, ed.,<i>The Teachings of Harold B. Lee</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996], p. 256).<br><br>The creation of the earth, the fall of Adam, and the atonement of Christ are essential elements or pillars in the Father's plan for the progress and development of his children. This is true not only for the salvation of the individual but for the exaltation of the family. The earth's creation provided a new state of existence apart from our spiritual home, and mortality's probationary test is qualitatively different from the premortal one. It differs in that we are expected to live by faith. A veil has been drawn over our minds, and we remember little or nothing of life with our Heavenly Parents. In the words of Ecclesiastes, "There is no remembrance of former things" (Ecclesiastes 1:11). In Paul's words, "For now we see through a glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Through faith, assurances come (see JST Hebrews 11:1). But diligence and obedience are required to hear and feel the still small voice.<br><br>The test in mortality also differs because the physical body is subject to a new set of desires and temptations. Mortals by nature have an "inherent . . . inclination to succumb to the lusts . . . of the flesh [and] the allurement of worldly things" (Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>2nd ed. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], p. 781, s.v. "temptation"; see also Alma 42:10). The earthly test is whether we will yield to the seductions of nature or to the "enticings of the Holy Spirit," which changes our nature "through the atonement of Christ" (Mosiah 3:19). Alma's counsel to Shiblon was to "bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love" (Alma 38:12). As children and parents, a new family setting allows us to love, trust, care, and serve in a different environment.<br><br>The fall of Adam made it possible for children to be born and, therefore, families to be created (see 2 Nephi 2:23, 25). The atonement of Christ opens the door of salvation for the individual and for exaltation for the family (see D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4, 132:22). The three doctrinal pillars of the plan of salvation are intimately involved in the creation of new eternal families and their extension into the eternities.<br><h2><b>Creation of Man and Woman</b></h2><br>The scriptures state that men and women are created in the image of God (see Genesis 1:26–27, Abraham 4:27–28). Both women and men have within them the attributes of divinity, and both are blessed as they fulfill their divine callings. The apostle Peter and King Benjamin indicate that we partake of the divine nature through Christ's atonement aided by the Holy Ghost (see 2 Peter 1:3–8, Mosiah 3:19). It is interesting to observe the similarity of the fruits of the Spirit to the divine seeds inherited from Heavenly Parents (see Galatians 5:21–22, 2 Peter 1:3–8). Since "light cleaveth unto light" and Spirit to spirit, the Holy Ghost is able to quicken us by a portion of light that causes the divine seeds within to bud and to flower (D&amp;amp;C 88:29, 40). The degree of light and the extent to which the attributes flourish is a function of how well women and men bridle their passions and are obedient to divine principles.<br><br>When a man understands how glorious a woman is, he treats her differently. When a woman understands that a man has the seeds of divinity within him, she honors him not only for who he is but for what he may become. An understanding of the divine nature allows each person to have respect for the other. The eternal view engenders a desire in men and women to learn from and share with each other.<br><br>Men and women are created as complements. They complete one another. Paul told the Corinthians: "Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11). Men and women complement each other not only physically, but also emotionally and spiritually. The apostle Paul taught that "the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband" and through them both the children are made holy (1 Corinthians 7:14). Men and women have different strengths and weaknesses, and marriage is a synergistic relationship in which spiritual growth is enhanced because of the differences.<br><h2><b>The Family Proclamation</b></h2><br>In September 1995 the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles issued "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102). The statement is an extraordinary document outlining Church doctrine with respect to the family and the relationships between husband and wife, parents and children. On a number of occasions during the past two years, President Hinckley has been asked why the proclamation was issued. Typical of his answers is the following:<br><br><i>Much of the world is in serious trouble over the disintegration of the family. The family is the basic unit of society. No nation is stronger than the homes of its people. . . .</i><br><br><i>Lawrence Stone, the noted Princeton University family historian, says: "The scale of marital breakdowns in the West since 1960 has no historical precedent that I know of, and seems unique. . . . There has been nothing like it for the last 2,000 years and probably longer." (Quoted by David Popenoe, "A World without Father,"</i>The Wilson Quarterly,<i>Spring 1996, p. 13.) You are familiar with the fruits of broken homes. I think the home is the answer to most of our basic social problems, and if we take care of things there, other things will take care of themselves.</i><br><br><i>We are trying to preserve the traditional family--father, mother, and children--working together in love toward a common goal. In large measure we are succeeding against great odds.</i>[Washington, D.C., media luncheon, 2 December 1996, quoted in<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997), pp. 209–10]<br><br>Following the issuance of the proclamation, all members of the Church have been challenged to become familiar with its doctrines and teachings and to apply them. It is particularly revealing to compare the teachings of the proclamation with contrasting philosophies and practices of the world. A review of the world's practices regarding marriage and the family illustrate the challenges that beset a society when it loses its eternal compass. May I share with you the basic principles taught by the proclamation and contrast them with the beliefs and practices that are becoming more and more prevalent in society. In doing so, I am aware that there are many people outside the Church who value the traditional family and whose views are similar to ours relative to this important institution. Nevertheless, the data suggests that the family is under siege in America and the Western world.<br><h2><b>Marriage Between a Man and Woman Is Ordained of God</b></h2><br>The first principle taught by the proclamation is that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God." We believe that the first marriage was performed by God and that marriage had no end (see Genesis 2:22–24, Moses 3:21–24). Marriage is a sacred relationship. When performed in the right place by the right authority, an everlasting covenant is established between the man, the woman, and the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C 132:15–19). The covenant has the potential of creating an eternal unit.<br><br>We believe that society has a stake in marriage in that the physical, emotional, spiritual, and economic health of its citizens is determined by the quality and duration of marital relationships. We believe that procreation powers are sacred and are to be used only between a man and a woman legally and lawfully married. When they are used outside of marriage they may destroy relationships rather than build them.<br><br>In contrast, many people in the world treat marriage as merely an association by consenting adults (see Bruce C. Hafen, "Covenant Marriage,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, pp. 26–28). The association may or may not be based on a contract. Sexual relationships outside the association are widely seen as acceptable. Open marriages without a contract are more and more prevalent as young people live together on a trial basis. Some people are now asking that an association between partners of the same sex be recognized as marriage. It is clear that marriage is not considered a sacred relationship in many quarters. In fact, some argue that the state or society has no interest or stake in marriage.<br><h2><b>The Family Is Central to the Father's Plan for the Eternal Destiny of His Children</b></h2><br>The second principle taught by the proclamation is that the family is central to the Father's plan for the destiny of his children. As noted earlier, the plan calls for mortal probation and the testing of God's spiritual offspring (see Abraham 3:22–26). In the testing process the family is essential for the proper training of children in the faith (see D&amp;amp;C 68:25, 28). The commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve to "multiply, and replenish the earth" remains in force (Genesis 1:28, Moses 2:28). Father and mother are important role models in nurturing and developing children. We believe that children's self-respect and identity are partially determined by the love their father and mother have for each other. President McKay often repeated the saying, "A father can do no greater thing for his children than to let them feel that he loves their mother" (see<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,</i>p. 201). My experience suggests that a child's identity and feelings of security are threatened when parents argue and condemn one another. The home is the best place for children to experience the bonds of love and learn virtue, honesty, and good citizenship. The home is the primary place where children learn to treat others with respect.<br><br>What are the world's views with regard to the family? There are many who assume that there is no plan because there is no God. Life is an accident. Marriage and the family are temporal associations. The association between consenting adults has as its purpose pleasure and individual satisfaction. If the association no longer serves that purpose, it should end regardless of the impact on one's partner or children. Is it any wonder that marriages do not last given these views? More than half of all civil marriages in the United States end in divorce. Based on these philosophies, it is not difficult to propagate an argument recently heard in a Hawaiian court that children can be nurtured as well by two adults of the same sex as by the natural father and mother. (See Brief for Amici Curiae Bronfenbrenner et al.,<i>Baehr v. Miike,</i>No. 91-1394-05 [Haw., May 23, 1997].) Also, if marriage is a temporary association that may end at any time, it is then simple to extrapolate that governments should assume primary responsibility for children's training and education.<br><br>In a recent general conference address, Elder Bruce Hafen pointed to the Savior's comments on the "contractual attitudes" of the "hireling" versus the covenant relationship of the shepherd.<br><br><i>When the hireling "seeth the wolf coming," he "leaveth the sheep, and fleeth . . . because he . . . careth not for the sheep." By contrast, the Savior said, "I am the good shepherd, . . . and I lay down my life for the sheep."</i>["Covenant Marriage," p. 26; see John 10:12–15]<br><br>When the view is myopic, the distortions are large. When one's marital objectives are selfish and transitory, relationships are ephemeral.<br><br>One can assume that the longer the view a woman and man have regarding the marital relationship, the greater the probability of success. The divorce rate for temple marriages is well below that of civil marriages, and civil divorce rates are exceeded by separation rates for open marriages. (See Tim B. Heaton and Kristen L. Goodman, "Religion and Family Formation,"<i>Review of Religious Research</i>26, no. 4 [June 1985]: 343–59; John O. G. Billy, Nancy S. Landale, and Steven D. McLaughlin, "The Effect of Marital Status at First Birth on Marital Dissolution Among Adolescent Mothers,"<i>Demography</i>23, no. 3 [August 1986]: 329–49; Larry L. Bumpass and James A. Sweet, "National Estimates of Cohabitation,"<i>Demography</i>26, no. 4 [November 1989]: 615–25.) A view of marriage and the family based on eternal principles increases the probability of success. When one takes the long view, one tries harder to be patient, long-suffering, kind, gentle, and meek. These characteristics, in turn, strengthen the marriage.<br><h2><b>Principles and Practices That Build Successful Families</b></h2><br>The proclamation teaches that "successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities." In other words, the Lord measures the success of a family by the quality of its relationships. In a home where faith, love, and forgiveness are dominant, members find joy and satisfaction in being together. Ideally the father presides in love and righteousness, provides the necessities of life, and protects the family while the mother is primarily responsible for the nurturing of the children. In contrast, the world often measures family success by the accumulation of worldly things and the size of the estate that is passed on to the children.<br><br>Many programs and practices in the Church are designed to strengthen the family. These include family home evening, family councils, family history work, family prayer, father's blessings, family scripture study, and others. It is important for families to build special traditions that tie children to parents and grandchildren to grandparents. In closing may I share one of the family practices that has produced joy and memories in our family. It is a tradition that has tied us together as a nuclear and an extended family.<br><br>When our oldest children were ready to begin formal schooling, Sister Bateman and I decided that a father's blessing would be given each to child and to the mother at the beginning of the school year. The family home evening preceding the start of school would be the occasion. We began the practice when Michael, our oldest son, turned five and was about to enter kindergarten. The practice continues to this day, although there is only one son at home. He is a student at BYU. When all the children were home, eight blessings were given on that special Monday evening.<br><br>The year Michael was about to enter the third grade holds special memories for us. During the summer he had participated in Little League baseball. He was a backup catcher and an outfielder on his team. For his age he had some athletic ability and was a good player. At the time he loved baseball. When we gathered together for family home evening just before the start of school, Michael announced to the family that he was too old for a father's blessing. After all, he had completed his first season in Little League, he had played well, and blessings were for younger children.<br><br>Marilyn and I were stunned at first. We encouraged him by suggesting that a blessing would help him with his schoolwork. It would provide him with protection. It would help him in his relationships with his brothers, sisters, parents, and friends. But our encouragement, along with considerable coaxing and cajoling, failed. He was too old. Since Marilyn and I believe in agency and were not about to force a blessing on an eight-year-old, all of the children except Michael received a blessing that year.<br><br>The school year proceeded normally. Michael and the other children did well and the family enjoyed their associations together. As the following May arrived, it was time for Little League baseball to begin. Following the last day of school, Michael's coach called a team practice. Michael's anticipation could not have been greater. His dream was about to be realized. He was to be the starting catcher. The baseball diamond was located in the river bottoms not far from the mouth of Provo Canyon and a few blocks from our home. The boys and the coach walked to the field. Following the practice the boys and coach started for home. Michael and a friend decided to run on ahead of the coach and the other boys. In the process they had to cross University Avenue not far from the mouth of the canyon. As they approached the highway, Michael's friend looked each way and noticed a car coming from the north. Michael failed to look and darted onto the highway just as a 16-year-old boy, out for his first drive in his brother's car, came speeding out of the canyon.<br><br>I can't imagine the fear that must have struck the young driver's heart as he saw the small boy in front of him. The driver slammed on the brakes and swerved in an attempt to miss the boy. The side of the front fender and grill hit Michael and threw him down the highway, where he landed in a heap of broken bones.<br><br>Sister Bateman and I were visiting parents in American Fork when the police reached us by telephone with the news. We were told that Michael was in an ambulance on his way to the hospital and that he was in critical condition. Before leaving American Fork, I called a friend and asked him to meet us at the hospital to assist in giving Michael a blessing. The drive from American Fork to Provo was the longest 20 minutes of our lives. During the drive Marilyn and I prayed fervently, asking the Lord to preserve the life of our son and bless me with an understanding of the Lord's will for him. In those 20 minutes we learned what it means to pray with "real intent" (Moroni 10:4).<br><br>As we parked the car by the door of the emergency room, we saw the police and a young man leaving the hospital. He was crying. The police recognized us and introduced us to the young man as the driver of the car. We put our arms around him and told him that we knew it was not his fault. We then entered the hospital to find Michael. We found him in a room with doctors and nurses feverishly attending to his needs. He had received a concussion and was irrational and crying for his mother. His scalp was laid back on his head, and the broken bones were obvious. My friend had arrived, and we asked if we could have two or three minutes with him alone before they took him to the operating room. They agreed. Again I prayed with all the fervency of my being that his life would be preserved and that the blessing would reflect the Lord's will. My friend anointed and I sealed. As I laid my hands upon his head, a feeling of comfort and peace came over me. Words flowed and promises were made.<br><br>For the next four weeks Michael lay in a hospital bed with his head bandaged, his arm in a cast, and his leg in traction. Each Wednesday evening following the Little League game, his teammates would file into the hospital room and give Michael a rundown. Each week tears would well up in Michael's eyes and run down his cheeks as he saw his teammates enter the room and heard the boys relive the game. He would have given anything to be able to participate. After four weeks Michael was put in a body cast that went from his chest to his toes. On two or three occasions we took him to a game to watch his friends play. Another four weeks passed, and the body cast was replaced with a cast from his hip to his toes. Two days before school was to begin the cast was removed, and Michael began the long process of exercising his leg to obtain full use again.<br><br>As the family gathered the next night for school blessings, is there any wonder as to who wanted the first blessing? A nine-year-old boy, a little older and a lot wiser, was first in line. Michael is not the only member of our family to learn from the experience. All of the other children have talked about the protection that may come through a father's blessing. Over the years they have come to understand that accidents are not always prevented by priesthood blessings, but they have also learned that more than one type of protection is available through the priesthood. Today our grandchildren are recipients of priesthood blessings. The tradition is in its second generation. We hope that this practice, like the family, will prevail through the eternities.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the family is meant to be eternal. Each one of us may be part of an eternal family if we are obedient to gospel principles. A fullness of joy is found only within the framework of an exalted family. Some people may scoff at the seventh commandment, which requires chastity before marriage and fidelity afterward, but "political correctness" is not a substitute for the plan of happiness. Marriage is a sacred relationship between a man and a woman. May each of us live so that we may partake of the greatest blessing the Lord has in store for us, that of eternal life. I ask these blessings on all of us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<br>
<br>
My dear young brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be on this campus. I recognize that it is both a rare privilege and an awesome responsibility to occupy this podium today. It is also a privilege to be a student at this institution. I honor your president and my brother in the Quorum of the Seventy, President Merrill Bateman. I'm especially grateful for the confidence of those who have entrusted me to address you and pray that you might come away today with a message that will strengthen you. In section 50 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord reminds us that both "he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (verse 22). I pray that such will be the case today.<br><br>I honor you for your willingness to take counsel from those of us who are older and are supposed to be wiser. I know that there is also great wisdom, experience, and tremendous potential among this group. I am not unaware of the generations that separate us. Most of you are the age of my children or grandchildren. I want you to know of my love and support for you and of my sincere appreciation for the good choices you are making. I know that it is not always easy to be young. And you must also understand that it is not always easy to be old.<br><br>Together, however, we can work to make better homes, increase the love in our families, bring peace to our neighborhoods and communities, and make the world a better place for you, for your children, and for your grandchildren.<br><br>Somewhere between your age and my age there is common ground that binds us together. And since truth knows no age nor generation, today I'd like to focus on some truths that bless us and help us have happier, more productive lives in our homes, in the Church, and in our work.<br><br>Your generation has grown up in the "information age." You have at your fingertips vast stores of data. You can carry around on a CD-ROM an entire encyclopedia. The scriptures are contained--along with a variety of commentary--on a small magnetic disk. You can download from the Internet volumes of information of every kind. You can access information around the clock on cable, satellite, and digital TV channels. To the uninitiated, this is an overwhelming resource. The key in using this information to our advantage--as in all things--is to know how to manage it. Of all the stores and stores of information available on the topic of William Shakespeare, for example, what do you include in your report, how do you write it in an interesting and informative way, and how do you select the sources you'll quote? It seems to me that with the availability of that kind of information, there is a danger of either using too much or not using enough as we try to apply it to our lives.<br><br>I want to talk to you today in a way that will give you enough information, yet not overwhelm you. I'd like to begin by sharing with you an example of information that has been put in the format of a "to do" list. I think you'll recognize them.<br><br>A few years ago Robert Fulghum became an overnight household word when he published his little guide<i>All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.</i>His counsel was pretty sound--even in the sophisticated world in which we live:<br><br><i>All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate-school mountain, but there in the sandpile at Sunday School. These are the things I learned:</i><br><i>Share everything.</i><br><i>Play fair.</i><br><i>Don't hit people.</i><br><i>Put things back where you found them.</i><br><i>Clean up your own mess.</i><br><i>Don't take things that aren't yours.</i><br><i>Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.</i><br><i>Wash your hands before you eat. ...</i><br><i>Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.</i><br><i>Live a balanced life--learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some.</i><br><i>Take a nap every afternoon.</i><br><i>When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands, and stick together.</i><br><i>Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the Styrofoam cup: The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.</i><br><i>Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam cup--they all die. So do we.</i><br><i>And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books and the first word you learned--the biggest word of all--LOOK.</i>[Robert Fulghum,<i>All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten</i>(New York: Villard Books, 1988), pp. 6–7]<br><br>Mr. Fulghum's little list is concise and to the point. It gives us enough information to clearly see his wisdom and boils it down just enough to tell a wonderful story.<br><br>For all the years that you and I have been alive, we have benefited from the foresight of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who sought to give a brief but concise summary of what it is the Latter-day Saint believes. We know his work to be the Articles of Faith, and they are dutifully memorized by almost every Primary child. I could call upon most of you to come forward and recite them, and it would not cause you any distress whatsoever. I will spare you that exercise, but I invite you to draw upon those time-tested and honored points of living belief.<br><br>Indeed, Heavenly Father has shared with us a concise list of the Ten Commandments. It is not by any means an all-inclusive list, but it's sure a step toward exaltation to be able to say that your life conforms to them.<br><br>I'd like to continue by sharing with you today my own list. It is brief and contains a few principles that I think you can easily remember and that I think will ultimately add a great dimension to your lives. I sincerely doubt these principles will ever be published as "The Goaslind Guidelines" or the "Three B's" or enjoy the popularity of any of the lists I've shared with you thus far today, but I still stand by them and hope that you will find them useful as you think about how to go on from here.<br><br>There are, in fact, three<i>be's:</i>Be honest. Be pure. Be humble.<br><br>Now I would not wish to imply that you can forget everything else and just focus on my list, but if you will make a diligent effort to include these elements in your daily life, I can almost surely promise you that you will find happiness--and that much more rarified goal, joy.<br><br>Examine with me for a few minutes these three broad categories of endeavor and see if together we can't make a meaningful effort at changing our lives.<br><h2><b>Be Honest</b></h2><br>As children we grew up (in this country, at least) hearing about the honesty of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. "I cannot tell a lie" and "Honesty is always the best policy" still ring in my ears today. I expect they were taught to most of you as children. In Primary, and throughout our learning experiences in the gospel, we hear lessons on always telling the truth, not taking things that don't belong to us, and returning things we've borrowed. A popular<i>Homefront</i>series a few years ago depicted--in operatic quality--the story of a boy who broke a storeowner's window and could not lie about it. He confessed in song that he had broken the window and was ready to pay the penalty. Indeed, the ninth commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour" (Exodus 20:16), reminds us that God expects us to be honest.<br><br>All of these are good and workable definitions of honesty. They are the foundation for helping us to define ourselves as "honest." But as you and I both know, there is an honesty much deeper and perhaps much more important than the answer we give our mothers about whether we took out the garbage.<br><br>Perhaps the honesty I'm probing for today can be dealt with much better by asking ourselves a few questions like "Who am I?" "Who have I become?" or "Who am I becoming?" Shakespeare reminded us, "To thine own self be true" (<i>Hamlet,</i>1.3.78), and even these 400 years later, that wisdom is good counsel.<br><br>I love the wisdom shown by the young Joseph Smith when he related the experience of the First Vision. He said in his first-person account, "I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it" (JS--H 1:25). It's the honesty you show when no one else is around, or when there is no chance of getting caught, that makes all the difference in who we are and who we become.<br><br>I love the Robert Frost poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." You'll remember it, I'm sure. In it the old poet recalled youth and the opportunity to do something other than what he knew he should be doing. The final stanza records a young man's coming to terms with his own will to do what's right, even when it might not be observed by others:<br><br><i>The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>But I have promises to keep,<br>And miles to go before I sleep,<br>And miles to go before I sleep.</i><br>[Robert Frost, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" (1923), st. 4]<br><br>The story of a young man's wrestle 30 years ago with whether to be honest helps to illustrate the point further. Brother Warren Johnson related this poignant experience in a June 1989<i>Ensign</i>article:<br><br><i>My friend Bob had to do a lot of persuading in order to get another Marine to loan him his new camera to take to a servicemen's conference in Japan. But Bob assured him that he would take good care of it, and the Marine consented.</i><br><br><i>We were stationed in Vietnam at the height of the war. For months the Latter-day Saints in our battalion had looked forward to this conference, and Bob wanted to take the camera along.</i><br><br><i>Our departure from Vietnam was hectic, with lots of red tape and much confusion. Two of the men in our small group could travel only if space was available, and we were all grateful for the two extra seats on the huge jet bound for Japan. The Spirit was mindful of us! At last we were on our way.</i><br><br><i>For three days we attended meetings, talent shows, dances, and other social activities at the conference, held at beautiful Mount Fuji. After months of exposure to the ugliness of war, we enjoyed the kindness of the members and appreciated the spiritual uplift of hearing a General Authority speak. Battle-hardened men shed tears in some of the meetings because of the great joy they felt in the fellowship of other Saints.</i><br><br><i>As we neared the end of one of our last meetings, Bob quietly excused himself to return to the hotel and get the camera, which he had left in the room we had shared.</i><br><br><i>When he returned, we could tell by his expression that something was very wrong. He said that he couldn't find the camera. I reassured him that it had to be in our room and told him to look again.</i><br><br><i>He was even more visibly upset when he returned the second time. He knew where he had left the camera in the room, and he knew that it was gone. Locks to hotel room doors were not common then, and both of us realized the possibility of someone entering our room and taking the camera. We knew what a burden it would be to try to replace it on his corporal's pay, especially with a wife and two small children to provide for. Our elation of the three previous days was gone, and our good feelings were replaced with regret and misgivings.</i><br><br><i>Bob said that he would pray about the matter and ask the kindly hotel manager if he had noticed anyone carrying that particular kind of camera.</i><br><br><i>The meeting was over when Bob returned again, this time smiling, with the camera in his hand. He related what the hotel manager, in his halting English, had told him he had seen: an American had come downstairs into the lobby carrying the camera. He had then sat down and looked at it for a long time, as if he were contemplating something or wrestling with himself. Suddenly he had stood up, placed the camera where the manager could retrieve it, and departed.</i><br><br><i>Since the only Americans in the hotel at the time were those attending the conference, the manager assumed the man was one of our group.</i><br><br><i>The servicemen's conference had uplifted all who had attended it--including, quite possibly, a young man who, though tempted to steal a camera, had ultimately obeyed his conscience.</i>[Warren Johnson, "The Camera and the Conscience,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1989, pp. 69–70]<br><br>I promise each of you here today that in your advancing years you will focus less and less on things that are immediate and demanding of your time. You will instead recall and reflect on the successes of your life--and, unfortunately, a failure here and there. The events of your life will become distilled in your memory. Thousands of unimportant or less fulfilling occurrences will fade from view. But the truly important decisions, actions, and events will be indelibly written in your ability to remember. You are in control of them now. You can choose, you can decide, you can write what will emerge 30 years from now as the significant events that shaped your life. I can assure you that among those vivid memories will remain the overall degree to which you have been an honest man or woman, husband or wife, father or mother, son or daughter.<br><br>Be honest in your dealings with one another--not just when you sell a car or get too much change at the supermarket--but honest in your relationships, honest in your dating, honest in your marriage. Be honest with your children and with your parents. Allow only the truth to emerge, however tempting it might be to color, change, or revise it as occasion seems to warrant.<br><br>Being honest, I think, is broad enough to include loyalty and fidelity. Jesus taught in Matthew 21 the parable of the two sons. It is an important lesson for us on honesty and integrity. Beginning in verse 28, the Savior teaches us:<br><br><i>But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</i><br><br><i>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</i><br><br><i>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</i><br><br><i>Whether of them twain did the will of his father?</i>[Matthew 21:28–31]<br><br>Be a man or woman of your word. If you said you would go, then go. If you said you would be true, be true. If you said you would love, then love. If you said you would honor, then honor.<br><br>Of course all of this places an enormous burden on each of us to weigh carefully the things we promise. Sometimes in the moment that we make a commitment to someone or something, it seems easy and right and exactly what we want. Peter himself wrestled with this kind of wavering. At the moment, his loyalty to the Savior seemed well and good, but before sunrise there had been wavering. Perhaps it is not a change of heart: our hearts may be pure and our intentions well in place. But we often find that some of the commitments we make become rather inconvenient. So perhaps my final point regarding honesty would be: Above all, be honest with yourselves. When you stand in front of yourself in the mirror, be sure that the person you see is someone you are comfortable with, approve of, and love. That person is less likely to make commitments, promises, and oaths that he or she is unable to honor.<br><h2><b>Be Pure</b></h2><br>The second point I wish to make is to be pure. The Savior Jesus Christ taught in the Sermon on the Mount, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8). I have thought a great deal about this promise because, like you, I would like to be among those who see God. It seems a simple enough thing. We are born pure, and most of us are taught right from wrong. We learn about choices and we find the strength to make commitments. But then life does tend to get complicated. Here we are in 1998. A great deal of pressure of every kind pounds in on each of us every day. If we are wrestling with axiom number one, above--that is, if we are finding it difficult to be honest--becoming pure is also going to present a challenge.<br><br>I'm fond of a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox that helps to bring the issue into focus:<br><br><i>It is easy enough to be pleasant,<br>When life flows by like a song,<br>But the man worth while is one who will smile,<br>When everything goes dead wrong.<br>For the test of the heart is trouble,<br>And it always comes with the years,<br>And the smile that is worth the praises of earth<br>Is the smile that shines through tears.</i><br><br><i>It is easy enough to be prudent,<br>When nothing tempts you to stray,<br>When without or within no voice of sin<br>Is luring your soul away;<br>But it's only a negative virtue<br>Until it is tried by fire,<br>And the life that is worth the honor on earth<br>Is the one that resists desire.</i><br><br><i>By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,<br>Who had no strength for the strife,<br>The world's highway is cumbered to-day,<br>They make up the sum of life.<br>But the virtue that conquers passion,<br>And the sorrow that hides in a smile,<br>It is these that are worth the homage on earth<br>For we find them but once in a while.</i><br>[Ella Wheeler Wilcox, "Worth While," in<i>Poems of Sentiment</i>(Chicago: W. B. Conkey Company, 1906), pp. 11–12]<br><br>Life is not always going to be fair. I suppose that most of you will remember as children that you were taught to play fair. Take turns. Share. Do all the kinds of things Robert Fulghum wrote about. In an ideal society everyone would honor those rules, and life itself would be colored inside the lines. But one of the most important principles you will learn in university life is that every problem must be viewed in terms of the variables that influence it. One of these great variables is that life is not always fair. We may not always get to choose. We may have influences and challenges in life that are quite out of our control. As much as we would like to have every home be an ideal setting for growth and development, we know that this is not the case. We are quite unable to control how others feel about us or, sometimes, how we feel about someone else. The scriptures teach us to love God and to love our neighbor as ourself. It seems a simple enough request. But I doubt seriously if there is one of us here who has not wrestled in some way with feelings that challenge this commandment. Emotion is a powerful persuader. Together with its companions, passion and desire, it moves upon us in ways that we sometimes do not understand. Like fire, which is a good and useful force on the earth, these enormous forces in our lives have the power to pull us in directions we might not willingly go. The laws of physics explain how the sturdiest of individuals can be pulled through the window of a jetliner when things go wrong. Likewise, the laws that govern our hearts and our souls explain how similarly the sturdiest of us can be pulled through the tiniest hole of indiscretion. What are we to do? How can we stand against this seemingly electromagnetic force?<br><br>We develop purity, brothers and sisters. I do not believe purity is a gift for most of us. I believe it is a hard-won, well-practiced skill. Like learning to play Beethoven or being able to apply the principles of math, we must learn and practice to be pure. If it were not so, I think we might not have ever heard from Heavenly Father about an "iron rod." We might not have heard about "the mighty change" (D&amp;amp;C 6:33) or received the counsel, "Fear not to do good" (Alma 5:12, 14). Heavenly Father knows that we need anchors to help keep us in place during times of storm.<br><br>As you drive up and down the war zone known as I-15, you will see giant rigs pounding vast steel pylons into the ground. They are driven deep into the earth and then reinforced with concrete. Huge bolts are attached to them, and then large slabs of steel and concrete are attached to those, and, finally, we are promised, asphalt will be laid over it all and we will speed over it without a care in the world.<br><br>If you will permit me to make what might be a crude analogy, I would point out how much like that anchoring of the freeway our own hearts and minds ought to be. Only as we are able to place anchors deep within the soil of our hearts will we know that we are safe and secure to drive through the heavy traffic of life. We are bound to have a rich variety of life experiences, including happiness and sadness, success and failure, joy and pain, and perhaps even ecstasy or tragedy. On balance, however, we can enjoy life to the fullest, reach our greatest potential, overcome significant challenges, and have a great outpouring of happiness in life if we will steel ourselves to unworthy or unrighteous desires. Am I saying we will not be tempted? On the contrary, I can almost promise you that you will be.<br><br>But, as you have heard from so many at this pulpit and others, deciding now and resolving how you will respond in certain situations will save you a lifetime of unnecessary sorrows. President Boyd K. Packer has taught us the power of the hymns of Zion. On numerous occasions he has reminded us that music, that powerful source of strength and inspiration, enables us to recall to our minds resolves and commitments we have made. Could I suggest that you allow the words of a hymn to be in the back of your minds continually? You can select any one you want, but one that I like and that might closely parallel what it is we have been talking about is "Choose the Right."<br><br>We have taught Primary children to prepare to make right choices in life by remembering to always choose the right. I know that a great many of you have adopted this theme in your own lives and have carried on the Primary practice of wearing the CTR ring. They have become rather trendy of late. Many have purchased rather expensive models, and the concept has enjoyed significant commercial success. I still prefer the simple one that turns your finger green. It was thought up by a wonderful sister who wanted to teach what it is that I am trying to illustrate today: When a choice is placed before you, simply decide to choose what you know Heavenly Father would have you choose. I know it gets more complicated than that, but, believe me, if you will keep it simple, it will bless your lives enormously.<br><br><i>Choose the right when a choice is placed before you.<br>In the right the Holy Spirit guides;<br>And its light is forever shining o'er you,<br>When in the right your heart confides.</i><br>["Choose the Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 239]<br><br>Strengthen your resolve now that you will never allow that tiny pinpoint of indiscretion to open wide enough to pull you through. Resolve to be pure. Resolve to be happy, to be successful, to enjoy life to the fullest, to laugh and cry and share in the rich blessing of emotions that will come to you in a lifetime--but resolve to do it with the anchor of purity undergirding all that you do. I do not wish to oversimplify righteous living; it may not be easy to choose the right when often there is such a strong influence toward choosing wrong--but you can do it!<br><h2><b>Be Humble</b></h2><br>The last of my three points today is closely related to the two I have described. Humility is perhaps the most elusive quality we strive after. I say that because it seems to me that as soon as you begin to feel that you have humility, it's a pretty good indication that you may not. I do believe, however, that we will be unsuccessful in developing it if we are not honest and pure. The lack of honesty and purity seem to me to be two of the great stumbling blocks to developing humility. Allow me to share with you a sweet story from the writings of Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone, one of my brethren in the Quorum of Seventy and a man who has been my counselor in the Young Men presidency and a friend for many years. He wrote:<br><br><i>I made a decision not to tell anyone of my mother's death as my feelings were especially tender, humble, and close to the surface. I met all day Saturday with the stake leaders and members. After the last meeting, which ended at 9:00 at night, the mission president came to me and asked me to interview a missionary. We met with the missionary, who had been involved inappropriately with a nonmember woman. He had not committed a major transgression but had crossed over the line of propriety. Her husband was offended, and the woman was upset. They no longer had any interest in the Church. The president had counseled the young elder at length. He told me that the elder would not admit he was wrong and would not even say he was sorry. The General Authorities in Salt Lake City had been involved, and I was to make a determination while I was in Florida as to whether or not he could stay in the mission field. I was tender anyway, and I thought that if he would just say he was sorry, I would let him stay. I used every skill I had learned and all the inspiration I could draw upon trying to get him to say he was sorry. He would not. Finally, he promised he would not do it again, but he would not say he was sorry, even though he wanted to stay on his mission.</i><br><br><i>I said, "Let me ask you two more questions before I make a decision." I had about decided he would have to go home, and the questions were simply a last-minute stall before I announced my feelings. I said, "What does your father do in the Church?" He responded that his father was inactive, that he fished, hunted, or sat in front of the television all day long on Sundays. His father did not want him to be on a mission; he wanted him to come home and would have been glad if he did. His father smoked and drank, and, as the elder described him, I realized there was no support from the father. I said, "Tell me about your mother; what does she do in the Church?" His face softened, his eyes moistened, and he responded, "She is the stake young women's president." Then he talked about her for a few minutes. When he finished, I said, "I am going to let you stay, but you don't deserve to. However, your mother doesn't deserve to have you come home dishonored. You are probably about the only joy she has in this life. I imagine every letter you write to her she reads over and over again. I imagine that she takes your letters as she goes around the stake and reads them to the Beehives, Mia Maids, and Laurels. Her whole pride and joy must be centered around you. She doesn't have much at home, and I couldn't bear the thought of having this woman have to go to the airport and pick up her son who had been dishonorably released from his mission." Then the emotion came, and with tears I reaffirmed, "I simply could not do that to your mother. You do not deserve to stay, but she does not deserve one more trial." He thanked me for letting him stay but still would not say he was sorry.</i><br><br><i>The next day at the close of the final session of the conference, I said, "I apologize if I have been a little tender and emotional. My mother died Thursday night, and the funeral is tomorrow." Then I shared for the next fifteen or twenty minutes what she had meant in our lives. I said, "I will miss the viewing tonight, but I will arrive back in Salt Lake by 1:00 a.m. or so and will be able to attend the funeral." It was an emotional time for me as I shared my innermost feelings.</i><br><br><i>At the close of the conference, this young elder whom I had interviewed came running up to the stand. With great tears on his cheeks, he threw his arms around me and shuddered with emotion. Then he said, "Now I know why you are letting me stay; it is not only because of my mother but also because of yours." I said, "You're right, I suppose it's because of my mother also." He said, "I humbly apologize for what I have done. I truly am sorry, and I promise I will be the best missionary in this mission." Later his mission president told me he was true to his word.</i>[Vaughn J. Featherstone,<i>More Purity Give Me</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1991), pp. 96–99]<br><br>I don't know what it is that makes it so difficult for us sometimes to banish pride from our hearts. I'm not talking about the good kind of pride--the kind of pride that allows you to rejoice in a wonderful accomplishment or be pleased that your team has worked hard and had a winning season. In fact, I'd add here that it's just as important to be proud of your team when they<i>don't</i>have a winning season as when they do!<br><br>I'm talking about the kind of pride that the Savior has asked us to weed out of our lives. There are abundant references in the scriptures to keeping pride at bay, but perhaps one of my favorites comes from section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord is counseling Joseph and Oliver concerning the continuing steps in organizing the First Presidency, but he warns them carefully in verse 17 that they not allow pride to overcome them in their important work and callings: "Be not ashamed, neither confounded; but be admonished in all your high-mindedness and pride, for it bringeth a snare upon your souls" (D&amp;amp;C 90:17).<br><br>"It bringeth a snare upon your souls." What beautiful and descriptive language the Lord uses to caution us in love and kindness! A snare is a noose used in entangling birds or small mammals. Another definition describes it as "something by which one is entangled, involved in difficulties, or impeded." How often our souls become entangled, involved in difficulties, or impeded because we are unwilling to lay aside our defenses and strip ourselves of the pride that keeps us from doing what we know to be right.<br><br>I cannot think on this topic without being reminded of the 2,000 stripling warriors--the sons of Helaman or the army of Helaman. These were good and honest young men, pure in all their doings and unashamed that they were taught by their mothers. Stripped of pride and vanity, but willing to defend what they knew to be right, they marched into battle against those who would destroy them. We pick up the story in Alma 56, wherein the humility of these young men becomes clear to us. Beginning in verse 47, we read:<br><br><i>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</i><br><br><i>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.</i>[Alma 56:47–48]<br><br>The Savior Jesus Christ suffered as he was nailed upon the cross, but as he languished in the last minutes of his earthly life, he thought and spoke with tenderness to his mother in John 19, beginning with verse 25:<br><br><i>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</i><br><br><i>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</i><br><br><i>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</i>[John 19:25–27]<br><br>There is a deep and well-regarded relationship between each of us and our mothers. I think even among those for whom the relationship has been unfortunately strained, there are thoughts and feelings regarding our mothers that bring us to our greatest humility. Jesus' dying thoughts were of the care of his mother; the stripling warriors spoke in humility the teachings of their mothers; the young man in Elder Featherstone's story was touched and finally humbled by thoughts of a caring mother. Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest of our presidents, once said, "All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother" (Josiah G. Holland,<i>The Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>[Springfield, Massachusetts: Gurdon Bill, 1866], p. 23, and George Alfred Townsend,<i>The Real Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>[New York: Publication Office, Bible House, 1867], p. 6). I think in this light of my own dear mother, for whom I have the greatest love, and who at age 95 still stands as a wonderful example to her three sons.<br><br>Now this is not a talk about mothers, brothers and sisters, but there seems to be a strong and striking parallel between the humility we obtain in life and the influence of our mothers on us as adults. I mention it because I think that it bears reflection and consideration in our lives as we try to become who it is we want to become. If it is as the Savior has suggested, that in becoming like little children we have the greatest faith and humility, perhaps it is in remembering how we were taught by our mothers as little boys or little girls that brings us to this tender, humble, teachable state. In Matthew 18, beginning in verse 2, we read:<br><br><i>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</i><br><br><i>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</i>[Matthew 18:2–4]<br><br>We speak of childlike faith, brothers and sisters, but it is actually the faith and trust of a child that brings the humility we desire in our lives. If we can find it in our hearts to strip ourselves of worldly pride, tune our hearts to the teachings of Jesus Christ, lose ourselves in the service of others, and, as the stripling warriors did, "think more upon the liberty" of our fathers than we do upon our own lives, we can begin to know in a quiet way the humility we seek.<br><br>I rejoice with you that you are where you are today, brothers and sisters. In this place of learning and growing, striving and becoming, it is a tribute to your parents and your teachers that so many of you would be where the Lord can find you. Will you try to remember the three little "be's" we have thought about this morning? As I have said, they cannot by themselves ensure anyone's salvation, but they can put us on the path toward perfection. Be honest; be pure, be humble.<br><br>Now, without much comment, could I risk adding a fourth? Be courageous. To be honest and pure, to seek humility, and then to move forward with a confidence in life, you will need courage. In fact, none of what we have spoken about today can be done without courage.<br><br>Let me leave you today with the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who encouraged his brethren in the work they had undertaken and bore strong testimony of the Savior, Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</i><br><br><i>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:22–23]<br><br>I add my own voice to this joyful sound of praise and honor for the Lord Jesus Christ. I testify of his birth, his life, his death, and his resurrection in our behalf, brothers and sisters. I pray that as you take upon yourselves his holy name and that as you seek to become his disciple, you will make a new start today by striving to be honest, pure, humble, and courageous. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jack H Goaslind was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 20 January 1998 in the Marriott Center.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Young: “The Man for the Hour Will Be Ready Whenever the Hour Strikes” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The year 2000 is fast approaching, and more than passing interest is being expressed in many quarters as a global populace makes the transition from one millennium into the next. On the BYU campus, my friend Dr. Gordon E. Stokes and his colleagues in the Department of Computer Science are viewing the wreck created by CBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) programmers in the 1960s and 1970s,<br><br><i>when they ignored good design and set up a date field with just two digits, 00. In doing so they sowed the seeds of a business world nightmare in the year 2000 when many accounts, bookings, and benefits will experience disastrous results if the necessary corrections are not made.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>It's panic time, and<i>Software Magazine</i>has just published its "Year 2000 Survival Guide."<sup>2</sup><br><br>In Great Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that the Millennium Dome, now being constructed on the prime meridian at Greenwich, will be "the most exciting thing to happen anywhere in the world in the year 2000."<sup>3</sup>A Washington, D.C., announcement has been made of a White House Millennium Project, "a yearlong celebration of American history, science, and culture," replete with "millennium evenings at the White House" featuring noted speakers. Washington has also contacted a number of world leaders to discuss mutually beneficial millennium celebrations. One spokesperson observed, "This is a chance to reflect on our collective past and where we're going together."<sup>4</sup><br><br>In the waning moments to the year 2000, I am sure that individually and unitedly as a Latter-day Saint community we will take occasion to reflect on our own collective past and to contemplate the future. Saints everywhere can look back with thankful hearts that we were part of this particular millennial era in which the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in its fullness, an era when strong men and women received the word gladly and carefully laid the foundation for our own belief. This is a very unique block of time by eternal standards.<br><br>Among the key figures profoundly influencing the restoration process in the departing millennium has been President Brigham Young--truly a man for the ages. The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have announced that in the years 1998 and 1999 an important element of the course of study for the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums and the Relief Society classes of the Church will be drawn from the book entitled<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young.</i>It is intended that every person in the Church eighteen years and over will receive a personal copy of this volume through a ward or branch. I am informed that approximately 4,000,000 copies have been published to meet current and anticipated needs in the years ahead and that there are some twenty-three language translations.<br><br>The work is designed to be part of your permanent home library and is stitched across the back for durability--not simply glued. In the introduction to the text, this statement is made: "This book reflects the desire of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to deepen the doctrinal understanding of Church members and to awaken within them a greater desire to know the things of God."<sup>5</sup>The<i>Ensign</i>magazine has recently featured articles on the components of the new course of study in both the December 1997 and January 1998 issues. And for the February 1998 printing, BYU's Ronald W. Walker has written an exceptional piece called "Brigham Young: Student of the Prophet."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Like you, I am excited about the prospect of absorbing the wealth of gospel understanding embedded in such a study. Although threads of President Young's life are found throughout the new volume, the primary concentration is designedly on his teachings. Believing that your two-year study might be enhanced by some additional understanding of how the man was made, I would like to speak with you today about the historical Brigham and his early ministry.<br><br>Following the death of President Joseph F. Smith in 1918 and the transition of administration to President Heber J. Grant, apostle Orson F. Whitney reflected on the lives of the seven prophets who had thus far graced the dispensation of the fullness of times. He wisely observed:<br><br><i>Each succeeding President of the Church ought to vary in some respects from all other incumbents of that high and holy position. For this reason: The work of the Lord is always progressing, and consequently always changing--not its principles, nor its aims; but its plans, its instruments, and its methods of procedure. These are constantly changing, in order to meet new conditions and profit by them. Hence a variety of leaders is essential. To-day is not Yesterday, nor will To-morrow be To-day. The Lord provides the men and the means whereby He can best work, at any given time, for the carrying out of his wise and sublime purposes.</i>The Man for the Hour will be ready whenever the Hour strikes.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Though he himself was hundreds of miles away, the literal hour struck for Brigham Young at Carthage Jail precisely at "5 o'clock, 16 minutes, and 26 seconds" on the afternoon of June 27, 1844. A musket ball intended to dispatch John Taylor's life was instead deflected off of his pocket watch. The hands of the smashed timepiece recorded the very instant when an infuriated mob besieged the prison and poured a murderous fire into jailer Stigall's upstairs apartment.<sup>8</sup>Brother Taylor recalled:<br><br><i>It certainly was a terrible scene, streams of fire as thick as my arm passed by me as these men fired. ...</i>[It]<i>was far from pleasant to be so near the muzzles of those fire arms as they belched forth their liquid flame and deadly balls.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were slain in the attack, and an inexorable moment of transition was set in motion for Brigham Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve.<br><br>Brigham Young said of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>The Lord had his eye upon him, and upon his father, and upon his father's father, and upon their progenitors clear back to ... Adam. He has watched that family and that blood as it has circulated from its fountain to the birth of that man. He was foreordained in eternity to preside over this last dispensation.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was."<sup>11</sup>I have no doubt that Brigham Young was also the recipient of a heavenly appointment and had a "watched" bloodline in his capacity of successor in office to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>Perhaps we can briefly establish a few ancestral roots for President Young. His father, John Young, was recruited at age sixteen in the 4th Massachusetts Brigade of Musketry, returning home to Hopkinton, Middlesex, Massachusetts, from the Revolutionary War in 1783.<sup>12</sup>He became acquainted with nineteen-year-old Abigail Howe, nicknamed Nabby. She is described as being "a little above medium height" and having "blue eyes, with yellowish brown hair, folded in natural waves and ringlets across her shapely brow." Nabby and her four sisters were identified by those who knew them as being "pretty girls, vivacious, musical and very popular." These talented young women "were all singers and many social affairs were brightened by the duets and simple folk songs essayed by the Howe sisters."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Highly impressed by her refined and pious nature, John Young asked for the hand of Abigail Howe. The couple entered the bonds of matrimony on October 31, 1785, at Hopkinton.<sup>14</sup>However, Nabby's marriage was carried out "solely against the will of her parents, particularly her Father, for he thought it rather beneath him that his daughter should choose a servant boy, brought up in the kitchen" of Colonel John Jones--and an orphan at that!<sup>15</sup><br><br>Daughters Nancy and Fanny were soon added to the Young household before John looked west, locating his little family in the Platauva district of east-central New York in what was then the township of Coxsackie, Albany County (where the village of Durham, Greene County, now stands). Another child, Rhoda, was born here on September 10, 1789.<sup>16</sup><br><br>It was in this wilderness setting that John and his neighbor were attacked by a large black bear. The bear had been treed by dogs. Against John's advice, his neighbor had wounded the treed bear with a load of shot, which only served to enrage the creature. John stood his ground and finally dispatched the attacker by jamming a long, sharpened stick into the bear's mouth and throat, "which after a severe struggle brought the furious animal dead at his feet."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Nabby had a difficult time adjusting to these decidedly primitive surroundings. She was "full of fear and cares, together with a delicate state of health" when she wrote to her family in Hopkinton and explained her "lonely situation." Her father, Phinehas Howe, "started two sleighs after his lost child, and her family." John rather resented the intrusion on his affairs, as he thought their circumstances promising. However, yielding to the entreaties of his wife and the teamsters, who had been instructed not to return without her, the Youngs journeyed back to Hopkinton.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Five additional siblings were born between 1791 and 1799. John, Jr., Nabby, Susannah, Joseph, and Phinehas Howe swelled the family ranks before John again left Hopkinton--this time for the Green Mountains of Vermont.<sup>19</sup>Locating in the township of Whitingham, Windham County, John homesteaded 51 H acres purchased from his brother-in-law, Joseph Mosley, Sr. On what is known today as Brigham's Hill, the ninth child and future prophet was born on June 1, 1801.<sup>20</sup>Susa Young Gates and Leah D. Widtsoe affirmed, "His name Brigham was the surname of his uncle, Phinehas Brigham, who married his mother's sister, Susanna." However, Leonard J. Arrington has stated that Brigham was named "after the surname of Nabby's maternal grandparents," who were Sibil Brigham and Ebenezer Goddard. Local historian Doris Kirkpatrick averred that "substantial evidence points to the fact that John Young named his ninth child 'Brigham' out of respect for his friend and contemporary--John Brigham of Whitingham."<sup>21</sup>I suspect that someday we may have to ask Brother Brigham, "Just where did you get that handle?"<br><br>Brigham's mother was not well at the time of his birth. As a family member later reported, Nabby was "not robust in her constitution, she burned up her fires of youth in impetuous toil while constantly on the move with her pioneering husband."<sup>22</sup>During her mother's perpetual sickness, daughter Fanny stepped in to assist with the newborn, "for the child had to be nursed from the bottle, and no one could pacify him but his sister Fanny, who was passionately fond of him. If need be she would have laid down her life for him."<sup>23</sup><br><br>Because of an ongoing controversy as to just where Brigham Young was born in Whitingham, I once spent ten days working with Arthur D. Wheeler, the town clerk, in hunting down the elusive site of origin.<sup>24</sup>In off moments I had the opportunity to walk in the vast stillness of the Green Mountains and enjoy some contemplative periods standing on the banks of Sadawaga Pond. In that setting, which is still pristine, I gained a vibrancy of feeling for the Young family that is only engendered while in those selfsame environs so familiar to them. As S. Dilworth Young remarked:<br><br><i>If one listened, one could hear the z-r-r-r z-r-r-r of a cross cut saw as the older boys felled trees, intermingled with the thump! thump! of an ax as they trimmed off limbs. If one listened intently, he could hear the Gee! Haw! of John Young as he guided the oxen pulling the hand plow among the stumps.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>John's restlessness again uprooted the family in 1804, and they journeyed to Sherburne, Chenango County, New York. Joseph Young stated:<br><br><i>The first place of our Residense was on one of the Hills of what was subsequently (Sherburne was Divided) called Smyrna at a farmhouse owned By a Man By the name of Philip Truax here we Spent the two first years</i>[of]<i>our Pilgramage.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>The Youngs eventually situated themselves some three miles southwest of the village of Smyrna, near Cold Brook, and on the road between "Dark Hollow" and "German Hollow."<sup>27</sup>In the midst of the hard labor demanded of an agrarian society, Susa Young Gates observed:<br><br><i>Father, mother, children, all of them, loved and made music. The mother was a choir singer in the Methodist congregation, where she and her God-fearing husband worshipped. Parents and children read and studied the Scriptures and they were eager students of the primitive schools of their neighbourhood during such periods as their almost nomadic life permitted.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>The family later moved to the Genoa/Lansingville area, where on June 11, 1815, the weak frame of Nabby finally gave out entirely at age forty-nine. Tuberculosis was the principal cause. Lorenzo Dow Young, her last child, said:<br><br><i>She frequently called me to her bedside and counseled me to be a good man that the Lord might bless my life. On one occasion she told me that if I would not neglect to pray to my Heavenly Father, he would send a guardian angel to protect me in the dangers to which I might be exposed.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>Brigham, who deeply loved his mother and was dutiful to her influence, reminisced:<br><br><i>Of my mother--she that bore me--I can say, no better woman ever lived in the world than she was. I have the feelings of a son towards her: I should have them--it is right; but I judge the matter pertaining to her from the principles and the spirit of the teachings I received from her.</i><br><br><i>Would she countenance one of her children in the least act that was wrong according to her traditions? No, not in the least degree.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>In all, eleven children had graced the household of Nabby and John--six girls and five boys. As was stated concerning that household, "All the children developed personal integrity; and each one on hearing the Gospel, accepted it with whole heart."<sup>31</sup><br><br>Local historians Richard Palmer and Karl Butler have found some accounts that strongly suggest that Nabby is buried in the old White Settlement Cemetery, a half-mile west of the village of Lansingville.<sup>32</sup>I have stood with these men in that cemetery in an attempt to trace the vestiges of her final resting place.<br><br>On the move once again, the family situated themselves in the area of Tyrone and the "Sugar Hill" district of Steuben (now Schuyler) County. John purchased one hundred acres in "a dense forest fifteen miles from any settlement."<sup>33</sup>On one occasion fourteen-year-old Brigham and eight-year-old Lorenzo Dow were left home alone with an empty flour barrel for two days while their father traveled to the Indian trading establishment at Painted Post to exchange sixty pounds of maple sugar for needed flour. Hungry from the lack of nourishment, the boys spotted a robin, which lingered a moment too long. Securing his father's musket, Brigham took careful aim and shot the bird. The robin, when properly boiled, and a creative additive of "two or three spoonfuls of flour" thumped out of the family barrel "with a stick," provided a nourishing meal.<sup>34</sup>I suggest to you students that at the appropriate time and place you may wish to stash away a few edibles for the lean days. Drawing your substance from nature isn't always what it's cooked up to be.<br><br>Referring to those challenging days at Tyrone, Brigham Young reported, "I have seen the time that I had not food to satisfy the craving of my nature," and further commented, "I know what it is to be in poverty, and to be destitute of the raiment necessary to keep my body warm." He learned to be "very close and economical," he said, "for my father had to do it."<sup>35</sup><br><br>Brigham's father proposed marriage to Hannah Dennis Brown in the Sugar Hill district about 1817. Hannah was a widow with a family of her own. She and John had three additional children. Hannah later struggled with the introduction of Mormonism into her Mendon household and would only join John, who gathered with the Saints in Kirtland, after nearly two years of separation. When John and the other members of the Young family elected to follow the Prophet to Missouri, Hannah again chose to return to her people in New York.<sup>36</sup>It was an era of soul-wrenching decision making for many.<br><br>The year 1817 proved a pivotal point for Brigham. He related, "When I was sixteen years of age, my father said to me, 'You can now have your time; go and provide for yourself'; and a year had not passed away before I stopped running, jumping, wrestling and the laying out of my strength for naught."<sup>37</sup>On reflection, we can each imagine our own state of preparedness to provide for ourselves at age sixteen. I have been forever grateful for a nurturing home and the old Logan 5th Ward that saw me through the vulnerable years until I could hit the road running at a more opportune time. The pure economics of the day often forced an early departure from the home.<br><br>Brigham Young was a self-made man--he had no formal education outside of a few days of schooling. What do you do when it's crunch time and you're on your own? Like many of you, he went interviewing. Brigham simply said, "I laid out my strength in planing a board."<sup>38</sup>Packing his limited belongings, he journeyed to the community of Auburn in Cayuga County, New York, and called upon the woodworking shop of John C. Jeffries, who advertised his wares "Chair Making, Sign Painting and Gilding."<sup>39</sup>He apprenticed himself to Jeffries and was taught the trades of carpenter, painter, and glazier (one who sets window glass). Numbers of you seniors will soon be plying your trade for a new boss in the workplace. Brigham described his initial assignment:<br><br><i>The first job my boss gave me was to make a bedstead out of an old log that had been on the beach of the Lake for years, water-logged and watersoaked. Said he--"There are tools, you cut that log into right lengths for a bedstead. Hew out the side rails, the end rails and the posts; get a board for a head board, and go to work and make a bedstead." And I went to work and cut up the log, split it up to the best of my ability, and made a bedstead that, I suppose, they used for many years.</i><sup>40</sup><br><br>Years later Brigham commented to an "old time friend," George Hickox, on his own continued work ethic from those New York years to the present:<br><br><i>I have believed all my life that, that which was worth doing was worth doing well, and have considered it as much a part of my religion to do honest, reliable work, such as would endure, for those who employed me, and to attend to the services of God's worship on the Sabbath.</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>His skill as a craftsman was later demonstrated on such building projects as the house of Judge Elijah Miller, which was eventually occupied by William H. Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state. The ornate mantelpiece within is reportedly his.<sup>42</sup><br><br>While pursuing a new job manufacturing furniture, buckets, and pails south of Bucksville (later Port Byron, New York), Brigham courageously attempted to save the life of a little infant. His attention was drawn by the frantic appeal of a woman whose baby had become lost. Suspecting that it might have tumbled into the water flume carrying water to the wheel that turned their lathes, Brigham first stopped the mill wheel, then dove into the flume and began feeling around the bottom. He touched the child, clutched and pulled her from the water. However, as he began to administer artificial respiration, the mother suddenly grabbed the child and ran to her home with the lifeless form, thus preventing the very act that may have saved its life.<sup>43</sup><br><br>It was at this time that he met and began to court eighteen-year-old Miriam Angeline Works from the town of Aurelius. Miriam is described as being "a beautiful blonde, with blue eyes, a finely chiselled face and wavy hair. She possessed a gentle, uncomplaining spirit and in every way most loveable."<sup>44</sup>The couple mutually agreed to affiliate with the Methodist persuasion following their October 5, 1824, wedding vows.<sup>45</sup>Brigham and Miriam lived for a short season at Haydenville, then located in Port Byron. Both homes still stand. Just at the time Joseph Smith and his scribes were in the process of translating the Book of Mormon in 1828, Brigham Young, Miriam, and a Port Byron addition, little Elizabeth (born September 26, 1825), took up residence on the John Young farm in Mendon, New York.<sup>46</sup>Brigham built a home for his father on the road leading south from the village of Mendon.<sup>47</sup>John's home was later split in two, and both halves face one another across the Cheese Factory Road.<sup>48</sup><br><br>Brigham also constructed a home and mill back in the property for himself. The mill had a "sizable undershot waterwheel to power the machinery."<sup>49</sup>He again established his woodworking trade, doing custom orders in the area. I might add, parenthetically, that thanks to a timely purchase by the Skabelund brothers, Lynn and Robert, of Logan, Utah, in 1979, the home of John Young and the site of Brigham's mill are now owned by the Church.<sup>50</sup><br><br>Lorenzo Dow Young said of his father's religious preference, "He was at first an Episcopal Methodist, but afterwards, in common with many others, became a Reformed Methodist."<sup>51</sup>John's sons, John, Jr., Joseph, Phinehas, Brigham, Lorenzo Dow, and a son-in-law, John Portineus Greene, also affiliated with Methodism, and, for the most part, were associated with the Reformed Methodists, being preachers and exhorters for that organization.<sup>52</sup>The Reformed Methodists were quite an exclusive denomination, numerically speaking. First organized in 1814, by 1844 the sect numbered just 3,000 in the United States and Canada. Its membership never exceeded 5,000 before merging with the Methodist Protestant Church.<sup>53</sup><br><br>I am convinced that, like Saul of Tarsus, the Lord wanted Brigham Young in his kingdom. He seems to have gone out of his way to appear to Saul on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1–22), and in a fashion found Brigham on the Mendon to Ionia road. There was no possible way for Brigham to escape. Though I am obviously exaggerating the point, let me say that it is not by much. Trace the events of his conversion with me. Brigham was first introduced to the Book of Mormon in the spring of 1830. Samuel Smith visited with Phinehas Young, who was dining at the Tomlinson Inn in the township of Mendon during April 1830. Samuel stated to him, "There is a book, sir, I wish you to read." He then affirmed, "If you will read this book with a prayerful heart, and ask God to give you a witness, you will know of the truth of this work." Thinking he would expose the erroneous nature of the work, Phinehas related: "I commenced and read every word in the book the same week. The week following I did the same, but to my surprise I could not find the errors I anticipated, but felt a conviction that the book was true."<sup>54</sup><br><br>This copy then began to circulate through the family.<br><br>In June 1830 Samuel Smith returned to the Mendon/Bloomfield area and placed a copy of the Book of Mormon on loan in the home of Brigham's sister, Rhoda Young, wife of John Portineus Greene, and that copy, too, was passed among family members.<sup>55</sup>Both of these books are variously mentioned as being instrumental in the conversion of Brigham Young.<br><br>Joseph and Phinehas Young were entertained at the home of Solomon Chamberlain in August 1830. The two brothers were on their way to Upper Canada (Ontario Province) to preach Reformed Methodism in the Kingston/Earnestown area. They stopped at Solomon's home on the Pilgrimport Road in Lyons Township. Solomon was a former Reformed Methodist, but he had been baptized into Mormonism in Seneca Lake by the Prophet Joseph Smith during April 1830. He preached to Joseph and Phinehas from the Book of Mormon. When he had spoken to them for almost two hours, Phinehas told him, "Hold on ... it was not good to give a colt a bushel of oats at a time. ... But it made little difference to him, he still talked of Mormonism."<sup>56</sup><br><br>Upon his departure from Canada, Phinehas joined his brother Brigham in attending a conference of the Reformed Methodists at Manlius Center in Onondaga County, New York. Solomon Chamberlain had also come to the conference to preach the Book of Mormon. Solomon recalled:<br><br><i>I met about 40 of their preachers and labored with them for two days to convince them of the truth of the Book of Mormon, and they utterly rejected me, and the Book of Mormon. One of their greatest preachers so called, by the name of Buckly, (if I mistake not) abused me very bad, and ordered me off from their premises. ... At this conference was Brigham and his brother Phinehas Young, they did not oppose me but used me well.</i><sup>57</sup><br><br>It remained, however, for Elders Alpheus Gifford and Eleazer Miller and others from the branch in Columbia, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, to complete the conversion cycle of Brigham Young and his family. There was a tiny pocket of Mormonism down in Bradford and Tioga counties, Pennsylvania, which was initially fanned into flame by Alpheus Gifford, who with his companions came through the Mendon/Victor area in 1831. He and Elder Miller returned again in 1832. In the intervening time, the Young family had made two visits to the Columbia Branch in Pennsylvania. After two years of intensive investigation, Brigham Young was prepared for baptism at the hands of Elder Miller at Mendon.<sup>58</sup>Speaking of Eleazer's great humility, Brigham confided:<br><br><i>If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like the smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence, or talents for public speaking, who could only say, "I know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord," the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true.</i><sup>59</sup><br><br>On Sunday, April 15, 1832, Brigham Young was baptized.<sup>60</sup>Remembering that memorable event, he said, "I recollect the Sunday morning on which I was baptized, in my own little mill stream."<sup>61</sup>Brigham also recalled that Elder Miller confirmed him at the water's edge, after which<br><br><i>we returned home, about two miles, the weather being cold and snowy; and before my clothes were dry on my back he laid his hands on me and ordained me an elder, at which I marvelled. According to the words of the Savior, I felt a humble, childlike spirit, witnessing unto me that my sins were forgiven.</i>[Miriam was baptized]<i>about three weeks afterwards.</i><sup>62</sup><br><br>As he did with Saul of Tarsus and Brigham Young, the Savior reaches out to each of us in his infinite goodness and gives us the opportunity to follow him. Brigham Young was seeking the Spirit by study and by faith when he received a personal confirmation. Thereafter his legs never faltered and his lips never quivered in that conviction. Reflecting on the spirit that pervaded his every action following his baptism, he later declared:<br><br><i>I wanted to thunder and roar out the Gospel to the nations. It burned in my bones like fire pent up. ... Nothing would satisfy me but to cry abroad in the world, what the Lord was doing in the latter days.</i><sup>63</sup><br><br>Over the next several months he performed local missions in such communities as Hector, Avon, Warsaw, Henrietta, "Reding" (Reading?), Hornby, and Patten.<sup>64</sup><br><br>Tragedy visited the Young home later that year on September 8, 1832. His wife, Miriam, succumbed to the ravages of consumption (tuberculosis) that had long racked her frame. She had been a virtual invalid from the affliction. A daughter recalled her father's reminiscing of those difficult days prior to her death:<br><br>[He]<i>got breakfast for his wife, himself, and the little girls, dressed the children, cleaned up the house, carried his wife to the rocking-chair by the fireplace and left her there until he could return in the evening. When he came home he cooked his own and the family's supper, put his wife back to bed and finished up the day's domestic labours.</i><sup>65</sup><br><br>After laying Miriam to rest in the Tomlinson Corners Cemetery on Boughton Hill Road, Brigham and his two daughters moved into the household of Heber C. and Vilate Kimball for an eighteen-month period. Vilate mothered Elizabeth and little Vilate, namesake of this benefactor.<sup>66</sup><br><br>Like so many of his contemporaries, Brigham Young wanted to meet the Prophet. Brigham, his brother Joseph, and Heber C. Kimball went to visit Joseph Smith at Kirtland during September–October 1832. Brigham declared:<br><br><i>Here my joy was full at the privilege of shaking the hand of the Prophet of God, and received the sure testimony, by the Spirit of prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to be, as a true Prophet.</i><sup>67</sup><br><br>And, in turn, Joseph Smith recorded that same incident:<br><br><i>I received a visit from Elders Joseph Young, Brigham Young, and Heber C. Kimball from Mendon, Munroe</i>[Monroe]<i>County, New York. They spent four or five days at Kirtland, during which we had many interesting moments. At one of our interviews, Brother Brigham Young, and John P. Greene spoke in Tongues, which was the first time I had heard this gift among the brethren, and others also spoke, and I received the gift myself. Brother Joseph Young is a great man, but Brigham is a greater, and the time will come when he will preside over the whole Church.</i><sup>68</sup><br><br>In New York, Brigham continued to labor as a missionary both locally and in Upper Canada.<br><br>The Youngs and Kimballs migrated to Kirtland, Ohio, in 1833. It was here that Brigham and other family members applied their craftsmanship in helping to build the new temple. He also took time to became better acquainted with Miss Mary Ann Angell, a sister who had been converted and baptized by John Portineus Greene in Ontario, New York. Mary Ann had gathered to Kirtland with the Saints in 1833. The two were married on February 18, 1834.<sup>69</sup><br><br>When the Lord called for the "strength of his house" to restore the Missouri Saints to their Jackson County homes in 1834 (see D&amp;amp;C 103), Brigham and Joseph Young were among those who immediately responded and undertook the long march with Zion's Camp. On returning to Kirtland, Brigham was accosted by an apathetic Mormon who challenged the purposes of the camp. It is needless to say that the man was a member of the Church who did not have the faith necessary to make the journey.<br><br><i>"Well," said the scoffer, "what did you gain on this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith?" "All we went for," promptly replied Brigham Young. "I would not exchange the</i>experience<i>I gained in that expedition for all the wealth of Geauga county."</i><sup>70</sup><br><br>Brigham Young was among nine members of Zion's Camp who were called to fill the original Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on February 14, 1835. And Joseph Young was named one of the seven presidents of the Quorum of Seventy that same month. In his capacity as an apostle, Brigham attended a council meeting in the Kirtland Temple following the dark days of apostasy associated with the demise of the Kirtland Safety Society Bank. A member of the opposition advanced the question of how they could drop Joseph Smith as president and sustain David Whitmer in his place. Without hesitation Brigham came to the Prophet's defense:<br><br><i>I rose up and told them in a plain and forcible manner that Joseph was a prophet, and I knew it; and that they might rail at and slander him as much as they pleased, they could not destroy the appointment of the Prophet of God; they could only destroy their own authority, cut the thread which bound them to the Prophet and to God, and sink themselves to hell. ... The meeting was broken up without the Apostates being able to unite on any decided measures of opposition....</i><br><br><i>During this siege of darkness I stood close by Joseph, and with all the wisdom and power God bestowed upon me, put forth my utmost energies to sustain the servant of God, and unite the quorums of the church.</i><sup>71</sup><br><br>Brigham Young proved to be such an able defender of the Prophet that the apostates sought to still his voice by doing him bodily harm or even taking his life. In order to save himself, it was necessary to flee Kirtland for Missouri. On the morning of December 22, 1837, he made his escape. Elder Young reported:<br><br><i>I left Kirtland in consequence of the fury of the mob, and the spirit that prevailed in the apostates, who threatened to destroy me because I would proclaim, publicly and privately, that I knew, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Most High God, and had not transgressed and fallen as apostates declared.</i><sup>72</sup><br><br>Is it any wonder that Brigham Young was subsequently identified by his fellows as "the lion of the Lord"?<sup>73</sup><br><br>From his place of momentary respite in Dublin, Indiana, Brigham aided the impoverished Joseph Smith when he, too, was forced to flee Ohio for his life in January 1838.<br><br>The Prophet said, "Brother Brigham, I am destitute of means to pursue my journey, and as you are one of the Twelve Apostles, who hold the keys of the kingdom in all the world, I believe I shall throw myself upon you, and look to you for counsel in this case."<br><br>Brigham replied, "If you will take my counsel, it will be that you rest yourself, and be assured, Brother Joseph, you shall have plenty of money to pursue your journey."<sup>74</sup>A Brother Tomlinson had been trying to sell his place for some time and asked Brigham Young for direction. Timely advice was given, and within a few days the property sold at a profit. A grateful Brother Tomlinson shared his good fortune with Brigham, and he then gave Joseph Smith $300 to continue his flight.<sup>75</sup><br><br>When the Prophet was incarcerated in Liberty Jail, as a result of the infamous extermination order of Governor Lilburn W. Boggs, Joseph called upon the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, especially in the persons of Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, to organize the exodus of the troubled Saints from that state under appointment of the First Presidency. Temporarily the Twelve were responsible for the affairs of the Church.<sup>76</sup><br><br>On April 18, 1839, it was Brigham Young who rallied available members of the Quorum of the Twelve in Quincy, Illinois, to accompany him back to Far West, Missouri, to initiate the fulfillment of the requirements specified in Doctrine and Covenants 118. The revelation directed the Twelve to depart for their European missions from the site of the Lord's house, commencing on April 26, 1839. Brigham Young declared to those present, "The Lord God had spoken, and it was our duty to obey and leave the event in his hands and he would protect us." This was admittedly an act of great courage on all their parts in the face of death threats from the mobber Samuel Bogart and others should they return to Caldwell County. In the early morning of April 26, the Twelve and a small group of Saints assembled at the southeast corner of the temple lot. There, hands were laid on the heads of Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith, and they were ordained as apostles as they sat on the southeast cornerstone.<sup>77</sup><br><br>The completion of that same revelatory assignment soon took nine members of the Quorum of the Twelve to Great Britain (including Orson Hyde) in 1840–41, where, as Ron Esplin has explained:<br><br><i>These labors of the Twelve in England under Young's direction marked the beginning of the quorum functioning as a united and effective entity. ... Young carefully nurtured harmony and the full participation of his associates in the decisions and labors of the Quorum. In England he labored diligently and with success to shape the Twelve into a quorum capable of functioning with united strength and wisdom rather than merely as a collection of individuals.</i><sup>78</sup><br><br>On their return from England, these members of the Quorum of the Twelve became, as it were, the Prophet's right hand. And as has been stated, they "remained unalterably united behind Joseph and his teachings."<sup>79</sup><br><br>Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards were among a select group of men who were the first recipients of the Lord's endowment at the hands of the Prophet on May 4, 1842, in Joseph's Red Brick Store--this before the availability of a temple. Joseph Smith explained:<br><br><i>I spent the day in the upper part of the store ... in council with General James Adams, of Springfield, Patriarch Hyrum Smith, Bishops Newel K. Whitney and George Miller, and President Brigham Young and Elders Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards, instructing them in the principles and order of the Priesthood, attending to washings, anointings, endowments and the communication of keys pertaining to the Aaronic Priesthood, and so on to the highest order of the Melchisedek Priesthood, setting forth the order pertaining to the Ancient of Days, and all those plans and principles by which any one is enabled to secure the fullness of those blessings which have been prepared for the Church of the First Born, and come up and abide in the presence of the Eloheim in the eternal worlds.</i><sup>80</sup><br><br>Brigham Young later directed the administration of some 5,615 endowments to the Saints in the Nauvoo Temple before the exodus to the West.<sup>81</sup><br><br>With a growing sense of urgency, the Prophet Joseph Smith felt the necessity of giving the Quorum of the Twelve all of the keys required to conduct the business of the kingdom, should anything happen to himself. Joseph convened the Quorum of the Twelve in the Red Brick Store during a time frame that, according to best evidence, fell between March 23 and April 4, 1844.<sup>82</sup><br><br>The text of the Prophet's remarks were related by Parley P. Pratt, who remembered him saying to them:<br><br><i>"I know not why; but for some reason I am constrained to hasten my preparations, and to confer upon the Twelve all the ordinances, keys, covenants, endowments, and sealing ordinances of the priesthood, and so set before them a pattern in all things pertaining to the sanctuary and the endowment therein."</i><sup>83</sup><br><br>Elder Pratt then explained:<br><br><i>Having done this, he rejoiced exceedingly; for, said he, the Lord is about to lay the burden on your shoulders and let me rest awhile; and if they kill me, continued he, the kingdom of God will roll on, as I have now finished the work which was laid upon me, by committing to you all things for the building up of the kingdom according to the heavenly vision, and the pattern shown me from heaven.</i><sup>84</sup><br><br>Of particular note, Elder Pratt said the Prophet<br><br><i>proceeded to confer on elder Young, the President of the Twelve, the keys of the sealing power, as conferred in the last days by the spirit and power of Elijah, in order to seal the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth should be smitten with a curse.</i><br><br><i>This last key of the priesthood is the most sacred of all, and pertains exclusively to the first presidency of the church, without whose sanction and approval or authority, no sealing blessing shall be administered pertaining to things of the resurrection and the life to come.</i><sup>85</sup><br><br>Elder Orson Hyde was likewise a witness to the Prophet's preparation of the Twelve for their leadership role and the investiture of priesthood keys. In a letter from Samuel W. Richards to Franklin D. Richards, August 23, 1844, Samuel commented on Orson's observations of the Prophet's last charge to the Twelve:<br><br><i>Orson Hyde told last Sunday what it was for, that they were in Council with Joseph so much last spring</i>[1844].<i>He said that Joseph was preparing them for the work that they have now got to do which is to hold the keys and build up this kingdom in all the world. Joseph committed unto them all the keys of the Priesthood otherwise the</i>fulness<i>would not have been upon the Earth now he is taken away. He also took them through all the ordinances which is necessary for the Salvation of Man, that they haveing experienced them all, by passing through them, might be prepared to lead the People in the path which they had trod when hed had finished his work ordained and anointed the twelve to lead this people and build upon the foundation which he had laid he was</i>filled with joy<i>&amp;amp; sayes he it is now but little matter what becomest of me.</i><sup>86</sup><br><br>At the moment the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered at Carthage, Illinois, Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff were seated in a railroad station in Boston, Massachusetts. Brigham said:<br><br><i>I felt a heavy depression of Spirit, and so melancholy I could not converse with any degree of pleasure. Not knowing anything concerning the tragedy enacting at this time in Carthage jail, I could not assign my reasons for my peculiar feeling.</i><sup>87</sup><br><br>His premonition of June 27 was not confirmed until July 16 in Peterboro, New Hampshire, where a letter directed to a local Saint from Joseph Powers in Nauvoo verified the awful news to him and Orson Pratt. The two sat in stunned silence. Brigham recalled:<br><br><i>The first thing which I thought of was, whether Joseph had taken the keys of the kingdom with him from the earth; brother Orson Pratt sat on my left; we were both leaning back on our chairs. Bringing my hand down on my knee, I said the keys of the kingdom are right here with the Church.</i><sup>88</sup><br><br>Affirmation of Joseph's death sped the return of the Twelve to Nauvoo. In the City of Joseph the apostles found Sidney Rigdon proffering a "guardianship" vs. the leadership of the Quorum. A special meeting of the Church was held at the "grove" on Thursday morning, August 8, 1844, to choose a guardian or a president and trustee under the auspices of the Twelve. After lengthy remarks by Sidney Rigdon in the morning assemblage, Brigham Young spoke briefly and then in the afternoon session addressed the vast congregation at some length. In the course of his delivery he stated:<br><br><i>For the first time in my life, for the first time in your lives, for the first time in the kingdom of God in the 19th century, without a Prophet at our head, do I step forth to act in my calling in connection with the Quorum of the Twelve, as Apostles of Jesus Christ unto this generation--Apostles whom God has called by revelation through the Prophet Joseph, who are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world.</i><sup>89</sup><br><br>As he spoke, many of his hearers became aware of a marvelous transformation taking place before their eyes in his "voice, person and manner." While in the process of delivering this important sermon, his whole being was transfigured, and it appeared to numbers of his hearers as though Joseph, not Brigham, was speaking. The mantle or form of the Prophet Joseph was manifested upon the person of Brigham Young. A spiritual confirmation of Brigham Young's leadership role was experienced by a significant number of the congregation.<sup>90</sup><br><br>After a succession of other speakers, business was conducted by Brigham Young. At the instigation of Sidney Rigdon, the proposition of an apostolic presidency was presented first. By universal vote, under the law of common consent, the Saints proclaimed their support for Brigham Young and the Twelve Apostles. This automatically negated the need to vote on Rigdon's tendered "guardianship."<sup>91</sup><br><br>"The Man for the Hour will be ready whenever the Hour strikes": President Young had been prepared in the councils of eternity for that very hour.<sup>92</sup>Throughout his life he firmly maintained, "What I have received from the Lord, I have received by Joseph Smith: he was the instrument made use of."<sup>93</sup>He also declared:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith has laid the foundation of the kingdom of God in the last days; others will rear the super-structure....</i><br><br><i>... I know that he was called of God, and this I know by the revelation of Jesus Christ to me, and by the testimony of the Holy Ghost. Had I not so learned this truth, I should never have been what is called a "Mormon," neither should I have been here to-day....</i><br><br><i>... Joseph told us that Jesus was the Christ, the Mediator between God and man, and the Saviour of the world. He told us that there was no other name in the heavens nor under the heavens, neither could there be, by which mankind could be saved in the presence of the Father, but by and through the name and ministry of Jesus Christ, and the atonement he made on Mount Calvary.</i><sup>94</sup><br><br>Brigham Young has been a man for the ages--most certainly a millennium man. I have tried to give you some sense of the emerging Brigham and those traits, already forged, that directed his later and better known achievements in the West. I pray that we, as a community of Saints, will take occasion to carefully read, digest, and ponder his words in the remaining moments before the year 2000. I can personally testify that for the inquiring mind the seeds of the gospel of salvation are implanted in his inspired discourses.<br><br><i>Larry C.

<h1>Believe - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be asked to speak at the devotional assembly this morning. Because the weekly devotionals at Brigham Young University have been such a significant part of my life, I have taken this invitation very seriously. My topic is "What We Believe."<br><br>Sooner or later you and I will be approached by men and women not of our faith--persons either sincerely interested in what we believe or else opposed to much of what we stand for. This is particularly true as the Church grows and as our influence spreads throughout the world. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for us to entertain a few questions about what we believe, questions frequently asked of the Latter-day Saints concerning scripture, God, Christ, and salvation. For example:<br><h2><b>1. How can the Latter-day Saints justify having additional books of scripture and adding to the Christian canon?</b></h2><br>I remember very well sitting in a seminar on biblical studies at an eastern university many years ago. One of the things that stands out in my mind is our discussion of the canon of scripture. For at least two hours the instructor had emphasized that the word<i>canon--</i>referring, of course, to the biblical books that are generally included in the Judeo-Christian collection--was the "rule of faith," the standard against which we measure what is acceptable in belief and practice. He also stated that the canon, if the word meant anything at all, was<i>closed, fixed, set,</i>and<i>established.</i>He must have stressed those words at least 10 times as he wrote them on the blackboard over and over.<br><br>I noticed in the second session on this topic that the instructor seemed a bit uneasy. I remember thinking that something must be wrong. Without warning, he stopped what he was doing, banged his fist on the table, turned to me, and said: "Mr. Millet, will you please explain to this group the Latter-day Saint concept of canon, given your people's acceptance of the Book of Mormon and other books of scripture beyond the Bible?"<br><br>I was startled. Stunned. Certainly surprised. I paused for several seconds, looked up at the blackboard, saw the now very familiar words under the word<i>canon,</i>and said, somewhat shyly, "Well, I suppose you could say that the Latter-day Saints believe the canon of scripture is<i>open, flexible,</i>and<i>expanding.</i>" We then had a<i>really</i>fascinating discussion!<br><br>Joseph Smith loved the Bible. It was through pondering upon certain verses in the Epistle of James that he felt directed to call upon God in prayer. Most of his sermons, writings, and letters are laced with quotations or paraphrased summaries of biblical passages and precepts from both the Old and New Testaments. The Prophet once remarked that one can "see God's own handwriting in the sacred volume: and he who reads it oftenest will like it best" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 56). From his earliest days, however, he did not believe the Bible was complete or that religious difficulties could necessarily be handled by turning to the Old or New Testaments for help (see JS--H 1:12). Nor did he believe in either the inerrancy or the infallibility of the Bible. The Prophet stated:<br><br><i>From what we can draw from the Scriptures relative to the teaching of heaven, we are induced to think that much instruction has been given to man since the beginning which we do not possess now. . . . We have what we have, and the Bible contains what it does contain: but to say that God never said anything more to man than is there recorded, would be saying at once that we have at last received a revelation: for it must require one to advance thus far.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 61; see also<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</i>ed. Dean C. Jessee (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984), pp. 297–301]<br><br>Occasionally we hear certain Latter-day Saint teachings described as<i>unbiblical</i>or of a particular doctrine being<i>contradictory</i>to the Bible. Let us be clear on this matter. The Bible is one of the books within our standard works, and thus our doctrines and practices are in harmony with the Bible. There are times, of course, when latter-day revelation provides clarification or enhancement of the intended meaning in the Bible. But addition to the canon is not the same as rejection of the canon. Supplementation is not the same as contradiction. All of the prophets, including the Savior himself, were sent to bring new light and knowledge to the world; in many cases, new scripture came as a result of their ministries. That new scripture did not invalidate what went before, nor did it close the door to subsequent revelation. We feel deep gratitude for the holy scriptures, but we do not worship scripture. Nor do we feel it appropriate to "set up stakes and set bounds to the works and ways of the Almighty," to tell God, essentially, "Thus far and no more" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 320; see also p. 321). As the Lord declared through Nephi, "Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written" (2 Nephi 29:10).<br><br>In short, we believe God has spoken through modern prophets, restored his everlasting gospel, delivered new truths, and commissioned us to make them known to the world. We feel it would be unchristian<i>not</i>to share what has been communicated to us.<br><h2><b>2. What do the Latter-day Saints really believe about God? Is it true that they believe man can become as God?</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith's First Vision represents the beginning of the revelation of God to man in this dispensation. We will no doubt spend a lifetime seeking to understand the doctrinal profundity of that theophany. This appearance of the Father and Son in upstate New York had the effect of challenging those creeds of Christendom out of which the doctrine of the Trinity came--a doctrine that evolved from efforts to reconcile Christian theology with Greek philosophy. (See Adolph von Harnack,<i>What Is Christianity?</i>[New York: Harper, 1957]; Edwin Hatch,<i>The Influence of Greek Ideas on Christianity</i>[Gloucester, Massachusetts: Peter Smith, 1970]; Henry Chadwick,<i>The Early Church,</i>rev. ed. [New York: Penguin Books, 1993], pp. 77, 89–90; Jaroslav Pelikan,<i>Christianity and Classical Culture</i>[New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993], pp. 28–29, 74, 84–85, 231–47; Dallin H. Oaks,<i>CR,</i>April 1995, pp. 112–13.) President Gordon B. Hinckley has observed:<br><br><i>To me it is a significant and marvelous thing that in establishing and opening this dispensation our Father did so with a revelation of himself and of his Son Jesus Christ, as if to say to all the world that he was weary of the attempts of men, earnest though these attempts might have been, to define and describe him. . . . The experience of Joseph Smith in a few moments in the grove on a spring day in 1820, brought more light and knowledge and understanding of the personality and reality and substance of God and his Beloved Son than men had arrived at during centuries of speculation.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>p. 236]<br><br>By revelation Joseph Smith came to know that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost constitute the Godhead. From the beginning the Prophet Joseph taught that the members of the Godhead are one in purpose, one in mind, one in glory, one in attributes and powers, but separate persons (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 370).<br><br>God is the Father of the spirits of all men and women (see Numbers 16:22, 27:16), the source of light and truth, the embodiment of all godly attributes and gifts, and the supreme power and intelligence over all things. From the book of Moses we learn that among the ancients God the Father was called "Man of Holiness," and thus his Only Begotten Son is the Son of Man of Holiness, or the Son of Man (Moses 6:57). The title Man of Holiness opens us to a deeper understanding of deity. We believe that God the Father is an exalted man, a corporeal being, a personage of flesh and bones.<sup>1</sup><br><br>That God has a physical body is one of the most important of all truths restored in this dispensation; it is inextricably tied to such doctrines as the immortality of the soul, the literal resurrection, eternal marriage, and the continuation of the family unit into eternity. In his corporeal or physical nature, God can be in only one place at a time. His divine nature is such, however, that his glory, his power, and his influence, meaning his Holy Spirit, fill the immensity of space and are the means by which he is omnipresent and through which law and light and life are extended to us (see D&amp;amp;C 88:6–13). The Father's physical body does not limit his capacity or detract one wit from his infinite holiness, any more than Christ's resurrected body did so (see Luke 24, John 20–21).<br><br>Interestingly enough, research by Professor David Paulsen of our Philosophy Department indicates that the idea of God's corporeality was taught in the early Christian church into the fourth and fifth centuries before being lost to the knowledge of the people. (See David L. Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses,"<i>Harvard Theological Review</i>83, no. 2 [April 1990]: 105–16; "The Doctrine of Divine Embodiment: Restoration, Judeo-Christian, and Philosophical Perspectives,"<i>Brigham Young University Studies</i>35, no. 4 [1996]: 7–94.)<br><br>On the one hand, we worship a divine Being with whom we can identify. That is to say, his infinity does not preclude either his immediacy or his intimacy. "In the day that God created man," the scriptures attest, "in the likeness of God made he him; in the image of his own body, male and female, created he them" (Moses 6:8–9). God is not simply a spirit influence, a force in the universe, or the First Great Cause. When we pray, "Our Father which art in heaven" (Matthew 6:9), we mean what we say. We believe God is comprehendible, knowable, approachable, and, like his Beloved Son, touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15).<br><br>On the other hand, our God is God. There is no knowledge of which the Father is ignorant and no power he does not possess (see 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:20, Mosiah 4:9, Alma 26:35, Helaman 9:41, Ether 3:4). Scriptural passages that speak of him being the same yesterday, today, and forever (e.g., Psalms 102:27; Hebrews 1:12, 13:8; 1 Nephi 10:18–19; 2 Nephi 27:23; Alma 7:20; Mormon 9:8–11, 19; Moroni 8:18, 10:7; D&amp;amp;C 3:2, 20:12, 17, 35:1) clearly have reference to his divine attributes--his love, justice, constancy, and willingness to bless his children. In addition, President Joseph Fielding Smith explained:<br><br>From eternity to eternity means from the spirit existence through the probation which we are in, and then back again to the eternal existence which will follow.<i>Surely this is everlasting, for when we receive the resurrection, we will never die. We all existed in the first eternity. I think I can say of myself and others, we are</i>from<i>eternity; and</i>we will be to eternity everlasting, if we receive the exaltation. [<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>3 vols., comp. Bruce R. McConkie (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 1:12; emphasis in original. See also Bruce R. McConkie,<i>The Promised Messiah</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 166.]<br><br>We come to the earth to take a physical body, to be schooled and gain experiences in this second estate that we could not have in the first estate, the premortal life. We then strive to keep the commandments and grow in faith and spiritual graces until we are prepared to go where God and Christ are. Eternal life consists in being<i>with</i>God; in addition, it entails being<i>like</i>God. A study of Christian history reveals that the doctrine of the deification of man was taught at least into the fifth century by such notables as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Justin Martyr, Athanasius, and Augustine (see Stephen E. Robinson,<i>Are Mormons Christian?</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991], pp. 60–61). Because we know that many plain and precious truths were taken from the Bible before it was compiled (see 1 Nephi 13:20–39 and preface to D&amp;amp;C 76), we might not agree with some of what was taught about deification by such Christian thinkers, but it is clear that the idea was not foreign to the people of the early Church.<br><br>For that matter, no less a modern Christian theologian than C. S. Lewis recognized the logical and theological extension of being transformed by Christ. "The Son of God became a man," Lewis pointed out, "to enable men to become sons of God" (<i>Mere Christianity</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1952], p. 154; see also<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1980], p. 18). Further, Lewis has explained:<br><br><i>The command</i>Be ye perfect<i>is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command. He said (in the Bible) that we were "gods" and He is going to make good His words. If we let Him--for we can prevent Him, if we choose--He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said.</i>[Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity,</i>pp. 174–75; emphasis in original]<br><br>All men and women, like Christ, are made in the image and likeness of God (see Genesis 1:27, Moses 2:27), and so it is neither robbery nor heresy for the children of God to aspire to be like God (see Matthew 5:48, Philippians 2:6). Like any parent, our Heavenly Father wants his children to become and be all that he is. Godhood comes through overcoming the world through the Atonement (see 1 John 5:4–5; Revelation 2:7, 11; D&amp;amp;C 76:51–60), becoming heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, who is the natural Heir (see Romans 8:17, Galatians 4:7), and thus inheriting<i>all</i>things, just as Jesus inherits all things (see 1 Corinthians 3:21–23; Revelation 21:7; D&amp;amp;C 76:55, 95, 84:38, 88:107). The faithful are received into the "church of the Firstborn" (Hebrews 12:23; D&amp;amp;C 76:54, 67, 94, 93:22), meaning they inherit as though they were the firstborn. In that glorified state we will be conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus (see Romans 8:29, 1 Corinthians 15:49, 2 Corinthians 3:18, 1 John 3:2, Alma 5:14), receive his glory, and be one with him and with the Father (see John 17:21–23, Philippians 3:21).<br><br>Although we know from modern revelation that godhood comes through the receipt of eternal life (see D&amp;amp;C 132:19–20), we do not believe we will ever, worlds without end, unseat or oust God the Eternal Father or his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ; those holy beings are and forever will be the gods we worship. Even though we believe in the ultimate deification of man, I am unaware of any authoritative statement in LDS literature that suggests that we will ever worship any being other than the ones within the Godhead. We believe in "one God" in the sense that we love and serve one Godhead, one divine presidency, each of whom possesses all of the attributes of Godhood (see Alma 11:44, D&amp;amp;C 20:28).<br><br>In short, God is not of another species, nor is he the great unknowable one; he is indeed our Father in Heaven. He has revealed a plan whereby we might enjoy happiness in this world and dwell with him and be like him in the world to come.<br><h2><b>3. Do the Latter-day Saints believe that salvation comes through their own works rather than by the grace of Christ? Are they "saved" Christians?</b></h2><br>The theological debate over whether we are saved by grace or by works is a fruitless argument that is much "like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary" (C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity,</i>p. 129). Latter-day Saints have often been critical of those who stress salvation by grace alone, and we have often been criticized for a type of works-righteousness. The gospel is in fact a gospel covenant--a two-way promise. The Lord agrees to do for us what we could never do for ourselves--to forgive our sins, to lift our burdens, to renew our souls and re-create our nature, to raise us from the dead and qualify us for glory hereafter. At the same time, we promise to do what we<i>can</i>do--receive the ordinances of salvation, love and serve one another (see Mosiah 18:8–10), and do all in our power to put off the natural man and deny ourselves of ungodliness (see Mosiah 3:19, Moroni 10:32).<br><br>We believe that more is required of men and women than a verbal expression of faith in the Lord, more than a confession with the lips that we have received Christ into our hearts. The scriptures of the Restoration add perspective and balance to the majestic teachings of the apostle Paul on the matter of salvation by grace. We know, without question, that the power to save us, to change us, to renew our souls, is in Christ. True faith, however, always manifests itself in<i>faithfulness.</i>Good works evidence our faith and our desire to remain in covenant with Christ, but they are not<i>sufficient.</i>(See Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary,</i>3 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–73], 2:499–500; and Dallin H. Oaks,<i>CR,</i>October 1988, p. 78). The real question is not whether I am saved by grace or by works but rather, In whom do I trust? On whom do I rely? (See 1 Nephi 10:6; 2 Nephi 2:8, 31:19; Moroni 6:4.)<br><br>Too often we are prone to view grace as that increment of goodness, that final gift of God that will make up the difference and thereby boost us into the celestial kingdom, "after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). To be sure, we will need a full measure of divine assistance to become celestial material. But the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, is available to us every hour of every day of our lives. "True grace," as one non-LDS writer has suggested, "is more than just a giant freebie, opening the door to heaven in the sweet by and by, but leaving us to wallow in sin in the bitter here and now. Grace is God presently at work in our lives" (John F. MacArthur, Jr.,<i>Faith Works: The Gospel According to the Apostles</i>[Dallas: Word Publishing, 1993], p. 32). The grace of God is a precious gift, an enabling power to face life with quiet courage, to do things we could never do on our own. The Great Physician does more than forgive sins. He ministers relief to the disconsolate, comfort to the bereaved, confidence to those who wrestle with infirmities and feelings of inadequacy, and strength and peace to those who have been battered and scarred by the ironies of this life (see Isaiah 61:1–2, Alma 7:11–13).<br><br>Few things would be more serious than encouraging lip service to God but discouraging obedience and faithful discipleship. On the other hand, surely nothing could be more offensive to God than a smug self-assurance that comes from trusting in one's own works or relying upon one's own strength. Understanding this sacred principle--the relationship between the grace of an infinite Being and the works of finite man--is not easy, but it is immensely rewarding. The more we learn to trust the Lord and rely upon his merits and mercy, the less anxious we become about life here and hereafter. "Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him," C. S. Lewis wisely remarked, "it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way" (Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity,</i>p. 129).<br><br>Are we then "saved Christians"? Whereas the ultimate blessings of salvation do not come until the next life, there is a sense in which people in this life may enjoy the assurance of salvation and the peace that accompanies that knowledge (see D&amp;amp;C 59:23). True faith in Christ produces hope in Christ--not worldly wishing but expectation, anticipation, assurance. As the apostle Paul wrote, the Holy Spirit provides the "earnest of our inheritance," the promise or evidence that we are on course, in covenant, and thus in line for full salvation in the world to come (Ephesians 1:13–14; see 2 Corinthians 1:21–22, 5:5). That is, the Spirit of God operating in our lives is like the Lord's "earnest money" on us--his sweet certification that he seriously intends to save us with an everlasting salvation. Thus, if we are striving to cultivate the gift of the Holy Ghost, we are living in what might be called a "saved" condition.<br><br>One of the most respected Evangelical theologians, John Stott, has written:<br><br><i>Salvation is a big and comprehensive word. It embraces the totality of God's saving work, from beginning to end. In fact salvation has three tenses, past, present and future. . . . "I have been saved (in the past) from the penalty of sin by a crucified Saviour. I am being saved (in the present) from the power of sin by a living Saviour. And I shall be saved (in the future) from the very presence of sin by a coming Saviour" . . .</i><br><br><i>If therefore you were to ask me, "Are you saved?" there is only one correct biblical answer which I could give you: "yes and no." Yes, in the sense that by the sheer grace and mercy of God through the death of Jesus Christ my Saviour he has forgiven my sins, justified me and reconciled me to himself. But no, in the sense that I still have a fallen nature and live in a fallen world and have a corruptible body, and I am longing for my salvation to be brought to its triumphant completion.</i>[<i>Authentic Christianity from the Writings of John Stott,</i>ed. Timothy Dudley-Smith (Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1995), p. 168]<br><br>President David O. McKay taught that<br><br><i>the gospel of Jesus Christ, as revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, is in very deed, in every way, the power of God unto salvation. It is salvation</i>here--<i>here and now. It gives to every man the perfect life, here and now, as well as hereafter.</i>[<i>GI,</i>p. 6; emphasis in original. See also Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>6:276 and 8:124–25.]<br><br>Too many of us wrestle with feelings of inadequacy, struggle with hopelessness, and in general are much too anxious about our standing before God. It is important to keep the ultimate goal of exaltation ever before us, but it seems so much more profitable to focus on fundamentals and on the here and now--staying in covenant, being dependable and true to our promises, cultivating the gift of the Holy Ghost. President Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>Our work is a work of the present. The salvation we are seeking is for the present, and, sought correctly, it can be obtained, and be continually enjoyed. If it continues to-day, it is upon the same principle that it will continue to-morrow, the next day, the next week, or the next year, and, we might say, the next eternity.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:131]<br><br>In short, salvation is in Christ, and our covenant with Christ, our trust in his power to redeem us, should be demonstrated in how we live. The influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives is a sign to us that we are on course, "in Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:17), and thus in line for salvation.<br><h2><b>4. Are the Latter-day Saints Christian? Or do they, as some have suggested, worship a different Jesus?</b></h2><br>We believe in Jesus of Nazareth, in the One sent of the Father to "bind up the brokenhearted" and "proclaim liberty to the captives" (see Isaiah 61:1, D&amp;amp;C 138:11–18). For us, the Jesus of history is indeed the Christ of faith. He was and is the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh (see John 3:16, 2 Nephi 25:12, D&amp;amp;C 20:21). Although some may exclude us from the category of Christian for this or that doctrinal matter, our behavior must be consistent with our profession; those who claim new life in the Spirit are expected to walk in the Spirit (see Galatians 5:25).<br><br>"Are we Christians?" President Gordon B. Hinckley asked.<br><br><i>Of course we are! No one can honestly deny that. We may be somewhat different from the traditional pattern of Christianity. But no one believes more literally in the redemption wrought by the Lord Jesus Christ. No one believes more fundamentally that He was the Son of God, that He died for the sins of mankind, that He rose from the grave, and that He is the living resurrected Son of the living Father.</i><br><br><i>All of our doctrine, all of our religious practice stems from that one basic doctrinal position: "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." This is the first article of our faith, and all else flows therefrom.</i>[Meeting with Religion Newswriters Association, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 14 September 1997; excerpted in Speaking Today,<i>Ensign,</i>February 1998, p. 73]<br><br>In the long run, all we can do is live what we preach and bear testimony of what we feel in our hearts and know in our minds. Although we do not want to be misunderstood and we certainly would like for others to recognize the centrality of Christ in our lives, we do not require the imprimatur of the religious world to substantiate our claim. We are who we are and we know who we are, and if all the world should think otherwise, so be it. Our primary thrust in the religious world is not to court favor. Our desire to build bridges of understanding does not excuse us from the obligation to maintain our distinctive position in the religious world. Our strength lies in our distinctiveness, for we have something to offer the world, something of great worth. No one wants to be spurned, misunderstood, or misrepresented. But sometimes such is the cost of discipleship (see Matthew 5:10–12).<br><br>As to whether we worship a different Jesus, we say again: We accept and endorse the testimony of the New Testament writers: Jesus is the Promised Messiah, the resurrection and the life (see John 11:25), literally the light of the world (see John 8:12). Everything that testifies of his divine birth, his goodness, his transforming power, and his godhood, we embrace enthusiastically. He has broken the bands of death and lives today. All this we know. But we know much more about the Christ because of what has been made known through latter-day prophets. President Brigham Young thus declared:<br><br><i>We, the Latter-day Saints, take the liberty of believing more than our Christian brethren: we not only believe . . . the Bible, but . . . the whole of the plan of salvation that Jesus has given to us. Do we differ from others who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? No, only in believing more.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:56]<br><br>Our conduct and our way of life cannot be separated from our doctrine, for what we believe empowers and directs what we do. A number of years ago an article appeared in<i>Christianity Today</i>entitled "Why Your Neighbor Joined the Mormon Church." Five reasons were given:<br><br>1. The Latter-day Saints show genuine love and concern by taking care of their people.<br><br>2. They strive to build the family unit.<br><br>3. They provide for their young people.<br><br>4. Theirs is a layman's church.<br><br>5. They believe that divine revelation is the basis for their practices.<br><br>After a brief discussion of each of the above, the author of the article concluded:<br><br><i>In a day when many are hesitant to claim that God has said anything definitive, the Mormons stand out in contrast, and many people are ready to listen to what the Mormons think the voice of God says. It is tragic that their message is false, but it is nonetheless a lesson to us that people are many times ready to hear a voice of authority.</i>[Donald P. Shoemaker, "Why Your Neighbor Joined the Mormon Church,"<i>Christianity Today</i>19, no. 1 (11 October 1974): 11–13]<br><br>The Savior taught of the importance of judging things--prophets, for example--by their fruits, by the product of their ministry and teachings (see Matthew 7:15–20, 1 John 3:7). He also explained that "every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up" (Matthew 15:13). Evil trees cannot bring forth good fruit. Works of men eventually come to naught, but that which is of God cannot be overthrown (see Acts 5:38–39).<br><br>In short, we proclaim that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ. We have taken his name upon us, eagerly acknowledge the redeeming power of his blood, and seek to emulate his perfect life.<br><br>Let me close by sharing with you three simple suggestions--learned through both sad and sweet experience--on how we might effectively deal with difficult questions posed by those not of our faith. First,<i>stay in control.</i>There is nothing more frustrating than knowing the truth, loving the truth, sincerely desiring to share the truth, and yet being unable to communicate our deepest feelings to another who sees things differently. Argument or disputation over sacred things cause us to forfeit the Spirit of God and thus the confirming power of our message (see 3 Nephi 11:28–30). We teach and we testify. Contention is unbecoming of one called to publish peace and thus bless our brothers and sisters. In the words of Elder Marvin J. Ashton, "We have no time for contention. We only have time to be about our Father's business" (<i>CR,</i>April 1978, p. 9).<br><br>Second,<i>stay in order.</i>The Savior taught that gospel prerequisites should be observed when teaching sacred things (see Matthew 7:6–7; see also Boyd K. Packer,<i>Teach Ye Diligently</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975], chapter 11;<i>The Holy Temple</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980], chapter 2). A person, for example, who knows very little about our doctrine will probably not understand or appreciate our teachings concerning temples, sealing powers, eternal life, or the deification of man. Joseph Smith the Prophet explained, "If we start right, it is easy to go right all the time; but if we start wrong, we may go wrong, and it [will] be a hard matter to get right" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 343). It is always wise to lay a proper foundation for what is to be said; the truth can then flow more freely. The apostle Peter is said to have explained to Clement:<br><br><i>The teaching of all doctrine has a certain order, and there are some things which must be delivered first, others in the second place, and others in the third, and so all in their order; and if these things be delivered in their order, they become plain; but if they be brought forward out of order, they will seem to be spoken against reason.</i>[<i>Clementine Recognitions</i>III, p. 34; cited in Hugh Nibley,<i>Since Cumorah,</i>2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company and FARMS, 1988), p. 97]<br><br>Third,<i>stay in context.</i>As we have already noted, we love the Bible and cherish its messages. But the Bible is not the source of our doctrine or authority, nor is much to be gained through efforts to "prove" the truthfulness of the restored gospel from the Bible. Ours is an independent revelation. We know what we know about the premortal existence, priesthood, celestial marriage, baptism for the dead, the postmortal spirit world, degrees of glory, etc., because of what God has made known through latter-day prophets, not because we are able to identify a few biblical allusions to these matters. Some of our greatest difficulties in handling questions about our faith come when we try to establish specific doctrines of the Restoration from the Bible alone. There is consummate peace and spiritual power to be derived from being loyal to those things the Almighty has communicated to us in our dispensation (see D&amp;amp;C 5:10, 31:3–4, 43:15–16, 49:1–4, 84:54–61). President Ezra Taft Benson stated:<br><br><i>Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson,<i>A Witness and a Warning</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1988), p. 5]<br><br>I testify to the truthfulness of these remarkable doctrines about which I have been speaking. I know, by the witness of the Holy Ghost to my soul, that God is our Father, Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the living God, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is indeed the kingdom of God on earth. These things I know, because I have studied and searched and sought to understand. These things I know, because I have read and pondered and prayed and pleaded for light and knowledge. What has come to me is as settling and soothing to my heart as it is stimulating and enlarging to my mind. This work is true, and because it is true it will triumph. The First Presidency of the Church in 1907 declared:<br><br><i>Our motives are not selfish; our purposes not petty and earth-bound; we contemplate the human race, past, present and yet to come, as immortal beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor; and to this work, broad as eternity and deep as the love of God, we devote ourselves, now, and forever.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1907, appendix, p. 16; cited in Howard W. Hunter,<i>That We Might Have Joy</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994), p. 59]<br><br>I pray that we will come to know what we believe, by study and by faith, and then with boldness but quiet dignity share those saving truths with others, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert L. Millet was the dean of Religious Education at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 3 February 1998.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. If the 14-year-old Joseph Smith did indeed learn of the Father's corporeality in the First Vision, he did not state it specifically in his various accounts of that vision. The Prophet explained in Ramus, Illinois, that "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22). That statement was recorded in April of 1843. However, the Saints were teaching of God's corporeal nature at least as early as 1836. (See Milton V.

<h1>rhighway of Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in the small town of Clearfield, Utah, and the last thing on my mind during those formative years was the thought that someday I would speak to the student body of Brigham Young University. Until I was in junior high, my hometown was little more than a bend in the road.<br><br>In those days my biggest challenge was gathering the eggs from the chicken coop without being attacked by the hen. I would carefully choose a stick large enough to lift each hen, and as a hen pecked at the stick, I would quickly gather her warm egg into my basket.<br><br>On the street where I lived there was the church, a canning factory, a small store, and the school. My life was uncomplicated and centered around home, church, school, and the candy aisle in the local store. That aisle was my incentive to work.<br><br>I was blessed because I had a kind and loving father and a mother and five sisters. We learned to work hard. Our father had his daughters help plant potatoes, corn, and various seeds in the ground each spring. We would place bedding plants around the yard and assist our father in mowing the lawn and trimming the shrubs. We were also taught the art of homemaking. Life was simple and rewarding. You worked hard and felt the joy and satisfaction of your accomplishments.<br><br>As I look back, my road map on the highway of life was developed in that setting and through a series of small decisions that became sequential steps of progression in my life--small decisions relating to family and individual prayer, work, practice or studies before play, honesty, integrity, church attendance, and service. Following my parents' example, I soon found the richness of these blessings in my own life.<br><br>Whatever your backgrounds, each of you have made right decisions or you would not be here today. I don't think you know how wonderful you are. Do you know how important you are to our Father in Heaven?<br><br>Someday, some of you will stand where I am standing and be amazed, as I am, at the magnitude and grandeur of the work of the Lord. Make right choices, even when they appear to be small, insignificant choices. And ask for the Lord's blessings to guide your footsteps on your personal highway of life.<br><br>I wish I could express to each of you personally the love and concern I feel for each of you on a daily basis. Because of my calling I see firsthand that President Hinckley has this same love and concern for each of you also.<br><br>As I focused my attention on preparing this talk, I contemplated your incredible challenges and choices and the struggles many of you face. My heart is filled with great love and empathy for each of you as you struggle, stretch, and grow to meet these challenges and make proper choices in life. Because our Father in Heaven has compassion upon us and desires the best for each of us, he has given us gifts in the way of travel plans to help us travel the superhighway of life.<br><br>As you think about it, life is like a superhighway. It is a time away from our heavenly home when we are confronted with a world of information and choices. Like any other highway, the superhighway of life will take you in one of two directions. If you choose to follow the philosophy of the world, it will lead you along a downward slope that ultimately leaves you lost, confused, and unhappy. Although the highway in this wrong direction is well traveled, and at first inviting, all who travel there will begin to notice deterioration and disrepair.<br><br>Before long the road becomes rough and difficult to traverse. The vehicle in which you travel sustains undue wear and tear. Your visibility becomes impaired as the highway takes you to a faltering side street, then to a dirt road, and finally to a rocky trail. Somewhere along the way some feel so despondent that they abandon their vehicle altogether and wander alone in a wilderness of despair.<br><br>Thankfully the other direction that leads in the way of truth and right is an altogether different experience. The superhighway in this direction turns into a thoroughfare that challenges and strengthens the traveler. Visibility increases as you travel in the right direction, enabling you to see and understand that which you cannot comprehend today. And your vehicle, although requiring continued care and maintenance, does not give in to the wear and tear of the world but undergoes continual renewal.<br><br>I would like you to consider three very important elements of your travels along the superhighway of life:<br><br>• First, the vehicle in which you travel through life is your family. Each member of the family is a child of God, and together they make up a family, the basic unit of our Heavenly Father's plan of happiness.<br><br>• Second, your visibility, your spiritual perception, comes through the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It enables you to see the proper course regardless of travel conditions that beset you.<br><br>• And third are the road signs, the truth and the fallacies you face during your travels through life.<br><br>Let us talk for a moment about the vehicle, or the family with which you each travel. There are all kinds of families. When you were born you left your heavenly family to join an earthly family. Your earthly family is not limited to just your siblings and parents but also includes a long line of ancestors as well as the generations yet to come. When rightly considered, both your ancestors and your posterity have a significant stake in your life decisions. In addition, you have your ward or branch families, no matter where you go, and now that you are here at BYU, you also have a home evening family.<br><br>Families in whatever form are critical to your experience here in mortality. Families bolster you in times of need and humble you when you are overtaken with pride. The members of your family often see the worst side of you, yet still love and accept you. They help you maintain perspective and help you to see your own weaknesses that you may not otherwise recognize.<br><br>For instance, my grandson Spencer, who was about five years old at the time, received a doctor's kit for Christmas. While examining his two-year-old brother, Austin, one day, Spencer made a rather revealing prognosis. After inserting the thermometer into Austin's mouth and making him lie still for several minutes, Spencer extracted the thermometer and proclaimed, "Austin, you've got a big temper!"<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we need strong families. The family unit is not a nicety but a necessity. It is an essential element of our Father in Heaven's plan of happiness. Your Father in Heaven did not set you off on life's highway alone. He gave you a family.<br><br>The traditional family, the family as you have known it, is under political and social siege. Years ago I traveled to Washington, D.C., as a chaperone for a group of high school students. Two of my sons accompanied me on that trip. During the course of our tour we visited the Capitol and met with a senator from Utah. He didn't have much time to meet with us, as he was scheduled to be at a Senate hearing, so he invited our group to come along with him. His task that day was to question an outspoken activist on a proposed legislative initiative that would have an adverse impact on the family unit.<br><br>The hearing was just beginning when we arrived. The room was full to overflowing. We stood and witnessed a frontline battle that has been raging now for several decades over the family. I am happy to report that those in favor of the family won the debate on that occasion. Sadly, however, there have been many battles where the family unit has sustained serious losses--both in the Capitol and in homes across the land.<br><br>Where do you stand in the flood of decline? Are you busy sandbagging or are you building your homes and families upon the bedrock of the gospel? Government cannot save our families. Lawmakers would be pleased if they could even define what a family is anymore. The salvation of our families depends upon our obedience to the words of the prophets.<br><br>Recently our modern-day prophets have presented us with "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." It outlines the Lord's sacred doctrines pertaining to the family. It is decisive and clear. You must know the truths it contains and share them with your families if you are to travel the superhighway of life successfully.<br><br>Someday it will not matter where else you have traveled if you have not followed after "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6) within the walls of your own homes and have not come unto Christ.<br><br>Stop! Listen! Do you hear sadness and heartbreak in families all over the world? How can the people of the world turn a deaf ear? Is it because they are beyond feeling, or do they ignore it because they do not have the answers? The gospel of Jesus Christ has the answers. I have witnessed countless examples of eternal families working together for the whole of the family, as well as for the one, where each person, each life, is valued and loved, and individual talents are praised, admired, and developed.<br><br>I cannot envision heaven without my wonderful husband and each of our beloved children and grandchildren and each of you. That's what this life is all about. That's what eternal life is all about. Not everyone will understand nor be willing to follow the Lord's counsel for families.<br><br>During my youth Clearfield had only one stake center. On the day of stake conference the city police would stand in the road to usher cars into the parking lot. The cars came bumper to bumper and automatically followed the guiding hand.<br><br>One gentleman, however, after being guided to his designated parking stall, rolled down his window and said, "What is this? Where are we all going?"<br><br>The officer said, "This is the stake house."<br><br>"Oh," he replied, "but we're not hungry yet!"<br><br>First, this gentleman did not understand the spiritual food his family could receive at this stake house. And second, he had not developed a spiritual appetite.<br><br>Each of you need to stop and consider how well you are prepared for the miles ahead. Have you maintained a relationship with your Father in Heaven? Are you strong enough to withstand the inevitable bumps, jolts, and storms that life's superhighway will introduce? Are you too preoccupied or busy with worldly things? Are you devoting time and energy enough to your loved ones? If you are, you will find no greater joy. You'll actually enjoy the ride. For as we move closer together, we move closer to God.<br><br>Young people, you stand on the threshold between leaving your immediate family and creating your own. The family in which you were raised will always be a part of your life, but so much of the schooling that our Father in Heaven sent you here to receive is yet ahead. Although you have all experienced a great deal to this point in your lives, on the horizon are the most deepening and joyous experiences in life. Until now you have only been a passenger in your parent's vehicle. Although at times I am sure you have been backseat drivers, it has been your parent's sacred accountability to steer the vehicle for the benefit of each member of the family. But now it is your turn to take the wheel and navigate the course for your family and posterity.<br><br>As you make decisions relative to your family, please accept some motherly counsel from me. Do not let convenience be the determining factor regarding the person you choose as your eternal companion, the timing and number of children that you bring into the world, and any career decisions that either you or your spouse make, especially if they would adversely impact your primary role as parents. Remember the words President David O. McKay used to quote: "No success in life can compensate for failure in the home" (quoting James Edward McCulloch, ed.,<i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i>[Washington, D.C.: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], p. 42).<br><br>Some of you may travel alone for a time in your own vehicle. Although you may still travel in a caravan with your parents and siblings, you will control your own vehicle and the course that it takes. Remember this promise: The Lord intends for each of you to experience the joys, challenges, and growth that come with having your own family and raising spirit children of our Father in Heaven. This I promise: If you live worthy, all of the joy of creating and raising your own family to the Lord will be yours, whether in this lifetime or in the one to come. The superhighway of life, and the growth and progress it brings, spans not only this lifetime but the eternities to come. Therefore, reach out and serve your family and fellow travelers, for that which you serve you come to love.<br><br>President Brigham Young spoke of the joy that accompanies gospel living and family life. His formula for happiness stands the test of time. He said, "Truly happy is that man, or woman, or that people, who enjoys the privileges of the Gospel of the Son of God, and who know how to appreciate his blessings" (<i>JD</i>1:309). And he also said, "We want to see every countenance full of cheerfulness, and every eye bright with the hope of future happiness" (<i>JD</i>12:314).<br><br>What a difference you will make in the lives of those most dear to you if your countenance truly is "full of cheerfulness" and your eyes shine bright with hope and happiness. The gospel of Jesus Christ puts such joy within reach. It is yours for the finding and yours for the sharing. Regardless of background, you can decide now to be happy and to have a happy family of your own.<br><br>My philosophy is: If you are happy, notify your face.<br><br>To you who have been hurt by members of your own family, you have the opportunity to break the abusive cycle. Decide now to take the road that leads to happiness. You cannot get there unless you're moving forward with a brightness of hope.<br><br>No matter who your family is, joy is your birthright. Nephi taught that "men [and women] are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). Make choices consistent with the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and you will find joy. "Joyriding" is not just an option--it is a part of the plan.<br><br>The second element of your travels is visibility, your ability to see clearly and discern right from wrong. The gift of the Holy Ghost helps you to see through the fog of this world and find your way back to your Father in Heaven. The Holy Ghost helps you recognize distractions for what they are. He also gives you strength to resist temptations, and peace when you are faced with difficult traveling conditions. All in all, the Holy Ghost clears the window of your soul and gives you the visibility needed to avoid life-threatening accidents and destructive detours.<br><br>Elder Parley P. Pratt understood this process well. In his book<i>Key to Theology,</i>he gives a useful and inspiring description of what happens to us when we receive the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. Listen carefully to these astounding blessings:<br><br><i>The gift of the Holy Ghost adapts itself</i>[in many facets of our lives].<i>It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections. . . . It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i>[Parley P. Pratt,<i>Key to the Science of Theology</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), p. 101]<br><br>Can you imagine anyone understanding these blessings and not doing everything they could to receive them? The joy that will come into your individual lives as you understand and embrace the promptings of the Holy Ghost will make the difference in your individual lives.<br><br>After leaving high school I attended college and at first lived in the dormitory. Then I became friends with two young women, and together we decided to move into a top-floor apartment off campus.<br><br>When I lived on campus my roommates and I belonged to a student ward, and we would all attend church together. Attending church had always been a part of my life, and I looked forward to the spiritual uplift each Sunday.<br><br>However, on the first Sunday in our new apartment I was faced with a decision. I had been to a formal dance the night before, and I was very tired. One of my roommates returned home for the weekend, and I awoke on Sunday realizing I was supposed to attend a regular ward that met in a building a block from our apartment.<br><br>I could sleep in and have a day of leisure for which I yearned, or I could attend a strange ward made up primarily of families with very few students. I woke my roommate and invited her to go with me to church. She declined my invitation and chose the day of leisure. She said she was too tired. I could not convince her. I hated the thought of going alone, but I got dressed, walked the block, and attended the ward. I can't remember that it changed my week significantly, but I do remember I knew in my heart that I made the right decision to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The next week it would only have been easier to stay in bed. That's how the adversary works.<br><br>As I stand here today, I see clearly that the seemingly insignificant decisions to obey the promptings of the Holy Ghost have made all the difference in my life. Commit today to follow each prompting of the Holy Ghost, and I guarantee that you will receive joy and, ultimately, exaltation.<br><br>More than a 100 years ago, while studying at the Budich Institute of higher learning in Dresden, Germany, a man abandoned the faith of his youth and gave way to skepticism. He became what we would call an agnostic. He recalled "this dark period" of his life as a time of searching among the "political, social, philosophic, and religious opinions of the world." During the course of his study, his attention was called to a Mormon pamphlet. He recounted:<br><br><i>I had some conceited notions in those days about literacy, and I had no faith in the Bible and religious doctrines; therefore, the inaccuracies and the poverty of language I found in those publications were, at first, sources of some ironical amusement.</i><br><br>And yet the truth began to pierce his soul.<br><br>Even though he found the pamphlet poorly written, and at times even illogical, the Holy Ghost spoke to his soul. He explained:<br><br><i>The humble but straightforward statements of testimony, the mistakes and the meagreness of the language used in the exposition of the wonderful truths that I could see back of it all, brought such uneasiness to me that I could not rest, my soul was on fire, as it were, and I therefore expressed a desire to have an elder sent to me.</i>[Karl G. Maeser, in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928), pp. 19–21]<br><br>The rest is history.<br><br>This man whose "soul was on fire" was named Karl G. Maeser. You've seen his name around campus. He was one of the founding fathers of this university. And just like you and me, he had to come to a knowledge of the truth. He had to receive the witness of the Holy Ghost. His conversion began in the recesses of his heart, where his faith lay dormant until truth entered in. He hearkened to a still small voice, and his life took a different course ever after.<br><br>The Holy Ghost set him back on track--just as it will for each of you. As you learn to recognize and follow promptings of the Spirit, the way will become clear before you. Darkness will be dispelled, fog will be lifted, and your visibility will increase.<br><br>This all leads us to the third element of our travels that I'd like you to consider: road signs, or the truths and the fallacies that confront you.<br><br>We live in a marvelous time. The information age is in full swing. We have access to incredible tools for research, discovery, and communication. I, too, have been introduced to the "information highway" via the Internet and e-mail. Who says an old dog can't learn new tricks? I marvel at the rapid advancement of technology. Even while I use a handheld electronic planner that records my handwriting, I remember being amazed as a young girl by the fact that a single song could be recorded on a small record and played back any time I wanted to hear it. My, what progress we have made.<br><br>We now have access to massive sources of information on the Internet and elsewhere. A comprehensive collection of the writings of God's prophets throughout the history of the world can fit on one--or, at the most, two--small compact discs that can be held in my hand. Such advancements were mere science fiction 20 years ago. And yet, has all of this information added one wit to the body of eternal truths available to you through the gospel of Jesus Christ? No! What it has added, however, is further evidence of the divinity of the work in which you are engaged and of the universal struggle between truth and fallacy.<br><br>Road signs are now found in places where you never used to see them. You're bombarded with advertisements, enticements, directions, and choices. And yet all of the different road signs present you with only two classes of information: truth and fallacy. Truth endures and liberates, whereas fallacy falters and imprisons. Truth carries with it power, whereas falsehood yields only unfulfilled expectations.<br><br>The difficulty lies in recognizing the difference, in seeing a road sign for what it really is. Sometimes our progress is halted not because we don't want to follow the path of truth, but because we're not sure which path is truth.<br><br>Or, as Elijah suggests in the Old Testament, sometimes we don't want to accept the burden of truth. It's so much easier to get off at the nearest exit and indulge our appetites. During the reign of wicked King Ahab, the people of Israel began to set aside sacred truths and worship Baal. Such idol worship was less restrictive and allowed for indulgence in worldly pleasures. But the Lord raised up Elijah as his prophet to remind his people of saving truths.<br><br>After three full years of drought and suffering, the wicked Israelites remained in their sins and refused to embrace the truth. Elijah then issued his famous challenge to the priests of Baal to meet him on Mount Carmel. On that occasion the prophet stepped forward and exclaimed to the Israelites: "How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal [be God], then follow him" (1 Kings 18:21).<br><br>All 450 of the priests of Baal proceeded to call upon Baal from early morning until noon, but their petitions were in vain. Baal did not manifest himself nor claim his domain as the priests had promised.<br><br>Then Elijah took his turn. He rebuilt the altar of Jehovah, dug a trench around it, and ordered that 12 barrels of water be poured atop the sacrifice, drenching the altar and filling the trench. Elijah then addressed God and asked that he make himself known to the Israelites. The swift reply from heaven was spectacular: "The fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench" (1 Kings 18:38). The lightning from heaven had fallen from a clear sky.<br><br>Elijah then knelt and prayed for rain to end the long drought. The Lord again heard his prayer, and "the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain" (1 Kings 18:45).<br><br>The God of truth made himself known to the Israelites, clearly and undeniably. And yet, like them, how often "halt ye between two opinions"? How easily we forget what truth is, how to recognize it, and how to find it. Especially when so many road signs point to easier, more alluring, or more widely accepted ways, you, too, often lose sight of your destination.<br><br>When the wicked King Ahab returned from Mount Carmel and told his evil wife Jezebel about all that took place, she was infuriated. Jezebel immediately sent a message to Elijah, informing him that she intended to have him killed on the morrow.<br><br>Elijah fled into the wilderness to save his own life. And after a day's journey he rested under a juniper tree. While there, he pled with the Lord to take his life before his enemies overtook him (see 1 Kings 19:4). That night, as Elijah slept, an angel of the Lord came to him and told him to go to what was known as the "mount of God." And Elijah did as he was commanded. He went to the mountain called Horeb and stood before the Lord (see 1 Kings 19:8). We next read of the prophet's encounter with the Lord:<br><br><i>And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:</i><br><br><i>And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</i>[1 Kings 19:11–12]<br><br>Although the Lord is the master of all the elements, he speaks truth to our minds most often, most powerfully, through the Holy Ghost, in a still small voice. And that voice, when it pierces our souls, can be just as powerful as the lightning that consumed the altar on Mount Carmel.<br><br>Remember the words of Elder Parley P. Pratt: "[The Holy Ghost is] marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being."<br><br>Are you prepared to receive these blessings? They are there before you. They are there for all who seek and earnestly strive. Visualize your eternal goals, work to achieve them, and you will be blessed with the strength to overcome any impediments in your way.<br><br>Like Elijah of old, you can make a difference. One person can make a difference. Before resuming your travels on the superhighway of life, stop to evaluate what you can do. Give your loved ones the attention they deserve, adhere to sacred truths, and let the Holy Ghost, your personal compass, lead you along. Not only will you enjoy the ride, but you'll also find your way back to your Father in Heaven. The Savior has gone before and shown the way. He is the way, the only "way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).<br><br>The Savior said: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Mary Ellen Smoot was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at BYU on 10 February 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>t and Judging - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a student of the scriptures and as a former judge, I have had a special interest in the many scriptures that refer to judging. The best known of these is "Judge not, that ye be not judged" (3 Nephi 14:1, Matthew 7:1).<br><br>I have been puzzled that some scriptures command us not to judge and others instruct us that we should judge and even tell us how to do it. I am convinced that these seemingly contradictory directions are consistent when we view them with the perspective of eternity. The key is to understand that there are two kinds of judging: final judgments, which we are forbidden to make; and intermediate judgments, which we are directed to make, but upon righteous principles. Today I will speak about gospel judging.<br><h2><b>Final Judgments</b></h2><br>I will speak first of the final judgment. This is that future occasion in which all of us will stand before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged according to our works (see 1 Nephi 15:33, 3 Nephi 27:15, Mormon 3:20, D&amp;amp;C 19:3). Some Christians look on this as the time when individuals are assigned to heaven or hell. With the increased understanding we have received from the Restoration, Latter-day Saints understand the final judgment as the time when all mankind will receive their personal dominions in the mansions prepared for them in the various kingdoms of glory (see D&amp;amp;C 76:111, John 14:2, 1 Corinthians 15:40–44). I believe that the scriptural command to "judge not" refers most clearly to this final judgment, as in the Book of Mormon declaration that "man shall not . . . judge; for judgment is mine, saith the Lord" (Mormon 8:20).<br><br>Since mortals cannot suppose that they will be acting as final judges at that future, sacred time, why did the Savior command that we not judge final judgments? I believe this commandment was given because we presume to make final judgments whenever we proclaim that any particular person is going to hell (or to heaven) for a particular act or as of a particular time. When we do this--and there is great temptation to do so--we hurt ourselves and the person we pretend to judge.<br><br>The effect of one mortal's attempting to pass final judgment on another mortal is analogous to the effect on athletes and observers if we could proclaim the outcome of an athletic contest with certainty while it was still underway. Similar reasoning forbids our presuming to make final judgments on the outcome of any person's lifelong mortal contest.<br><br>President Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>I am very t`hankful that it is not our province . . . to judge the world; if it were, we would ruin everything. We have not sufficient wisdom, our minds are not filled with the knowledge and power of God. . . . And we must also acquire the discretion that God exercises in being able to look into futurity, and to ascertain and know the results of our acts away in the future, even in eternity, before we will be capable of judging.</i>[<i>JD</i>19:7–8]<br><br>In this teaching Brigham Young was, typically, merely elaborating on a teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who said:<br><br><i>While one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard. . . . He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men . . . , "not according to what they have not, but according to what they have," those who have lived without law, will be judged without law, and those who have a law, will be judged by that law.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 218]<br><br>Thus, we must refrain from making final judgments on people, because we lack the knowledge and the wisdom to do so. We would even apply the wrong standards. The world's way is to judge competitively between winners and losers. The Lord's way of final judgment will be to apply his perfect knowledge of the law a person has received and to judge on the basis of that person's circumstances, motives, and actions throughout his or her entire life (see Luke 12:47–48, John 15:22, 2 Nephi 9:25). As was wisely taught in a BYU devotional, "The Lord does not grade on a curve." He will judge us in terms of "qualities," not "quotas" (in Janet G. Lee, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/janet-g-lee_lord-doesnt-grade-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lord Doesn't Grade on a Curve</a>,"<i>BYU 1994–95 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1995], pp. 91, 93).<br><br>Even the Savior, during his mortal ministry, refrained from making final judgments. We see this in the account of the woman taken in adultery. After the crowd who intended to stone her had departed, Jesus asked her about her accusers: "Hath no man condemned thee?" (John 8:10). When she answered no, Jesus declared, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (v. 11). In this context the word<i>condemn</i>apparently refers to the final judgment (see John 3:17).<br><br>The Lord obviously did not justify the woman's sin. He simply told her that he did not condemn her--that is, he would not pass final judgment on her at that time. This interpretation is confirmed by what he then said to the Pharisees: "Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man" (John 8:15). The woman taken in adultery was granted time to repent, time that would have been denied by those who wanted to stone her. The Savior gave this same teaching on another occasion, when he said to the Pharisees, "And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world" (John 12:47).<br><br>From all of this we see that final judgment is the Lord's and that mortals must refrain from judging any human being in the final sense of concluding or proclaiming that they are irretrievably bound for hell or have lost all hope of exaltation.<br><h2><b>Intermediate Judgments</b></h2><br>In contrast to forbidding mortals to make final judgments, the scriptures require mortals to make what I will call "intermediate judgments." These judgments are essential to the exercise of personal moral agency. Our scriptural accounts of the Savior's mortal life provide the pattern. He declared, "I have many things to say and to judge of you" (John 8:26) and "For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see" (John 9:39).<br><br>During his mortal ministry the Savior made and acted upon many intermediate judgments, such as when he told the Samaritan woman of her sinful life (see John 4:17–19); when he rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy (see Matthew 15:1–9, 23:1–33); and when he commented on the comparative merit of the rich men's offerings and the widow's mites (see Mark 12:41–44).<br><br>Church leaders are specifically commanded to judge. Thus, the Lord said to Alma:<br><br><i>Whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people.</i>[Mosiah 26:29, 32]<br><br>Similarly, in modern revelation the Lord appointed the bishop to be a "judge in Israel" to judge over property and transgressions (D&amp;amp;C 58:17, 107:72).<br><br>The Savior also commanded individuals to be judges, both of circumstances and of other people. Through the prophet Moses the Lord commanded Israel, "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour" (Leviticus 19:15).<br><br>On one occasion the Savior chided the people, "Judge ye not what is right?" (Luke 12:57). On another occasion he said, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment" (John 7:24).<br><br>We must, of course, make judgments every day in the exercise of our moral agency, but we must be careful that our judgments of people are intermediate and not final. Thus, our Savior's teachings contain many commandments we cannot keep without making intermediate judgments of people: "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine" (Matthew 7:6); "Beware of false prophets. . . . Ye shall know them by their fruits" (Matthew 7:15–16); and "Go ye out from among the wicked" (D&amp;amp;C 38:42).<br><br>We all make judgments in choosing our friends, in choosing how we will spend our time and our money, and, of course, in choosing an eternal companion. Some of these intermediate judgments are surely among those the Savior referred to when he taught that "the weightier matters of the law" include judgment (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>The scriptures not only command or contemplate that we will make intermediate judgments, but they also give us some guidance--some governing principles--in how to do so.<br><h2><b>Righteous Intermediate Judgment</b></h2><br>The most fundamental principle is contained in the Savior's commandment that we "judge not unrighteously . . . : but judge righteous judgment" (JST, Matthew 7:1–2; see also John 7:24, Alma 41:14). Let us consider some principles or ingredients that lead to a "righteous judgment."<br><br>First of all, a righteous judgment must, by definition, be intermediate. It will refrain from declaring that a person has been assured of exaltation or from dismissing a person as being irrevocably bound for hellfire. It will refrain from declaring that a person has forfeited all opportunity for exaltation or even all opportunity for a useful role in the work of the Lord. The gospel is a gospel of hope, and none of us is authorized to deny the power of the Atonement to bring about a cleansing of individual sins, forgiveness, and a reformation of life on appropriate conditions.<br><br>Second, a righteous judgment will be guided by the Spirit of the Lord, not by anger, revenge, jealousy, or self-interest. The Book of Mormon teaches:<br><br><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain . . . as the daylight is from the dark night.</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil.</i>[Moroni 7:15–16]<br><br>The Savior taught that one of the missions of the Comforter he would send would be to assist in judgment of the world by guiding the faithful "into all truth" (John 16:13; see also vv. 8, 11).<br><br>Third, to be righteous, an intermediate judgment must be within our stewardship. We should not presume to exercise and act upon judgments that are outside our personal responsibilities. Some time ago I attended an adult Sunday School class in a small town in Utah. The subject was the sacrament, and the class was being taught by the bishop. During class discussion a member asked, "What if you see an unworthy person partaking of the sacrament? What do you do?"<br><br>The bishop answered, "You do nothing. I may need to do something." That wise answer illustrates my point about stewardship in judging.<br><br>A fourth principle of a righteous intermediate judgment of a person is that we should, if possible, refrain from judging until we have adequate knowledge of the facts. In an essay titled "Sitting in the Seat of Judgment," the great essayist William George Jordan reminded us that character<br><br><i>cannot be judged as dress-goods--by a yard or so of sample unrolled from a bolt on the counter. . . . One judges a painting by the full view of the whole canvas; separate isolated square inches of colour are meaningless. Yet we dare to judge our fellow man by single acts and words, misleading glimpses, and deceptive moments of special strain. From these we magnify a mood into a character and an episode into a life. . . .</i><br><br><i>We have a right to our preferences, our likes and dislikes, our impressions, our opinions, but we should withhold final judgment--as an honest unprejudiced juryman keeps his verdict in suspense until he has heard and tested all of the evidence. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We misinterpret motives, do not know facts, and judge from wrong standards.</i>[William George Jordan, "Sitting in the Seat of Judgment,"<i>The Crown of Individuality</i>(New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1909), pp. 101–5]<br><br>In another essay, William George Jordan wrote:<br><br><i>There is but one quality necessary for the perfect understanding of character, one quality that, if</i>[a]<i>man have it, he may</i>dare to judge--<i>that is, omniscience. Most people study character as a proofreader pores over a great poem: his ears are dulled to the majesty and music of the lines, his eyes are darkened to the magic imagination of the genius of the author; that proofreader is busy watching for an inverted comma, a misspacing, or a wrong font letter. He has an eye trained for the imperfections, the weaknesses. . . .</i><br><br><i>We do not need to judge nearly so much as we think we do. This is the age of snap judgments. . . .</i>[We need]<i>the courage to say, "I don't know. I am waiting further evidence. I must hear both sides of the question." It is this suspended judgment that is the supreme form of charity.</i>["The Supreme Charity of the World,"<i>The Kingship of Self-Control</i>(Old Tappan, New Jersey: Revell, n.d.), pp. 27–30; emphasis in original]<br><br>Someone has said that you cannot slice cheese so fine that it doesn't have two sides.<br><br>Two experiences illustrate the importance of caution in judging. A Relief Society worker visiting a sister in her ward asked whether the woman's married children ever visited her. Because of a short-term memory loss, this elderly sister innocently answered no. So informed, her visitor and others spoke criticisms of her children for neglecting their mother. In fact, one of her children visited her at least daily, and all of them helped her in many ways. They were innocent of neglect and should not have been judged on the basis of an inadequate knowledge of the facts.<br><br>Another such circumstance was described in an<i>Ensign</i>article by BYU professor Arthur R. Bassett:<br><br><i>I was troubled when one person whispered to another all through the opening prayer. The guilty parties were not hard to spot because they continued whispering all through the class. I kept glaring at them, hoping that they would take the hint, but they didn't seem to notice. Several times during the hour, I was tempted to ask them to take their conversation outside if they felt it was so urgent--but fortunately something kept me from giving vent to my feelings.</i><br><br><i>After the class, one of them came to me and apologized that she hadn't explained to me before class that her friend was deaf. The friend could read lips, but since I was discussing--as I often do--with my back to the class, writing at the chalkboard and talking over my shoulder, my student had been "translating" for her friend, telling her what I was saying. To this day I am thankful that both of us were spared the embarrassment that might have occurred had I given vent to a judgment made without knowing the facts.</i>[Arthur R. Bassett, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/06/floods-winds-and-the-gates-of-hell?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floods, Winds, and the Gates of Hell</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1991, p. 8]<br><br>The scriptures give a specific caution against judging where we cannot know all the facts. King Benjamin taught:<br><br><i>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just--</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance.</i>[Mosiah 4:17–18, 22]<br><br>There is one qualification to this principle that we should not judge people without an adequate knowledge of the facts. Sometimes urgent circumstances require us to make preliminary judgments before we can get all of the facts we desire for our decision making.<br><br>From time to time some diligent defenders deny this reality, such as the writer of a letter to the editor who insisted that certain publicly reported conduct should be ignored because "in this country you are innocent until you are proven guilty." The presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a court of law is a vital rule to guide the conduct of a criminal trial, but it is not a valid restraint on personal decisions. There are important restraints upon our intermediate judgments, but the presumption of innocence is not one of them.<br><br>Some personal decisions must be made before we have access to all of the facts. Two hypotheticals illustrate this principle:<br><br>1. If a particular person has been arrested for child sexual abuse and is free on bail awaiting trial on his guilt or innocence, will you trust him to tend your children while you take a weekend trip?<br><br>2. If a person you have trusted with your property has been indicted for embezzlement, would you continue to leave him in charge of your life savings?<br><br>In such circumstances we do the best we can, relying ultimately on the teaching in modern scripture that we should put our "trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously" (D&amp;amp;C 11:12).<br><br>A fifth principle of a righteous intermediate judgment is that whenever possible we will refrain from judging people and only judge situations. This is essential whenever we attempt to act upon different standards than those of others with whom we must associate--at home, at work, or in the community. We can set and act upon high standards for ourselves or our homes without condemning those who do otherwise. For example, I know of an LDS family with an older teenage son who has become addicted to smoking. The parents have insisted that he not smoke in their home or in front of his younger siblings. That is a wise judgment of a situation, not a person. Then, even as the parents take protective measures pertaining to a regrettable situation, they need to maintain loving relations and encourage improved conduct by the precious person.<br><br>A recent<i>Ensign</i>article by an anonymous victim of childhood sexual abuse illustrates the contrast between judging situations and judging persons. The article begins with heart-wrenching words and with true statements of eternal principles.<br><br><i>I am a survivor of childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. I no longer view myself as a victim. The change has come from inside me--my attitude. I do not need to destroy myself with anger and hate. I don't need to entertain thoughts of revenge. My Savior knows what happened. He knows the truth. He can make the judgments and the punishments. He will be just. I will leave it in his hands. I will not be judged for what happened to me, but I will be judged by how I let it affect my life. I am responsible for my actions and what I do with my knowledge. I am not to blame for what happened to me as a child. I cannot change the past. But I can change the future. I have chosen to heal myself and pass on to my children what I have learned. The ripples in my pond will spread through future generations.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/09/the-journey-to-healing?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Journey to Healing</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1997, p. 19]<br><br>This wise author also treats the importance of forgiveness. Forgiveness is a companion principle to the commandment that in final judgments we judge not and in intermediate judgments we judge righteously. The Savior taught, "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven" (Luke 6:37). In modern revelation the Lord has declared, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10).<br><br>Pursuing that principle, the author of the<i>Ensign</i>article writes:<br><br><i>Somewhere along the journey of healing comes the essential task of forgiving. Often the command to forgive (see D&amp;amp;C 64:10) seems almost more than one can bear, but this eternal principle can bring lasting peace. . . .</i><br><br><i>". . . I love that truth that although I need to evaluate situations . . . , I do not need to condemn or judge my abusers nor be part of the punishment. I leave all that to the Lord. I used the principle of forgiveness to strengthen me."</i>["Journey to Healing," p. 22]<br><br>A final ingredient or principle of a righteous judgment is that it will apply righteous standards. If we apply unrighteous standards, our judgment will be unrighteous. By falling short of righteous standards, we place ourselves in jeopardy of being judged by incorrect or unrighteous standards ourselves. The fundamental scripture on the whole subject of not judging contains this warning: "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again" (Matthew 7:2; see also 3 Nephi 14:2).<br><br>The prophet Mormon taught:<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.</i>[Moroni 7:18]<br><br>A standard can be unrighteous because it is too harsh--the consequences are too severe for the gravity of the wrong and the needs of the wrongdoer. Here I remember a conversation with an LDS newspaperwoman who described what happened when she reported that the Prophet Joseph Smith received the golden plates in 1826--a mistake of one year from the actual date of 1827. She said she received about 10 phone calls from outraged Latter-day Saints who would not accept her admission of error and sincere apology and berated her with abusive language. I wonder if persons who cannot handle an honest mistake without abusing the actor can stand up to having their own mistakes judged by so severe a standard.<br><br>As I have observed the judgments of presidents of the Church in matters of Church discipline, I have marveled at the care they have exercised to assure that justice is balanced with mercy, with loving concern for the consequences to innocent family members--born and unborn--as well as to the transgressors themselves.<br><br>In a BYU devotional address, Professor Catherine Corman Parry gave a memorable scriptural illustration of the consequences of judging by the wrong standards. The scripture is familiar. Martha received Jesus into her house and worked to provide for him while her sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word.<br><br><i>But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</i><br><br><i>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</i>[Luke 10:40–42]<br><br>Professor Parry comments:<br><br><i>Those of us with more of Martha than of Mary in us . . . do not doubt the overriding importance of listening to the Lord,</i>[but]<i>does the listening have to be done during dinner preparations? Would it have hurt Mary to have joined us in serving, then we all could have sat down to hear the Lord together? And furthermore, what about the value of our work in the world? If it weren't for us Marthas cleaning whatever we see and fussing over meals, there would be a lot of dirty, hungry people in this world. We may not live by bread alone, but I've never known anyone to live without it. Why, oh, why couldn't the Lord have said, "You're absolutely right, Martha. What are we thinking of to let you do all this work alone? We'll all help, and by the way, that centerpiece looks lovely"?</i><br><br><i>What he did say is difficult to bear, but perhaps somewhat less difficult if we examine its context. . . . The Lord acknowledges Martha's care: "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things" (v. 41). Then he delivers the gentle but clear rebuke. But the rebuke would not have come had Martha not prompted it. The Lord did not go into the kitchen and tell Martha to stop cooking and come listen. Apparently he was content to let her serve him however she cared to, until she judged another person's service: "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me" (v. 40). Martha's self-importance, expressed through her judgment of her sister, occasioned the Lord's rebuke, not her busyness with the meal.</i>[Catherine Corman Parry, "'<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/catherine-corman-parry_simon-somewhat-say-unto-thee-judgment-condemnation-parables-jesus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simon, I Have Somewhat to Say unto Thee': Judgment and Condemnation in the Parables of Jesus</a>,"<i>Brigham Young University 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1991], p. 116]<br><br>In subsequent portions of her talk, Professor Parry observed that in this instance--and also in the example of Simon the Pharisee, who criticized the woman who anointed the feet of the Savior (see Luke 7:36–50)--the Savior took one individual's judgment of another individual as a standard and applied that judgment back upon the individual who was judging. Professor Parry observed:<br><br><i>Quite literally, they were measured by their own standards and found wanting. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . While there are many things we must make judgments about, the sins of another or the state of our own souls in comparison to others seems not to be among them. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Our own sins, no matter how few or seemingly insignificant, disqualify us as judges of other people's sins.</i>["Simon, I Have Somewhat to Say unto Thee," pp. 118–19]<br><br>I love the words in Susan Evans McCloud's familiar hymn:<br><br><i>Who am I to judge another</i><br><i>When I walk imperfectly?</i><br><i>In the quiet heart is hidden</i><br><i>Sorrow that the eye can't see.</i><br><i>Who am I to judge another?</i><br><i>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br>["Lord, I Would Follow Thee,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220]<br><br>In one of the monthly General Authority fast and testimony meetings, I heard President James E. Faust say, "The older I get, the less judgmental I become." That wise observation gives us a standard to live by in the matter of judgments. We should refrain from anything that seems to be a final judgment of any person--manifesting our determination to leave final judgments to the Lord, who alone has the capacity to judge.<br><br>In the intermediate judgments we must make, we should take care to judge righteously. We should seek the guidance of the Spirit in our decisions. We should limit our judgments to our own stewardships. Whenever possible we should refrain from judging people until we have an adequate knowledge of the facts. So far as possible, we should judge circumstances rather than people. In all our judgments we should apply righteous standards. And, in all of this, we must remember the command to forgive.<br><br>There is a doctrine underlying the subject of gospel judging. It was taught when a lawyer asked the Savior, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" (Matthew 22:36). Jesus answered:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[vv. 37–40]<br><br>Later, in the sublime teachings the Savior gave his apostles on the eve of his suffering and the Atonement, he said:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>May God bless us that we may have that love and that we may show it in refraining from making final judgments of our fellowman. And in those intermediate judgments we are responsible to make, may we judge righteously and with love. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of love. Our Master, whom we seek to serve, is, as the scriptures say, a "God of love" (2 Corinthians 13:11). May we have his love. May we grow in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom I testify, as our Redeemer, our Creator, and our Savior. And may we grow in the capacity to live his gospel, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at BYU on 1 March 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ly Engaged in a Good Cause” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In section 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord tells us that it should not be necessary for him to "command in all things." He then said:<br><br><i>Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28]<br><br>As dean of Admissions and Records, I am deeply committed to this principle. I feel a sacred trust and responsibility for encouraging and admitting students to BYU who will not only be serious about their education but will also best use their education and talents to build and serve the kingdom of God. As students you have the sacred obligation to develop your talents for service, and as you use your talents for the kingdom, the Lord will open doors of opportunity, not only while you are here but after you graduate.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained in his book<i>The Promised Messiah:</i><br><br><i>There are two laws--the law of Christ and the law of Moses. The one is the gospel, the other is the preparatory gospel. There are two sets of commandments--the commandments which assure a celestial inheritance, and the law of carnal commandments, which, standing alone, carry no such assurance of eternal reward. The one is for those who are "anxiously engaged in a good cause," who "do many things of their own free will," who use their agency to "bring to pass much righteousness"; the other is for those who are slothful and rebellious by nature, who need to be commanded in all things, who neglect good works unless they are compelled to perform them. (D&amp;amp;C 58:26–27.)</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>The Promised Messiah</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 408]<br><br>Similarly Elder Dallin H. Oaks explained that "service is an imperative for true followers of Jesus Christ" (<i>Pure in Heart</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], p. 37). He emphasized, "Whether our service is to God or to our fellowmen, it is the same" and quoted King Benjamin's testimony: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Elder Oaks carefully pointed out:<br><br><i>When we think of service, we usually think of the acts of our hands. But . . . the Lord looks to our hearts as well as our hands. He is concerned not only with our acts but also with our motives. . . .</i><br><br><i>In order to purify our service to God and to our fellowmen, it is therefore important to consider not only</i>how<i>we serve, but also</i>why<i>we serve.</i>[<i>Pure in Heart,</i>p. 38; emphasis in original]<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson provided this insight:<br><br><i>Usually the Lord gives us the overall objectives to be accomplished and some guidelines to follow, but he expects us to work out most of the details and methods. The methods and procedures are usually developed through study and prayer and by living so that we can obtain and follow the promptings of the Spirit. Less spiritually advanced people, such as those in the days of Moses, had to be commanded in many things. Today those spiritually alert look at the objectives, check the guidelines laid down by the Lord and his prophets, and then prayerfully act--without having to be commanded "in all things." . . .</i><br><br><i>Sometimes the Lord hopefully waits on his children to act on their own, and when they do not, they lose the greater prize, and the Lord will either drop the entire matter and let them suffer the consequences or else he will have to spell it out in greater detail. Usually, I fear, the more he has to spell it out, the smaller is our reward.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1965, pp. 121–22]<br><br>Over the years Church and BYU leaders have clearly envisioned the mission of BYU and the hopes that they have for BYU graduates. One such statement--and one of my favorites--is by President Spencer W. Kimball. He said:<br><br><i>There are many ways in which BYU can tower above other universities . . . because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world. Your light must have a special glow. . . . You will also do some special things. . . .</i><br><br><i>I am both hopeful and expectant that out of this university . . . there will rise brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, sculpture, painting, science, and in all the scholarly graces. This university can be the refining host for many such individuals who will touch men and women the world over long after they have left this campus.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, pp. 1, 4]<br><br>In 1988, during an executive committee meeting of the board, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>The mission of BYU is to produce men and women who will make a significant contribution to society and in the process render faithful service to the Church and also be a strong influence for the Church in the world.</i>[Ford Stevenson, personal file note]<br><br>In considering a request for increased scholarship funds at BYU, President Hinckley asked if a study had been conducted to measure the level of leadership and Church activity for BYU scholarship students after they left BYU. President Hinckley then stated that if he knew our students were remaining faithful in the Church after leaving BYU and giving significant<i>service</i>and<i>leadership</i>to the Church and community, he would be happy to increase our scholarship budget. (And I might insert that he did.)<br><br>In 1990 Elder Boyd K. Packer explained:<br><br><i>Literally thousands of</i>[students]<i>dream of enrolling at BYU. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The enrollment at this university . . . cannot grow as the Church grows. . . .</i>[In fact, during the past decade the number of LDS 18-year-olds has nearly doubled whereas the enrollment ceiling at Brigham Young University has remained virtually the same.]<i>The growth of the Church cannot be held back. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We have no choice but to make some adjustments to accommodate the growth of the Church. . . . Entrance requirements cannot be based on grades alone. Church schools are not solely for the academically gifted.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "The Edge of the Light," BYU fireside address of 4 March 1990, adapted in<i>BYU Today</i>45, no. 2 (March 1991): 38–39]<br><br>That same year, 1990, I was appointed dean of Admissions and Records, and we were given a charge by the board of trustees to expand the criteria by which students are admitted to BYU. As we prayerfully considered guiding principles for an expanded admission criteria, we frequently referred to President Hinckley's comment that "BYU is to produce men and women who will make a significant contribution to society and in the process render faithful service to the Church and also be a strong influence for the Church in the world" (see "The Mission of Brigham Young University," approved by the BYU Board of Trustees on November 4, 1981). We decided that an applicant's service and leadership in community, high school, and Church should be part of the expanded criteria for admission to BYU. We also believed that just as high school grades are the best single predictor of how students will perform academically in the university, a student's record of leadership and service during the high school years would also be the best single predictor for a student's future contribution.<br><br>In 1991 the undergraduate admissions application was expanded to collect this information, and the Admissions Committee has since considered service and leadership in screening those who are admitted to BYU. You may be interested in knowing that approximately 25 percent of the students admitted to the freshman class through the Admissions Committee's reading of their files would not have been admitted if only grades and test scores were used in the selection process.<br><br>You would be impressed if you could see each applicant's admission file. Your commitment to service and leadership shines. You are an extraordinary group of students. I am convinced that, regardless of what we provide educationally, this institution will continue to grow in prestige because of the quality of the students attending and graduating from here.<br><br>Attendance at BYU is truly a sacred privilege, not only when you consider how few LDS students can attend BYU but how BYU is financed. As many of you may know, 70 percent of the cost of your education comes through the tithes of the LDS Church membership. Therefore, whether a student has a scholarship or not, the financial support by the Church is significant. The gift from, or, better stated, the financial investment in you by the Church assumes an obligation on the part of each student to fulfill the purposes for which this university is chartered.<br><br>Two and a half years ago Professor Paul Cox, then dean of General Education and Honors, made the following statement to honor students:<br><br><i>BYU students who see their scholarships</i>[and I might insert admissions]<i>as gifts rather than as entitlements will use their time at BYU to prepare for future service in the kingdom of God. They will keep themselves pure and unspotted so that they can enter the temple and become parents of an eternal family unit. They will diligently study the scriptures and prepare themselves to teach superbly in their homes and in the auxiliaries of the Church. They will seek to hone their musical, accounting, and administrative talents to assist the Church wherever they live. They will learn to live close to the Spirit so they will be able to identify and reach out to those who are in need. Such students will be particularly cognizant of Church members in distant lands who support BYU through tithes and offerings but who cannot enroll here. They will, where appropriate, seek to study other languages and cultures so as to better prepare themselves for service in a worldwide Church.</i>[Paul Alan Cox, "Your Scholarship: Gift or Entitlement?" 10 October 1995, p. 8]<br><br>Last year, as part of the selection process, the university's Presidential Scholarship Committee decided to ask finalists to submit a proposal addressing how they would use their gifts and talents to benefit others. The purpose was to encourage them, at the outset of their university experience, to begin thinking about how they might contribute to the university, the Church, or society at large.<br><br>A wide variety of intriguing proposals was submitted. One was to establish an organization within Provo and Orem that would assist the many different service agencies in coordinating efforts. Another was to implement a program in hospitals using therapeutic music to increase the survival rate of critically ill newborns. Most important, these students entered BYU this past fall realizing that not only would they receive a quality education and experience here, but they would also be expected to make significant contributions beyond their academic activities in the classroom.<br><br>There have always been high expectations for the students attending BYU and for the contributions they would make in the world and to the Church. On September 18, 1962, President Ernest L. Wilkinson addressed the BYU faculty and used an example of one of BYU's earliest students. He said:<br><br><i>One of the most thrilling examples of the type of student produced at the "Y," through our secular and spiritual environment, is that of a young English immigrant who first enrolled at Brigham Young Academy in 1876. Two years later, at the age of sixteen, he graduated and immediately joined the faculty as an instructor in elementary science, Latin, and English.</i><br><br><i>With the friendly encouragement of Dr. Karl G. Maeser and President John Taylor, the young Englishman journeyed back East and engaged in further study at Lehigh University and Johns Hopkins University. Thus, he was among the very first LDS students to obtain advanced training at eastern universities. Returning to the "Y," the young scholar was appointed as professor of geology and chemistry. Later he became assistant to Brother Maeser. While serving in this capacity, he was appointed to the school's board of trustees. Having tremendous civic vigor, he also served as Provo City councilman, alderman, and justice of the peace.</i><br><br><i>Later, this English scholar was called to the position of president of the Latter-day Saints College in Salt Lake City. And five years later, he became president and professor of geology at the University of Utah. In 1911 he was called to the Council of the Twelve, and Dr. James E. Talmage served in this office with great ability and inspiration until his death in 1933, at the early age of seventy-one. . . .</i><br><br><i>I am convinced that Elder Talmage's life and his outstanding accomplishments were influenced to a marked degree by his experiences at the "Y" and by the counsel and encouragement he received from Dr. Karl G. Maeser. In this respect, I sincerely exhort each of you to remember that there may be many other "James Talmages" in our student body.</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson, "The Calling of BYU," in<i>Educating Zion</i>(Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), pp. 38–39]<br><br>Although there may be few who meet the full merit of being a James E. Talmage, BYU has an illustrious list of graduates who have made and are making "significant contribution[s] to society and in the process render[ing] faithful service to the Church and also [are] a strong influence for the Church in the world." Let me cite a few recent examples.<br><br>There is an international student on our campus who chooses to do many things of her own free will. I am sure that she is like many of you. Because of her own financial struggles, she is sensitive to the needs of others. As she has met other students who are struggling to make ends meet, she has taken it upon herself to help by directing these students to offices on campus that may have the resources to help. She has also found financial sponsors for some and in some cases has raised money herself to give to those who are in desperate straits.<br><br>A former BYU student, like many of our alumni, freely gives of his skills and talents. Upon leaving BYU he studied medicine and eventually became a plastic surgeon. He now has his own practice. Each year he and others who work with him go to South America at their own expense and provide needed plastic surgery to children whose bodies and faces are grossly disfigured. He brings hope and healing to those who could never afford such procedures.<br><br>Recently I learned that one of my former BYU classmates has adopted over the years the practice of giving 10 percent of his professional time in service to others without a charge, just as he gives a tithing on his income. As a student at BYU he constantly gave service to the student body in student government, service organizations, and the Church. This has continued through his life, and he has served on the BYU Alumni Board and as Alumni president. During this time he has also served as a bishop twice and is currently a stake president.<br><br>Recognition should also be given to the wonderful contributions being given by full-time homemakers. Every year as we participate in the scholarship selection process, so many students, when asked what made the difference in their lives, respond that it was their parents--specifically their mothers. They tell of mothers with great talents and skills who could have had distinguished professional careers but remained in the home to nurture and teach their children. I am convinced that these good women saw their opportunity to "bring to pass much righteousness" by raising a righteous posterity to the Lord.<br><br>We are all recipients of gifts from the Lord that can be used to build the kingdom and make this world a better place to live. The Lord reinforced this wonderful principle to the Prophet Joseph Smith in D&amp;amp;C 46:11: "To every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God."<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said, "God has endowed us with talents and time, with latent abilities and with opportunities to use and develop them in his service. He therefore expects much of us, his privileged children" (<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], p. 100). To be at BYU is to be a "privileged child." It is important that you seize every opportunity, develop your talents, and prepare for service. Then, as you become "anxiously engaged in good causes," you will bring "to pass much righteousness," and the Lord will open doors for you to make your own personal contributions.<br><br>Today, special circumstances allow me to introduce you to a wonderful woman, who, like all of us, has been blessed with gifts and talents from the Lord. She has not had the privilege of attending BYU, but she personifies what we are about. She has spent a lifetime "anxiously engaged" in good causes and has brought forth "much righteousness." In addition to being an exemplary member missionary in Norway, her initiatives led to the establishment of the Norwegian and Danish lecture series here in our David M. Kennedy Center. She joined the Church in 1964 when my father was mission president in Norway. She is seated in the audience today. [May I ask Sister Rigmor Heistø to please stand. Thank you.]<br><br>Sister Heistø is 78 years old, and she came from Norway two weeks ago to hear Norwegian Supreme Court Justice Georg Fr. Rieber-Mohn give a lecture in the Kennedy Center. She is the person who made the original contact with Justice Rieber-Mohn and put me in touch with him.<br><br>Two years ago Sister Heistø read a newspaper article in which Justice Rieber-Mohn, then attorney general for Norway, lamented about the disintegrating family and cultural values in Norway. In the newspaper interview he warned that the continued pursuit of materialism could destroy the country, and he called for a greater emphasis on teaching values.<br><br>Sister Heistø thought the attorney general should know that a church was already doing the very things he advocated. So she wrote to him, told him about our church, and sent him some brochures. A week later the attorney general telephoned, thanked Sister Heistø for writing to him, and invited her to meet with him. As a result, she had a two-hour meeting with the attorney general in which she explained the Church's teachings and programs.<br><br>At the conclusion of their visit, Sister Heistø suggested that the attorney general visit Utah to learn more about the Mormons personally. She then said she had a friend at BYU who would be happy to invite him to visit Utah and give a lecture at BYU. I was contacted, I extended the invitation, and we had the privilege of hosting Justice Rieber-Mohn and his son just two weeks ago.<br><br>It was a wonderful visit, and Justice Rieber-Mohn gave an excellent lecture in the David M. Kennedy Center. He discussed his observations overseeing criminal prosecution in Norway for the past 11 years and placed the primary blame for increased crime on the breaking down of the family and the pursuit of materialism. In a radio interview in Salt Lake City discussing his observations, the interviewer asked if Justice Rieber-Mohn had gained any insight during his visit to Utah that he might take back to Norway to help resolve the problems he had identified. His response was, "Well, I should take the whole Mormon Church with me and the family life you have, and we would see a rapid decline in all the negative signs developing of which I have spoken" (transcription of radio interview provided by Dave Porter, LDS Public Affairs, 5 March 1998). Here is a man who prior to meeting Sister Heistø admitted that the only thing he knew about Mormons was what he learned in high school regarding polygamy--and now he is a good friend to the Church and BYU.<br><br>The visit by the Norwegian Supreme Court justice is just one of the most recent examples of Sister Heistø's contributions. To conserve time, may I summarize just what she has done since she retired 11 years ago:<br><br>1. She earned a theology degree at Norway's most prestigious theological seminary.<br><br>2. She initiated contacts with some of Norway's most noted educational and political leaders, many of whom have come to BYU to give lectures.<br><br>3. She has worked with the Norwegian Ministry of Education in developing a comparative religion course being taught in Norwegian high schools.<br><br>4. She organized, edited, and published a book on comparative religions that is now being used as a text in Norwegian public high schools and is the first comparative religion text book where each religion was permitted to write its text for itself.<br><br>5. She got the video of<i>The God Makers</i>removed from all Christian bookstores in Norway.<br><br>6. She has proposed legislation to protect religions from having inaccurate information printed about them.<br><br>7. She has presented a display on our Church each year at the annual Norwegian Teachers Conference.<br><br>8. She has helped hundreds of non-LDS Norwegian high school students research and write accurate term papers about our Church.<br><br>As noted, Sister Heistø decided to obtain a theology degree. Her family and friends had told her that if she'd had any intelligence she could have seen through the lies of Mormonism. She felt that by attending a Norwegian Lutheran theological seminary and obtaining a theological degree she could show her intelligence and counter the criticisms by family and friends for joining the LDS Church.<br><br>One of her first classes was Philosophy of Religions, taught by Professor Guttorm Fløistad. At the end of the course, Professor Fløistad asked for suggestions on how he might improve the course for future offerings. Sister Heistø raised her hand and suggested he add a section on the philosophy of Mormonism. Professor Fløistad responded that he didn't know enough about Mormonism. Sister Heistø quickly suggested that she could arrange for a Latter-day Saint scholar from Brigham Young University to come to Norway and give a lecture at Oslo University on Mormonism. Then Professor Fløistad could use the BYU professor's lecture material for his course. Professor Fløistad was agreeable to her suggestion, although it may have been a polite way to close the discussion. However, Sister Heistø, with her strong determination, followed through and arranged for Professor Truman Madsen from BYU to go to Norway. Professor Madsen gave a superb lecture, and Professor Madsen and Professor Fløistad became close friends.<br><br>When I went to Norway as mission president, Sister Heistø approached me about having Professor Fløistad visit BYU and lecture at the Kennedy Center. I made contact with the university for an invitation and made arrangements with a donor to pay for his expenses. It was a marvelous experience that resulted in Professor Fløistad becoming one of the Church's best public relations friends in Norway.<br><br>One interesting side note about Professor Fløistad's visit that shows Sister Heistø's fortitude when representing the Lord was the commitment she extracted from Professor Fløistad before coming to BYU. The European area presidency visited Oslo and gave a seminar on member missionary work. At the end of the seminar, Elder Carlos Asay, then the European area president, asked the members to make a commitment to give at least three referrals a month to the full-time missionaries. That gave Sister Heistø an idea.<br><br>The next day Sister Heistø telephoned Professor Fløistad and said, "Since we are paying for you to go to Utah to learn about the Mormons, I think we should get something in return." He responded that her request seemed fair and asked what she had in mind. She then suggested that he invite at least three people a month to learn more about the Mormons. He agreed to the request.<br><br>Professor Fløistad had taken a year's sabbatical from Oslo University to study leadership and management in Norwegian businesses. Arrangements had been made for him to tour Norway giving lectures on his findings. The day he returned from Utah he began a week's tour in Norway visiting major cities and lecturing to Norway's leading business executives. At the end of the week, when he returned to Oslo, Professor Fløistad telephoned Sister Heistø to give a report on his visit to Utah and to thank her for arranging the trip.<br><br>Professor Fløistad then asked Sister Heistø if she remembered the commitment she had extracted from him. She said yes, and he then asked her what it was. She replied that he was to invite at least three people a month to learn more about the Mormons.<br><br>He said, "I've done better than that. I gave six lectures this week to business executives, and I have invited each of them to learn about your church." He then added, "Do you want to know what I said?"<br><br>"Of course!" she replied.<br><br>He continued, "I told them that I have found the most perfect organization, and it is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." He then added, "Even if you are not interested in religion, the next time two Mormon missionaries knock on your door, let them in. There is much you can learn from the Mormons."<br><br>A week later Professor Fløistad telephoned again. He said, "Rigmor, I understand Mormons like reports." She confirmed that we do, and he said, "I've called to give you another report. This week I gave five more lectures, and again I invited my audiences to learn more about the Mormons."<br><br>It didn't stop there. Professor Fløistad has returned to BYU three times. And now, 10 years later, he tells me that he still gives about 400 lectures a year, and in at least one out of three lectures he talks about what his audience can learn from the Mormons.<br><br>As a result of Sister Heistø's initial efforts, the groundwork was laid for the establishment of the Scandinavian Scholarship Endowment at BYU. This was made possible through the generous contribution of a private donor who was aware of Sister Heistø's work and applied his own gifts and talents to help this work go forward. In conjunction with the scholarship program, a special lecture series in the David M. Kennedy Center was established to bring Norwegian and Danish government and educational leaders to Utah and Brigham Young University.<br><br>The lecture series was initiated by writing to the Norwegian ambassador to the United States. I told him of the scholarship program and of our objective in bringing Norwegian government and educational leaders to lecture at BYU. Within a few weeks the ambassador replied, complimenting us on our initiatives and inviting me to visit him at his embassy the next time I was in Washington, D.C. Fortunately, a month later I went to Washington on some university business and met with Kjeld Vibe, the Norwegian ambassador. We had a delightful visit, and he graciously accepted the invitation to visit Utah and lecture at BYU.<br><br>About two weeks later Stephen Studdert, a stake president in northern Virginia and a former member of President Reagan's administration, stopped by my office. During our discussion I told him about my visit with the Norwegian ambassador. President Studdert smiled and said, "How would you like a postscript to your visit?" He then told me that two nights earlier he had attended a dinner with 18 ambassadors in Washington, D.C. None of the ambassadors knew he was LDS nor had an association with BYU. As the evening began, the Austrian ambassador told the other ambassadors that he had just returned from a visit to Brigham Young University. The ambassador said it was one of the most delightful experiences of his life. He told of his impressions of BYU, of how kindly he was hosted, and of how impressed he was with BYU and its students. President Studdert said as soon as the Austrian ambassador finished, another ambassador said that he, too, had visited BYU. He gave a similar report. When he finished speaking, the Norwegian ambassador then stated, "I just accepted an invitation to go to BYU and will be there next month." After Ambassador Vibe's comment, President Studdert said a fourth ambassador asked, "How do you get invited? I would like to go there, too."<br><br>President Studdert moved to Utah and was asked by Governor Michael Leavitt to serve as chair of the 1996 Utah Statehood Centennial Celebration Commission. One of President Studdert's proposals for the Statehood Centennial Celebration was to have an ambassadorial-visits program to showcase Utah to foreign ambassadors. I was invited to serve on the program committee and later became its chair.<br><br>Our target was to bring 50 ambassadors to Utah representing countries that were Utah's strongest economic trading partners. Each ambassador could come at a time convenient to his own schedule. Forty-three ambassadors came. One of the objectives during the visits was to have each ambassador speak at a college or university. Most ambassadors wanted to visit BYU, and the highest percentage did. It was a marvelous experience to host them and see their reactions. Because of the success of the state's program, we have now started our own BYU Ambassador Lecture Series and bring ambassadors each semester to visit BYU and lecture at the Kennedy Center. Tomorrow the Czech Republic ambassador will be on campus and lecture in the Kennedy Center conference room at 12:00 noon--and on Thursday the ambassador from Spain will be on campus and lecture in the Kennedy Center conference room at 11:00 a.m. May I encourage you to attend their lectures.<br><br>Shortly after hosting the Norwegian ambassador, we hosted the ambassador from Denmark--Peter Dyvig--and his wife. They, too, were extremely impressed with BYU, the students who attended the ambassador's lecture, and the quality of the questions asked in the question-and-answer session. Afterward the ambassador's wife commented, "Peter, look into the eyes of these students. There is something different . . . from students we have seen on other campuses." The ambassador agreed. Most dignitaries I host make the same comment about you. Your very appearance makes a statement to our non-LDS guests.<br><br>In the fall of 1992 we hosted the Danish minister of education, Bertel Haarder. He had just come from a seminar in Denmark, where he had gathered 100 of the leading Danish educators to discuss the future of Danish education. In preparation for the seminar, he sent a copy of Allan Bloom's book<i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>to each participant. He asked the seminar participants to read the book and come prepared with ideas how they and the Danish Ministry of Education could avoid the problems that had developed in American education.<br><br>Minister Haarder was therefore very interested after holding the seminar to come to the United States and visit our university. Minister Haarder and his wife spent two days on our campus. He gave a lecture at the Kennedy Center and met with the university president, faculty, and students. Although the Haarders were very impressed with BYU, they were even more impressed with the quality of the LDS students and their willingness to interrupt their university studies for missionary service.<br><br>When we took the Haarders to the Salt Lake Airport on a Wednesday, it was very busy, even though it was 8:15 in the morning. Minister Haarder was curious why the airport was so congested at that early hour. I told him it was because missionaries were departing for their assignments, and their families were seeing them off. He asked how I could tell. I smiled and pointed out the new suits, white shirts, and missionary badges.<br><br>He asked, "Where are they going?"<br><br>I said, "Throughout the world."<br><br>As we walked down the concourse, we approached a missionary who was saying good-bye to his family. I suggested to Minister Haarder that we ask him where he was going. I interrupted the family conversation long enough to ask, "Elder, where are you going?"<br><br>The missionary politely answered, "North Dakota, sir."<br><br>I then introduced the missionary and his parents to Minister Haarder. Minister Haarder asked the missionary how he felt about serving a mission. The missionary responded that he was excited, but he would miss his family.<br><br>Minister Haarder commented, "Well, you will be able to come home for vacations and holidays, won't you?"<br><br>The missionary responded, "No, sir. When I go, I am there for two years and won't see my family until the end of those two years."<br><br>Minister Haarder then turned to the parents and asked, "How do you feel about that?"<br><br>The mother replied, "We will miss him, but we are very proud of him. This was his decision."<br><br>We concluded the conversation and again proceeded toward his departure gate. However, before getting there, we visited with other missionaries: one going to South Carolina, a second going to Moscow, and a third going to St. Petersburg. In each case Minister Haarder asked the missionary several questions regarding his desire to serve a mission, how he felt about interrupting his education, and what he hoped to accomplish during his mission. Minister Haarder was overwhelmed by the answers he received.<br><br>The airline was giving the final boarding notice as we came to the departure gate. However, I took time to ask, "Minister Haarder, you just came from a seminar where you read and discussed<i>The Closing of the American Mind.</i>That book suggests that American education is in an intellectual crisis. It portrays youth as self-centered, lacking commitment, having no direction in their lives, and having little identity with their culture and religion." I continued, "How do you compare that image of American education and American students to what you have seen at BYU and the missionaries you have just met?"<br><br>He paused and thoughtfully answered, "What I have observed is the antithesis of what was portrayed of American education and youth. I am very impressed with your university and your students. Both are uniquely different."<br><br>As a result of his visit to BYU and Utah, Bertel Haarder has become a friend of the university and the Church. The Copenhagen stake president shared the following account with me that demonstrates the impact these visits are having for the Church. One day not long after the minister's return to Denmark, he heard a radio call-in show that focused on the Mormons. One caller made some critical comments about the Church. Other callers followed with equally disparaging comments. Then a caller came on the line and said, "This is Bertel Haarder." Most Danes knew who Bertel Haarder was because he had been minister of education for 10 years. He then continued, "When I was a young man I probably had the same impression of the Mormon Church. But recently my wife and I visited Utah and saw the Mormons up close. What you are saying is incorrect, and I suggest you discontinue this discussion." The radio station not only discontinued the topic, but they closed the program and played music for the balance of the program time.<br><br>As I consider the past several years and see the amount of good that has come from the visits of these dignitaries, my mind continually goes back to Sister Heistø. So much of this is a direct result of her desire to be "engaged in a good cause." There are many others like her who in their own private way make a difference. And those differences can be made in so many ways.<br><br>May I challenge you to be "anxiously engaged" in good causes, and you, too, can make a difference and "bring to pass much righteousness." To that end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Erlend D.

<h1>: A Miraculous Gift - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored that I have been asked to speak at today's devotional assembly. During the six years that I was dean, I enjoyed sitting in one of these comfortable chairs located behind me, as I listened to Church leaders and colleagues deliver messages of inspiration. I found this morning that the chair assigned to me was not nearly as comfortable--at least I didn't feel quite as relaxed. I pray that the Lord's Spirit will be with me this morning, that I may enjoy his guidance as we share this time together.<br><br>One of the qualities of humankind that distinguishes us from other species, and that relates us closely with our Father in Heaven, is the ability to communicate using language. Speaking and listening and reading and writing are such natural parts of everyday life for most of us that we rarely stop to consider the fact that we are performing a miracle. In the opinion of the late Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, "In his whole life man achieves nothing so great and so wonderful as what he achieved when he learned to talk" (in Richard Lederer,<i>The Miracle of Language</i>[New York: Pocket Books, 1991], p. 224). Language is one of the most important of our human possessions. Noah Webster, a man whose very name is intimately associated with the English language, said that "language, as well as the faculty of speech, was the immediate gift of God" (in Lederer,<i>The Miracle,</i>p. 241). Language is indeed a gift of God to help us as we experience this earthly life.<br><br>Consider with me for a few minutes what takes place as two people engage in a simple conversation. The speaker must first formulate thoughts about what is to be said; then recall the appropriate words that express these thoughts; then order the words in a grammatically correct sequence; then perform unbelievable "acrobatic maneuvers" with the lungs, mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, velum, larynx, pharynx, and other speech organs that most of us don't even know we have (see Philip Lieberman,<i>Eve Spoke</i>[W. W. Norton, 1998], p. xv). We must control nasality, volume, pitch, stress, intonation, and speed. We perform this complex task in one or two seconds for an average sentence. As if this were not enough, we are constantly thinking ahead to the next sentence and the one after that. The listener meanwhile must perform this same operation in reverse, trying to make sense out of what is really nothing more than a continuous stream of noise.<br><br>V-e-r-y f-e-w p-e-o-p-l-e s-p-e-a-k i-n s-u-c-h a w-a-y t-h-a-t t-h-e-y c-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y e-n-u-n-c-i-a-t-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d. Instead, we run words and sounds together, even leaving out sounds entirely or blending them together in creations such as<i>gunna</i>for "going to,"<i>wanna</i>for "want to,"<i>whuf</i>for "what if," and<i>oush</i>for "I wish." The listener must take all of this into account as this few seconds of speech is decoded first into words, then into some kind of meaning. In a typical conversation the listener is also a speaker and must prepare a spoken response while trying to listen at the same time. To complicate the process of listening even more, there are often extraneous sounds such as other people speaking around us, traffic noise, machines operating, airplanes flying overhead, or bells ringing. When we analyze language we discover that the system of rules for encoding and decoding sentences is highly complex. Yet when we speak and listen we are hardly conscious of rules. We just speak spontaneously and don't worry about verb conjugation, pronoun antecedents, noun plurals, or word order. And we get it right most of the time.<br><br>I feel that it can safely be said that using language is indeed miraculous. I truly believe that if language did not exist and someone proposed it, it would be dismissed as an impossibility. The marvelous thing is that, except for cases of speech impairments, everyone beyond a certain age can and does use language almost continuously during the waking hours of a day, and sometimes even while sleeping. If we are not speaking, then we are listening to other people speak--or sing--either live or through radio and television. If we are not speaking or listening, we are reading books, newspapers, magazines, signs, posters, license plates, and any number of printed media. And many of us spend a great deal of time writing during an average day, especially those of us addicted to e-mail. Much of our enjoyment, inspiration, education, and general knowledge in life comes through language in the form of reading, listening to speakers, entertainment, personal communication, and social interaction.<br><br>Language has been the object of interest and study among humans probably for as long as languages have existed--certainly as far back as we have written records. Linguists and anthropologists are continually trying to show relatedness among existing and extinct languages and would like very much to discover the original language. Unfortunately, we have no information about the early history of human speech except for a couple of scriptures such as Genesis 11:1, which refers to the time just prior to the building of the Tower of Babel: "And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech." In verse 8 we read that the Lord was not pleased about the building of the tower, so he confounded the language of the people and "scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth." In Moses 6:6 we learn that the language of this time was "pure and undefiled."<br><br>Today there are approximately four to six thousand languages spoken among the people of the world. This number is not very precise because there is often disagreement as to what is a language and what is a dialect. And this does not even include the hundreds--perhaps thousands--of languages that were once spoken but are now extinct. In the Americas alone, for example, there were probably several hundred languages spoken by the native inhabitants that are no longer spoken today. In spite of the tremendous diversity among the thousands of languages spoken today and in the past, we find that in many ways these languages actually have a great deal in common. Each of them is a complex and well-organized system that is capable of expressing quite well the thoughts and feelings of its speakers. Languages change constantly over time, but there is no such thing as a degenerate or inferior language. Benjamin Lee Whorf, one of the pioneer linguists of our century, said:<br><br><i>The crudest savage may unconsciously manipulate with effortless ease a linguistic system so intricate, manifoldly systematized, and intellectually difficult, that it requires the lifetime study of our greatest scholars to describe its workings.</i>[In Lederer,<i>The Miracle,</i>p. 242]<br><br>Given the divine and miraculous nature of human language, it seems to me that it is incumbent upon us, the beneficiaries of this gift, to use language in a way that reflects its venerable status and sacred origin. The Roman writer Publius said, "Speech is a mirror of the soul: as a man speaks, so is he" (Publilius Syrus, Maxim 1073). And Richard Lederer, an educator and popular author on language, writes:<br><br><i>Thus it is that the manner in which you utter words, write words, and receive words throughout your life determines how effectively and resourcefully you carry on the business of being a member of the human race.</i>[Lederer,<i>The Miracle,</i>p. 18]<br><br>Like many things that our Father in Heaven has blessed us with, language can be used as a force to bring about much righteousness, to bring us blessings, and to bless the lives of those around us. But it can also be used as a tool of destruction. It can edify and uplift as well as vilify and destroy. In Matthew 15 you will recall that the scribes and Pharisees rebuked the Savior because his disciples failed to wash their hands before eating bread. The Savior responded by saying:<br><br><i>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man....</i><br><br><i>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</i>[Matthew 15:11, 18]<br><br>In the Third Epistle of James we are warned about the danger of an uncontrolled tongue:<br><br><i>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature....</i><br><br><i>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</i>[James 3:6, 10]<br><br>I would like to discuss five danger zones of language use--or misuse--that I believe violate the very purpose for which language was intended. As we give utterance to our thoughts and feelings, as we communicate with members of our family, our roommates, friends, fellow students, colleagues, store clerks, and impetuous drivers, as we perform this miracle of speech, we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.<br><br>The first language danger zone is that of negative speech. All of us are guilty on occasion of complaining about something, and we probably have a legitimate right to do so. But I am talking about the hard-core cases: the naysayers, the chronic complainers, the gripers, the groaners, the grousers, the grouches, the grumblers, the bellyachers, the murmurers, the faultfinders, and the whiners. These are the people who have very little good to say about anything. They have the uncanny ability to see a dark side in almost everything. They fail to realize that things in this life are not perfect, so they choose to dwell on imperfection. Life for them is not colorful--it's not even black and white. It's just dark. These are people who apparently find happiness in being unhappy and in letting everyone else know about it. They look for things to complain about because they find great pleasure in being indignant.<br><br>Perhaps we should have a tolerant attitude about other people's outlook on life, but the problem is that this kind of behavior can be infectious and even destructive. Imagine what it must have been like to have Laman and Lemuel around day and night to offer their opinions about what father Lehi had been instructed to do. It was a tough assignment that the Lord had given to Lehi and his family, but it was made even more difficult because of the constant murmuring of two adult men who should have known better. In an October 1989 general conference talk, Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed:<br><br><i>Damage to ourselves is sufficient reason to resist murmuring, but another obvious danger is its contagiousness. Even faithful father Lehi, for one brief moment, got caught up in the contagion of murmuring. (See 1 Ne. 16:20.) Similarly, when Moses lapsed, very briefly, it was under exasperating pressure from rebels. (See Num. 20:7–12.) No one knows how to work a crowd better than the adversary.</i>["Murmur Not,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 84]<br><br>The second danger zone of language is that of speaking ill of others. This includes gossip, slander, spreading vicious rumors, and evil speaking of people around us. In section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord outlines some of the responsibilities of those who hold the office of teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood: "And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking" (D&amp;amp;C 20:54). I know that it seems difficult to imagine a 14-year-old boy being expected to monitor backbiting and evil speaking within the confines of his ward boundaries, but I do believe that the Lord was speaking to all of us, not just to the teachers. It is sometimes hard not to relay a piece of juicy gossip about someone we know or make a snide remark about an acquaintance. But the weapon we use to launch slanderous remarks about other people will usually backfire and injure us as much as the intended victim. President David O. McKay admonished us in the closing remarks of a general conference talk:<br><br><i>May we go forth with greater resolution to defend one another in righteous living, to defend the Church, not to speak against our neighbors, nor against authorities of the Church, local, stake or general. Let us avoid evil speaking, let us avoid slander and gossip. These are poisons to the soul to those who indulge. Evil speaking injures the reviler more than the reviled.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1953, p. 59]<br><br>And President N. Eldon Tanner spoke in a similar vein when he counseled:<br><br><i>Gossip is the worst form of judging. The tongue is the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly weapon available to man. A vicious tongue can ruin the reputation and even the future of the one attacked. Insidious attacks against one's reputation, loathsome innuendoes, half-lies about an individual are as deadly as those insect parasites that kill the heart and life of a mighty oak. They are so stealthy and cowardly that one cannot guard against them</i>. [<i>CR,</i>April 1972, p. 57]<br><br>Shakespeare expressed the evil of slander through the character Iago in his play<i>Othello:</i><br><br><i>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;<br>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;<br>But he that filches from me my good name<br>Robs me of that which not enriches him,<br>And makes me poor indeed.</i>[Othello III, iii, 157–61]<br><br>The third danger zone is that of lying or dishonesty. In the book of Proverbs we read that among the seven things that the Lord hates is "a false witness that speaketh lies" (Proverbs 6:19). Furthermore, "lying lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight" (Proverbs 12:22). And "the lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment" (Proverbs 12:19). The Doctrine and Covenants admonishes us, "Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out" (D&amp;amp;C 42:21). Unfortunately, playing fast and loose with the truth has become common, if not accepted, in our modern no-fault society, and we certainly have plenty of role models. Automatic denial is the typical knee-jerk reaction if someone has been caught or accused of doing something wrong.<br><br>The lie is often a strong temptation, because it may seem to help preserve a reputation or career or prevent serious legal problems. Frequently a lie is told subsequent to another sin that we are trying to cover up. Sometimes it works--at least for the present--but usually the truth emerges and a bad situation becomes even worse. As we meet with the bishop for a temple recommend interview, tithing settlement, or an ecclesiastical endorsement, as we submit academic work to our professors, as we interact daily with family members, roommates, classmates, friends, and strangers, we should keep in mind the sanctity of truth and the consequences of dishonesty. It can cause pain and suffering for other people, but the teller of the lie is the one who will suffer most.<br><br>In the second verse of the beloved hymn "Now Let Us Rejoice," we sing, "We'll love one another and never dissemble" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 3). I don't know what motivated Brother William Phelps in 1833 to include this particular sentence in his hymn, but it is a good message for<i>our</i>times. Unfortunately, many of us today do not know the meaning of the word<i>dissemble.</i>It is not the opposite of<i>assemble,</i>and it has nothing to do with being disorganized. It means to conceal the truth or to deceive. We encounter dissembling all the time in today's world. Have you ever been told that you have definitely won a million dollars? Have you ever received a notice that you have been selected out of all the people in your city to receive a special prize? Have you ever read or heard about something that just seemed too good to be true? It is a natural tendency for some people to want to push the limits of honesty to the edge. I recall as a campus bishop being told by a member of my ward, "Well, technically, bishop, I really wasn't lying to you." What does that mean? Are you honest in your dealings with other people? That is a simple question. The answer should be equally simple.<br><br>Language danger zone number four is the use of profanity and its close relatives obscenity, swearing, cursing, cussing, blasphemy, vulgarity, and sacrilegious speech. I have never really understood why certain movies, television programs, musical recordings, books, and magazines are said to contain "adult" or "mature" language. Is this use of offensive language really a sign of maturity? I think not. Perhaps "immature" language would be a more appropriate designation. You will recall the account related by Parley P. Pratt about an incident in the makeshift jail at Richmond, Missouri, in November of 1838. The guards, according to Brother Pratt, were<br><br><i>the most noisy, foul-mouthed, vulgar, disgraceful rabble that ever defiled the earth....</i><br><br><i>In one of those tedious nights we had lain as if in sleep till the hour of midnight had passed, and our ears and hearts had been pained, while we had listened for hours to the obscene jests, the horrid oaths, the dreadful blasphemies and filthy language of our guards....</i><br><br><i>I had listened till I became so disgusted, shocked, horrified, and so filled with the spirit of indignant justice that I could scarcely refrain from rising upon my feet and rebuking the guards; but had said nothing to Joseph, or any one else, although I lay next to him and knew he was awake. On a sudden he arose to his feet, and spoke in a voice of thunder, or as the roaring lion, uttering, as near as I can recollect, the following words:</i><br><br>"SILENCE, ye fiends of the infernal pit. In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you or I die THIS INSTANT!"<br><br><i>He ceased to speak. He stood erect in terrible majesty. Chained, and without a weapon; calm, unruffled and dignified as an angel, he looked upon the quailing guards, whose weapons were lowered or dropped to the ground; whose knees smote together, and who, shrinking into a corner, or crouching at his feet, begged his pardon, and remained quiet till a change of guards.</i>[Parley P. Pratt,<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1950), pp. 210–11; emphasis and capitalization in original]<br><br>Hugh B. Brown tells us:<br><br><i>The man or woman who is guilty of profanity, swearing, or crude slang unwittingly reveals a soiled mind and a limited vocabulary, and is pitied and shunned by all cultured people. Profaning the name of God is an affront to him, and he has forbidden it.</i>[Hugh B. Brown,<i>The Abundant Life</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965), p. 65]<br><br>And Spencer W. Kimball has said:<br><br><i>Profanity displays poverty of language. We note the increasing coarseness of language and understand how Lot must have felt when he was, according to Peter, "vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked." (2 Peter 2:7.) We wonder why those of coarse and profane conversation, even if they refuse obedience to God's will, are so stunted mentally that they let their capacity to communicate grow more and more narrow. Language is like music; we rejoice in beauty, range, and quality in both, and we are demeaned by the repetition of a few sour notes.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 199]<br><br>The fifth danger zone or misuse of language, and perhaps the most pernicious of all, is that of verbal abuse. This can range from serious teasing to unjust criticism to mean-spirited and even hateful accusations. Ironically, verbal abuse usually occurs among people who are supposed to love each other: parents and children, husbands and wives, and close friends. We know that the broken bones from sticks and stones can heal much faster and more permanently than the broken spirits from words that can and do hurt a great deal. "The stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue" (Apocrypha, Ecclesiasticus 28:17–18). Name-calling, belittling, criticizing, sarcasm, and other similar tactics can cause mental scars that are difficult to erase. Sometimes people who feel that they are in a position of authority or responsibility believe it is their duty to correct a child, a spouse, a friend, or a student. This may be true, but the response should not be Draconian. The outcome is rarely productive and usually results in a loss of self-esteem. Sometimes it becomes necessary to say painful things to other people--for example, when conveying unpleasant realities or tragic news. But far too often painful things are said that are completely unnecessary. The results can be devastating.<br><br>In an October 1991 conference talk, President Gordon B. Hinckley quoted:<br><br><i>Please remind the brethren that the physical and verbal abuse of women is INEXCUSABLE, NEVER ACCEPTABLE, AND A COWARDLY WAY OF DEALING WITH DIFFERENCES, especially and particularly despicable if the abuser is a priesthood holder.</i>["Our Solemn Responsibilities,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 50; capitalization in original]<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson remarked in an earlier general conference talk:<br><br><i>What does it mean to love someone with all your heart? It means to love with all your emotional feelings and with all your devotion. Surely when you love your wife with all your heart, you cannot demean her, criticize her, find fault with her, or abuse her by words, sullen behavior, or actions.</i>["To the Fathers in Israel,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 50]<br><br>And on another occasion President Benson said, "A priesthood holder who would curse his wife, abuse her with words or actions, or do the same to one of his own children is guilty of grievous sin" ("What Manner of Men Ought We to Be?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1983, p. 42).<br><br>Recent research has uncovered some disturbing facts about verbal abuse. For example, many people who are guilty of verbal abuse do not feel that they are being abusive. They think that their behavior is acceptable. Perhaps they grew up in an abusive environment and simply assumed this was normal. The second finding was that many victims of verbal abuse eventually begin to believe, at least in part, the horrible things that are being said about them. They feel that they deserve the treatment they are receiving. And finally, many abuse victims reported that the experience of verbal abuse was even worse than that of physical abuse (see Patricia Evans,<i>Verbal Abuse Survivors Speak Out</i>[Adams Media Corporation, 1993], pp. 27, 32–33, 122).<br><br>I think that we need to have a clear understanding of what is meant in the Doctrine and Covenants when we are told that we should reprove "betimes with sharpness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:43). This in no way gives license to vent our anger on someone who in our eyes has done something wrong. In the two preceding verses we read about long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned, kindness, pure knowledge, and being without hypocrisy and without guile. And we are told that we should only reprove "when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–43).<br><br>Most of us wander into these five danger zones of language at various times during our lives. I confess that I do. We become so accomplished in speaking that we sometimes fail to think about what we are saying. Perhaps if we concentrate on the good we can accomplish through language, we will be less likely to misuse it. I like the counsel attributed to the late Mother Teresa: "Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless." If it is so easy to speak kind words, why don't we do it more often? I think it's fine to tell people to have a nice day, but I think it is even better to tell them other things that will make a contribution to that end. We don't have to be sugary and insincere, but I think that we can frequently find honest, simple, pleasant things to say to those around us. You will recall that the Savior said that the "things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart" (Matthew 15:18), just as the hymn reminds us, "Kind words are sweet tones of the heart" ("Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 232). And from Proverbs: "Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones" (Proverbs 16:24).<br><br>I believe that the way we use language is closely related to how we keep the commandment to love one another. We can tell a spouse or a child that we love them, but we can show that love much more convincingly in the way we speak to them. The same goes for other people, for whom it may not be appropriate to say "I love you," but whom we are expected to love nonetheless. It seems to be the nature of some people to be cautious about how kindly they speak to other people--withholding compliments, congratulations, and expressions of gratitude, perhaps in the fear that they might somehow diminish themselves in the process. In fact, it is a measure of spiritual maturity to demonstrate love to other people through the language we use. We need to remember to praise, encourage, compliment, and edify at suitable times as we speak to other people. We need to apologize and ask forgiveness when appropriate. We all know the positive effect that kind words can have on us. We should all do our part to keep the process in motion--even initiate it.<br><br>Just as we are what we say, we are also what we hear and read. A child learns language through hearing it spoken by others. As adults we never stop learning our native language, and much of what we learn depends on what we allow ourselves to be exposed to. As we admit language into our lives in the way of television, movies, books, magazines, musical lyrics, even the circle of friends we associate with, what effect is it having on us? Do we sometimes have an uncomfortable feeling that the type of language we are hearing or reading is replete with vocabulary that we personally would not want to use ourselves? If we are exposed to inappropriate language on a regular basis, we soon become more comfortable with it and it begins to creep into our own vocabulary. We need to exercise good judgment in selecting the type of media that we are exposed to. Let me make a few suggestions.<br><br>A good first choice is obviously the scriptures. I must confess that I have struggled with maintaining a regular scripture-reading schedule, but when I succeed it is always a source of personal satisfaction. Much of the reward I find in reading the scriptures is the spirit I feel.<br><br>A number of years ago I was a young assistant professor living in Ithaca, New York. I had been asked to be on a committee for the Modern Language Association that was scheduled to meet soon at Pennsylvania State University. The association was going to pay all of the expenses, and I thought I was pretty hot stuff. But the first part of the trip was a disaster. The small commuter plane I took almost hit a herd of deer when it was landing. My luggage was lost. I had to wait an unusually long time for the shuttle to the hotel. A sudden storm caused a power outage in the city, and the hotel had no electricity. Even though my expenses were to be paid, I learned while checking in that I was expected to pay for the hotel and my meals in advance, then be reimbursed later. I had brought very little money.<br><br>After checking in I went to my dark room and sat on the bed, feeling sorry for myself. The storm had cleared and the rays of the setting sun came through my window and provided sufficient light for me to see a Gideon Bible lying on a nightstand next to the bed. I opened it up and immediately saw the verse in Matthew 11:28: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I immediately felt much better, but I also felt ashamed, because I knew that the Savior probably had more serious cases in mind than lost luggage and a power outage. But the message was appreciated. The scriptures can teach and enlighten us, and we should make them a part of our daily lives. We should feast on the words of the Lord frequently.<br><br>In a devotional talk two weeks ago, President Thomas S. Monson encouraged us to learn the words to our Church hymns and think about them as we sing (BYU devotional, 10 March 1998). It is possible to sing all of the verses of a hymn and be stirred by the beautiful music but hardly think about the message. The texts of our hymns are poetry--some of the most beautiful and uplifting that we can experience. Elder Boyd K. Packer reminds us that our LDS hymns "teach of the ministry of our Lord, our Redeemer. We sing reverently of His Crucifixion, His sacrifice for our sins, His Resurrection, His Atonement, His Ascension" ("The Peaceable Followers of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1998, p. 62).<br><br>While I was serving a mission in Germany, I was assigned for a few months with another elder to travel around the mission. On one Sunday evening in April we were driving from Nürnberg to a small town to the north. We had attended a district conference that afternoon, and we were both in good spirits. But we were also tired, and it was getting dark. I was driving and decided to turn on the car radio to help me stay alert. Immediately the car was filled with the sound of the Tabernacle Choir singing "O My Father." I was stunned. The station happened to be that of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio Network, and the program was called "Hymns from Home." They had no idea how accurate that was. The music of this hymn is beautiful, but on that night it was the poetry of Eliza R. Snow that captured my spirit: "For a wise and glorious purpose / Thou hast placed me here on earth" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292). It was a stirring spiritual experience.<br><br>In a few days we will have the privilege of listening to our Church leaders at general conference. I encourage you to avail yourselves of this extraordinary opportunity. I recall the feeling I had after the Sunday afternoon session of the October 1997 general conference. I was ablaze with enthusiasm--a word whose literal meaning is "inspired by God." As I thought about it, I realized that I had heard very little that I had not already heard before. But I appreciated the reminders, the examples, the encouragement, the admonitions, the expressions of love, and the fervent testimonies of the speakers. It was good for me to reflect on their words and think about my life. Through the<i>Ensign,</i>the<i>New Era,</i>and other Church publications, we also have the opportunity to read about the gospel and its promise.<br><br>There are, of course, countless other sources of good language that can enrich our lives: the great literature of the ages, books that help us better understand our world and the universe, books on the creative accomplishments of humanity, histories, and biographies of great people. Unfortunately, there is so much genuinely good reading material that none of us can begin to devour even a small part of it in a lifetime. Why then do so many people choose to spend their valuable time reading books and magazines that detract from the Spirit instead of nourishing it? Mark Twain wisely said, "The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them" (in Lederer,<i>The Miracle,</i>p. 131). It is similar for the kind of television programs and movies we choose to see. There are good offerings to select from, but there are too many that contain language that would probably cause Brother Parley P. Pratt to be "disgusted, shocked, horrified, and ... filled with the spirit of indignant justice."<br><br>I spoke earlier about the miracle of learning our mother tongue. How much more miraculous it is to learn a second and even third language. Many of you have done this, and I encourage you to maintain some level of proficiency in your newly acquired tongue. Read the scriptures, seek out occasions to converse with others, listen to recordings, and attend advanced classes to learn more about the literature, culture, and linguistic elements of the language. Those of you who have not learned another language may yet have this opportunity. You will never know when your ability to converse in a second language may be a source of blessings to other people.<br><br>Imagine the wonderful challenge the Church has faced during the past 10 or so years as the word of the gospel has been brought to the people of Eastern Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world. The scriptures, missionary materials, manuals, and much more must be translated into these languages. At the same time, new converts are coming into the Church who speak these languages, and missionaries are now learning to speak them. Think of the increasingly rich linguistic resources we are developing. Let me give you a vivid illustration. There are more than 750 languages spoken among the people of Africa. Some of these are tribal languages spoken by a relatively small number of people, but African language experts say that there are more than 80 so-called "critical" African languages. The Church is doing much of its missionary work in Africa today using French and English, but there are many local missionaries who are teaching the gospel in the local languages. The Church is currently preparing translations of scriptures and other materials for 10 African languages, including Afrikaans, Akan, Amharic, Igbo, Malagasy, Shona, Swahili, Tswana, Xhosa, and Zulu. This is a wonderful beginning, but it is only a beginning.<br><br>In conclusion I would like once again to quote from Richard Lederer's book<i>The Miracle of Language:</i><br><br><i>We give thanks for language--the human essence, the skin of thought, more to the mind than light is to the eye.</i><br><br><i>May we try not only to talk, but to say something; not only to hear, but to listen; not only to write, but to communicate.</i><br><br><i>May our thoughts and aspirations become words that serve to build bridges from mind to mind and from heart to heart, creating a fellowship of those who would hold fast to that which is good.</i>[Lederer,<i>The Miracle,</i>p. 243]<br><br>Watch your language! It is a tool far more powerful than you can possibly imagine. Think of the good you can accomplish by using it in the way that the Lord has intended. For this I pray in the name of him who was called the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Randall L.

<h1>cause He First Loved Us:&quot; Children and Family Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the early chapters of Mosiah, King Benjamin asked his son to gather the people to the temple so that the king could address them. Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land, and great numbers of people assembled. As they arrived, they pitched their tents round about with the doors facing the temple. The people were organized by family with father, mother, children, and grandchildren grouped together. (See Mosiah 2:5–6.) In every dispensation of time, the family and home have been recognized as the basic unit in the kingdom and the foundation of a righteous life. It was no less in Nephite days.<br><br>During his discourse King Benjamin counseled parents with regard to their duties. He advised them of their responsibility to feed and clothe their little ones and to teach their children the commandments and help them live peaceably with each other. He then concluded that part of the speech with the theme chosen for this conference. His conclusion referred to the higher law and presented the greatest responsibility and challenge that parents have. From Mosiah 4:15 we read: "Ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another."<br><br>King Benjamin's counsel is similar to that given by the Lord in our day when he revealed that parents in Zion are to teach their children gospel principles and should teach them "to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 68:25–28). You may remember that the Lord chastised the Prophet Joseph Smith and other brethren because they had not taught their "children light and truth," and he instructed them to set their houses in order (D&amp;amp;C 93:42–50). Parents, enlightened by the gospel, are under the Lord's command to exemplify and teach their children the fundamentals of the gospel. And the greatest commandment is to "love one another" as Jesus loves us (John 13:34–35). Teaching begins at birth and is especially important in the early years when children are impressionable and feelings and patterns of behavior are formed.<br><br>In rare cases children learn to love others in spite of parental behavior and inadequate teaching. Generally, however, the lessons are learned best in a home where parents love each other and express love for their children. President McKay stated that a home to be worthy of its name must be characterized by love. He said:<br><br><i>Every home has both body and spirit. You may have a beautiful house, with all the decorations that modern art can give, or wealth bestow. You may have all the outward forms that will please the eye, and yet not have a home. It is not home without love. It may be a hovel, a log hut, a tent, a wikeup, if you have the right spirit within, the true love of Christ, and love for one another--fathers and mothers for the children, children for parents, husband and wife for each other--you have the true life of the home that Latter-day Saints build, and which they are striving to establish.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1907, p. 63]<br><br>Most, if not all, agree that love is the key ingredient in child development. From where does love come? Is it a divine inheritance? Is it a gift of the Spirit and, therefore, a function of a righteous life? Can it be learned? Can we acquire it from others? Is an understanding of the plan of salvation important to the development of love? Are service and sacrifice key requirements in its cultivation? I believe the answer to each question is "yes!"<br><br>I wish to discuss four ways in which parents can teach their children to love and serve one another. The first is for parents to magnify their divine inheritance by exemplifying love and service to each other and to their children. The second is to teach children the gospel emphasizing the making and keeping of baptismal, priesthood, and temple covenants. The third is to provide opportunities for sons and daughters to serve. The fourth is to teach children the meaning of the Atonement. Although this last step is an integral part of the second (i.e., teaching the gospel), the Atonement is the greatest act of love and service in the history of mankind, and a testimony of the Savior's redemptive role generates humility, faith, repentance, and love.<br><h2><b>The Influence of Parental Love</b></h2><br>Moses taught that men and women are created in God's image. Genesis reads: "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (Genesis 1:27). Paul taught the Athenians at Mars' Hill that we are God's offspring (see Acts 17:29). Men and women, sons and daughters of deity, inherit divine attributes in embryo. The consummate attribute is charity, or the pure love of Christ. Consequently, each of us has within our soul a seed that, if nourished, will sprout into warm, intense feelings for parents, brothers and sisters, our children, the Savior, and others. The question is: "How is the seed nourished so that it will flower and grow?"<br><br>The key relationship in a family is that between husband and wife. President James E. Faust stated: "The relationship between husband and wife is the linchpin . . . in the whole family relationship" ("Psychotherapists: Love Your Wives,"<i>AMCAP Journal</i>16, no. 1 [1990]: 53). The dictionary defines a linchpin as "a locking pin inserted in the end of a shaft . . . a central or cohesive element" (<i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,</i>p. 759). It holds everything together.<br><br>The husband-wife relationship is key in the development of children, as the mother and father play a pivotal role in modeling appropriate behavior and nurturing children's feelings. Love between the father and mother establishes identity and self-respect in children. In contrast, a child's identity and feelings of security are threatened when parents argue and condemn one another. President McKay often repeated the saying, "A father can do no greater thing for his children than to let them feel that he loves their mother" (see<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 201). In the home children experience the bonds of love when they see and feel their father's affection for their mother and the mother's genuine concern for the father. When a husband shows respect for his wife, children learn respect for parents and for each other.<br><br>Another key relationship in the home is that between parents and children. The finest example of love is the mother's love for her children--a divine inheritance. President James E. Faust stated: "I am also sorry that I have not sooner appreciated the great sublime, unique gifts which our wives inherit from divinity. I speak of their womanly intuitions and their six senses, and their steadfast faith and capacity to love" ("Psychotherapists," p. 53).<br><br>If a woman has any degree of spiritual maturity, there is an instinctive love for her newborn child. She sees the infant as a prized gift from eternity, and the intensity of her feelings is almost overwhelming. She has passed near death to bring the newborn into the world and would sacrifice her own life to protect it. In the early years the infant's dependence bonds the mother and child to each other. There is a spiritual dimension to the bonding.<br><br>Recently a young woman contemplating marriage asked my daughter, a married woman with five children, what it was like being a mother. In particular, she asked, "What do you do all day?" She wanted a description of a typical day in a mother's life. The question bothered my daughter because it missed the essence of motherhood. My daughter told the young woman: "You can follow me around all day and do the same tasks, but you will not have the same experience! You will be performing physical tasks but miss out on the spiritual dimension of motherhood that makes all the difference."<br><br>As a child develops and the dependence lessens, the love or intense, affectionate concern for a son or daughter does not diminish but takes on new dimensions. Often there is less concern for the physical but more consideration for the emotional, spiritual, and intellectual challenges. Still, physical needs are always part of the picture.<br><br>A few weeks ago, while attending a stake conference in California, Sister Bateman and I listened to a new convert bear witness of the love she has for her son as well as for the Restoration and the healing power of the priesthood. Her introduction to the missionaries was unusual, and her story illustrates the powerful love of a mother for her young boy. The relevant portion of the sister's testimony is as follows:<br><br><i>It began last year when my son shattered his arm. We were told that it would be months before we would know if he would ever . . . use it again. We were devastated. There is nothing more painful than seeing your child suffer.</i><br><br><i>The day after Sean came home from the hospital, I saw two missionaries walking by our house. I knew Mormons were good people with strong faith, so I asked if they would come in and pray for my son.</i><br><br><i>They gave him a blessing with oil. I could feel the power of the Spirit in the room. Within days we began to see signs of improvement! Even the doctor was amazed.</i><br><br><i>The missionaries would stop by regularly to see how Sean's arm was doing. We would talk about this miracle and about God. The Spirit was always strong when we would talk. I told them that I did not intend on becoming a Mormon and was afraid I was wasting their time. They assured me it was not a problem. They continued to stop by, and we began the discussions. I could not deny the spirit that was with us each night as we held discussions.</i><br><br><i>I still had doubts. I would ask them, "How do I know that the Book of Mormon is true? How do I know it is not just a good book?"</i><br><br><i>The missionaries said, "Don't take our word for it. Pray and ask God if it is true. He cannot lead you astray. Ask with a sincere heart and real intent." They wrote a note in my book that said "read/ponder/pray."</i><br><br><i>I prayed and read, and, later, as I lay pondering this question, a very powerful sensation filled my chest. It startled me. It was a very physical, very tangible experience. This physical sensation was accompanied by a spiritual enlightenment as well. Nothing else would have been able to cut through my doubt. This experience was very moving.</i><br><br><i>I was afraid the missionaries might think I was a little strange when I told them about this experience, but they opened their books to scriptures that described my experience exactly and indicated that the next step was to be baptized.</i>[Letter and testimony received from Laura L. MacKenzie on March 4, 1998]<br><br>The good sister had a number of challenges to overcome before she was baptized, but the divine light within and her conversion experience more than compensated for the roadblocks placed in her way. My purpose in telling the story relates to the mother's feelings for her son and the motivating power unleashed by her love. The mother had seen missionaries before but had never sought their help or even engaged them in conversation. From her statement one may assume that faithful LDS members had crossed her path. She, too, was a woman of faith. She believed in the power of prayer. And just as Cornelius was prompted by the Holy Ghost to seek help from Peter (see Acts 10), this good woman undoubtedly received a spiritual prompting to approach the missionaries.<br><br>But where did the courage come from to heed the prompting? The mother's special love combined with despair for her son's health provided the strength to move beyond the normal boundaries that circumscribed her actions. The intense concern for the son caused her to seek help from two strangers. Would this woman have approached the missionaries if the crushed arm had been her own? Perhaps, but not likely. The intense feelings inherited and developed for her son were the motivating force. The son's suffering gnawed at the mother's heartstrings. She was concerned about the boy's future. Would it include a lifeless limb? Would a useless arm inhibit him in other ways? Her concerns transcended her reluctance.<br><br>The intense, affectionate concerns of a parent for a child, especially a mother's deep feelings for her offspring, are a divine inheritance. They are part of the light brought from the premortal world. Since light responds to light, the divine spark of love in the heart of a child is lit by the candle flame burning brightly within the soul of a mother or father.<br><br>Another important relationship in a family is that between children themselves. Often an older brother or sister will come to the aid of a younger sibling in a show of love and concern. If there is any doubt about love as a divine inheritance, consider a brief<i>Reader's Digest</i>story shared by Sister Sharon G. Larsen at the recent Young Women conference. The story is about<br><br><i>twin girls, Brielle and Kyrie, who were born prematurely. "They were placed in separate incubators to reduce the risk of infection. Kyrie, the larger sister at two pounds three ounces, quickly began gaining weight and calmly slept. But Brielle, who weighed only two pounds at birth, could not keep up with her."</i><br><br><i>Sister Larsen said Brielle's condition became critical as her oxygen intake plummeted and her heart rate soared. "Then the nurse remembered a procedure she had heard about. The parents consented, and the nurse slipped the squirming baby into the incubator with the bigger sister. No sooner had the door of the incubator closed than Brielle snuggled up to Kyrie and calmed right down. Within minutes Brielle's blood-oxygen readings were the best they had been since she was born. As she dozed, Kyrie wrapped her tiny arm around her smaller sibling."</i>["Protect Families from Anger, Strife,"<i>Church News,</i>4 April 1998, p. 5]<br><br>One might argue that the relationship formed in the womb was the reason why Brielle snuggled up to her sister and why Kyrie wrapped her arm around her smaller twin. Even then, the bonding reflects a divine spark in both children that reaches back into the eternities.<br><h2><b>The Righteous Life and Love as a Fruit of the Spirit</b></h2><br>In addition to exposing children to parental love and love from others, the Lord has established a second way to increase children's sensitivity and concern. It is for parents to teach gospel principles and guide their children in living righteously. The attribute of love brought from the first estate will then be added upon by the Holy Ghost. The apostle Paul states that love is a fruit of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22). Gifts from the Holy Spirit are conditional. One must strive to live righteously in order to enjoy blessings from this member of the Godhead (see D&amp;amp;C 46:9). Alma told his son Shiblon, "Bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love" (Alma 38:11–12). This lesson is particularly important for teenagers who mistake passion for love. In speaking of the presumption made by some teenagers about love, President Hinckley's words are appropriate: "Their expression may sound genuine, but their coin is counterfeit" (<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,</i>p. 316).<br><br>It is important for parents to teach children about covenants, to help them understand two-way promises. Children should understand the basics of their promises to the Lord and the Lord's promises to them before they participate in an ordinance. It is important to note that every covenant includes a promise to serve others. In the baptismal covenant a young boy or girl promises to bear others' burdens, to mourn with and comfort those in need, and to stand as a witness of God (see Mosiah 18:8–10). In exchange the Lord promises to remit sins, provide the Holy Ghost as a companion, and open the door to the celestial kingdom (see 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&amp;amp;C 20:37, John 3:3–8). Parents should teach their children about the obligation they have taken upon themselves and provide appropriate opportunities for children to serve in the home, family, neighborhood, and church.<br><br>The oath and covenant of the priesthood requires faithfulness of young and not-so-young men if they are to receive it, and then the holder is expected to magnify his priesthood callings. Faithfulness requires service to others. Callings entail service to others. To magnify or enlarge one's calling suggests greater and greater service. In exchange the Lord opens the door to eternal life and to all that he has (D&amp;amp;C 84:34–41; 88:21; 124:28, 34, 42).<br><br>Multiple promises are made in the temple endowment. Two, in particular, are directly linked to service. The first is a willingness to sacrifice in order to build the kingdom, and the second is a pledge to consecrate one's time and resources to the Lord. Young men and women should be prepared by parents and Church leaders to enter into these promises before participating in the endowment. One sign of their readiness would be a history of faithful payment of tithes and offerings. Other signs would be fulfillment of home teaching assignments by young men and completion of service projects by young women as outlined in their Personal Progress program. Another sign would be participation in temple ordinances wherein young people also learn to serve others.<br><h2><b>Teaching Children to Love Through Service</b></h2><br>Love and service are interdependent. Acts of service are reflections of the heart, but those acts also serve to deepen one's feelings. Service rendered others is, in large measure, determined by the feelings we have for them. But the more we serve, the greater is our love. The patriarch Jacob's love for Rachel was reflected in his willingness to serve her father, Laban, for years. When Jacob received Rachel's hand, the scriptures record: "They seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her" (Genesis 29:20). I suspect, also, that his love deepened as a result of his many years of service. She became even more precious to him.<br><br>This same cycle occurs in the mission field. The great blessing of a mission is that it teaches young men and women to love and to serve. It instills within them and solidifies the meaning of love. Have you ever heard a missionary say that his or her mission is the best in the world? In our family I tell my children that the British Mission is the only real mission. My eldest son tells me I am wrong. The best mission is Canada Montreal, where true Quebecois is spoken. My second son says that we are both wrong. It is Japan Tokyo North. The Japanese people are the greatest in the world. My third son tells us that it is unfortunate that Russia was not open to missionary work when we were called. The Russian people are the best. From his vantage point, the greatest missionary experiences are to be found in the Russia Moscow and Russia Novosibirsk Missions. My fourth son tells his older brothers and me that the finest people in all the world are found in the Spain Malaga Mission. Their Spanish is pure and the culture is wonderful. And when you find converts, they are the best. Finally, my daughter Melisa says, "You men are all wrong! The greatest mission is Argentina Cordoba!"<br><br>Why do almost all missionaries, upon their return, feel they served in the best mission and among the best people on earth? Because the Holy Ghost blessed them with the gift of love as they worked hard and served faithfully (see D&amp;amp;C 4, Galatians 5:22). In other words, the Holy Spirit planted in their hearts special feelings for the people as they met with and taught them. Can you imagine a missionary being an effective teacher if he disliked the people or was indifferent in his feelings? The Holy Ghost softens the missionary's heart and becomes a true companion to those who are faithful and hardworking.<br><br>As a stake president a few years ago, I asked each homecoming missionary to tell me about his or her mission. If they began with the words "It's the greatest mission on earth!" I knew they had served faithfully and had received the special gift to which they were entitled.<br><br>It is no different today than in Book of Mormon times. When Ammon went among the Lamanites to begin his mission, he was captured and taken to the king. King Lamoni inquired of Ammon "if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites." Ammon replied, "Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die" (Alma 17:22–23). Although Ammon did not spend the rest of his life in Lamanite country, he did spend his remaining days serving the people. Following his mission he was told by the Lord to lead his converts to safety. He took them back to Zarahemla, where they were eventually given the land of Jershon and became the people of Ammon.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that although a missionary returns home, he often leaves his heart in the mission field. Feelings of love for those served linger long after the mission is completed. The cycle of love begetting service and service increasing love is not unique to the mission field, but this circular process coupled with testimony is the basis of successful missionary work and a successful life.<br><h2><b>Love, Service, and the Atonement of Christ</b></h2><br>The greatest act of love and service in the history of mankind is the atoning sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. In Jesus' explanation to Nicodemus of the path one takes to obtain eternal life, he said, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). It was an act in which the most intense, affectionate concern was shown for the entire human family. The Father had promised his spirit children in the premortal world that he would provide a way for them to return to his presence following an earthly sojourn. Agency was part of the inheritance; he knew we would sin, and a cleansing and sanctifying process was required.<br><br>The "way" was an infinite and eternal sacrifice (see Alma 34:10, 14). Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). The Son was willing to "bleed at every pore," to experience sins and "pains and afflictions and temptations" of all mankind in order to know how to succor us in the flesh, to "draw" us to him so that the Father could lift us up (D&amp;amp;C 19:18, Alma 7:11–12, 3 Nephi 27:14–15). The eternal nature of the Atonement's depth is matched by its infinite breadth.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell calls the Atonement "the greatest act of service in all of history" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 63). On another occasion he termed it "the central fact of human history" (<i>Behold, I Say unto You, I Cannot Say the Smallest Part Which I Feel</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973], p. 44). In still other settings he has called it the "eternal linchpin," i.e., the event that ties together the premortal, mortal, and postmortal worlds and makes eternal life possible (Meetings in Japan and Korea, 1993–94). It is the central event upon which every righteous outcome depends. The Atonement is the key message of every prophet in every dispensation. Most principles, laws, ordinances, miracles, and covenants given by the Lord are types and shadows of the Atonement and illustrate its dimensions and impact (see 2 Nephi 11:4).<br><br>As the Last Supper was coming to a close and just prior to the experience in Gethsemane, Jesus offered a prayer in behalf of his disciples. At the beginning he stated that the process of obtaining eternal life is one of coming to know the Father and the Son (see John 17:3). Ultimately, in order to know a person, one must become like them. The apostle John records:<br><br><i>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. . . .</i><br><br><i>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him.</i>[1 John 2:3, 3:2]<br><br>I firmly believe that the more we know about his life and, in particular, the Atonement, the more we will love him, desire to keep his commandments, and appreciate what he has done for us. In the process we will be blessed with his divine attributes. Our faith in him will increase; we will be true to the trust he has given us; we will enjoy an inner strength to control our desires; our capacity to endure will grow; our bodies and spirits will become sanctified by the Holy Spirit; and our love for those around us and, eventually, for all of God's children will increase. As we acquire these characteristics, we will be, in Peter's words, "neither . . . barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:3–8).<br><br>Parents should use the scriptures to teach their children, young and old, about the Savior. We hope that our children and youth will know that Abel sacrificed the firstlings of the flock as a reminder that Jesus is the firstborn in the spirit and the first to be resurrected (see Genesis 4:4; John 1:1; Colossians 1:15, 18). We hope that our people will recognize the Israelite sacrifice of the "lamb without blemish" as a symbol of Christ's offering for sin and his innocence and perfect character (1 Peter 1:19; see also Exodus 12:5). The manna from heaven provided for the children of Israel should remind us that Christ is the bread of life and that through him we receive the food of eternal life (see Exodus 16:15, John 6:32–35). Moses smiting the rock to obtain water for Israel teaches us that Christ is the fountain of life, and his living water (the gospel) quenches our thirst forever (see Exodus 17:6, John 4:7–14). The blood of Israel's sacrificial lambs reminds us that Christ bled from every pore in Gethsemane and that his blood was spilled on the cross as the price for our sins (see Exodus 12:21, 24:8; Luke 22:44; D&amp;amp;C 19:18).<br><br>The brass serpent Moses raised in the wilderness was a representation of Christ being raised upon the cross. Moses promised Israel that they would live if they would look upon the brass serpent after having been bitten by the poisonous snakes. In like manner, those who exercise faith in Christ by looking upon him as their Savior are promised life everlasting, for they will be cleansed of the venomous subtleties and poisons of the serpent that slithered in the first garden (see Genesis 3:1–4, John 3:14–15).<br><br>The apostle John states that Jesus turned water into "good" wine at the marriage feast in Cana "and manifested forth his glory" (John 2:10–11). The glory of the Father and Son is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). How does the changing of water to wine show forth the Savior's glory? Through the Atonement of Christ, his "good blood" changes God's children from mortals to immortals, from corruptible to incorruptible beings. The apostle Paul told the Corinthians that we are "sown in corruption [but] raised in incorruption: . . . sown in dishonour [but] raised in glory: . . . sown in weakness [but] raised in power" (1 Corinthians 15:42–43). Just as the house of Israel drank "the pure blood of the grape" in remembrance of their rock of salvation (Deuteronomy 32:14–15) and the revelers at the marriage feast were provided with the best wine, so we also drink the sacramental water as a reminder that the best blood spilled in Gethsemane and on Calvary has the power to lift and perfect us.<br><br>The greatest act of love in the history of the world is the atoning sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. The Atonement reveals the intense feelings of both the Father and the Son for all mankind. As a type, one might think of Abraham's and Isaac's feelings on Mount Moriah. Jesus taught Nicodemus about the Father's love: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" (John 3:16). And Jesus taught the Twelve about his own love: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:12–13). If we and our children learn about the Lord's life and sacrifice, we will love him "because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19).<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>It&#039;s Always a Possibility! - Wendy L. Watson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During the Saturday afternoon general conference session, I was moved as I watched President Hinckley during one of the congregational hymns. He turned right around and looked at our BYU combined choir--for the longest time. It was not just a brief glance. He stood there gazing. It seemed that he was surveying and studying each student. President Hinckley is the prophet of the Lord. He knows who you as BYU students are. He knows your goodness. He knows your greatness. It struck me that the Lord's prophet is counting on you.<br><br>Teaching is a privilege anywhere, but to teach at BYU with you as students who are filled with light and the love of learning and of your fellowmen--well, it just doesn't get much better than that for me as a professor. So even though I want to offer you some ideas about change today, there are many things I hope you will never change. Let me tell you a few:<br><br>• Please don't change your goodness--your deep core goodness.<br><br>• Please don't change being a cut above any other student body in the land. I believe it. It's true. You are amazing--not perfect, but amazing.<br><br>• Please don't change that light in your eyes.<br><br>• Please don't change how much you want to help each other. Even when I hear distress stories about roommates and family members, the distress flows from wanting to have connections with each other that just aren't happening.<br><br>• Please don't change your love of the Lord.<br><br>• Please don't change your courage to do so many seemingly impossible things.<br><br>• Please don't change your desire to keep improving.<br><br>• Please don't change your desire for change.<br><br>So, let's talk about change. I love change! I love it. I'll admit it. I'm passionate about it. Actually, I'm just plain wild about change! I'm professionally committed to it--and personally enamored by it. Professionally I try to facilitate it and study it, and I love to participate in it. Personally, I advocate it, seek after it, and, basically, am in awe of it.<br><br>Personally and professionally I am a detective of change. I want to discover change when everyone else says there is none present nor possible. I guess that's as close as I come to my Sherlock Holmes name of "Dr. Watson."<br><br>For 25 years I have had the privilege of working with other seekers of change--they go by the title of "clients": individuals, couples, and families who want change. They want something to be different in their lives.<br><br>I'm not sure when my love of change commenced, but I still remember the thrill that accompanied one of the first big changes in my life: the change of advancing from riding a tricycle to riding a bicycle. The brief sinking feeling that accompanied my awareness that my Dad had let go of the back of my bike and was no longer running alongside and holding me up was quickly replaced by exhilaration. I was riding a two-wheeler--all by myself! A few wobbles on the heavily graveled road and I was off! I could go further, faster. My world suddenly got bigger.<br><br>I loved this change. And I loved the exhilaration that accompanied this change. A change in the number of wheels on my vehicle changed my speed, changed what I could explore, changed even my view of myself. I was all grown up now--or so I thought. And I loved those changes.<br><br>My progression to a bicycle was a change that involved much more than a decrease in wheels. It involved moving forward in my life--and realizing that my Dad believed I could move forward, even forward faster than I thought I could. I was embracing something new I'd never tried before. Riding a bicycle didn't feel anything like riding a tricycle. It felt more like flying!<br><br>When I advanced from two-wheeling it on a bicycle to two-wheeling it on a brand-new blue Honda 50, I was in ecstasy. By paying for half of this marvelous flying machine, this change in mode of transportation brought increased responsibility into my life. This change also brought increased confidence, increased vulnerability, and increased possibilities--all part of the wonderful world of change.<br><br>My blue Honda 50 introduced me to another world: the world of men. I met a young man with a red Suzuki. Think of that: a red Suzuki and a blue Honda--now this was true, everlasting love. Well, at least for a summer--and then all that changed.<br><br>There have been times when change seemed to push itself into my life--totally uninvited. When I was nine years old, my baby brother, David, was born on the first day of fall classes--September 1. After school I walked all over town with a Polaroid picture of David clasped in my hands, knocking on doors, asking neighbors if they wanted to see my brand-new baby brother. When I returned home I learned how quickly things can change. David had died, having lived only 8.5 hours. That was a change I never anticipated. But with that change, my understanding of life and death changed as my grandmother talked to me in my bedroom that afternoon about the reality of life after death. This new understanding of life, now situated in the reality of my baby brother's death, and the increasing reality of eternal life, slowly loosened the grip that grief had on my nine-year-old heart--grief arising from this unanticipated change.<br><br>There have been times when I anticipated change and change did not happen--like the times when I was so certain about a change in my last name corresponding with a change in my marital status. I said "yes" to several young men--sequentially, I might add--who posed the question "Wilt thou?" And I wilted! Unfortunately, on those occasions I responded to those young men before I really sought the Lord's opinion. However, upon hearing the Lord's voice, I followed his counsel and ended those relationships. I've learned to seek the voice of the Lord a bit sooner since then.<br><br>What are the changes that you have experienced in your life? Which ones were invited and anticipated? Which were anticipated yet never materialized? Which were uninvited yet marvelous? Which were uninvited and soul-wrenching?<br><br>Change is always happening. Change requires much of us, and change changes us. How have you responded to the changes in your life? Think of a change that came into your life, uninvited, that you did not want and that was soul-wrenching. How did you respond to it: by turning toward the Lord and drawing closer to him or by turning away?<br><br>I've had the privilege of observing the responses of many people to these difficult situations. Let's consider just a few:<br><br>A father commits suicide. His daughter is angry at God and turns away from him, believing that the Lord and her father have both deserted her.<br><br>A husband commits adultery. Both husband and wife turn toward the Lord for comfort and answers to agonizing questions.<br><br>A mother dies. Her son turns away from the restored gospel and back to old views of God and to his former religion.<br><br>A woman feels a change coming into her life. It doesn't come--at least not when she thought nor as she thought, and she turns to God for the reassurance that all is still well.<br><br>Your best friend marries your fiancé. That change brings about a whole new way of turning to the Lord.<br><br>What are the changes that have influenced your life? You've heard the old adage: "The only thing you can count on for sure is that things will change." Some of you may say that you can't handle one more change in your life right now. Perhaps you've experienced too much change in a very compressed period of time. Perhaps you are like the young man who returned home from his mission to find that his parents were divorcing, his father was excommunicated, his fiancée welcomed him home with the Dear John letter in hand, all the classes for his major were full, his prospective roommates were moving, and the company he was going to work for had gone bankrupt. When changes like that happen all at once, it can be very difficult to hold on, to go on, without sustaining help from the Lord and from those that the Lord raises up to assist you. Such changes can even threaten your spiritual stability and sense of peace.<br><br>Others of you may be saying: "I could use<i>more</i>change in my life--let's start by adding to the few cents left in my bank account at this point in the semester."<br><br>"I also could use a change of scenery. I'm ready to be up<i>in</i>the mountains, not just looking up<i>at</i>them."<br><br>"Give me a change of activities--I'm tired of studying."<br><br>And maybe some of you are praying for a change of heart--not your own, but your professors'--as they make grade calculations during the next few weeks.<br><br>What change would make the biggest difference in your life at this time? A change in your thinking, your behavior, your feelings? Would you want a change in a relationship or a change that would allow you to<i>have</i>a relationship? A change in the way you see yourself or in the way you believe others see you? A change in your abilities, your qualities? Or do you most desire a change in your nature, or a change of heart?<br><br>Change--and beliefs about change--are all around us. Some people believe that change is not desirable at all or is a totally hopeless pursuit: "Only a wet baby likes change," teases the bumper sticker. "The more things change, the more they remain the same," protests a French saying (Alphonse Karr,<i>Les Guêpes</i>[January 1849]).<br><br>When we find ourselves complaining about the same thing to a friend year after year; when we make the same resolutions every New Year's Eve; when the bathroom scales obnoxiously declare you are still 10 pounds overweight--we may wonder if there is such a thing as change.<br><br>Or we may wonder if<i>real</i>change is truly possible. Yet my teaching, clinical, and research experiences tell me that people desire change, do indeed change, and--more important--change is always occurring.<br><h2><b>Beliefs and Change</b></h2><br>So, how does change occur?<br><br>Through my research with families, I have come to believe that therapeutic change occurs as the belief that is at the heart of the matter is identified, challenged, or solidified (see Lorraine M. Wright, Wendy L. Watson, and Janice M. Bell,<i>Beliefs: The Heart of Healing in Families and Illness</i>[New York: Basic Books, 1996]).<br><br>Ancient Hebrew tradition held that the heart could think. It is the heart-generated and heartfelt thoughts, those affectively saturated cognitions that influence feelings and actions, those beliefs of the heart--even those beliefs in one's deepest heart of hearts--that I am interested in distinguishing, challenging, or solidifying.<br><br>These are the beliefs that matter: The beliefs of the heart that are at the heart of the matter. These are the beliefs that provide the greatest leverage for change. These are core beliefs and can either be constraining or facilitating of change. Facilitating beliefs increase options to finding solutions to problems. Constraining beliefs decrease solution options.<br><br>Let me share with you some constraining beliefs that inhibited change:<br><br>• One couple spent years building walls to protect their hearts, which had been hurt in the midst of an affair. They had walled each other out. They wondered why they felt so lonely and unfulfilled in their marriage. The constraining belief that held each of them captive and prevented them from reaching out to each other at the very time they most needed each other was "I am not loveable and am not worthy of love."<br><br>• A man ruled by anger that oppressed his wife, his children, and himself held to the belief "I am the holder of all truth and light." This constraining belief invited frustration, anger, and unrighteous dominion into his relationships.<br><br>• A young man seeking assistance with his almost lifelong battle with pornography believed "I am weak!"<br><br>• A couple struggled to find new ways of relating with each other after years of silence and suffering. Each felt misunderstood and underappreciated, and each believed "My spouse doesn't care about my feelings and what life in our marriage has been like for me."<br><br>• The widow of a man who won the million-dollar lottery one year and committed suicide the next New Year's Eve believed "I am to blame for my husband's death."<br><br>Each of these constraining beliefs prevented solutions from being found and in most cases invited the belief that a solution was impossible. What beliefs about yourself, others, or life constrain you from taking the next step toward making the changes you desire in your life?<br><br>One belief that consistently constrains change is the belief that "there is only one correct view, and I have it!" Being passionate about your ideas is one thing--even a great thing. Offering your ideas to others and understanding that they may hold different ideas than you do can be the essence of a congenial discussion--even of a discussion that merges into a warm disputation. However,<i>insisting</i>that someone must change their ideas to comply with yours is more than demanding--it is demonic!<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter pointed out the Lord's approach to influencing others:<br><br><i>God's chief way of acting is by persuasion and patience and long-suffering, not by coercion and stark confrontation. He acts by gentle solicitation and by sweet enticement. He always acts with unfailing respect for the freedom and independence that we possess.</i>["The Golden Thread of Choice,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 18]<br><br>One of our hymns sets this same truth to music:<br><br><i>He'll call, persuade, direct aright,<br>And bless with wisdom, love, and light,<br>In nameless ways be good and kind,<br>But never force the human mind.</i><br><br>["Know This, That Every Soul Is Free,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 240]<br><br>You cannot<i>make</i>someone change his/her mind. But you can invite and entice, offer and persuade, and then respect what he/she chooses to do.<br><h2><b>Invitations to Reflection Facilitate Change</b></h2><br>Through clinical research I have found that change is most likely to occur when we are invited to a reflection. Through the process of reflection we can become aware of ourselves and others in a whole new way.<br><br>When I read Alma, I experience him as a man who is passionate about change and a man expert in the art of inviting others to reflect--reflections that increase the likelihood that people will change.<br><br>Just how does Alma invite these change-inducing reflections? One way is through his use of questions. In Alma 5 alone, more than 40 questions are offered--questions like:<br><br><i>Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i>[Alma 5:14, 26]<br><br>Through the process of persistent questioning, Alma invites us to reflect over and over again: on our status with the Lord, on our spiritual growth and development, on things that need to change or have changed--and before we know it our desire for more change increases.<br><br>The next time you want an incredible experience with reflection--to see just what it feels like to be invited and enticed to change, to have your stance of "I'm just fine" or "I can't change" persistently chiseled away at--read Alma chapter 5--maybe several times. Notice how your thoughts about yourself and your possibilities for change are altered through Alma's relentless questioning. I love Alma. I love his devotion to change and I love his use of questions that invite reflection.<br><br>Perhaps you have invited yourself to a reflection lately through the multitude of questions that are on your mind these days. What are the questions that you are asking yourself?<br><br>I am impressed that the questions my clients often ask themselves are variations on:<br><br>• Am I worthy?<br><br>• Have I been forgiven of my sins?<br><br>• Am I clean before the Lord?<br><br>They know that<i>no other change can compensate for failure in this area.</i><br><br>What reflection would allow you to see yourself and perhaps someone else in a different way--a way that would add to your desire for change?<br><br>One husband was invited to reflection and experienced a major wake-up call when he listened to a portion of an audiotape of my therapy session with his wife. She had offered the tape to him because in the session she was able to articulate some of her core beliefs: The belief that he did not see her as equal to him. The belief that nothing she had contributed to their marriage had made a difference to him.<br><br>He telephoned me in deep grief--a deep grief born of a deeper understanding of his wife's pain.<br><br>"I never knew," he said. "I never knew I caused her this much pain."<br><br>His voice is a voice of authority in her life. His words can heal her pain or induce more pain.<br><h2><b>Voices of Authority</b></h2><br>Who are the voices of authority in your life? Which voices really matter to you? Which voices constrain change in your life? Which voices support and sustain the changes you so desire? Are the present voices of authority in your life voices that help you be who you really are? Voices that help you step up and speak right into the microphone about what's really in your heart? Voices attached to ears that really want to hear your voice, your ideas, and encourage you to listen to the voice of the Lord in your life?<br><br>Or are they chiding voices, mocking voices, strident voices? Voices that cleverly call "obedience" a far too simpleminded approach to life? Voices that are so sophisticated in their disparagement of others that you start to believe you are missing something in your own assessments? Voices that move you away from who you really are? Voices that silence your inner voice? Voices that make your voice a stilled, small voice?<br><br>And what if you are the voice of authority in someone else's life? It matters to that person what you think about them. Are you the keeper of some words that would make all the difference in someone else's life? Are you willing to speak the words of healing, comfort, and cheer? Have you already got clues about what someone is longing to hear from you? What would need to be different for you to offer those words--honestly, and from your heart?<br><br>As the voice of authority in someone else's life, have you unwittingly been silencing their voice--through your sermonettes, through your over-explanations and defenses of your actions, through inviting them to defend themselves by asking, "Why did you do that?" and yet never accepting their explanations or apologies? If you are the voice of authority in someone else's life, you are also the ears of authority. You need to listen.<br><br>Listen and ask: "Tell me about the pain you experienced because of what I did--or someone else did. Tell me. Tell me more."<br><br>Ask and listen: "Tell me about the joy you are experiencing these days because of the decision you made. Tell me. Tell me more."<br><br>There is an extra level of healing that occurs when ears of authority are able to hear the exquisiteness of a loved one's pain and joy. Change is accelerated!<br><br>As helpful as human voices of authority are, none can or should replace the ultimate voice of authority--the Word himself: the Savior Jesus Christ. What are you doing to hear his voice in your life? What are you doing to establish his voice as the voice of authority for you? His voice will strengthen yours and provide direction and courage--especially for those times when you need to speak "the unspeakable." And for some of us, the unspeakable that we have needed to say to others is: "I love you," "I really need you in my life," or "I am so sorry." As you learn to hear the voice of the Lord in your life, you will be increasingly drawn to hear who you really are.<br><h2><b>Caterpillars and Change</b></h2><br>A story is told of a caterpillar named Yellow who was trying to find out what she should be doing with her life. In her wanderings she discovered another caterpillar seemingly caught in some gauzy, hairy filament. Concerned, she asked if she could help. He explained that this was all part of the process of becoming a butterfly.<br><br>When she heard the word<i>butterfly,</i>her whole insides leapt. "But what is a butterfly?"<br><br>The cocooned caterpillar explained: "It's what you are meant to become."<br><br>Yellow was intrigued but a bit defiant. "How can I believe there's a butterfly inside you or me when all I see is a fuzzy worm?"<br><br>On further reflection she pensively asked, "How does one become a butterfly?"<br><br>And the answer? "You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar." (From Trina Paulus,<i>Hope for the Flowers</i>[New York: Paulist Press, 1972], pp. 67–75.)<br><br>I love that.<br><br>"How does one become a butterfly?"<br><br>"You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar."<br><br>So, what are you willing to give up being so that you can fly? Your spirit wants to fly! Your spirit remembers your premortal assignments and aspirations. What are you willing to give up believing so that you can be all you really are--all that you committed you would be?<br><br>Perhaps the words of Lorenzo Snow will help. He said:<br><br><i>Jesus was a god before he came into the world and yet his knowledge was taken from him. He did not know his former greatness, neither do we know what greatness we had attained to before we came here, but he had to pass through an ordeal, as we have to, without knowing or realizing at the time the greatness and importance of his mission and works.</i>[Lorenzo Snow, in<i>First Presidency, President's Office Journals, 1899–1901,</i>8 October 1900, pp. 181–82, Archives Division, Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City; cited in Truman G. Madsen,<i>The Highest in Us</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978), p. 9]<br><br>Like Yellow, the caterpillar, whose insides leapt at the very sound of the word<i>butterfly,</i>what marvelous words, recurring phrases, lofty thoughts, grand concepts, memorable people, and unforgettable places make your whole insides leap these days? Could these internal leapings be premortal stirrings? Brief glimpses of your premortal life?<br><br>What comes to your heart and your mind, what happens to your cells and your soul when you ask yourself: "If I were to remember that I was valiant before I came here--that I have to pass through an ordeal here on earth without remembering what I was like premortally, and without knowing or realizing the greatness and importance of my mission and works now--what would I give up being, doing, feeling, and believing in order to be all that I really am?"<br><br>Does that seem too grandiose a belief? Or do you feel truth embedded in those words? What are you willing to give up so that you can arise and shine forth as the valiant daughter or son of God that you really are?<br><h2><b>Cocooning</b></h2><br>Is it time to give up your caterpillar-like lifestyle? Is it time to give up living beneath yourself? Time to give up the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that keep you groveling on the ground when you could be flying--soaring even? Is it time to lift your sights and cocoon yourself away from the old caterpillar way of life so that your real self can emerge?<br><br>What are you willing to give up being so that you can fly? Are you willing to give up your sins, even your favorite ones, to really know yourself and--most important--to really know the Lord? To really come close to him? To rend the veil of unbelief? To access the healing power of the Atonement that is there for you--the power that can be applied to your disappointments, your temptations, your sorrows, and your suffering?<br><br>And what would help you? What would provide cocooning for you? Do you remember Alma and his life-changing cocooning process? His cocooning included harrowing reflections about his many sins and comforting memories of his father's tutoring about the Atonement.<br><br>From the depths of his soul Alma cried out to the Lord: "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death" (Alma 36:18).<br><br>Many of us here today appreciate the anguish that prompted Alma's pleading. And happily many of us are no longer strangers to the joy Alma experienced and expressed: "And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!" (Alma 36:20).<br><br>Do you know that joy? Does it help you remember who you really are? You<i>are</i>a god or goddess in embryo!<br><h2><b>Structural Coupling with the Lord</b></h2><br>In whose presence do you really get to be your true self? Who is your closest companion? With whom do you spend the most time? And does your time with your closest companion enhance or diminish your ability to have the Holy Ghost as your constant companion? Whose views are influencing you the most these days? Through repeated interactions, whose image are you receiving in your countenance?<br><br><i>Structural coupling</i>is a biological term that describes a process through which changes in living systems occur (see Humberto R. Maturana and Francisco Varela,<i>The Tree of Knowledge: The Biological Roots of Human Understanding,</i>rev. ed. [Boston: Shambhala, 1992]). Structural coupling involves two entities having interactions with each other over a period of time. Each interaction between the two triggers changes. Through this history of interactions, the two distinct entities become less different from each other--they become more alike and there is an increasingly better "fit" over time. Like feet and shoes, like two stones rubbed together, they change in concert with each other.<br><br>When you interact with someone or something repeatedly over time, it changes you. Even your interactions with an idea--with an image--changes you. That is why your environment is so important. That's why what you watch on TV or read or see in magazines is so critical. So<i>watch</i>what you watch! Be careful with whom or with what you are interacting. Those recurrent interactions change your countenance. They change your cells. They change your soul.<br><br>Do congruent changes arising from recurrent interactions explain why friends begin dressing alike and talking alike? Could structural coupling explain why couples over time often look alike? Do we grow to look and act like those we love--those with whom we interact a lot? Is structural coupling the way we become more and more like those we admire and honor? Could we, in fact, through our repeated interactions with someone, not only start looking like them but also start seeing like them?<br><br>Our ever-changing bio-psychosocial---spiritual structures influence what we see and what is real for us. As Robert L. Millet, dean of Religious Education, said, "We do not see things as<i>they</i>really are; we see things as<i>we</i>really are" (<i>Alive in Christ: The Miracle of Spiritual Rebirth</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 28; emphasis in original).<br><br>Our interactions with others trigger changes in our biological structures, our psychosocial structures, and our spiritual structures. Eyes change, hearts change, cells change, and souls change through structural coupling.<br><br>So, who would you most want to<i>be</i>like? Who would you most want to<i>see</i>like? Who would you most like to<i>think</i>like? Whose image would you like engraven upon your countenance?<br><br>A sociological principle states: Increased interaction leads to increased sentiment. The more we interact with someone the more feelings we have for them. The biological principle of structural coupling indicates that increased interaction leads to increasingly becoming like the person or thing that we have repeated interactions with.<br><h2><b>Come unto Christ and Become More Like Him</b></h2><br>The Savior entreats us to come unto him. He wants us to come close to him. He wants us to have increasingly repeated interactions with him and to really get to know him.<br><br>According to the sociological principle, our increased interactions with the Lord will lead to increased feelings for him--which will lead us to want more interactions with him. And, according to the biological principle of structural coupling, our increased interactions with the Savior will lead to our increasingly becoming like him.<br><br>And because he never changes,<i>the changes that would occur through our interaction with the Savior would all be in us.</i><br><br>As we increase our interactions with the Savior--as we really come unto him--we can become like him. But what does it really mean to come unto him? How can we do that? My interaction with a little three-year-old girl several years ago was a great example to me about the relentless, undaunted effort that can be put forth--that needs to be put forth--when we really want to be close to someone, when we really want to get to know them.<br><br>My experience with this little three-year-old gave me some new insights into coming unto Christ. I was attending sacrament meeting in Raymond, Alberta, Canada, in the ward in which I grew up. It was summertime, just a few years ago. As soon as I sat down in the row behind this little three-year-old girl and her family, she had her eye on me. (I think it was my earrings that initially caught her eye.) I asked her what her name was. It was the same as mine: Wendy. When I told her that was my name, too, she was thrilled! So was I.<br><br>The Savior wants us to take his name upon us. To have his name.<br><br>There was no hymnal near me, so I asked the older sister to hand me one from the row in front of their family. Little three-year-old Wendy heard my request and scurried to the end of her row, passing the knees of her four siblings and parents, and then up to the next row, where she secured the book and brought it back with joy to me.<br><br>Now I'm not saying that Wendy's efforts to retrieve that hymnal compared with what Nephi went through to secure the plates--but perhaps her willingness to "go and do" did! (See 1 Nephi 3:7.)<br><br>When we hear what the Lord needs us to do, do we respond willingly and quickly? Is that one way to come unto him--to do what he wants us to do and do it quickly? Little Wendy had heard my request and completed this loving act.<br><br>Wendy's desire to be close to me was evident when, as my dad and I sang the opening hymn, she leaned over the back of her bench and put her face right on our open hymnal and smiled up into our faces with her big brown eyes filled with light and love.<br><br>As the sacrament meeting continued, Wendy found every way she could to connect with me. She entreated me to talk to her, and I complied by softly whispering into her ear. She studied every aspect of my face and hands as much as she could from her position of leaning over the back of her bench. Finally, she could bear it no longer. She shimmied under the bench and up and onto my lap, where she happily, peacefully, joyfully stayed for the rest of the meeting.<br><br>Do we feel that same restlessness and urgency to come even closer to the Savior?<br><br>(I might add that little Wendy actually made<i>several</i>people happy with that move: her parents, who were happy they didn't have to tell her to turn around any more, and the surrounding people in the congregation, who didn't have to listen to her parents telling her to turn around. And I was delighted to have her right there on my lap!)<br><br>From Wendy's new vantage point of being up close and personal with me, she was curious about the other people in my family. Pointing to my father, she said: "What's his name?"<br><br>I said, "His name is Daddy."<br><br>And with a mix of joy, amazement, and awe she said, "I've got a boy named Daddy, too!"<br><br>When we are close to the Savior, when we come unto him, we come to understand that not only does he have a Heavenly Father, too--we come to know that his father is our father.<br><br>And we know that there was a time in the Garden of Gethsemane when the Savior, out of the depth and breadth of his suffering for us, called out to our Heavenly Father with the most familiar name of "Daddy" when he cried, "Abba!"<br><br>With little Wendy on my lap, I whispered into her ear telling her what a wonderful little girl she was, how much her mother and father loved her, and what she could do to show them how much she loved them. She was totally enraptured with hearing these things--totally silent and very reflective.<br><br>I believe that in moments of reflection and particularly as we listen to the still small voice, we will hear that we are wonderful and that we are loved. We will know how to show our love to the Lord, how to come even closer to him, and how to have more interactions with him. We will increase in our ability to see more like him, to love more like him, and to be more like him.<br><h2><b>The Savior: The Ultimate and Only True and Living Change Agent</b></h2><br>The ultimate and only true and living change agent is the Savior. He is the source of all change. He changed water into wine--bringing the very best liquid refreshment to the celebration. As you turn to him, he will bring the very best out of you. He will indeed rescue all that is finest down deep inside of you. And what a celebration that will be!<br><br>Ask him. Asking for the Savior's help is another way to come closer unto him.<br><br>The Savior changed eyes. And he can give you the eyes to see what you need to see in order to change your life. He will open the eyes of your understanding. Just ask him.<br><br>The Savior changed ears. And he can help you hear his voice, and that will add strength to your own voice. Ask him.<br><br>He changed limbs that were weak. And he can change your mobility and direction to help you move to the next level of your life and help you in your efforts to shore up the feeble knees that are around you. Ask him.<br><br>He changed a few fishes and a couple of loaves of bread into enough to feed 5,000 people. And he will take your widow's mite of time, energy, and ability and magnify them, multiply them, so that there is enough and to spare. You just need to ask him.<br><br>The Savior changed names: he turned Saul into Paul. And he can help you become his son or daughter. You can thus take upon you his name in a whole new way.<br><br>Although our Lord Jesus Christ never changes, he is the quintessential change agent--the only true change agent. Don't you love that seeming irony: the only true change agent never changes! There is only one true and living change agent--and he changes not. And he loves you. And he loves your desire and your efforts to change.<br><br>His desire is for you to change, to have a change of heart, a change of nature, and to, over time, completely cast off the natural man. He did all that he did so that you could change! He is your Savior and my Savior!<br><br>We need to actively, persistently plead for the power of his infinite and atoning sacrifice to be applied in our lives. And as we do so, his ultimate healing will bring to each of our lives the ultimate change. I promise you this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Wendy L.

<h1>ble Citizenship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and humbled by this invitation. I pray for the Lord's blessings that I may convey well to you the message I have and that you might receive it in the spirit by which it was prepared. I have titled these remarks "Accountable Citizenship," a topic discussed in section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the section about which I want to talk to you today. But I want to introduce you to that section with some preliminary thoughts, starting with some thoughts about agency.<br><h2><b>Agency</b></h2><br>Beyond life itself, agency is God's greatest gift to his children. In the absence of agency, we could not progress toward our ultimate potential. A world without agency would be a prison from whose bars we could never escape. This principle of agency is so important that the most significant war in human or divine history was waged over it and, indeed, continues today. Satan led those forces that would limit agency and progress, and he who would become our Savior led those forces supporting agency and the potential to become more like our Father.<br><br>This helps us understand the LDS distaste for totalitarian or even authoritarian governments. Such political systems may achieve order, but it is an order without justice, without creativity and initiative, and without the opportunity to err--a community in which none could be proven and none could progress.<br><br>This also helps us understand the LDS commitment to political freedom, to the rule of law, and to what is generally called liberal democratic government--governments created and maintained by popular sovereignty. Such governments are champions of "individual and minority rights, personal freedom, and religious pluralism" (Gary C. Bryner, "Politics: Political Teachings,"<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 3 [New York: Macmillan, 1992], p. 1104). These governments adopt laws to ensure<br><br><i>the rights and protection of all . . . ;</i><br><br><i>That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which</i>[God has]<i>given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:77–78]<br><br>Much of this commitment is explained in what I believe to be the most inspired and accurate statement about government ever written. This statement is described in its preface as "a declaration of belief regarding governments and laws in general." We know it as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<sup>1</sup>J.Reuben Clark, Jr., former counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, has said that these statements "are wise and as far-reaching as the Articles of Faith themselves" (<i>CR,</i>April 1935, p. 90).<sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>Dual Sovereignty</b></h2><br>Section 134, along with the twelfth article of faith, addresses one of the oldest dilemmas of Christian intellectual history--the dilemma of dual sovereignty. Sovereignty means ultimate or supreme authority, and a sovereign is one who exercises supreme authority.<br><br>Some Christians have grappled with the implications of this concept for centuries. How could one owe ultimate allegiance to both God and king? How could both God and king be sovereign? As President Howard W. Hunter once said, "At first blush dual sovereignty would seem inconsistent" (<i>CR,</i>April 1968, p. 64).<sup>3</sup><br><br>The standard scriptural basis of this dilemma is found in Matthew 22. In an attempt to entrap the Savior, the Pharisees approached Jesus and asked, "Is it lawful to give tribute [meaning tax] unto Caesar, or not?"<br><br>The question, really, was whether or not a Jew--one who considered God his only sovereign--could in good conscience pay tax to the Romans. It was a question of sovereignty: to whom did they owe their loyalty and would the payment of tax violate allegiance to God? If the Savior had said, "Yes, pay the tax," he would have betrayed his cause. If he had said, "No, don't pay the tax," he would have betrayed the government.<br><br>The Savior, aware of their hypocrisy, asked first for a coin and then asked whose image appeared on the coin. When they replied, "Caesar's," the Savior said simply, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matthew 22:15–22; see also Howard W. Hunter,<i>CR,</i>April 1968, pp. 64–65).<br><br>Matthew reports that the Pharisees "marvelled . . . and went their way" (verse 22). I suspect another interpretation might be that they went away from him still puzzled about the dilemma of dual sovereignty, not understanding the implications of the Savior's use of the coin. The coin, as President Hunter has reminded us, "denotes that temporal things belong to the temporal sovereign," and the image of the current Caesar on it was to be contrasted with the "image of God stamped on the heart and soul of a man [which] denotes that all [of one's] facilities and powers belong to God and should be employed in his service" (<i>CR,</i>April 1968, p. 65). In effect, the Savior told them that the things of the world are subject to worldly authority, but eternal things are subject only to God. But, consistent with pharisaical behavior through all ages, those Pharisees wanted the lines drawn more clearly--they wanted to know precisely what was Caesar's and what was God's.<br><br>Many Christian intellectuals have struggled ever since to understand the full implications of dual sovereignty and to understand what must be rendered to Caesar and what must be rendered to God.<br><h2><b>Section 134</b></h2><br>So this morning I want to read and comment on a few of the themes found in this sacred "declaration of belief regarding governments and laws" that we know as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The teachings contained therein make clear what must be rendered to Caesar and what must be rendered to God. Verse 1 begins, "We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man." What a simple, yet bold, opening to this declaration. Keep in mind that this declaration was adopted by the Church "after the mobbings, the plunderings, [and] the assassinations" that were a part of the Church's early experience in Missouri. This statement was written by "a people, who, judged by human standards, had every reason to feel that their government had failed, and that they might not hopefully and successfully look thereto for their protection" (J.Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>CR,</i>April 1935, p. 90).<br><br>This opening declaration lays to rest the deceit of both ancient and modern anarchists that government is evil. Listen to a few phrases taken from a book that has been and continues to be very popular among some Latter-day Saints: "Government is . . . evil. And we do not mean . . . that they (governments) are merely dishonest. For all governments . . . are thoroughly dishonest. . . . Government is always and inevitably an enemy of individual freedom" (<i>The Blue Book of the John Birch Society</i>[Belmont, Massachusetts: The John Birch Society, 1959], pp. 102–3). Does this sound like something God would institute "for the benefit of man"? I believe that a properly constituted and well-administered government is, in fact, the first friend of freedom.<br><br>And notice that this verse does not talk about any particular government. It talks about governments. Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>All regularly organized and well established governments have certain laws by which . . . the innocent are protected and the guilty punished. . . .</i><br><br>[God]<i>has taught man that law is necessary in order to govern. . . .</i>[Since]<i>God is the source</i>[of]<i>all good; and . . . man is benefited by law, then certainly, law is good.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 49, 55]<br><br>Now this is not an endorsement of any and all governments. Nor is it an endorsement of any particular policy or practice of the American government. I have worked for several years in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., and I can criticize many aspects of government as well as anyone. But government is not a necessary evil; it is, in fact, a necessary good.<br><br>Why would the Lord institute government among his children when government has the potential of becoming dictatorial and of limiting human freedom? This question is answered in verse 6 of this section: "As without [government and its laws] peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror."<br><h2><b>Limitations on Agency</b></h2><br>There are two conditions under which the earthly kingdom of God cannot exist comfortably. The first is under anarchy, where individuals are so concerned with physical survival that they cannot devote time and attention to more eternal concerns. And notice that the Book of Mormon appropriately links anarchy with terror. The condition of anarchy and the terror of living one's daily life under anarchy are well described in the Book of Mormon in Ether 14:1–2:<br><br><i>And now there began to be a great curse upon all the land because of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon . . . the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own life and of his wives and children.</i><br><br>The second condition is dictatorship, where all or some religious practice is banned. As Elder Bruce D. Porter has reminded us, anarchy and dictatorship are related:<br><br><i>As is often the case in history, absolute dictatorship was made possible not by the steady growth of government into a leviathan of power, but rather by the destruction of government, which left a vacuum into which ruthless men could move.</i>["The Virtue of Government," address to the Pi Sigma Alpha Society of Brigham Young University, April 1996, p. 2]<br><br>Both anarchy and dictatorship thwart God's plan, since both deny agency. Both anarchy and dictatorship create a society advocated and described by Korihor in the Book of Mormon. It would be, according to Korihor, a society in which<br><br><i>every man fared in . . . life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and . . . every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</i>[Alma 30:17]<br><br>Section 134 requires us to respect government and work for the establishment of well-ordered and well-administered governments to avoid the evil consequences of anarchy and terror. Government is the opposite of anarchy. It was instituted by God to prevent that kind of society from existing. It is an exalted and ennobling principle. And for this divine gift that was instituted for the benefit of man, what does the Lord expect of us in return?<br><h2><b>Accountability</b></h2><br>First, he expects us to be accountable for this gift. Listen to the continuation of verse 1: "We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he [God] holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them."<br><br>God holds us accountable for our acts in relation to our governments. I take this to mean two things. First, as verse 1 goes on to say, we are accountable both for "making laws" and for "administering them, for the good and safety of society." In commenting on this accountability, President J.Reuben Clark, Jr., said:<br><br><i>Therefore, every man who takes on a responsibility by virtue of assuming office in worldly government, is responsible to the Lord . . . for the way in which he carries it out. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Whether a</i>[person]<i>takes office in the legislature, or in the executive branch of government, or in the judicial branch, he becomes, by virtue of that assumption of office, responsible to the Lord himself.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1935, p. 91]<br><br>What a different nation this would be if every public official understood this obligation.<br><br>But accountable citizenship may also require more. It may require a willingness to participate in the political process. It is increasingly difficult to persuade good men and women to run for public office. Public officials are so widely disliked and so much ill is spoken of them that many are unwilling to spend money and time only to earn disrespect. I remember many years ago when I ran for the state legislature, my mother, of all people, cautioned me against doing so by asking if I really wanted to become a corrupt politician.<br><h2><b>Citizen Participation</b></h2><br>Our late university president Rex E. Lee reminded us that we need to look at the phrase "render unto Caesar" more closely.<br><br><i>Citizen participation is the fuel that keeps the fires of democracy burning. It is also the single characteristic that best distinguishes republican forms of government from autocracy or dictatorships. The latter not only do</i>not<i>depend on participation by the people, they suppress it. And it also follows, I submit, that a creeping indifference among our citizens concerning the importance of their involvement in matters governmental can lead to a deterioration of democracy itself, and of the freedoms that it secures.</i>[Rex E. Lee, commencement address, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, April 27, 1995, p. 1; emphasis added]<br><br>In this regard we need to follow the admonition of section 98, where we are reminded to seek diligently and uphold honest and wise men and women for public office, because "when the wicked rule the people mourn" and "whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil" (D&amp;amp;C 98:9–10).<br><br>I hope we all remember the wonderful admonition to this end from the First Presidency letter of January 15, 1998. Among other things, the letter said:<br><br><i>Thus, we strongly urge men and women to be willing to serve on school boards, city and county councils and commissions, state legislatures, and other high offices of either election or appointment, including involvement in the political party of their choice.</i><br><h2><b>Civic Officers</b></h2><br>Another aspect of accountable citizenship is spelled out more clearly in verse 6:<br><br><i>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men show respect and deference.</i><br><br>Verse 3 touches on this same theme:<br><br><i>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld.</i><br><br>This second aspect of accountable citizenship suggests that we should honor and uphold office holders and even (dare I say the word) bureaucrats and the laws they create, administer, and enforce.<br><br>I know that in today's world, this requires a near Christlike charity of judgment. But could I quote at length from a great man who, unfortunately, we largely recall only for a building on this campus that bears his name--Stephen L Richards. President Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and a longtime counselor to President David O. McKay. Writing during the heat of World War II, President Richards said that he was concerned over<br><br><i>the tendency to indulge in . . . "long-range" criticism of public officials, especially as regards their private life and character. I include within the group not only political officers, but all others who, by reason of their elevation to positions of leadership, assume a responsibility for the direction of movements and causes. I recognize, of course, that the policies of a man in public place and the wisdom of his actions and statements are legitimate subjects for public debate and that proper criticism of such matters is not only allowable, but is to be encouraged in the interests of good government and civic procedure. But is it necessary in such an analysis of issues to bring imputations against a man's character, his intentions, and his honor? I think it is not, and I believe that inestimable and unnecessary damage is done to personal reputations, sensitive feelings, and legitimate family pride by the misconceived and cruel strategy that the way to win an ideological victory is to assassinate the character of an opponent. . . .</i><br><br><i>I think that those who occupy positions of public trust and responsibility in state, church, or businesses are entitled to a measure of sympathy in the discharge of their obligations. It certainly is not easy to please everybody, and the enforcement of the best and soundest policies invariably affects someone adversely. Because a person is affected adversely is no justification for an attack on the personal character of the enforcing or policymaking officer.</i><br><br><i>So until we can stop calling men "crooks"</i>[or, I might add, any other pejorative name]<i>just because they disagree with us, we have much to repent of. . . .</i><br><br>[We ought]<i>to yield obedience to this divine injunction of the Savior, to refrain from intemperate judgment, to impute good rather than evil to the intentions of men, and to investigate and know the facts before deciding. We are much too prone to judge men by the mistakes they make, forgetting that we ourselves are constantly making mistakes. We seldom know or consider their intentions and that they themselves suffer most for their mistakes, in both disappointment and consequence. Most people need our sympathy, rather than our censure, in their failures.</i>[Stephen L Richards,<i>The Church in War and Peace</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1943), pp. 168–70]<br><br>I apologize for such a long quotation, but this call for charity in judgment is more necessary today than it was in 1943. And this exhortation is especially significant to me since I have seen several individuals and families ruined by irresponsible and false accusations of wrongdoing.<br><h2><b>Deference to the Law</b></h2><br>I have talked about honoring and sustaining those who create and administer the law, but what about showing respect and deference to the law itself? According to verse 5, "We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside." The twelfth article of faith states: "We believe . . . in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law" (Articles of Faith 1:12). Again, the Doctrine and Covenants contains supporting material on this topic. Section 58 states: "Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land" (verse 21).<br><br>It makes no difference how we feel about a law. We should obey, honor, and sustain all laws. Whether it be the law that requires us to pay taxes, to serve in the military, to sit on juries, or whatever, we are told that "when we violate the laws of the land, we violate the law of God" (George F. Richards,<i>CR,</i>October 1922, p. 83).<sup>4</sup>If we disagree with the laws of the land, we should work to change them. According to Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>It is our duty to concentrate all our influence to make popular that which is sound and good, and unpopular that which is unsound. 'Tis right, politically, for a man who has influence to use it.</i>[<i>HC</i>5:286]<br><br>But this effort must be done appropriately. Our modern prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, said:<br><br><i>The building of public sentiment begins with a few earnest voices. I am not one to advocate shouting defiantly or shaking fists and issuing threats in the faces of legislators. But I am one who believes that we should earnestly and sincerely and positively express our convictions to those given the heavy responsibility of making and enforcing our laws.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1975, p. 58]<br><h2><b>Loss of Social Capital</b></h2><br>Quite often disregard for law and government stems from self-elevation--from believing that one's own desires are greater than community needs and goals. Historically, this perversion comes about as the noble goals of the Enlightenment--personal agency and individual rights--are taken to an extreme. Elder Bruce D. Porter described this condition well:<br><br><i>The whims and lusts of the individual become paramount, and man becomes his own god, a law unto himself. This is a perverted vision of freedom as the elimination of all laws, all restraints, and all government. Those who adopt it seek, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, to become "a law unto [themselves]" (D&amp;amp;C 88:35).</i>[Porter, "The Virtue of Government," p. 12]<br><br>Being part of a community or society requires respect for others and a willingness to restrain one's own desires to support broader community goals and aspirations. Unwillingness to make this sacrifice results in a corrosion of shared values. Members of a community in which individualism and personal goals are pursued at the expense of community goals are driven to look out for their own self-interests, knowing that no one else will look out for those interests for them, to paraphrase the French philosopher Rousseau. Rousseau wrote critically of the anarchy created by the unrestrained pursuit of self-interests. In such a society or community, the public good is gradually driven out by individual goals, and, eventually, the very nature of the community is changed. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has commented:<br><br><i>Our whole system depends upon what has been called "obedience to the unenforceable," in which citizens willingly constrain themselves for the good of the whole because of shared respect. Once selfishness, which is an apostate form of individualism, reigns supreme, there cannot be a real sense of community. When shared respect dissolves, so does shared power.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "The Constitution: The Wisest Ever Yet Presented to Men," devotional address at Ricks College, Rexburg, Idaho, September 15, 1987, reprinted by the BYU College of General Education and Honors, p. 20]<br><br>The secular scholars whose work I like most on this topic are Francis Fukayama of George Mason University and Robert Putnam, professor of government at Harvard. Putnam has documented the decline of what he calls social capital, civic engagement, or civic trust. In his provocative article "Bowling Alone, Revisited," Putnam traces the more than quarter-century decline in a wide variety of civic organizations, including (obviously) bowling leagues, and laments the community decline associated with these trends (see Robert D. Putnam, "Bowling Alone, Revisited,"<i>The Responsive Community</i>[spring 1995]:18–33).<br><br>The impact of unbridled self-interest on a community is imperceptible but inexorable. Many times its effects can be seen only when it is too late. Social scientists speak about the "problem of the commons," referring to early New England, where town commons were created on which community members could graze specified numbers of their cows. However, as the community increased, cow ownership increased, and individual owners assumed that certainly their own one additional cow would not damage the commons. The individual assumption was correct, but the collective set of assumptions destroyed the commons.<br><br>For several years I have (I hope kindly and gently) stopped students as they have attempted to save a second or two by cutting across the grass or shrubbery. I remember once pointing back to an area that was once grass but that now looked like hardscrabble and saying to a student, "Look what you have done."<br><br>At first, he looked aghast, but then he said, almost apologetically, "I didn't do that!"<br><br>Like the New England cow owner, as an individual he was right, but collectively he had destroyed the beauty of that section of the "university commons." President Jeffrey R. Holland once reminded us that "no individual snowflake ever felt any responsibility for an avalanche" ("Oh, Lord, Keep My Rudder True,"<i>BYU 1985–86 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1986], p. 61). Yet an avalanche is but a collection of individual snowflakes.<br><br>In his commencement address in April 1996, President Hinckley quoted with favor a writer who said:<br><br><i>People might think of a civilized community as one in which there is a refined culture. Not necessarily; first and foremost it is one in which the mass of people subdue their selfish instincts in favour of the common wellbeing.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Our Fading Civility," inauguration and spring commencement address, April 25, 1996, p. 15, quoting from "The Duty of Civility,"<i>Royal Bank Letter</i>76, no. 3 (May/June 1995):2]<br><br>Ignoring the common, in whatever context, leads to its destruction. An early, anonymous, concise, yet penetrating poem describes the results of this kind of behavior.<br><br><i>The law locks up both man and woman<br>Who steals the goose from off the common,<br>But lets the greater felon loose<br>Who steals the common from the goose.</i><br>[Anonymous, from Edward Potts Cheyney,<i>Social and Industrial History of England</i>(1901), introduction]<br><br>This principle applies to us in whatever stage of life we find ourselves. Students need to think more about supporting the goals and values of this institution. Faculty need to use their time and efforts to do more than further their own research or professional agenda. And all of us need to be more sensitive to the needs of larger communities around us.<br><br>I hope I am not trivializing sacred things by talking about cutting across the grass and individual snowflakes. I don't want to do what Macaulay, I believe it was, in his famous<i>History of England,</i>accused the English Puritans of doing--of making everything sacred, and thus making the sacred trivial. But I am reminded of a story told to me by a friend of mine who is an area authority of the Church in the northeast. He reported a conversation with a district judge in New York City who, on being asked why that illustrious, but oft-maligned city was beginning to actually look a little better, responded that it was because they were enforcing the anti-spitting laws. My friend was surprised by the response and asked what that had to do with the general decline in crime and other positive indicators of improvement. The judge replied that they had discovered that if they enforced the little things that were actually enforceable--anti-spitting, anti-jaywalking, and other seemingly rather insignificant ordinances--then general respect for the city and its moral authority seemed to improve. What were a few years ago actual pockets of anarchy in urban life have now become much more orderly--and here is the important point--thus giving city dwellers more freedom (conversation with Elder Robert S. Wood, April 29, 1998).<br><h2><b>Community Service</b></h2><br>I believe that accountable citizenship requires concern for community life, for the commons, as well as concern for individual goals--it requires us to give "obedience to the unenforceable." It may even go beyond that. It may require voluntary community activities. It may require--as Dean Erlend Peterson pointed out in his devotional address a few months ago (17 March 1998)--significant individual and collective efforts to create or protect community values and standards, thus following the Lord's admonition to "be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and [to] do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27).<br><br>Erastus Snow, an early pioneer and Church leader, once asked:<br><br><i>What man, however good be his desires, can control himself and his family in their habits and manners of life and fashions, without the aid of the surrounding community? What sensible man can hold me or my brethren responsible, in all respects, either for ourselves or our households, unaided by the community and while the community are all working against us? But when the community learn to work together, and are agreed in a common purpose, what is it that they can not accomplish? Union is strength.</i>[<i>JD</i>17:74]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are but individual snowflakes, but if we are not more concerned with community life, if we pursue merely our own selfish desires and goals, we will create avalanches of social ills.<br><h2><b>Separation of Church and State</b></h2><br>On another issue, D&amp;amp;C 134:4 calls for mutual respect and deference between state and religion.<br><br><i>We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.</i><br><br>We must be ever so careful, particularly in communities where LDS people predominate, to avoid using civil authority to enforce singularly unique LDS practices or to "dictate forms for public or private devotion" merely because we have the political power to do so. At the same time, we must work as hard as we can in all levels of politics--as individuals and as groups, but not as a church--to establish and enforce general moral and ethical standards.<br><br>In summary, I have tried to suggest that accountable citizenship requires:<br><br>1. Appreciation and respect for the concept of government.<br><br>2. A well-established and orderly government to prevent anarchy, terror, and dictatorship.<br><br>3. A willingness to participate in political affairs and to be accountable for one's political actions.<br><br>4. A willingness to withhold judgment and to honor and respect those involved in civic affairs whether elected, appointed, or volunteers.<br><br>5. A willingness to obey, honor, and sustain the law.<br><br>6. Considerable self-sacrifice and respect for the needs of others and for the common good.<br><br>7. A good dose of community spirit animated by healthy volunteerism.<br><br>8. A respect for the distinction between church and state.<br><br>I am deeply grateful for the inspired teaching of this and other sections of the Doctrine and Covenants. I am grateful for the principle of continuing revelation. I bear my testimony as to the truthfulness and relevance of these inspired scriptures in our lives today. And I pray that we will prepare ourselves for living in an eventual Zion community by bringing the principles of a Zion community into our lives today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Stan A. Taylor was a BYU professor of political science when this devotional address was given on 5 May 1998.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. It is commonly believed that this statement was written by Oliver Cowdery, perhaps with the help of W. W. Phelps, and later adopted at a general assembly of the Church on August 17, 1835 (see Bryner, "Politics: Political Teachings," pp. 1103–4). At this same assembly, this declaration was voted to be included as section 102 in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. It appeared as section 110 and as section 134 in subsequent editions (see Richard O. Cowan,<i>The Doctrine and Covenants: Our Modern Scripture</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984], p. 218).<br><br>2. For a different view of section 134, see Hyrum M. Smith and Janne M. Sjodahl,<i>Doctrine and Covenants Commentary,</i>rev. ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), pp. 852–53.<br><br>3. This is not to suggest that the New Testament does not solve this dilemma. Even non-LDS scholars point out that the problem of church and state is solved in the New Testament: "Surely the Kingdom of God should be of infinitely more value to us than the State; but it is wrong to attack the State violently in order to set up the Kingdom of God" (Oscar Cullmann,<i>The State in the New Testament,</i>rev. ed. [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1956], p. 21). Nevertheless, the tension between church and state has reappeared many times through the centuries.<br><br>4.

<h1>at Wait upon the Lord”: Metaphor and Meaning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Using the literary technique of repetition and completion, the prophet Isaiah wrote this magnificent promise: "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" (Isaiah 40:31). My text is guided today by this scriptural passage, drawing on personal and professional life experiences, other scriptural passages, and the words of the prophets.<br><br>Waiting upon the Lord: As a woman and a nurse researcher focusing on women's health, when I first think of the word<i>waiting,</i>I think of women bearing children. Old Testament Hannah spoke of her experience when she said, "For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him" (1 Samuel 1:27). Hannah waited upon the Lord. Patricia T. Holland has suggested that "women appreciate that word<i>labor</i>in a way that no man ever can" (<i>Within Whispering Distance of Heaven: A Message for Mothers</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989], p. 11). I believe this is so. For nine months a woman carries a child both beneath and within her heart. Waiting long months and then laboring long hours, she then gives birth.<br><br>Over the past decade my research has focused on the meaning of childbirth. I have listened to the birth stories of women living in North and Central America, Scandinavia, and the Middle East. What wonderful experiences have been mine. I have learned through interviewing women that there is a connectedness that transcends the barriers of language and culture when sacred experiences such as childbirth are shared. The pictures of my own children and grandchildren became dog-eared and worn from being held in so many women's hands as we shared our commonalities. I listened to "woman talk" sitting on worn, century-old wooden benches in maternal and child health clinics and on dirt floors in humble homes and in refugee camps. I sat among these women--women whose life circumstances are so different than my own--and listened. I see in my mind's eye the Guatemalan women wearing brightly colored woven clothing, made by their own hands--creating beauty in stark contrast to the harshness and poverty of their life circumstances. I think of the Orthodox Jewish women, their hair covered in symbolism of their modesty before the Lord. Many of the Muslim women were robed and veiled, covered from head to toe in black as a symbol of their devotion to God. I think in contrast of Mormon women who have made temple covenants wearing the symbol of their devotion in sacred white clothing worn next to their skin.<br><br>In thousands of pages of transcribed narrative data, I found that women made sacred the experience of giving birth, supporting the thesis that there is deep meaning in women's ordinary and commonplace lives regardless of sociocultural context (see Sue Bender,<i>Everyday Sacred: A Woman's Journey Home</i>[New York: Harper-Collins, 1995]). The foundational wellsprings of Christian, Islamic, and Judaic religious traditions give these women a pattern and language for creating meaning in their lives. Such intuitiveness demonstrates an openness to the transcendent dimensions of their life experiences. Women spoke of the integration of the spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and physical dimensions of pregnancy and birth. This supports the most significant Islamic principle<i>tawhid:</i>meaning that life experiences prove the oneness of God. One Muslim woman expressed it this way:<br><br><i>During childbirth the woman is in the hands of God. Every night during my pregnancy I read from the Holy Qur'an to the child. When I was in labor I was reading a special paragraph from the Holy Qur'an about protection. The nurses were crying when they heard what I was reading. I felt like a miracle might happen--that there was something holy around me, protecting me, something beyond the ordinary, a feeling, a spirit, about being part of God's creation of a child.</i><br><br>There is special protection for women who assume the sacred task of bearing children, as expressed in an earlier verse in chapter 40 of Isaiah: "He shall feed his flock like a shepherd ..., and shall gently lead those that are with young" (Isaiah 40:11). An Orthodox Jewish woman said that every action in her life, including childbirth, is guided by<i>Hashem,</i>the Yiddish word for God. An Orthodox Jewish grandmother whose two daughters had recently given birth articulated her sense of the dimensions of becoming a mother in this way:<br><br><i>Having a baby is not only a physical and biological experience. It is all that, but it's much more than that. It is a very high spiritual experience, because the whole purpose of the world is bringing down a child, bringing down a soul. If God gives you a soul, you become the caretaker of this soul. I mean, God gives this into your hands. You feel God's presence most tangibly when you have gone through</i>[childbirth].<br><br>Jewish women spoke reverently about childbirth. Frequently in Jewish literature, spiritual striving is compared to labor and childbirth. The pivotal life event of giving birth for many women represents this concept of waiting upon the Lord. Among indigenous women giving birth in rural Guatemalan highlands, newborns have a 10-fold higher risk of dying during the first year of life as compared with babies born in the United States, and mothers have a 12-fold higher risk of losing their lives in complications associated with childbirth (Lynn C. Callister and Rosemarie Vega, "Giving Birth: Guatemalan Women's Voices,"<i>Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing</i>27, no. 3 [May/June 1998], pp. 289–95). The stark reality is that the child a woman carries may not live and that the childbearing woman is in increased risk of losing her own life. Within this sociocultural context where life is tenuous, women find strength in their spiritual lifestyle, relying on the Lord to ensure positive outcomes or to give them the courage to deal with negative ones. One Mayan woman said:<br><br>[Giving birth]<i>I felt closer to God. I thanked God for allowing me to have a baby. Well, I don't say she is mine but that he let me borrow her. While the baby was in my womb I realized how great God is. Only God watches over the children that are yet in the womb because only he could do that.</i><br><br>Professor Cynthia L. Hallen, in an interesting treatise on Isaiah and 3 Nephi, defines the metaphorical scriptural language associated with childbirth and spiritual growth (see<i>The Lord's Covenant of Kindness: Isaiah 54 and 3 Nephi 22,</i>in Donald W. Parry and John W. Welch, eds.,<i>Isaiah in the Book of Mormon</i>[Provo: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1998], pp. 313–49). The bittersweet paradox of this experience is described by the apostle John:<br><br><i>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</i>[John 16:21]<br><br>The acts of labor and childbirth have been compared to the struggle for spiritual birth, as suggested in this scriptural text: "Pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail" (Micah 4:9). And, again, in the New Testament, "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you" (Galatians 4:19). The spiritual rebirth of the earth is articulated in the language of childbirth: "The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength" (D&amp;amp;C 84:101). Elder Bruce C. Hafen also noted significant spiritual parallels:<br><br><i>Just as a mother's body may be permanently marked with the signs of pregnancy and childbirth, he</i>[the Savior]<i>said, "I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands." (1 Nephi 21:15–16.) For both a mother and the Savior, those marks memorialize a wrenching sacrifice--the sacrifice of begetting life--for her, physical birth; for him, spiritual rebirth.</i>[Bruce C. Hafen and Marie K. Hafen, "'Eve Heard All These Things and Was Glad': Grace and Learning by Experience," in Dawn Hall Anderson and Susette Fletcher Green, eds.,<i>Women in the Covenant of Grace: Talks Selected from the 1993 Women's Conference</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994), p. 29]<br><br><i>Wait</i>in Hebrew means to hope for, to anticipate. In a gospel context, waiting on the Lord connotes hopeful anticipation, submission to the Lord's will, and trusting in the Lord. Waiting denotes an active process, one of keeping our covenants. Fervent meekness is required as well as the realization of the need for reliance on the Lord. Waiting requires continual self-examination, constantly trying to become more worthy, an ever-deepening and progressive discipleship of a broken heart, a contrite spirit, a yielded will, and a consecration of self. The word<i>wait</i>denotes spiritual expectation. It is when one knows that the guidance of the Lord and the answers to our prayers are spiritual gifts that one cannot control or demand. It means that we must be content and peaceful about the spiritual nudgings we may receive, the gentle promptings, and be grateful for those occasional illuminating moments of brighter light and clearer understanding.<br><br>Why does the Lord require waiting? Why aren't blessings granted immediately? Why are we required to "see through [the] glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12), not knowing the end from the beginning? The Lord has told us, "Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning [you]" (D&amp;amp;C 58:3). The Savior has said, "I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee" (3 Nephi 22:8). The hymnist penned this plea: "Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see / The distant scene--one step enough for me" ("Lead, Kindly Light,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 97).<br><br>Waiting sometimes means living with uncertainty. We can look to the example of Elder Neal A. Maxwell, living with the uncertainty of a potentially life-threatening illness. He said:<br><br><i>Uncertainty as to our longevity is one of life's basic realities for all of us. Hence, you and I should importune</i>in faith<i>for the blessings we deeply desire, but then "be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto [us]" (Alma 29:3).</i>["From Whom All Blessings Flow,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, p. 11; emphasis added]<br><br>Elder Maxwell has suggested further that such waiting upon the Lord is "much more than polite deference. Rather, it is a deep yielding in which one's momentary uncertainty gives way to the certainty of [the] Father's rescuing love and mercy" ("Apply the Atoning Blood of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1997, p. 23).<br><br>Emma Smith was counseled, "Murmur not" (D&amp;amp;C 25:4). I believe the Lord was saying, to Emma and to us, "Be still and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16). We have been given the invitation "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). Is it possible for us to trust in the Lord that much, or do we rely too much on ourselves and our own finite abilities to reason and solve perplexing problems? Blessings come when we are willing to wait upon the Lord. We can obtain the blessing of the renewal of strength and the blessing of exhilarating upward growth. The blessing of strength to endure is promised in this scriptural passage. Many of the women whom I interviewed learned about their own capacities as they literally waited upon the Lord as they labored and gave birth. One woman reflected:<br><br><i>The experience of childbirth helped me learn a lot about my capacity. ... When I thought I was just too tired to push anymore I found another 15 minutes worth of energy. I learned I have a lot more strength than I thought I did. Childbirth brought me more in tune with my</i>[self]<i>because I know what my capacities are: my mental,</i>[emotional, and spiritual]<i>capacities, my strength. I just know I could do a lot more than I thought I could.</i><br><br>"But they that wait upon the Lord shall<i>renew</i>their strength" (Isaiah 40:31; emphasis added). The phrase "shall renew their strength" seems to imply receipt of the gift of the Holy Ghost as a Comforter, which enlightens our minds, fills our souls with joy, and literally renews our bodies (see D&amp;amp;C 11:13).<br><br>May I share with you, with permission, the story of one of my students. This young man experienced the tragic death of his father in an accident when he was six years old. He left his childhood home when the actions of an emotionally and physically abusive stepfather became overwhelming. He worked to earn money for his mission. He had been blessed with a burning testimony all of his life and literally counted the days until he could serve a mission. He was determined to use every moment of his time wisely as he served in Japan, putting in long hours of finding and teaching investigators. He gave his heart, mind, might, and strength to the work. Again and again he had investigators get one step away from baptism and then fall through. Every time someone would walk away from their testimony, this elder felt as though his heart would break.<br><br>One day he sat in a zone leader's conference. It had been a rough month. He hadn't heard anything from home for many months and had had no baptisms. He sat and listened as elders rose and spoke of the great blessings they were enjoying in the work. One elder testified of how much his family had been blessed by his missionary service. This elder heard the same things said over and over again. He began to weep and could not hold back the tears. He said at that moment he was comforted and renewed by the Holy Spirit.<br><br><i>I knew that the Lord was pleased with my efforts. I felt his Spirit quite literally to the consuming of my flesh. About a month later, the mission president came to do interviews. He sat me down and asked me how I was doing. I told him about our investigators and their progress.</i><br><br><i>He stopped me and asked again how I was doing, so I told him how the missionary efforts were going. He stopped me again and asked me how I was doing. I couldn't answer. Sometimes the strain of life just becomes so heavy and filled with heartbreak that if you stopped to rest you are afraid that you'll be crushed under the weight of it all. That is how I was beginning to feel. My mission president opened up his scriptures ... and</i>[read],<i>putting my name in place of Nephi's, 'Blessed art thou, Elder Taylor, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou ... hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments. And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever" (Helaman 10:4–5). The words spoke right out to me.</i><br><br><i>At that moment I felt justified before God. I knew of his acceptance of my offering.</i><br><br>The experiences of this young missionary fulfill the scriptural injunction of the apostle Paul to not "be wearied and faint" in our minds (Hebrews 12:3) but to be "transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God" (Romans 12:2). This elder waited upon the Lord.<br><br>By hoping for or anticipating Christ, our strength is renewed. The apostle Paul suggested that "though our outward man [or woman] perish, yet the inward man [or woman] is renewed day by day" (2 Corinthians 4:16). That thought is powerfully simple with wonderful imagery. The blessing of renewal may come through the keeping of our covenants. May I share a tender example of renewing covenants while waiting upon the Lord in uncertain circumstances.<br><br>On a humanitarian service assignment through the Kennedy Center for International Studies, Carol and Sterling Ottesen are currently teaching English in Jinan, Shandong Province, in the People's Republic of China. Carol wrote of their first Sabbath day in China:<br><br><i>The two of us sat in our living room side by side in two upholstered chairs with a small table between us on which we placed a cup of boiled water and a plate with a small piece of bread. We selected a song that we knew and that wouldn't be too sentimental: "Welcome, Welcome Sabbath Morning." Nevertheless, we couldn't make it through without a lump in our throats, and the sound was nearly inaudible as we finished with "Now we rest from every care. / Welcome, welcome is thy dawning, Holy Sabbath, day of prayer."</i><br><br><i>Sterling said a beautiful prayer and thanked the Lord that "Carol could come today," which made us laugh and cry at the same time. He then blessed the sacrament and we partook. After that we began our scripture reading in the New Testament ... then spoke a few words to each other in an assessment of our time here and a statement of our purposes. We both feel strongly about the rightness of this decision, and this gives us courage.</i>[Carol Clark Ottesen, personal communication, August 31, 1997]<br><br>In the culminating weeks of their yearlong stay in China, the Ottesens recently wrote:<br><br><i>We feel so blessed to have this experience--to know there are children here that we can learn from and that we can draw our circle of love around. ... We can only give in ways we know how, and sometimes that seems woefully inadequate. But we know that we have been watched over here and been made strong many times when we felt very weak. More than ever we can bear full witness of the sustaining presence of the Spirit when we sufficiently humble ourselves, given strength we didn't know we had.</i>[Carol Clark Ottesen, personal communication, May 10, 1998]<br><br>"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles" (Isaiah 40:31). The next promised blessing is to "mount up" with wings as eagles. Have you ever seen the wings of eagles? The extension of those powerful wings is incredible. Jehovah reminded the children of Israel, "I [bore] you on eagles' wings, and [bring] you unto myself" (Exodus 19:4). Speaking metaphorically, the apostle John wrote, "And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness" (Revelation 12:14). What are the wildernesses of our lives in which we struggle to mount up with wings as eagles?<br><br>In an international nursing course, students have the opportunity to spend a semester in Amman, Jordan, providing health care in a variety of acute-care and community-based health settings, including a Palestinian refugee camp, where more than 200,000 people live in abject poverty. Student experiences have been facilitated by able Brigham Young University faculty, including Dean Sandra Rogers, Dr. Rosanne Schwartz, Dr. James Toronto, and Professor Myrna Warnick. Students and faculty are pioneers, charting their course with faith and courage. They learn to literally wait upon the Lord for guidance and direction. Permission was gained to participate in evening prayers at the university mosque and to be instructed by the director of that mosque. He was amazed at the respectful and thoughtful questions posed by the Mormon students about the Islamic faith.<br><br>In this immersion experience, BYU students live side by side in on-campus housing with Arab students. These facilities lack many of the conveniences we take for granted here: hot water is sporadic, there are frequent power outages, and the bathroom facilities are challenging. I joined the nursing students for their evening devotional and was deeply touched. A hymn of faith, a heartfelt thought, a favorite scripture, and a humble prayer characterize these gatherings. The dormitory at the University of Jordan grew hushed as the sweet voices of these young students were raised in song and the Spirit filled a small student bedroom. One Arab Christian student asked permission to join our BYU students each night, audiotaping the devotionals so she could listen to them after the students from Brigham Young University left Amman. The light of the gospel of Jesus Christ was reflected in the faces and lives of our BYU students.<br><br>Two years after the initial experience in the 1995 fall semester, I returned to Jordan and listened to health-care personnel and university and government officials speak with fondness and respect about these little "Mormon nurses" who made such a difference with their brightness and enthusiastic approach to caring. Dean Sandra Rogers has said, "When the history of the Church in the Middle East is written, the footprints of the students and faculty in the College of Nursing will be indelibly stamped on those pages" (Sandra Rogers, BYU College of Nursing convocation, December 21, 1995). I believe this will be so. These students have waited upon the Lord and mount up with wings as eagles, making a difference in the lives of our Muslim brothers and sisters in the Middle East.<br><br>"But they that wait upon the Lord shall ... run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" (Isaiah 40:31). "Run," and not be weary; "walk," and not faint: I believe we are seeing this scriptural blessing come to pass as we witness the remarkable ministry of President Hinckley, now in his 89th year, who has traveled hundreds of thousands of miles throughout the world since becoming the prophet.<br><br>King Benjamin wisely counseled, "It is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27). The Prophet Joseph Smith received this counsel from the Lord: "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength ...; but be diligent unto the end" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4). Think of this promise of endurance in terms of a marathon, which requires consistent and long-term efforts: running with a burst of speed, but then consistently slowing to a walk and completing the race. Could this imply, in the words of Mormon, that as followers of Christ we walk peaceably rather than with an anxious and hectic haste? (See Moroni 7:3–4.)<br><br>We have been promised that as we "run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1), "in the strength of the Lord" we can do all things (Alma 20:4). We can run and not be weary, and walk and not faint as we wait upon the Lord to gain a fuller understanding of our life challenges. I testify that this is so. I bear solemn witness that continuing opportunities to wait upon the Lord have blessed my own life. I am sensitive to making reference to my own life experiences, but I'll use the excuse of Henry David Thoreau, who said, "I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well" (<i>Walden</i>[1854], I, Economy).<br><br>As a young child my life was secure and happy in a home centered in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The pain of the death of my mother when I was seven years old was cushioned by the love of my family. I graduated from Brigham Young University, married in the temple, supported my husband through graduate studies, held Church callings, and had five beautiful children. I was blessed with a wonderful and secure life. I had multiple opportunities to serve.<br><br>Then came the test of the depths of my faith. Twelve years ago I found myself a single mother. I felt shock that anything could so disrupt our family, disbelief that divorce could happen to the "perfect family," fear of the future, and anger. I held my sobbing children in my arms at night, trying to comfort their broken hearts. One of my little daughters carefully hid in her room a white envelope filled with tiny pieces of a photograph of her mother and father, shredded by the hands of a heartbroken child.<br><br>After 23 years of marriage and five children, after 14 months of litigation and thousands of dollars in legal fees, I found myself in a Kansas courtroom going through what was abhorrent to me. I was alone in that courtroom. I thought of another who was alone: he who said, "I have ... trodden the wine-press alone" (D&amp;amp;C 76:107). There are some things that must be done alone.<br><br>I was determined that although the adversary had destroyed a marriage, he would not destroy our family. On the wall of our home hung an inscription of the stirring commitment of Old Testament Joshua: "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15). I drew my children close in an intimate circle of love. We read scriptures on my big bed, my children like a litter of puppies sprawled across and around each other and me in a casual, happy atmosphere. Our family was strengthened by pillows of faith that cushioned and softened the blows of life with flexibility and resiliency. (See Lynn Clark Scott, "A Time to Heal,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1989, pp. 56–63.)<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>A line from Cervantes' great classic,</i>Don Quixote, ...<i>has given me comfort over the years. In that masterpiece, we find the short but very important reminder that where one door closes, another opens. Doors close regularly in our lives, and some of those closings cause genuine pain and heartache. But I</i>do<i>believe that where one such door closes, another opens (and perhaps more than one), with hope and blessings in other areas of our lives that we might not have discovered otherwise.</i>["The Opening and Closing of Doors,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, pp. 54–59; emphasis in original]<br><br>Ten years ago, unsolicited and across many miles, came the invitation to join the faculty in the College of Nursing at Brigham Young University. My first response was no. It would not be possible for me to uproot my children from their childhood home when they had already experienced so much pain. It would not be possible for me to complete my graduate studies, take my comprehensive examinations, pack a household, sell a home, move a family halfway across the country--a single woman with five children--all to be accomplished in a few short weeks.<br><br>In turmoil and doubt I went to the temple, seeking the Lord's guidance, and there came to me the gentle whispering: "Go." And with that counsel came these reassuring words: "For I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way" (1 Nephi 3:7).<br><br>The way was prepared, my graduate studies completed, the house sold, the offer accepted, and the move negotiated. Then came the day when Dean June Leifson unlocked the door to my small corner office in the Kimball Tower. As the door closed behind me and I was alone, I looked out the window to a magnificent view of the Provo Temple: the house of the Lord with the mountains beyond. I fell to my knees with tears of gratitude streaming down my face for the many blessings of a loving Heavenly Father to one of the least of his daughters.<br><br>Nearly nine years ago I knelt again with tears in my eyes--this time kneeling across the altar of the Provo Temple with a man who loves the Lord. It is only when we have known the bitter that we may prize the sweet (see 2 Nephi 2:15, Moses 5:11). The philosopher Kahlil Gibran observed, "The cavity created by the suffering through which we go becomes a receptacle for compensating blessings." I am grateful for the multitude of compensating blessings that have come as I waited upon the Lord. We were sealed in the house of the Lord, bringing together a blended family of 11 children. It seems significant that our first two grandsons were born only hours apart--and we planted two tiny spruce trees in celebration of those births. These two grandsons were baptized this month and are happily preparing to serve missions in only 11 short years! Missions and marriages and more grandchildren have come and keep coming. Our cup runneth over! We are rich in posterity. We anticipate two temple marriages of our last two children in the coming months and will be celebrating the births of three more grandchildren in the coming weeks. There are continuing challenges and opportunities for growth, including the death of a precious daughter, Lucianne, last July--but how blessed our family is.<br><br>The Lord described my own experience when he said, "Mine angels [shall be] round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88). Perhaps at times we mount up with wings as eagles because others are lifting us up. I have felt the strengthening influence of my parents succoring me on both sides of the veil. My children and grandchildren may never fully know the strength they continue to offer me and how they bless my life. Recently, when a medical emergency occurred in our home at three a.m., our two youngest sons were immediately at our bedside to support us. James and Jonathan were virtual angels standing at the foot of our bed, their white temple garments in stark contrast to the darkness of the night. I am so grateful for my wonderful husband. We continue to have enriching, bonding experiences as we grapple with challenges of many kinds and grow in our love for each other.<br><br>"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" (Isaiah 40:31). These affirming words continue in the following chapter in Isaiah:<br><br><i>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. ...</i><br><br><i>For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</i>[Isaiah 41:10, 13]<br><br>His promises are sure. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1>BYU’s Responses to “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My address today is related to the topic of strengthening marriages and families. It's a topic I'm generally comfortable with. But I'm not comfortable--and not just because I feel inadequate to address this audience. Family has been a popular topic for speeches on this campus recently. Both President Bateman and Elder Eyring have recently addressed us on the topic of "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102). A handful of other General Authority speakers have spoken on campus during the last few years about the importance of families. I've worried that we have reached a saturation point. What could<i>I</i>add? I reviewed these earlier talks in preparation for my talk today and was not surprised to find that these men, special witnesses and servants of the Lord, were lifting a voice of warning about the evil influences that threaten our abilities to build strong families.<br><br>If I<i>can</i>add something today, perhaps it is a view of the counteracting, good forces that also exist and that "inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; ... and to love God, and to serve him" (Moroni 7:13). I pray my remarks today will give you a better sense of the small but significant ways in which the Lord is using BYU to bless families. Yes, there is much darkness and confusion, but I believe a loving God is giving us precious gifts to help us build strong families. I interpret the promise given to Noah after the Great Flood that God would never again destroy the inhabitants of the earth (see Genesis 9:11–17) as a promise to keep the forces of good and evil in relative balance so that the purposes of God will not be hindered as they were during the time of Noah.<br><br>Moreover, I believe the prophecy of Malachi also promises us divine blessings related to the family in the last days:<br><br><i>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</i>[Malachi 4:5–6; see also D&amp;amp;C 27:9, 110:15]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee and others taught that the mission of Elijah "applies just as much on this side of the veil as it does on the other side of the veil" (Harold B. Lee, address given at the Priesthood Genealogy Seminar, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, 1973; quoted in Leaun G. Otten and C. Max Caldwell,<i>Sacred Truths of the Doctrine and Covenants</i>[Springville, Utah: LEMB, 1982–83], 1:16). Hence I believe that the Spirit of Elijah is here in great measure upon the earth, not just to link families to their dead ancestors but also to bless and strengthen living families.<br><br>There are strong, counterbalancing forces for good that will help God's children today build strong families. I will focus my remarks today on these forces for good. And, more specifically, given this campus setting, I will focus primarily on the role BYU is playing in blessing the lives of families today.<br><br>Building understanding and faith in the Lord's plan for eternal families is an essential part of the mission of this university. In a recent conference address, referring to practices for maintaining strong and happy families, President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "When all is said and done, this is what the gospel is about. The family is a creation of God. It is the basic creation" ("Living Worthy of the Girl You Will Someday Marry,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, p. 51). And, in a recent<i>Ensign</i>article, Elder Henry B. Eyring said, "Eternal life means to become like the Father and to live in families in happiness and joy forever" ("The Family,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 1998, p. 10). In LDS theology, God is a family man--a literal parent and an eternal companion. This life is to prepare us (see Alma 34:32) with earthly experiences that help us to become like him (see D&amp;amp;C 50:24, 93:28).<br><br>So, given the centrality of family to LDS theology and BYU's increased attention to family teaching, scholarship, and outreach, the time seems right to investigate how a loving God is using BYU to bless families. Let me express this in a different way: What are we doing at BYU to respond to the proclamation to the world on the family? From my perspective as a Latter-day Saint, a husband, father, and family scientist, the proclamation is an inspired document that brings together theology and revealed principles for building strong families. Our response at BYU to the proclamation will be an effective way to see how we are blessing families. I believe the proclamation is a latter-day Liahona for those seeking guidance through the wilderness of contemporary family life (see 1 Nephi 16, Alma 37:38–46). I like the metaphor of the Liahona in this instance. In reading the account of Lehi and his journey in the wilderness and some commentaries on it, it appears that Lehi had some familiarity with the wilderness through which he journeyed, yet it seems that the Lord knew that Lehi would need greater guidance in those challenging circumstances. Thus he provided the faith-activated Liahona as their physical compass to point the way that they should go (see 1 Nephi 16:28).<br><br>Similarly, I believe that the proclamation can be both a personal and an institutional Liahona to those who will place even a grain of faith (see Matthew 13:31–32) in its truths. I seek that faith. In addition I am grateful to know that the vast majority of family research that I am aware of is congruent with the principles of strong families articulated in the proclamation. Unlike the truth contained in the Word of Wisdom, which was revealed to Joseph Smith more than a century before its health consequences were clearly understood, the wisdom in the proclamation already has substantial scientific support. That knowledge reinforces my faith.<br><br>Unfortunately the breadth of the issues covered by the proclamation and the considerable volume of teaching, research, and outreach on family at BYU prevent a comprehensive treatment of this topic today. So I have had to make some hard choices. I apologize that I will not be able to tell you about all the praiseworthy work of teacher-scholars in various departments across campus. Also, I ask for your tolerance if my sampling is biased by my position in the Department of Family Sciences.<br><br>I want to focus my remarks today on two areas that I believe will be the most important, most strategic, and most enduring ways BYU is and will be responding to the proclamation. One area is our teaching related to family. A second area is our effort to understand and promote stable and happy marriages.<br><h2><b>Teaching Related to Family</b></h2><br>First, our teaching. I have thought a lot about this, and ranking our teaching as one of the two most important things we do at BYU to promote the proclamation was not simple. Ultimately, however, this ranking should not come as a surprise, given that our primary mission is to provide BYU students with a first-class education in a context of faith and example. Our teaching makes an important contribution to strengthening the families of the world in three ways: first, through the religious education our students receive; second, through students who graduate to go into the helping professions focused on families; and third, through providing a good foundation for students to create their own strong families.<br><h3><strong><i>Religious Education as a Foundation for Strong Families</i></strong></h3><br>First, I want to note the religious education given to BYU students. Understanding the plan of salvation orients us to the purpose of families in this life and the nature of our premortal life and our eternal possibilities. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin recently said, "Seeing life from an eternal perspective helps us focus our limited mortal energies on the things that matter most" ("The Time to Prepare,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, p. 14). Recall that the proclamation, after a brief introductory declaration, begins with instruction on the plan of salvation. Later on, the proclamation sets forth the Christlike life as the surest foundation for successful marriage and family life, emphasizing faith, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreation. By the way, in contrast to what you may have heard, good research has consistently identified religious devotion as a strong element in happy families (see I. Reed Payne, Allen E. Bergin, Kimberly A. Bielema, and Paul H. Jenkins, "Review of Religion and Mental Health: Prevention and the Enhancement of Psychosocial Functioning,"<i>Prevention and Human Services</i>9, no. 2 [1991]: 11–40; Darwin L. Thomas and Marie Cornwall, "Religion and Family in the 1980s: Discovery and Development,"<i>Journal of Marriage and the Family</i>52, no. 4 [November 1990]: 983–92). Thus I am grateful for the religious instruction and experience students receive here. They are crucial ways in which we are attending to the proclamation and helping to create eternal families.<br><h3><strong><i>Seeding the Earth with Faithful Family Professionals</i></strong></h3><br>As I have reflected further on family teaching at BYU, one point of analysis is how well our students are providing a positive influence in the family professions. Of course, we start from a strong base. We are all aware of the tremendous quality of students who come to BYU these days. Our students studying family who desire graduate work routinely go to the best programs in the country. We place hundreds of students each year in clinical programs in marriage and family therapy, social work, and psychology, as well as programs focused more on education and research. Our own graduate programs related to family studies are well thought of. I believe the values these students have and the training they receive here and at other institutions combine to create a group of talented professionals that helps many people prepare for and deal with challenging family problems.<br><br>To illustrate, I spoke recently with a friend and graduate of our marriage and family therapy program. I'll call her Kate. During our conversation, Kate recounted to me an inspiring story in her work as a therapist. She had recently received a note from a couple she had helped five years ago, and they expressed their appreciation for her efforts.<br><br>"Thanks for not giving up on us," the note said. They were doing great. She said that this temple-married couple first came to her with a set of common but serious problems. He had returned from his mission and quickly married a young woman whom his parents wanted him to marry. A baby came within a year. He was feeling smothered and regretted his quick marriage and lack of freedom. He began spending most of his time away with friends. She was needy, lonely, and depressed. They sought professional help, but after working with my therapist friend for six months, nothing was getting better. At one critical session, the couple begged the therapist to acknowledge the failure of their marriage and justify their strong, mutual desire to get divorced.<br><br>"We just can't do it," they said.<br><br>Kate's trained professionalism covered her natural response: "You're telling me?!" Kate said she was as frustrated as the couple was. At that time she did not have a great deal of clinical experience, did not know what else to do, and felt that there was no way to save this marriage. Perhaps it was time to end marriage counseling and begin divorce counseling. Kate herself had experienced the divorce of her parents growing up and had survived. She was no stranger to divorce. But something stopped her natural response. Instead, she gently refused to provide the justification the couple wanted. She appropriately placed the burden back on them. "You are the ones who have to decide to break your covenants," she said. "You are the ones who will have to live with the decision."<br><br>The couple returned two weeks later. They were strangely affectionate and responsive to each other. The therapist asked for an explanation. The husband responded: "I thought a lot about it. I just decided I was going to be committed to this marriage. That's all." With that commitment they began working on their challenges together, with Kate's help, and resolved their problems. Perhaps there is nothing terribly unusual about this therapeutic incident. But I can't help but wonder what another therapist, one without a strong faith in the eternal nature of families, would have said at that critical moment when an eternal family hung in the balance.<br><br>In addition to fine clinicians, every year we also seed the academic institutions of the United States and beyond with talented young teacher-scholars who studied family as undergraduate or graduate students at BYU. Our influence is being felt; we are not invisible. Indeed, our numbers in the National Council on Family Relations, a national academic and professional organization to which many family scholars here belong, are large enough that we have to be a little careful. A few years ago a colleague of mine at another university was observing the large number of BYU people who were at our national conference and half-jokingly and half-annoyed asked me if we were trying to take over the world. I admit my casual response to her was not completely honest!<br><br>Our disproportionate presence in organizations like this are, in part, a result of the large number of students at BYU studying families. This is a phenomenon that requires some explanation and analysis. Over the past 10 to 15 years there has been tremendous growth in the number of students studying families. This is most easily illustrated by looking at the Department of Family Sciences, but I suspect that the growth in some other majors, such as sociology, psychology, political science, and others, may be due in some part to the increased interest our students have in helping families.<br><br>BYU has the largest undergraduate enrollment in family sciences in North America and probably the world (see John Touliatos,<i>Graduate Study in Marriage and the Family,</i>3rd ed. [Fort Worth, Texas: Human Sciences Publications, 1996], pp. 140–41). There are currently about 1,000 students in active majors in family sciences; the department now teaches the most credit hours of any academic unit in the university (3.2 percent of all university credit hours). Since 1989 the number of enrolled students in the active majors that make up the Department of Family Sciences has grown more than 200 percent.<br><br>What explains this growth? It is tempting just to see it as following the national trend; family studies and human development departments have experienced a growth rate of almost 150 percent since the mid-1980s (see<i>Chartbook of Degrees Conferred, 1969–70 to 1993–94</i>[Washington, D.C.: National Center for Education Statistics, 1997], appendix, pp. 103–272 passim). The increasing enrollment nationwide is probably due to such factors as an increased interest in family and human development issues and services, a concern for family problems, and more students coming to college from challenging family backgrounds who desire to prepare for more effective family life. Each of these explanations applies to us as well. But I am convinced there is a deeper, spiritual motive behind the growth. I believe that students here are responding to the call of the Spirit. The Lord needs more of his meek Saints, schooled in good scholarship about families and human development and grounded in their faith in the restored gospel, to join with other good people to be a brighter light (see Matthew 5:14) and the salt of the earth (see Matthew 5:13) to a world that increasingly needs eternal principles of strong families, lest the earth be utterly wasted when the Lord comes again (see D&amp;amp;C 128:17).<br><h3><strong><i>Preparing Better Spouses and Parents</i></strong></h3><br>However, less than 20 percent of family sciences undergraduate students go on for graduate education in the field that will allow them to influence the family-related professions. A few will take teaching positions in high schools and teach classes in family relationships, child development, and home economics. And there are some enterprising students who are building flexible careers as professional family-life educators who will wrap comfortably around full-time family responsibilities. Furthermore, many graduates provide much-needed volunteer services in the community to strengthen families. Still, most family sciences undergraduate majors, even those who now graduate as certified family life educators, are focusing their education to prepare themselves to be better spouses and parents. And, because more than 80 percent of family sciences majors are women, most of whom desire a career at home as full-time mothers and homemakers, we are preparing a substantial army of full-time homemakers. These young women believe what Elder Henry B. Eyring has said, "The highest and best use [they] could make of [their] talents and [their] education would be in [their] home[s]" ("The Family," p. 16).<br><br>Most of these students do not make the choice to be a full-time homemaker naïvely; they are aware of the risks that some will never marry, some will not be mothers, and some will experience the heartbreak of divorce. Hence they choose to do as Elder Eyring recently said, to take "courage and faith to plan for what God holds before [them] as the ideal rather than what might be forced upon [them] by circumstances" ("The Family," p. 16).<br><br>I teach a class with a section devoted to full-time homemaking. We discuss both its challenges and its rewards. The students know the economic risks of removing themselves from the paid labor market in an era of marital instability. They know that full-time homemakers have a higher risk of serious depression compared to mothers who are in the paid labor force. They know the demographic realities of maternal employment outside the home. They are not naïve; or, at least, they don't leave my class naïve. But they also read the words of the prophets and talk about the rewards of full-time homemaking. And in their course evaluations, many comment that after staring reality in the face they feel more prepared and even more confident of their career choice as a full-time homemaker and take with them a new appreciation for their courageous choice.<br><br>This is not to say it is an easy choice. There are many talented students who want to make a contribution to the professions, and still may at a slower pace or at a later point in life, but who postpone or slow that process by full-time homemaking. A recent example is Sarah, who graduated in family sciences with a 3.9 GPA and was eagerly accepted into a family-related master's program. She completed that program in one year instead of the typical two, leaving a wake of impressed professors behind. She recently had a scaled-down version of her master's thesis accepted for publication in a leading journal in the field. She could go anywhere for a PhD and desires to do so. But she has delayed that course for a small season--a season that often ends up being 20 years or longer--to devote herself to her family. I'm not saying that this is the exact course all should take in similar circumstances. But it is a laudable choice for Sarah and many others, and one that comes with sacrifices and personal struggles. The scriptural counsel given to Emma Smith in section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants is no easier for Sarah than it was for Emma: "Continue in the spirit of meekness. ... Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him" (D&amp;amp;C 25:14).<br><br>I hope we are honoring this course of study focused on preparation for full-time homemaking, even knowing that many who will follow it will not be able to fulfill that goal quite as planned. As I listen to these students, they sometimes speak of a lack of respect from some students for their course of study. That is unfortunate and unkind.<br><br>Of course many students will not major in a family field but will take a class or two in preparation for that work. Helping so many students prepare well for marriage and parenting, I believe, is one of the most important things we do at BYU to promote the principles of the proclamation and that helps to counterbalance the forces of family disintegration.<br><br>Although I give our teaching efforts about family good grades thus far, we can do more. An exact figure is difficult to estimate, but I estimate that less than 20 percent of BYU undergraduate students take a class focused on family. And, given that women make up a large majority of students in these classes, I suspect that the proportion of male students who take a course focused on family may be less than 5 percent. Men, you will benefit from preparing yourself for the work of marriage and parenting as well. Elder G. Homer Durham said, "Man ... has obligations to learn the difficult art of fatherhood in homemaking" ("Woman's Responsibility to Learn," in<i>Woman</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 36). I hope we can increase the proportion of BYU students--especially men--who take advantage of the wonderful resources we have here to prepare them for family life.<br><br>One major initiative on the horizon that I hope will increase the number of students taking a family course is a class being developed that focuses directly on the proclamation to the world on the family. The class will bring together the best gospel scholarship and the best family scholarship in a way that promotes a deeper understanding of and commitment to the principles in the proclamation. It will also provide valuable practical information. Development of this course will be benefited by the production of an edited volume on the proclamation now being done under the direction of the Center for Studies of the Family. Scholars will integrate faith and reason in relation to the topics covered in the proclamation. This volume will be an important resource for the course, as well as bless the lives of Saints throughout the Church.<br><br>The availability of a new course is only a small thing in the substantial scope of the BYU undergraduate experience. But like the Liahona, "by small means the Lord can bring about great things" (1 Nephi 16:29; see also Alma 37:6–7, D&amp;amp;C 64:33, 123:15–17). I am confident that students who will take this class will be better able to achieve their desires for happy families and to articulate the principles of the proclamation.<br><br>I want to extend a challenge to BYU students. First, take seriously your religious education and experience here. As you build faith in the teachings of Jesus Christ and incorporate Christian virtues into your character, they will provide you with the surest foundation possible for building and maintaining a happy and successful family. In addition, prayerfully consider taking advantage of other courses that will increase your knowledge and skills for a strong marriage and family. At BYU all students receive a solid general education to be more effective thinkers and writers, to be better citizens in the community and nation, to lead healthier lives, and to appreciate the arts. This is great. But the greatest source of growth and happiness in your life will come from your family relationships. I especially want to invite male students to consider this invitation. Preparation for your work within the walls of your future home is even more important than preparation for your work in the marketplace. Please do not be tempted to think that your wife or wife-to-be will be able to care for your family without much need of your help.<br><br>I sense that many young people today--both men and women--have ambivalent feelings about marriage and parenting. Much of this ambivalence comes from experiencing the effects of family dissolution. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said in a CES fireside address here a few years ago, "The next generation always lives downwind of the toxic trends of the previous generation" (CES fireside, Brigham Young University, June 4, 1995). Successful marriages and families do require hard work; there are many significant challenges and pitfalls for families today. But there is a knowledge base about strong marriages and families that can help you train better for this challenging work. And ultimately--meaning eternally--it is the most important work you or I will do in this life, as the prophets continually remind us. And it is the work in which your Heavenly Father is engaged (see Moses 1:39). Hence you will come to understand more about divinity and the things of eternal significance through marriage and parenting than in any other way. Do not take lightly the gifts the Lord has provided for you here to help you prepare for a strong marriage and family. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift" (D&amp;amp;C 88:33).<br><h2><b>Promoting Marriage</b></h2><br>Now let me shift to the second area I want to highlight in terms of how a loving God is strengthening families and the role BYU is playing in manifesting that love. It is our efforts to understand and promote marriage as the foundation for personal happiness, strong families, and civil communities. President Hinckley said in a recent conference address, "The truest mark of your success in life will be the quality of your marriage" ("Living Worthy," p. 51). The proclamation states that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102). The vast majority of people today still desire strong and enduring marriages. But there are many forces that work against these good desires. And in many ways the character traits and skills, as well as the social and ideological reinforcements needed to maintain strong marriages, are weak in their support of those good desires.<br><br>I believe BYU can make a valuable contribution to promoting stable and happy marriages. Of course our teaching is important in this regard, but let me now focus on our scholarship. In the last two years at least four prominent, non-LDS family scholars have visited our campus. Each in one way or another has remarked that they expect and want BYU to be a leader in supporting and promoting the institution of marriage. Their rationale is not complicated. Many family scholars at most academic institutions are ambivalent about the institution of marriage these days. We live in an era of high rates of marital dissolution; about half of first marriages in the United States and a higher proportion of second marriages will end in divorce (see David Popenoe, "American Family Decline, 1960–1990: A Review and Appraisal,"<i>Journal of Marriage and the Family</i>55, no. 3 [August 1993]: 527–55). About 30 percent of children born in the United States are born to unmarried parents (see Tim B. Heaton,<i>Family Trends</i>[Provo: Center for Studies of the Family, 1997]). We are all aware of the tragic epidemic of spouse abuse in this country and across the world. Hence it is easy to see why many scholars do not see marriage as a positive or necessary institution these days.<br><h3><strong><i>Positive Voices and Trends</i></strong></h3><br>BYU has an important work to do in its scholarship and outreach to strengthen marriage. Fortunately we will not be alone in this effort; God is using many people to bring about his purposes and to counterbalance the forces that view marriage as an outdated or oppressive institution. There are some scholars out there who are rigorously evaluating the research and concluding that the academic ambivalence toward marriage is not well founded; it is more ideological than empirical. For instance, Linda Waite, an excellent demographer and recent president of the American Population Association, argued in her presidential address that<br><br><i>social scientists have a responsibility to weigh the evidence on the consequences of social behaviors in the same way as medical researchers evaluate the evidence on the consequences of (say) cigarette smoking or exercise.</i>[Linda J. Waite, "Does Marriage Matter?"<i>Demography</i>32, no. 4 (November 1995): 499]<br><br>Based on a broad review of the research literature, Waite concluded that marriage has significant positive effects on physical health and longevity. Married men and women have more frequent and more satisfying sexual relationships. Married men and women also have more occupational success and more economic resources. And on a long list of indicators, and controlling for many factors, children's well-being is also substantially higher if their parents are married. Waite, like an increasing number of scholars, believes that social scientists have been too quick to assign<i>all</i>the responsibility for differences between the married and unmarried to the selection of the psychologically healthy into marriage or the psychologically unhealthy out of marriage, "and not quick enough to consider the possibility that marriage<i>causes</i>some of the better outcomes we see for the married" (Linda J. Waite, "Does Marriage Matter?" p. 498; emphasis in original). And let me add to this some research findings just hot off the press that found in 16 of 17 countries studied that married individuals were significantly more happy than non-married individuals. This was true for both men and women. And this was true even when controlling for many potentially confounding variables (see Steven Stack and J. Ross Eshleman, "Marital Status and Happiness: A 17-Nation Study,"<i>Journal of Marriage and the Family</i>60, no. 2 [May 1998]: 527–36).<br><br>In addition, Bill Doherty, an influential marriage and family therapist and current president of the National Council on Family Relations, has been an effective critic of value-neutral marriage counseling. He calls for therapists "to recognize and affirm the moral nature of marital commitment" and to help build "a cultural ethic that would make it just as irresponsible to terminate a marriage without seeking professional help as it would be to let someone die without seeing a physician" (William J. Doherty, "How Therapists Threaten Marriages,"<i>The Responsive Community</i>7, no. 3 [summer 1997]: 39–40).<br><br>In the face of discouraging trends, there is also unprecedented interest in building stronger marriages and preventing preventable divorces. For instance, the state of Louisiana last year passed a law providing couples with a choice to enter into a more committed form of marriage, called a covenant marriage, as opposed to the common no-fault-divorce marriage that can be terminated at any time by either spouse. This voluntary higher level of commitment to marriage requires couples who choose it to have some form of premarital counseling that emphasizes the lifelong commitment associated with marriage and the responsibilities and ethical obligations of marriage and parenting. In addition it requires all couples who choose a covenant marriage to do all they can, including marriage counseling, to rectify marital problems before seeking a divorce. Arizona just became the second state to pass a covenant marriage law. More than 20 other states are currently considering comparable legislation.<br><br>Similarly, the Florida legislature became the first in the nation to pass a bill that endorses and provides incentives for premarital education. Couples who take a four-hour educational course before getting married will get a substantial savings on their marriage license. The premarital education will instruct couples on conflict resolution, which is so critical to stable marriages; general communication skills; financial responsibilities; and the challenges of parenting. Instruction may be given by counselors, educators, or clergy. Perhaps even more significant is that the legislation also includes a requirement for 9th and 10th graders to complete one-half credit in life management skills to include marriage and relationship skill-based education.<br><br>I'm not sure what effects policies such as these will have. Overall, perhaps not much. On the other hand, law can be a powerful symbol for what we hold important as a society. I<i>do</i>believe, though, that policies like these are influenced by the Lord's spirit because he desires to bless his children in their wishes for strong marriages.<br><h3><strong><i>BYU Scholarship and Outreach to Promote Strong Marriages</i></strong></h3><br>What are we doing at BYU with our scholarship to strengthen marriage? Again, my sampling is biased. But let me highlight three ongoing efforts.<br><br><i>Covenant Marriage.</i>First, an interdisciplinary team of BYU scholars recently was invited to participate in a study of covenant marriage in Louisiana. Time won't permit me to tell you how this opportunity came about, but I believe the Lord's hand was in it. We will participate in a national team of scholars to observe changes over the next five years in Louisiana and Arizona with regard to attitudes about marriage and divorce and will study the decision-making processes of couples deciding whether to get a covenant marriage or a no-fault-divorce marriage. This should be fascinating. In Louisiana, when he asks, "Will you marry me?" she is likely to respond with the question "What kind?" Some couples may have their first and last argument over which type of marriage they want. We will also study already-married couples as they think about converting their vows to a covenant marriage. Thousands of couples in Louisiana have already "upgraded." The potential to learn how people are thinking about marriage these days is tremendous. And we hope to discern if divorce rates will be reduced by these changes.<br><br><i>Defense of Heterosexual Marriage.</i>A second ongoing project to strengthen the institution of marriage comes from Professor Lynn Wardle in the Law School. Professor Wardle has been pretty much a lone voice among legal scholars defending marriage as a heterosexual relationship. There are significant efforts in several states to legalize marriage for homosexual couples. Professor Wardle has been active in his scholarship and advocacy, including some involvement in the recent Hawaiian court case, attempting to point out the risks of such a course of action. His scholarly advocacy is unpopular among legal scholars and has come at some professional cost. Given the prevailing philosophies of the day, Professor Wardle has a difficult task to defend marriage as a union exclusively between a man and a woman, as the proclamation says, and he doesn't get enough help from social scientists to do this. Without more work in this area, Professor Wardle's legal defense of traditional marriage will be difficult. I expect BYU scholars can contribute to a greater understanding of why the union of opposite sexes is critical to the purposes of marriage. These efforts are comparatively small, but "by small means the Lord can bring about great things" (1 Nephi 16:29).<br><br><i>Marriage Preparation Education and Research.</i>Earlier I mentioned the Florida legislation promoting marriage preparation education. We are well prepared to contribute effectively in this area. A team of BYU scholars, led by Professor Tom Holman, has produced perhaps the finest marital preparation questionnaire available. Engaged or seriously dating couples can take this instrument and receive feedback, preferably with the help of a counselor, on potentially challenging issues they may face to build an enduring marriage. Data collected from tens of thousands of individuals over the past 15 years and follow-up studies are allowing this team of researchers to understand premarital factors that predict stable and happy marriages, which in turn is providing more reliable information to couples and counselors that should help people be better prepared for the adventure of marriage. BYU is a leader in this area.<br><br>This is just a sample of our efforts to strengthen marriage. I wish I had more time to list other worthy efforts. From this sample, however, I hope you can see that we are responding in small ways to the proclamation. I believe the Spirit of the Lord is influencing these and other efforts. I am satisfied that these small offerings are acceptable to the Lord and that he will multiply them in our day, just as he multiplied the fishes and the loaves to feed the hungry during his earthly ministry long ago (see John 6:6–14).<br><h2><b>Using the Proclamation to Guide our Scholarship</b></h2><br>Of course there is always more we can do to respond to the proclamation and to strengthen families. Earlier I issued a challenge to BYU students. Now I issue a challenge to BYU faculty whose scholarship touches on family issues. I believe it will be valuable to reexamine and refocus our scholarly efforts based on the principles articulated in the proclamation. Just as the Liahona pointed the way Lehi's family should go and led them "in the more fertile parts of the wilderness" (1 Nephi 16:16), I believe that if we give greater heed to the proclamation as our guide in family scholarship, it will lead us in the more fertile parts of the academic wilderness to a bountiful land with much intellectual fruit (see 1 Nephi 17:3–5).<br><br>I am speaking as much or more to myself as to others. I have concentrated my scholarship in the area of fathering. In the proclamation the most specific language regarding fathering is, "By divine design, fathers are to<i>preside</i>over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to<i>provide</i>the necessities of life and<i>protection</i>for their families" (emphasis added). As I think about two of these concepts--presiding and protecting--I cannot think of two less-studied aspects of fathering than these. The concept of paternal protecting has received little attention despite its obvious relevance to modern-day life with its many physical and spiritual dangers. Also, the concept of paternal presiding has not received much direct investigation. Contemporary notions of egalitarian relationships, which are generally good, probably inhibit investigations of how fathers can preside in their families. Perhaps most family scholars have difficulty seeing how presiding can be a positive feature of family life, or how this can be reconciled with the obligation "to help one another as equal partners," as stated in the proclamation.<br><br>Anyway, as I think out loud, I can see the potential for much intellectual fruit in a study of the concepts of paternal presiding and protecting. Yes, there would be pitfalls and dangers as I journey through this scholarly wilderness. It was not easy for Lehi and his family either; they experienced trials and afflictions as they traveled in the wilderness for many years (see 1 Nephi 17:1, 4). But they were guided and protected, and they prospered as they followed their Liahona (see 1 Nephi 17:2–3). I pray those blessings flow our way as we place greater faith in proclamation principles and allow them to lead us in fruitful paths.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I am grateful for a loving God who gives when we ask and opens doors to us when we knock (see Luke 11:9–10). There is a great need for a lot of asking and knocking these days when it comes to building strong marriages and families. And I am convinced that in an area so important to our temporal happiness and eternal welfare, the Lord offers to all his children bread, not stones (see Luke 11:11–13), and "milk and honey, without money and without price" (2 Nephi 26:25). For "he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world" (2 Nephi 26:24). God is offering many gifts to strengthen families. I pray our small efforts at BYU to respond to the proclamation will add to these good gifts, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Alan J.

<h1>s We Are Seen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I've envisioned this moment and considered what to share with you today, my mind has gone back to the hundreds of times I've attended events here in the de Jong Concert Hall. Thinking about those times caused me to reflect on the changes that have come into my life since I first arrived at BYU 30 years ago and reminded me that life's journey is accomplished one small step at a time. Usually I sit at the very back of this hall. If someone had told me in 1968 when I transferred to BYU that today I would be here at the front of this hall, speaking to you, I would have been incredulous. The shy, self-conscious, insecure person that I was at that time could never have imagined this moment.<br><br>Today I would like to speak to those of you who may be where I was at that time--those of you who may not yet know what you have to share with others or those who may long to become something more than you now are, something that seems very far out of reach. I want to talk about how we see ourselves and discuss some of the steps we can take to see ourselves more clearly. I believe this subject is relevant not only to those of you who are trying to discover your potential, but also to those who are seeking to move beyond past boundaries, to chart new personal territories, and to discover more of your eternal potential.<br><br>To preface my remarks, I want to share three experiences.<br><br>The first: One cool spring day a few years ago I went to a park in Salt Lake City with some of my family. We were feeding ducks in a pond, and Benjamin, my nephew who was then 12 or 13 years old, mused aloud, "I wonder what they see. With their eyes on the sides of their heads, what do ducks see when they look out at the world?" I thought this was a very good question! I certainly couldn't answer it, and I was left wondering.<br><br>The second situation: I have a dear friend, Linda, who has been blind since birth. She leads a very dynamic life. In earlier years she was a professional singer and teacher; now she's a stay-at-home mom with five sons. One evening I was talking with Linda, telling her of a dream I had had the night before. As I described the surroundings, the people's faces, and their responses, I realized how visual my dream had been, and a question came into my head. I asked Linda what she sees when she dreams. She thought a moment, then replied, "I see the way I see--mostly in light and shadows." She went on to describe what she could see at that moment: the darkness of night where she knew the window was, the bright light overhead, the shadow against the wall that she knew was the piano because she has touched it and knows its shape and knows where it is located in the room. I pressed her a little more, and she said that sometimes in her dreams she is conscious of sounds and temperature and smells. And when sight is involved, she sees the same things she sees in her daily life.<br><br>There is one more situation I'd like to share: One Sunday I attended sacrament meeting in another ward that meets in our building. I watched a sweet family a few rows in front of me. My attention was drawn to their son, Spencer, who was sitting in his wheelchair. Spencer is a very handsome boy, now 13 years old. His movements are uncoordinated and he cannot speak. His developmental level appears to be that of an infant. He has big, beautiful, clear eyes that look out on the world but seem to see nothing. As I watched his head moving from side to side and his eyes directed first here, then there, I wondered what he saw through those eyes that seemed to register no recognition.<br><br>Each of these experiences caused me to think about how we see, how we perceive. And a scripture came to my mind--Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 13:12, where he said: "For now we see through a glass, darkly." New Testament commentaries teach us that the word translated here as<i>glass</i>actually refers to a mirror. The imagery Paul invokes in his statement may be unclear to those of us who know mirrors as the clear reflective glass we look into every day. When you try to envision what it is to look "through a glass, darkly," perhaps you, like me, see a steam-covered bathroom mirror after a shower. But if we consider the imagery in the context of Paul's times, the phrase "looking through a mirror, darkly" carries powerful implications.<br><br>A mirror in Paul's day was not made of glass but of metal, and it required constant polishing. One commentator stated that "a sponge with pounded pumice-stone was generally attached" to the mirror (Marvin R. Vincent,<i>Word Studies in the New Testament</i>[Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1887–1990 (1976 reprint)], 3:266). This allowed the user to polish the metal before use in order to remove the tarnish and more clearly see the reflection.<br><br>So often in our mortal state we view life through a tarnished metal mirror. There may be smudges here and there that obscure our vision. There may be uneven surfaces that distort the picture. Fine detail may be completely indistinguishable. When we peer at ourselves in that imperfect mirror, what do we see? What blemishes seem to be there that would disappear if our glass were more highly polished? What dimensions do we fail to see? What would we see if our mirror were perfect?<br><br>I would like to focus my remarks today on how we see ourselves and suggest that there are steps we can take to polish the glass that we now look through, darkly. We can sharpen and clarify our vision of ourselves so that an eternal perspective permeates the self-image that drives our lives. In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul adds that "when that which is perfect is come" (v. 10), we will no longer see through a glass, darkly, but we will see "face to face" (v. 12).<i>Now</i>we "know in part," but<i>then</i>we shall know even as we are known and see as we are seen (see v. 12).<br><br>Mortality brings limitations to our ability to grasp our full potential. Neal Maxwell suggests that one reason we see "through a glass, darkly" is that the veil that separates us from our previous existence becomes "a film of forgetting that covers the memories of [our] earlier experiences" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 9). With recollections of our premortal life blocked, we must work hard to discover our God-given gifts and talents. Each of us who has watched a child in the first few weeks of life can testify of the uniqueness of each spirit. We come to earth "trailing clouds of glory," as William Wordsworth said ("Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood" [1807], st. 1), and each cluster of clouds, it seems, is distinct and gives the opportunity for discovery of the eternal nature of that individual.<br><br>My patriarchal blessing lists several gifts and talents that the Lord has endowed me with, then adds that I have "other gifts which [I] will discover and enjoy." I have always been conscious of the fact that I must discover those gifts that are uniquely mine. I believe each of us has a similar quest and that as we pursue it, we are better able to define ourselves and we become more fully prepared for the journey Heavenly Father would have us follow.<br><br>To give a context for the thoughts that follow, I want to paint another picture for you now. I'd like to share with you a rough sketch of some of my personal experiences and describe how I have come to know myself better over the years.<br><br>During the early 1950s polio had reached epidemic proportions. Every summer the virus seemed to thrive, and, in spite of the best efforts to prevent its spread, thousands of children and adults fell prey to it. Researchers devoted their energies to finding a way to combat the disease. Finally, in 1954, Jonas Salk's vaccine was available for general use. I remember receiving the injection that year when I was six years old and a few years later taking the sugar cube that contained a more stable oral vaccine. There were three strains of polio, so my parents were anxious that I receive these vaccinations even though one strain of polio had already taken its toll on me when I was only three years old.<br><br>My mother described how heartsick she felt when she saw her little three-year-old grow ill in the summer of 1951. Polio was such a dreaded disease, so Mom watched carefully when I became ill. In her heart she knew before the doctors did that this was more than a severe case of flu. That was the beginning of years of hospitalization, therapy, and surgery. Over time I learned to walk using crutches and braces, but I never had enough strength to climb stairs or pick myself up from a fall. It was safer to navigate the world in my wheelchair, though around home I used crutches most of the time. My childhood memories alternate between happy days with my family and long months in Shriners' Hospital. Nights at the hospital were lonely with my family so far away, but the days were filled with friends and schoolwork and childhood pranks. I have some pretty good stories I could tell you!<br><br>Outside the hospital I was always very conscious of the fact that I got around differently than others. The chair was hard to ignore. One of my first struggles was over how to deal with the blatant stares of other children. When our family went shopping or sightseeing, kids would stop and stare and point and wonder out loud, "What's wrong with her? Is she crippled?" In my immaturity I pouted and frowned over this, but my sisters found a way to help me cope. (I'm not sure I'd recommend this approach now, but it worked beautifully for us then!) Whenever a child stopped with open mouth and pointing fingers, Paula would stand on one side of me, Patsy on the other, and the three of us would stare intently at the offending child until she went running back to her mother in tears. We would laugh and go on our way, focusing on whatever we had been doing until the next child reminded us that there really was something different about our family group.<br><br>My junior high years were probably the worst. I wore metal braces on my legs, which I thought were dreadfully ugly, and the orthopedic shoes I wore with them were terribly unfashionable. Afternoon dances in the gym were torture. (Though when I was a student here at BYU, my roommates helped me realize just how painful those afternoon dances were for everyone. They actually thought I had been lucky! At least I had a reason for being a wallflower!)<br><br>One day in my senior year in high school, I remember going down the hall at school with Mrs. Cole, my music teacher. I was in a manual wheelchair at the time, and as I pushed myself along, I couldn't keep pace with her brisk walk. As soon as she realized the problem, she stopped and said, "Oh, sorry, I forget you're in that chair!" That was the first time anyone made such a comment to me, though it has been repeated many times since. That moment stands out in my memory as the beginning of my realization that the chair was not the defining element of who I am. I realized that others could see beyond the chair and beyond my disability, to think of me as me.<br><br>Well, what can we learn from what I've just described? As I look at the process I was going through, I wonder how often, in life's circumstances, do we focus only on our weaknesses, on those areas where we fall short, where we would like to improve? Do we give equal time to our strengths? Do we look beyond the surface and seek to discover the qualities that lie latent within us, waiting to be nurtured and developed? Or do we wallow in what we are not, or what we don't have?<br><br>Neal Maxwell urges us to<br><br><i>make quiet but ... honest inventories of our strengths. Most of us are dishonest bookkeepers and need confirming "outside auditors." He who in the first estate was thrust down delights in having us put ourselves down. Self-contempt is of Satan; there is none of it in heaven. We should, of course, learn from our mistakes, but without forever viewing the instant replays lest these become the game of life itself.</i>[<i>Notwithstanding My Weakness</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981), p. 10]<br><br>Remember the question my nephew Ben asked about how ducks perceive the world? How do they see? Is their world fragmented into the right-hand view and the left-hand view? Does it ever come together into one cohesive whole? I'm sure there are folks in this audience who could give us a detailed scientific explanation for this, but recently I asked my cousin Kent to describe what he knows about how birds see the world. Kent has raised exotic birds and has studied their habits extensively. He explained to me that birds have both monocular and binocular vision. With their monocular vision they can focus directly in on what they see through one eye. We've all watched a robin, head cocked to one side, peering intently at the ground, looking for her prey, then nabbing it!<br><br>But birds also have the ability to blend the vision from both eyes into one large picture. With their peripheral vision from both eyes combined, they are able to see objects directly in front of them, and, by turning their heads only slightly, they can see nearly 360 degrees around their heads. Birds use both their monocular and binocular vision, depending on the need of the moment.<br><br>What about us? As we look at ourselves, do we see only through our myopic, monocular vision? So often in my youth that is exactly what I did, focusing in on my physical problems, defining myself by my limitations, failing to turn on that wider vision and see myself in perspective. I suspect we all do that at times.<br><br>I've always loved Alma's advice to his son Corianton. In counseling his son to give up his wanton ways and return to righteousness, Alma said:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins</i>[or perhaps we could say here, weaknesses]<i>trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.</i>[Alma 42:29]<br><br>During the times in my life when I have focused too intently on my weaknesses and inadequacies, I have heard in this scripture a gentle reminder to be kind to myself. It is important to examine our weaknesses, but we must keep them in perspective and let them motivate us to stretch for better things rather than allowing them to obscure the view of our eternal potential.<br><br>In gaining a broader perspective, it is often helpful to listen to the input others give us about ourselves. What kinds of praise do you hear repeatedly? That you're fun to be around? That you listen well? That you are a loyal friend? Those who know us well will see traits that we may be blind to. Listen carefully to your parents, sisters, brothers, friends, teachers, and leaders. They can polish your mirror, then turn it back toward you, giving you a clearer reflection of your true self.<br><br>As friends and family members, it is also important that each of us give honest, insightful feedback to our loved ones. We should never be stingy with our praise but always ready to convey sincere, heartfelt compliments--as well as honest, careful critiques. Neal Maxwell's comment about making an honest inventory of our strengths mentioned the value of "outside auditors" who can see with objectivity and clarity what we ourselves might miss in our day-to-day accounting.<br><br>So my first suggestion to you for coming to know your potential more completely is to honestly assess your strengths, to listen to the feedback others give you, and to refrain from concentrating only on your weaknesses.<br><br>The context for my second suggestion requires another explanation. We have all heard faith-promoting experiences of priesthood blessings that lead to the restoration of health. One of the most memorable stories to me, which most of you have undoubtedly heard, was told by Matthew Cowley and frequently repeated over the years. He told of being asked to bless a nine-month-old baby. As he was about to begin the blessing, the father said, "By the way, give him his vision when you give him a name. He was born blind."<br><br>Twelve years later, when Brother Cowley returned to that area, the branch president said, "Brother Cowley, the worst thing you ever did was to bless that child to receive his vision. He's the meanest kid in the neighborhood, always getting into mischief."<br><br>I've never doubted the reality of that experience, nor of hundreds of others I've heard, but for years such testimonies would leave questions tugging at my heart. Those questions had more to do with me than with the people those testimonies were about. We are taught that healing powers can be called forth when there is sufficient faith and righteousness on the part of those giving and receiving the blessing. I have received many priesthood blessings in my life, including one from President David O. McKay shortly after I became ill with polio. But I'm still in my wheelchair. No apparent miracles have occurred in my life.<br><br>I vividly remember one Sunday in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake attending the choir broadcast prior to the morning session of general conference. My friends and I visited with the gentleman seated beside us. He was curious about my situation and asked a few questions. Then, just before the broadcast began, he leaned over, looked me straight in the eyes, and said, "You know, if you had enough faith you could walk!"<br><br>I was speechless. After all, that was the very thought that had plagued me for so many years. Whenever I heard those Matthew Cowley stories, I was left with haunting questions about my own faith. It was easy to conclude that if the outcome of priesthood blessings is based on the faith of those participating, and if the person giving the blessing is a prophet of the Lord who surely does not lack faith, there is only one other factor in the equation. And the nagging thought persisted that if only I had sufficient faith I could be healed.<br><br>For months after the incident in the Tabernacle I pondered and prayed over the question. One day as I was reading my patriarchal blessing, my mind returned to the priesthood blessing I received from David O. McKay. My mother repeatedly told me that in the blessing, President McKay had not promised me a full recovery. His words were simply, "Your limbs will be restored so that you can lead a useful and happy life." I should add that at that time, I was able only to turn my head from side to side and weakly wiggle the fingers on my left hand. In recent years doctors have expressed amazement that I am able to do as much as I do, given the extent of neurological damage I experienced.<br><br>That day when I was thinking about the literal fulfillment of President McKay's blessing and puzzling over what the man in the Tabernacle had said, I was drawn to a statement in my patriarchal blessing that clearly defines my mission in life. For the first time I realized that my specific mission can best be fulfilled sitting in a wheelchair rather than walking around every day. I had always believed that restoration of health was completely dependent on faith. I finally began to realize that lack of faith is not the reason I still use my wheelchair. What I understood that day is that the Lord's will is another vital element in the equation. No matter how much faith we exercise, no matter how righteously we are trying to live, the Lord may have reasons for withholding his healing power or for withholding whatever it is we are pleading for. There may be purposes beyond our understanding that can be accomplished only by going through an experience rather than by going around it, by enduring it rather than having that cup pass from us.<br><br>Like my friend Linda who sees "darkly" through her natural lenses but who uses her other senses in creative ways to compensate for her lack of sight, we, too, must recognize that limitations may prevent us from experiencing everything in life. There may be some things we cannot do, some things we cannot give. But we must also recognize that when we are weak in one area, we will likely find compensation in another. Though my physical well-being has been less than whole since I was three years old, I have been blessed with everything I need to fulfill the purpose for which I've been sent to earth. It is my responsibility to discover where my strengths lie and develop them in such a way that my weaknesses are minimized.<br><br>In Ether 12:25, Moroni confided in the Lord his fear that the Gentiles would mock his writings because they were less polished than his spoken words. The Lord replied:<br><br><i>My grace is sufficient ... that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;</i><br><br><i>. . . I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and ... if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:26–27]<br><br>I have a deep and abiding testimony that as we endure challenges and push through our weaknesses, our spiritual muscles or character muscles grow dramatically stronger. Our tailor-made trials provide a customized cross for each of us to bear, and it is through those trials that we gain the strength to make our most enduring contributions.<br><br>The second suggestion, then, for seeing yourself more clearly is to look deeply into your experiences in an effort to discover how you can compensate for the weaknesses and challenges that are certain to be a part of your mortal experience. Read your patriarchal blessing for understanding. "Search, ponder, and pray" for understanding of your trials (<i>Songbook,</i>1995, p. 109). Carefully examine the strengths you develop as you compensate for specific weaknesses. They may help you understand where you should focus your energies in order to fulfill the mission that only you can accomplish.<br><br>Finally, I want to return to Spencer, the young boy whose eyes register no recognition of the objects or the people around him. Recently I spoke with his mother, who told me that he has what is called lissencephaly, or smooth brain syndrome. His brain never formed the folds and convolutions that characterize a properly developed brain. He functions at the level of a six-month-old infant. In answer to my question about what he sees, his mother said that doctors assume his eyes and optical nerve function normally in a physiological sense, or at least they once did. But because his brain never developed, his cortex cannot process what he sees, and so he is diagnosed as cortically blind.<br><br>Is there an analogy here for our experiences? Do our eyes ever take in data but fail to properly process it? Maybe our physical eyes are not limited, like Spencer's, but what about our spiritual eyes? The Savior himself said of those who did not understand the meaning of his parables, "Because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not" (Matthew 13:13).<br><br>A powerful example of how, through the Spirit, our eyes may be opened to broader views is recorded in the Old Testament. In 2 Kings 6 we read that when the king of Syria learned that Elisha's prophetic powers were the reason Syrian soldiers continually lost battles against Israel, he sent a large army to destroy Elisha. The scriptures tell us that at night a great host of Syrian horses and chariots surrounded the city where Elisha lived.<br><br>Elisha's servant rose early the next morning, saw the vast army surrounding the city, and said to his master, "Alas, what shall we do?"<br><br>Elisha's response in verse 16 was meant to be reassuring. He said, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them." Apparently, though, his servant was not reassured, so Elisha prayed, "Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (v. 17). Only when his eyes were opened was this young man able to perceive the spiritual hosts who were there to assist them.<br><br>One quick aside--I find the outcome of this story fascinating in light of our theme today. The Lord temporarily cursed the Syrian army with blindness to allow Elisha to overpower them. Elisha then led the Syrians into captivity, restored their sight, instructed the king of Israel to feed them, then finally released them to return to their own king. All this was done to demonstrate the Lord's power to them. The last sentence in verse 23 tells us that "the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel." It seems we could build another entire talk around this verse.<br><br>I would like to return to the point illustrated in the scripture about Elisha and his young servant. Can our eyes be opened to see in a spiritual sense? As we allow the Spirit into our lives, is it possible for us to perceive a dimension of reality that is invisible to the natural eye? This may be a very simplistic analogy, but what comes to my mind here are the visual puzzles that have become popular in the last several years. Undoubtedly many of you know what I'm referring to. When you casually glance at one of these puzzles you see a picture or pattern of some sort. But when you allow your focus to alter slightly, there's a momentary sensation of hovering on the brink of seeing something more, and a bit of depth begins to emerge. Then, suddenly, three dimensions appear, and you see an entirely new picture. At times it's hard to hold onto the new image--at least for me that's true. And it usually takes me a long time to find the depth. But with a little practice it becomes easier to see multiple dimensions and to see them more rapidly.<br><br>Do you suppose this is how it might be as we come to know ourselves more fully? We gaze at the mirror images that reflect who we are, and at first we see only the surface--perhaps we focus on our flaws and imperfections. But as the eyes of our understanding open, we begin to see in a different plane. As we allow the Spirit to adjust our focus, the picture we have of ourselves takes on new dimensions. We begin to catch glimpses of our eternal nature and to see ourselves as we are seen by our Father in Heaven.<br><br>But how do we do this? How can we make this become a reality in our lives? I believe that the first step is to pray that our eyes will be opened. Then when we discover those new dimensions within ourselves, we must create opportunities for testing our newfound abilities.<br><br>I vividly recall days when, professionally, I was so unsure of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out in even the smallest, most friendly meetings or classroom settings. I had no confidence in my ability to contribute to the ideas under discussion. Somewhere along the line I began to realize that I did have good ideas and that if I didn't share them, no one else would. And as I shared one idea, other ideas evolved. From there I eventually recognized that teaching what I had learned was highly satisfying. And I decided that more education would give me the chance to share in new ways and in broader circles. Those additional educational opportunities opened even more doors through which I have glimpsed new paths I want to follow. I imagine this process will continue eternally; at least I hope it will! I expect that many of you could share similar tales of self-discovery and progress.<br><br>When the Savior appeared to the Nephites, he taught, "I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). In footnote<i>b</i>of Matthew 5:48 we are told that the Greek word translated as<i>perfect</i>means "complete, finished, fully developed." C. S. Lewis wrote that the command to be perfect "is not idealistic gas." He added that if we will let him, God<br><br><i>will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God ... His own boundless power and delight and goodness.</i>[<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Touchstone, 1996), p. 176]<br><br>I would like to summarize by reading again from 1 Corinthians 13, this time beginning in verse 9:<br><br><i>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</i><br><br><i>But when that which is perfect is come</i>[meaning, perhaps, when the Savior comes; or, perhaps, when we are perfected],<i>then that which is in part shall be done away.</i>[We will then have the fullness available to us.]<br><br><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</i>[Think of this sentence in eternal terms. When I was a mortal, I thought and understood as a mortal, but when I eventually become an eternal being and the veil is removed, then I will put away mortal limitations.]<br><br><i>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then</i>[we shall see]<i>face to face: now</i>[we]<i>know</i>[ourselves]<i>in part; but then shall</i>[we]<i>know</i>[ourselves]<i>even as</i>[we are]<i>known.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:9–12]<br><br>Our awareness of our individual eternal nature will gradually unfold to our view as we focus on our strengths, listen to the feedback of our loved ones, find ways to compensate for our weaknesses, ponder and pray over our experiences, and invite the spirit of understanding into our lives. I pray that we will each seek to increase that awareness, that we will be bold enough to give ourselves new experiences through which we can test our newly discovered talents and abilities, and that we will continually seek Heavenly Father's help in moving toward the potential he already sees within us.<br><br>I know that our Father lives. I know that he loves each of us with a tender father's love. I know that he desires that we each return to him.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that celestial glory is where "God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever" and that those who dwell there with him "see as they are seen, and know as they are known" (D&amp;amp;C 76:92, 94). I pray that we may each find our way to that glory, where we will see ourselves and our loved ones as our Father now sees us. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Julene Butler was the assistant university librarian for public services at BYU when this devotional address was given on 9 June 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ng the Tree - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, good morning! Several years ago a young returned missionary came to see me. I had been his bishop several years before and had helped him to work through some problems from his youth and to prepare to serve a mission. By the time he began his mission, he was ablaze with the fire of the gospel and served enthusiastically and honorably. It was now a year or two after he had returned home, and he told me that his excitement about the gospel and the Church had been growing dim. He also told me of a strained relationship with his parents and of his general discouragement and bitterness. He asked me in frustration, "Bishop, why am I losing my testimony?"<br><br>In response to his question, I asked him, "Are you nourishing the tree?" At first he didn't understand, so we talked about the principle taught in chapter 32 of Alma. Looking back on our conversation, I wish now that I had said more and read more to him. Perhaps he is listening this morning or may see a replay of this devotional. Perhaps some of you have had or are having feelings similar to his.<br><br>Alma had likened the exercise of our faith--meaning our trust in the Lord--to planting a seed. As we continue to trust and obey the Lord, that seed will grow into a tree. But Alma warned us that we are not finished at that point. Here are his words:<br><br><i>But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</i><br><br><i>Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof</i>. [Alma 32:38–39]<br><br>We often think of that discourse when we think of those who are first learning about the restored gospel and experimenting with the goodness of its glorious message. But it also applies to us after we have been in the Church for many years, and it applies to all of our relationships with the Lord. We need to continue nourishing the tree of faith, to continue deepening our roots, and to be partaking of the fruit of the love of God. Indeed, this metaphor applies very generally to our spiritual health, and Alma was teaching a true principle about spiritual nutrition.<br><br>So I've come today to talk about food--specifically,<i>spiritual</i>food--but also about its metaphorical connections to<i>physical</i>food. I realize that, in some ways, I'm preaching to the choir. After all, you are all here--at a BYU devotional. You already know of the importance of spiritual nourishment or you wouldn't be here. Most of you are probably very healthy, with the spiritual equivalent of rosy cheeks and sparkling teeth. But this life is full of challenges that would exhaust our spirits, weaken our resolve, and infect us with sin. There are times when we feel a little less than at our peak, a little less than fit for a celestial marathon, and maybe even a bit weak of soul. We all have spiritual peaks and valleys, and sometimes we may feel that we've been in a valley for an awfully long time and the memory of our last peak is fading fast. If so, there may be help in my message this morning.<br><br>As I've suggested, many of the Lord's commandments use words and images associated with physical food.<sup>1</sup>Thus, he teaches us that there is a close correlation between spiritual and physical nourishment. I believe that he uses this metaphor not just for poetic impact, but because it teaches some vital principles about how to avoid serious pitfalls and how to fulfill our mission here on the earth. Let's review that mission.<br><br>Latter-day scriptures make it clear that our ultimate goal is to become like our Father in Heaven and our Savior so that we can live with them. This is not an instantaneous transformation but requires a<i>process</i>--a process called "sanctification," made possible by the Lord's grace. In fact, in this process, we receive "grace for grace" until we "receive of his fulness," just as our Savior exemplified (D&amp;amp;C 93:12–13, 19–20). For our part of the process, we need to make righteous choices, and we need to be strong against powerful destructive influences. As we do so, the Lord makes "weak things become strong" unto us (see Ether 12:27). Thus we grow stronger and stronger until we are able to live the law of a celestial kingdom, without coercion or restraint. This becomes the criterion for determining if we can ultimately live where our Father in Heaven lives and where there is celestial glory, "For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory" (D&amp;amp;C 88:22).<br><br>The Lord's commandments are really an instruction manual for the process. Among those instructions are guidelines to help us succeed rather than fail. To visualize this, let's think for a minute about a similar process: growing physically.<br><br>In elementary school and high school, we learned that our physical growth and health require that we provide our bodies with proper nutrition. We need a regular intake of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. If we have that intake, we are far more likely to have strength, energy, mental health, growth, healing, and a defense against the constant attack of infectious organisms around us. But the same is true of spiritual growth and health. That is, we need a regular intake of spiritual food--like prayer, scripture study, temple attendance, and loving service to others. If we have that intake, we will have moral strength, clear and inspired thinking, growth in spiritual stature, and a defense against the constant attack of the adversary.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is also a negative side. If we deny our physical bodies the necessary nutrients over a period of time, we can develop deficiencies and even starvation. The symptoms of malnutrition and starvation include such problems as weakness, mental confusion, loss of memory, decreased growth, decreased defense against infection, and even a decreased ability to absorb nutrients (see Lawrence M. Tierney, Jr., Stephen J. McPhee, and Maxine A. Papadakis, eds.,<i>Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment,</i>36th ed. [Stamford, Connecticut: Appleton and Lange, 1997], p. 1129–32). Do you realize that there can also be spiritual starvation? If we deny ourselves spiritual nutrients, the results will include moral weakness, confusion, lack of growth, and more vulnerability to temptation and sin.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, these spiritual effects are real, and<i>we are all vulnerable.</i>Every bishop works with members whose lives have been devastated by serious sin. During my service in that office, I heard many confessions in which such a heartbroken member would say, "I never meant for this to happen!" Almost in disbelief, this devastated soul would explain that he or she had always been a faithful member of the Church with a strong testimony, sometimes even holding major leadership positions in the Church. How could this have happened?<br><br>My questions to the member were always, "Are you praying every day? Are you spending time with the scriptures every day?"<br><br>Almost without exception, the answer was, "No."<br><br>I would question further, "Did you<i>ever</i>do these things?"<br><br>Sometimes, the answer would be, "Yes, I used to pray and study."<br><br>Then I would ask, "When did you stop?" Invariably, I learned that the prayer and the scripture study stopped first, and then the serious problems began. I would walk away from those interviews with increased feelings of my own vulnerability and of my own need for the Lord's protection and nourishment.<br><br>Not only does good spiritual nutrition help to prevent sin, it also helps with repentance, with spiritual healing. I use the word<i>healing</i>because sin causes injury to the spirit, it causes the wounding of our eternal soul. With Christ as our Master Physician, the healing process requires remorse and confession and restitution, but it also requires time and nourishment in order to regain our spiritual strength and equilibrium and to repair the painful damage. That is why repentance from serious sin will always include regular prayer and scripture study--food for healing.<br><br>But we are also vulnerable, perhaps even more vulnerable, to another kind of spiritual disease besides the kind that leads to formal Church disciplinary action. I speak of the more subtle disease of spiritual retardation--a kind of stunted growth and lethargy that just prevents us from growing or going anywhere. It's the kind of malady that was the point of a Mormon folktale about Satan and his generals discussing how to prevent a Latter-day Saint from achieving exaltation. In the story, one of Satan's generals suggested, "Let's tell him (meaning the Latter-day Saint) that there is no God and no Christ."<br><br>Satan, thoroughly experienced in such matters, quickly dismissed that plan, saying, "That won't work. He knows by the Spirit that there's a God and a Christ, and he won't believe us."<br><br>At that point, a second general offered, "Well, all right, we won't challenge his testimony of God and Christ; we'll just tell him that Joseph Smith was a fraud and there was no restoration of the gospel."<br><br>Again, Satan quickly saw the flaw and said, "That won't work either; he's read the Book of Mormon and has had the confirmation of the Spirit."<br><br>Frustrated, a third general asked, "Isn't there anything we can do to prevent him from reaching exaltation?"<br><br>With a wicked smile (because that's the only kind he has), Satan answered, "Oh, yes. We'll let him have his testimony of God and Christ and of the Restoration. We'll just tell him that there's no hurry."<br><br>Well, it's just folklore, but it teaches a true principle that if we aren't diligent about our spiritual nourishment, we can lose our way. Without the energy derived from regularly feasting at the Lord's table, we can weaken and then be tempted to indulge "just a little" in forbidden things like R-rated movies, pornography, dishonesty, gossip, Sabbath breaking, meanness, and contention, to mention just a few of the spiritual poisons in Satan's arsenal. Whether it leads to more serious transgression or not, it will surely prevent our progress and cause the tree to wither. We will withdraw ourselves from the Spirit of the Lord just a little--just enough not to have his help in the face of temptation or disappointment or to help us endure a trial, and just enough that the sweet and sacred experiences of the sanctification process just won't happen (see Mosiah 2:36).<br><br>The young returned missionary who came to see me and to seek help with his weakening testimony admitted that he had lost the good habits practiced during his mission--habits of daily personal prayer and daily scripture study. He was spiritually malnourished and was displaying the symptoms of that condition. His vision was cloudy and his strength was too low to overcome the dark influences of the evil one and to maintain an eternal perspective.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, it is vital that we recognize how vulnerable we are to the forces that would prevent us from returning to our celestial home. We need spiritual nutrition to strengthen us against those forces and to help us in our growth process. It is that kind of nourishment that the Lord repeatedly urges us to obtain as he uses the metaphor of physical food. Let's review some aspects of that metaphor.<br><br><b>The Savior said we should hunger and thirst after righteousness.</b>"Blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost" (3 Nephi 12:6). The Lord is telling us how much we should desire the things of eternal value. To hunger and thirst are among the most powerful urgings of our physical being. This is not a description of a casual interest or even of a pleasant longing; this description is of a physical craving for life-sustaining sustenance--for that which we need for our very existence. He is telling us that we should crave righteousness as though our existence depended on it--and, of course, it does. Incidentally, we hunger and thirst for things we don't yet have, and the Lord is commending us and promising us a blessing not because we are already righteous, but because we desperately wish to be.<br><br><b>The things of the Spirit become "delicious" to us.</b>Said Alma, "The word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me" (Alma 32:28).<br><br>Think of the power of the word<i>delicious.</i>Of all our sensory experiences, one of the most intense is associated with our sense of taste. It uses not only our taste buds but also our senses of smell and touch. In fact, taste is so potentially pleasurable, it plagues those of us who try to resist its tempting call. By saying that the influence of the Lord's Spirit would be "delicious," Alma was teaching us that that influence would become the most pleasurable of all pleasures. Said the psalmist, "O taste and see that the Lord is good" (Psalms 34:8).<br><br>We all can relate to the power of this metaphor. One of our favorite family stories is about our son Aaron when he was two years old. Climbing up on the couch, where his mother was reading the scriptures, he asked, "Mom, why are you always reading that book?"<br><br>She answered, "Because it is delicious to me."<br><br>Just then the phone rang, and she went to another room to answer it. When she came back a few minutes later, there was Aaron with several pages from the New Testament in his mouth, testing his mother's description. To this day, her Bible is missing Romans 10–14.<br><br>Many scriptures reinforce this metaphor. To the Hebrew Saints, Paul talked of those who had "<i>tasted</i>of the heavenly gift, and . . . the good word of God," and King Benjamin spoke to those who had "<i>tasted</i>of [the Lord's] love." And to Lehi, the fruit of the tree in his vision was "most sweet, above all that [he] ever before<i>tasted"</i>(Hebrews 6:4–5, Mosiah 4:11, 1 Nephi 8:11; emphasis added).<br><br><b>The Lord wants us to "feast" on the word.</b>We are not only to hunger and thirst after righteousness and to find it delicious, but the Lord wants us to respond proactively by seeking spiritual nourishment. Nephi instructed us that after we are baptized, we must "press forward,<i>feasting</i>upon the word of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20; emphasis added).<br><br>Imagine yourself at a feast. What kind of food would be there? Would it be what we sometimes call "junk food," or would it be nutritious food carefully and lovingly prepared? Would you sample a few items and then hurry away? The instruction for us to "feast" suggests that we partake slowly and deliberately, enjoying the quality and goodness until we are filled.<br><br>I'd like to talk for a few minutes about what Nephi's counsel can mean in our lives by talking about<i>feasting in prayer, feasting in the scriptures, feasting in service,</i>and<i>feasting upon Christ.</i><br><h2><b>First: Feasting in Prayer</b></h2><br>In the first few years after my wife and I joined the Church, my prayers would not be classified as "feasting in prayer." They were more like nibbling or, at best, snacking. They were brief and often without depth. Seldom did I feel like I was communing with our Father in Heaven or that he was hearing me. Have you ever felt that way? Influenced by the scriptures and numerous talks from the pulpit, I realized that I needed to spend more time in prayer. So I finally decided that I would pray for a half-hour each morning. The first day I arose early and locked myself in a spare bedroom in our apartment, knelt by the chair, and placed my watch next to me on that chair. I then began to pray. When I had finished repeating to the Lord the same things I had said to him rather routinely every day for the previous year or two and could think of no more to say, I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. Three minutes had elapsed. I remember thinking, "Oh great, what am I going to talk about for another 27 minutes?"<br><br>It was then that I admitted to myself that I wasn't allowing the Lord into my heart. Part of the problem was that I wasn't even allowing<i>myself</i>into my heart. You sisters are probably saying, "Typical male!" I simply wasn't thinking consciously about my concerns, about the people I loved, or about my own repentance. I wasn't even taking the time to prepare for my time with the Lord. Think about that. If you had an appointment to talk with President Hinckley, wouldn't you plan ahead and think about what you would like to talk with him about? Yet I wasn't doing that with the Lord.<br><br>That morning, realizing my problem, I began constructing a list of things that were really important to me and that I would like to talk with the Lord about. Each morning I reviewed that list before beginning my prayer, and the list continued to grow as I thought of new things to add. In the next few days and weeks, my prayer became much more meaningful, and I began to feel the promptings and reassurances of the Lord during my prayer. I began to look forward eagerly to my private interview with the Lord. Furthermore, it soon became common for me to look up at my watch and discover that the 30 minutes had already gone by, and I had only discussed the first few items on my list.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, I urge you to feast in prayer. I'm not suggesting any particular length of time for your prayers. I am only suggesting that you take the time to move past the formal and familiar phrases that often become too routine. Remember the Lord's counsel about "vain repetitions" in prayer (Matthew 6:7 and 3 Nephi 13:7). Even more important, take the time to commune with the Lord--to share with him the innermost thoughts and feelings of your heart--and the time to listen and to taste of his love.<br><h2><b>Second: Feasting in the Scriptures</b></h2><br>One of the greatest sources of spiritual nourishment for all of us is the scriptures. Here again the Lord counsels us to feast rather than hurriedly rush through some verses to satisfy the requirements of a religion class or merely to complete a goal, like finishing a marathon.<br><br>There is strength and renewal in the Lord's words. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 135]<br><br>President Kimball was talking about feasting and nourishment, as was President Ezra Taft Benson when he promised:<br><br><i>There is a power in the book</i>[of Mormon]<i>which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path. . . . When you begin to hunger and thirst after those words, you will find life in greater and greater abundance.</i>["The Book of Mormon--Keystone of Our Religion,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 7]<br><br>I hope you have experienced the fulfillment of that promise, as one student who, after spending time on a reading assignment in the Book of Mormon, reported:<br><br><i>This week I have four tests and two papers, and I have been neglecting my spirituality. This section</i>[of reading]<i>uplifted me a lot at a time I really needed it. I still have the same amount of work to do, but I feel relaxed and at peace.</i><br><br>That principle was reinforced in our family when, over a number of years, my wife suffered serious health problems that left her completely exhausted. The only way she could find the strength to continue on each day was to drink from the scriptures for 30 minutes to an hour every morning. Because she was so exhausted, she doubted that she would remember very many details of what she had read, but regardless of what she could remember mentally, she felt strength come to her to sustain her physically and emotionally throughout the day.<br><br>But the nourishment of the scriptures also feeds our minds, because the Lord has promised that the Holy Ghost would bring all things to our remembrance that he has said unto us (see John 14:26). Continuing with the story about my wife, after a number of years her strength began to return, and she was called to teach Sunday School, a position in which she still serves. To her delight, she experienced a fulfillment of the Lord's promise, as the Holy Ghost does indeed bring to her remembrance scriptures that she read during that very difficult time when she didn't think that she would remember anything at all. But the promise is a two-edged sword, for if we never read his words in the first place, there is nothing for us to remember.<br><h2><b>Third: Feasting in Service</b></h2><br>We all know that the greatest commandments are that we love the Lord and that we love our neighbor (see Matthew 22:35–40). The word<i>love</i>in these commandments is a verb--something we do. As we perform acts of kindness and service for our neighbors, we nourish<i>them</i>with the warmth and encouragement of fellowship within the covenant. Because of the love they receive, they are strengthened in their resolve to keep their covenants with the Lord and to follow our good examples. But the miracle is that<i>we,</i>who provide the service, are also nourished. Feelings of the Spirit buoy us up and draw us closer to the Lord, and our spiritual health is increased.<br><br>One of the miracles of the Lord's Church is that it is designed to involve us in serving each other. As we perform the duties of our callings and work together in Church service projects of love, we experience the joy of serving others, and we are nourished and strengthened.<br><br>But the concept of feasting in service implies that our attitude of service extends beyond the Church to all of our interactions with others. I call this the attitude of "shepherds versus hirelings." The Savior said:<br><br><i>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</i><br><br><i>But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, . . . seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: . . .</i><br><br><i>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</i>[John 10:11–13]<br><br>When someone around us encounters a problem or challenge, do we "flee" to the safety of indifference, or are we one of the Savior's undershepherds who provides real caring and real help? This metaphor has become a common part of the vocabulary in our home. For example, there seem to be numerous instances in our everyday lives when we are given the proverbial runaround and brush-off by someone who is supposed to help but doesn't. So when my wife or I encounter a clerk or receptionist who is truly helpful and concerned, we say, "I found a shepherd today."<br><br>Most of the people on this campus are wonderful examples of shepherds who give loving and professional care, but, unfortunately, there are occasional lapses. One of my colleagues tells of a student coming to his office for help with a problem. The student had been trying for several hours to resolve the problem and had been sent from one office on campus to another. The student was also from another country and was not only bewildered by the new culture but felt very helpless. The last office that sent him away told him to come to our department, and by the time he entered my colleague's office, he was nearly in tears. After listening to the student describe the problem, my colleague made one or two phone calls and, within a few minutes, solved the problem. The grateful student thanked him over and over again for being his savior.<br><br>Knowing how many good people work in the offices at BYU, I am surprised when I hear stories like the one I just related, but I do hear them occasionally. And the sheep who are abandoned are not just students but also include other members of the university as well as visitors to campus. My plea is for all of us--faculty, staff, administrators, and students--to feast on service by being shepherds. As we do so, we will be nourished as we also nourish others and help to build Zion here at BYU.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Feasting upon Christ</b></h2><br>This is the ultimate and most important spiritual food of all. We are to feast on the "word," but remember that<i>Christ is the word.</i>This is how he said it:<br><br><i>I am the bread of life. . . .</i><br><br><i>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</i><br><br><i>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</i><br><br><i>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</i>[John 6:35, 54–56]<br><br>This imagery reminds us of the ordinance of the sacrament, but its significance extends beyond the ordinance as well. When we eat and drink, we bring something<i>inside us--</i>even more than inside us, we make it part of us as our bodies incorporate that food into our very cells. Our Savior is pleading with us to do likewise with him: to bring him inside us figuratively and to incorporate him into every fiber of our being. In the sacrament we internalize the important aspects of his Atonement, including the Resurrection and our purification from sin. But we also renew our covenant to remember him. He is the ultimate food, and we remember him best by assimilating his characteristics into our souls. I am suggesting that in all of our praying, all of our studying, and all of our serving, we strive to become like him who is the Example of all examples and the Goal of all goals.<br><br>My final plea this morning is that we feast often. With physical food, we eat regularly and frequently to provide a steady supply of nutrients. Why should it be otherwise with spiritual food? With prayer, the Savior commanded us to "watch and pray<i>always,</i>lest [we] be tempted" and also to "pray<i>always,</i>that [we] may not faint" (3 Nephi 18:15, D&amp;amp;C 88:126; emphasis added; see also Luke 18:1, 21:36; Alma 13:28). How often is "always"?<br><br>We all remember Lehi's vision of the tree of life. Lehi saw the process by which we are to reach eternal life. He saw those who had entered into the path, and his son Nephi later explained that the gate leading to the path is baptism (see 2 Nephi 31:17–18), so we conclude that those on the path had already been baptized. But those on the path could not see the way because of the mist of darkness, representing the temptations of the devil (see 1 Nephi 12:17). Only those who were "clinging" or "holding fast" to the rod of iron that led by the path were successful in reaching the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:24, 30).<br><br>Have you ever tried walking without being able to see? Maybe it was a game with blindfolds, and you started off walking in what you thought was the right direction. Do you remember taking off the blindfold and being surprised at how far you had wandered from your goal? Maybe you almost pinned the tail on the lampshade instead of on the donkey. Would a rod of iron have been helpful?<br><br>Now here's the point: How do you walk while clinging to a rod of iron? Unless you release your first grip, you can't walk very far. So you obviously need to let go and then re-grip the rod with every step. Each new grip restores your bearings. Each new grip helps prevent you from going very far off course. If you stop using the rod, thinking, "I remember what direction to go," you may quickly wander off the path, just as you did with the blindfold. How often do we need to feast on the word, which was represented by the rod? At every step, or, in other words, every day.<br><br>We might be tempted to say, "I prayed a lot during my mission" or "I read the scriptures a lot when I was a Sunday School teacher, so I can stop for a while" or "I remember those feelings and those details, so I don't need to do those things right now." Isn't that like saying, "I remember what food looks like or tastes like, so I don't need to eat for a few weeks or a few months"?<br><br>Every culture develops habits of eating their meals at certain times to help its people remember to eat. Young people of your age may think it amazing that anyone would forget to eat. But it's very helpful to have the habit of eating meals at certain times. Notice, I said, "meals," rather than snacks, which we might be tempted to reach for in place of more well-balanced offerings. In our culture there's breakfast (unless we sleep in until right before class), lunch (which you hope you can start eating if the devotional speaker would just stop talking), and dinner. The<i>habit</i>of daily spiritual meals provides a similar value.<br><br>Years ago a family home evening manual told the story of 17-year-old Karen, who received for her birthday a beautiful lamp in the shape of a parasol. When the light was lit, the parasol also turned. As she placed it on her dresser, she told her nine-year-old sister, Lisa, who shared her bedroom, "Never touch this lamp." One night while Karen was out on a date, Lisa thought that it would be fun to have the special lamp on while she waited for her older sister to come home. Excitedly she ran across the room, and just as she reached for the lamp, she tripped on the shoes she had left on the floor. Down went Lisa, and down went the lamp, which broke into pieces on the floor.<br><br>When Karen later quietly tiptoed into the room, she was greeted by the sudden sight of the broken lamp and the equally sudden attempt by Lisa to quickly explain what had happened. Karen became furious. In her anger she hurled cruel, hurtful words at Lisa for what she had done. In quick, angry movements she got ready for bed. Then, because it was her practice--her good habit--before she climbed into bed, she knelt down for her evening prayer. Have you ever tried to pray when you're angry?<br><br>As she knelt there, this daughter of God wrestled in the spirit against the forces of the evil one. In the background she could hear the sobs of her little sister. In a situation that defines one of the most important battles of mortality for all of us, Karen prayed for help. Finally she was able to rise from her knees and go the bed of her little sister, where she told Lisa that she loved her and that she was far more important than any lamp.<br><br>Karen was helped because she had the good habit of regular spiritual feasting. Before she even recognized Satan's attack, her wise habit was providing protection. We all need that kind of protection.<br><br>I'd like to conclude by going back to where I began--with Alma's discourse. To my young returned missionary friend and to all of us, Alma's warning is vital. Indeed, if we neglect the tree and take no thought for its nourishment, it will wither away. But, like all of the Lord's warnings, there is also a bright side, a promise. Here it is, in Alma's words:<br><br><i>Nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree. . . .</i><br><br><i>And . . . behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet . . . ; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</i>[Alma 32:41–42]<br><br>That we may commit ourselves to habits of daily spiritual nourishment and be sanctified is my sincere prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Kenneth A. Solen was a professor and chair of the BYU Department of Chemical Engineering when this devotional address was given on 16 June 1998.</i><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>1. James E. Talmage, in his book<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>includes the following note about the metaphor of food in relation to spiritual things:<br><br><i>"The idea of eating, as a metaphor for receiving spiritual benefit, was familiar to Christ's hearers, and was as readily understood as our expressions--'devouring a book,' or 'drinking in' instruction. In Isaiah 3:1, the words 'the whole stay of bread,' were explained by the rabbis as referring to their own teaching, and they laid it down as a rule, that wherever, in Ecclesiastes, allusion was made to food or drink, it meant study of the law, and the practice of good works. It was a saying among them--'In the time of the Messiah the Israelites will be fed by Him.' Nothing was more common in the schools and synagogs than the phrases of eating and drinking, in a metaphorical sense. 'Messiah is not likely to come to Israel,' said Hillel, 'for they have already eaten Him'--that is, greedily received His words--'in the days of Hezekiah.' A current conventionalism in the synagogs was that the just would 'eat the Shekinah.' It was peculiar to the Jews to be taught in such metaphorical language. Their rabbis never spoke in plain words, and it is expressly said that Jesus submitted to the popular taste, for 'without a parable spake he not unto them' (Mark 4:34)."--Geikie,</i>Life and Words of Christ,<i>vol. i, p. 184.</i>[James E.

<br>
<br>
I don't know when children begin to remember, but I know that my earliest childhood memories are an important part of who I am even though I don't have a good memory for things that I really should remember: people's names, things that happened to me, important events. For example, I was 14 when I was baptized, but I remember only a few details of what happened, though I remember vividly some of the things surrounding my conversion. Perhaps it's true that you don't remember what doesn't matter to you or what is painful, but I don't think so. I remember relatively little about my childhood, but I know that it was a happy one. I remember relatively few details of when Janice and our sons and I lived in Pennsylvania while I went to graduate school, and that was one of the most important and happiest times of my life.<br><br>In spite of my poor memory, some memories stand out for me. One of my earliest is a game that my mother and I played together: she chewed gum and blew as large a bubble as possible, and I tried to break the bubble before she could suck it back into her mouth. I also remember the interior of my Grandfather Sammon's car. It was dark and warm, and I especially remember the seat covering--gray, rough, and musty but pleasant smelling. Was it made of horsehair or wool? I don't know, but once in a great while I smell the smell again, though I can never quite decide just what I am smelling. In new-car showrooms or dry-goods stores I often sniff the air, unsuccessfully searching for that smell.<br><br>I remember riding in the back of that car with my mother--my grandfather driving while she pointed at the telephone poles going by outside. I think she was counting them, and we pointed to animals in the fields: "Look, a horse" or "See the cow?"<br><br>These two shadows of memory come together in one vivid memory. While my father served in General MacArthur's honor guard in Japan during the Korean War, my mother and I lived with and near my grandparents in central Missouri. I remember riding with my mother one afternoon, probably in the fall--my mother on the right and me in the middle of the backseat, and my grandfather in the front, driving. Mother blew an especially large bubble, and this time I won, exploding the bubble before she could pull it back. When it burst, it was all over her face and in her hair, and she laughed. But Grandpa didn't laugh. I think he was probably afraid we would get gum on the upholstery of his car.<br><br>I also remember my first experience with death, though I didn't know that was what it was. The house where my grandparents lived when I was young is gone now, torn down after both had passed away because it was dilapidated. I'm told that the large room in the northwest corner at the front of the house was the bedroom for my mother and me when we came back from Colorado after my father left for Japan, but it wasn't until many years later that I remember being allowed in that room, a sitting room. In the early days its large double doors were kept closed, and I had to be quiet when around them. At that time my Aunt Betty, Uncle Ermon's first wife, slept in the room behind those doors. In fact, she was confined there with tuberculosis--which I only learned when I was quite a bit older.<br><br>I remember nothing about Aunt Betty except being kept from her, but I remember standing in the front yard one day, north of the yard gate across from where the chicken coop was later built, watching Uncle Ermon carry a small woman wrapped in a light-colored blanket or quilt out to the car, her head on his right shoulder. My mother and grandmother stood watching from the porch. My grandfather got in the front seat to drive.<br><br>The memory ends there, but my mother says this must have happened when I was about two years old, perhaps on a visit, since by the time we returned to Missouri to wait for my father, my aunt was dead.<br><br>I also remember well the first time my father talked to me about baptism, several years before we joined the LDS Church. I was in the fourth or fifth grade, and we lived in Munich, Germany. One day, I suppose it was a Saturday or Sunday, my father took me for a walk. We crossed the two-lane highway (now a freeway) west of our apartment building, and we walked along the forest paths with others out for a stroll. The sky was clear and bright, and the green and black of Perlacher Forest contrasted beautifully with the light of the sky. My father talked to me about whether I wished to be baptized, and I agreed. I only vaguely remember being baptized by the Protestant chaplain, but I remember well the event of our conversation. In a certain way, that walk in the Bavarian woods, talking with my father about serious things on a beautiful day, has come to define my experience in Germany.<br><br>Such memories have played a large part in shaping who I am. For philosophical reasons, I do not believe in what many refer to as the unconscious. I cannot make sense of what is said about it. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is much about myself that I cannot bring to explicit consciousness. Memories such as those I've mentioned are the tips of icebergs floating in my consciousness; they indicate places where matters of considerable weight can be found, even if I cannot explicitly name or bring them to consciousness. They reveal not by exposure, but by suggestion.<br><br>Today I would like to speak with you about memory, partly because it is a professional interest of mine, not least of all because memory is so central to the gospel that we covenant to remember every time we take the bread and water of the sacrament.<br><br>Philosophers have had quite a bit to say about memory. Reading and teaching philosophy, I've learned to distinguish between recollection and memory. The former is a psychological phenomenon that is a subset of the latter. Memory includes the things I can recollect, but it is not limited to it.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Many of you may ask, "What in the world can he be talking about? What could memory be<i>except</i>a subjective psychological phenomenon--what I call to mind?" To think about that, consider an example.<sup>2</sup>Like most married people in our culture, I wear a wedding band, and it cannot be reduced to its economic value as a piece of gold or even to its instrumental values. That is because, beyond having economic or instrumental values, my wedding band is a symbol of my marriage. As a symbol, it is obviously connected to memory. On the other hand, though it serves to remind me that I am married, it is more than just a reminder.<br><br>What more could it be? First notice that if my wedding ring were only something for reminding me, then I could also have chosen to tie a string to my finger. However, though I can create such reminders--putting Post-it notes on my computer monitor or remarks in my daily planner--a wedding ring "works" differently than such things.<br><br>My wedding ring is more than a reminder at least because my wife, Janice, gave it to me. It is different from a reminder because it has a physical relation to her and so mediates my physical relation to her. However, when I wear the ring, it isn't that, by doing so, I touch Janice in absentia. The ring isn't a substitute for my wife. Though the ring<i>can</i>remind me--it can cause me explicitly to think about my marriage--most of the time I wear it<i>without</i>explicitly calling my wife or marriage to mind. And yet it continues to do its work, as I notice quickly if I have taken it off to work and forget to put it back on. I am more conscious of its absence than its presence, so I cannot explain its work by the way in which it is, sometimes, explicitly present to thought.<br><br>Thus my wedding ring is a memorial of our relation because it does something for me<i>in spite of myself:</i>even if I am not thinking of my marriage, the ring demands a certain attitude toward the world, a certain reverence and respect for Janice; it connects me to Janice even when I am not explicitly thinking of her. My wedding ring makes possible certain relations in the world by embodying those relations.<br><br>Said another way, my wedding ring gives order to my world: an order that relates me to my wife and to the rest of the world, an order that cannot be reduced to an intention to remember my marriage. Thus, though it is odd to say,<i>it is as if my wedding ring remembers my marriage for me.</i><sup>3</sup>Not only does the ring not usually refer to or represent Janice, it does not take her place. In a very real sense, it takes<i>my</i>place rather than hers. Perhaps like all symbols, rather than merely reminding me, my wedding ring "remembers for me." That is how it can also serve as an explicit reminder.<br><br>We encounter the same phenomenon in many things other than wedding rings--for example, in other physical symbols, in sacred objects, in ritual practices, in a variety of institutions. I've mentioned the sacrament, perhaps the most important of such event-symbols in Latter-day Saint experience, but we can also see the phenomenon in other, more mundane places.<br><br>The university is an institutional repository of memory. As an institution, it remembers a great deal for us: making our explicit recollection of many things possible, giving our lives a particular character, and creating possibilities for us that we have often not yet envisioned. The university is a memorializing object and institution, not only in the library collections but also in its organization and influence, in such things as our academic regalia and other traditions (recognized or unrecognized), in our folklore and style of gossip, and in courses such as the civilization courses or American heritage classes. We often see the university as a place from which we look to the future--a place where we prepare for jobs, where we produce knowledge that will have effects in the future. But it is equally important to recognize that, as an institution, the university is a place of remembrance and memorial.<sup>4</sup>In fact, I suspect that a university can be oriented toward the future only<i>because</i>it is an institution of memory. As a Latter-day Saint institution, BYU is the repository for one particularly important memory, that of the Restoration as it enlightens the academy. That memory orients us to the world and the future in a unique way.<br><br>At the personal level, memory resides not only in my subjective recollections but also in things I may seldom notice, such as the ways I speak--ways that sometimes betray my origins, as when I say "Missour<i>uh</i>" rather than "Missour<i>ee.</i>" More broadly, that I speak English rather than Korean or Swahili or Rumanian as my native language is a memory of my cultural inheritance. The ways that I interact with others are memories of the interactions of my family and childhood as well as the accumulated results of countless human interactions in ages past. When I joined the Church, such things as our pioneer heritage became part of my memory, as did a uniquely Latter-day Saint vocabulary and various social practices. Most important, by joining the Church, the memory of the prophets became part of me, as did the Atonement. Though I was raised a believing, Bible-reading Christian, through my conversion a vast storehouse of memory was added, an important part of which is latter-day revelation.<br><br>While studying the scriptures a few years ago, I was impressed by the importance of memory when I read a passage from the Book of Mormon. At the end of 1 Nephi 1, the prophet tells us that he will abridge the sacred record that his father, Lehi, kept, and he will give an account of his own life. He then tells us that Lehi prophesied to the people of Jerusalem, but they refused to listen. Instead they mocked him and sought to kill him. Then, having set the context and the mood of his message, Nephi says, "I will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance" (1 Nephi 1:20).<sup>5</sup>As I read this sentence, it struck me that we might take this to be Nephi's "thesis statement" for the Book of Mormon: Nephi and the other Book of Mormon prophets give us to remember the tender mercies of the Lord so that we can be delivered according to our faith.<br><br>As I reread the Book of Mormon with Nephi's statement in mind, I was struck by how often the prophets begin by calling us to remember the Lord's mercy.<sup>6</sup>However, given that the Book of Mormon ends with the annihilation of the people of Mormon and Moroni, we may find this thesis startling. How does a record that ends in disaster and genocide show us the tender mercies of the Lord? Moroni's answer is clear: By showing us that the Lord has, over and over again, been merciful to his children, the Book of Mormon, like the Bible, gives us hope, even when we are in what would otherwise seem a hopeless situation. In Moroni 10:1, Moroni begins his final exhortations. To the remnant of the Lamanites he says:<br><br><i>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</i>[Moroni 10:3]<br><br>And he follows this exhortation to remembrance with an exhortation that those who receive the Book of Mormon should ask the Father whether it is true. In other words, they should ask the Father about the truthfulness of the record of God's mercies in the Book of Mormon. In verse 24 Moroni turns from the descendants of Lehi to the rest of us, exhorting us, too, to remember the things we have read--namely, the account of God's tender mercies to his people, tender mercies that "make them mighty even unto ... deliverance" in faith.<br><br>As do the psalmists, Nephi and Moroni see a close connection, perhaps even an identity, between remembering the tender mercies of the Lord and repentance. Without such memory, we seem unable to repent; if we repent, remembering those tender mercies is always part of our repentance. Over and over again we find this theme in the Book of Mormon: conversion and reconversion come by remembering; dedication, sacrifice, and covenant are one with memory. Sermon after sermon begins with a prophet reminding his listeners or readers of what the Lord has already done for them. They remind us of the Flood (Alma 10:22), of the Exodus from Egypt (Mosiah 7:19), and of the journey across the ocean (2 Nephi 10:20). Ammon converts Lamoni by rehearsing these stories to him, beginning with the story of Adam and Eve (Alma 18:36).<br><br>Once I noticed this theme of remembering God's mercy, I saw it everywhere. The Lord announced himself to Moses by calling himself "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6), a common appellation and a name that reminds us of the mercies that he showed to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, particularly as those mercies are manifest in his covenant with them (see Leviticus 26:42).<sup>7</sup><br><br>And occasions for memory are found not only in the scriptures. Each Sunday we renew our covenant with the Father by taking tokens of Christ's body and blood in remembrance of that flesh and blood and by promising always to remember him. I understand the Word of Wisdom as an ongoing memorial of who we are and what we have promised.<sup>8</sup>One of the most obvious sites of memory is the garment worn by those who are endowed, reminding us of the covenants we have made; we wear sacred memory on our bodies day in and day out. Like my wedding ring, the garment remembers for me, calling me to recollection when need be, but ordering my world even when I do not have it explicitly in my consciousness. Because I wear the garment, I am in the world differently than I would be if I did not.<br><br>In my own life, the memorializing objects and practices of the Church continue to make my spiritual life possible. When I remember the Savior not only in my recollections, but especially in my practices and relations with others, I bear witness of his saving relation to me, and, as promised in the sacrament prayers, I receive the Spirit. To the degree that I do not have memory--from the readily identifiable and seemingly mundane culture that Latter-day Saints all over the globe share to my obedience to commandments even when I am not thinking of them to the mysteries and blessings of the temple--I am not part of the body of Christ, I am not one of his adopted sons.<br><br>Sometimes I find myself slipping from the memory into which I entered through my conversion. I have doubts about my testimony. Something happens that I do not understand, and I wonder whether the Church is true. I may chafe at commandments or policies. I might think myself better than others--sometimes because of education, sometimes because of social status, often for who-knows-what reason. I may criticize instructors and leaders in the Church, wishing (not out loud and rarely even to myself, but wishing it anyway) that they had more "training for the ministry," that they were better at getting my interest--shifting the burden of my spiritual life to them. Occasionally I find myself bored with the talks in sacrament meeting or quietly and self-deceptively scornful of the testimonies borne on fast Sunday. In other words, though I may be able to<i>recall</i>my covenants, sometimes I find myself no longer<i>remembering</i>them, no longer remembering (whatever I recollect) that at baptism I promised to "mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" so that I would "stand as [a witness] of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9).<sup>9</sup>In spite of having so promised, sometimes I do not even learn with those who would learn or testify with those who would testify, much less mourn or comfort. Whatever I may recall, whatever I may repeat consciously, at such times I have begun no longer to remember the tender mercies of the Lord; I have begun to slip out of the ongoing process of repentance. (I hope that you will recognize a version of yourselves in my self-description, not because I hope you share my failings, but because I assume that I am not the only one who finds himself slipping on occasion.)<br><br>Such events do not characterize most of my life in the Church, but they happen often enough that I must consider how to deal with them. My answer is recollection. Though memory cannot be reduced to recollection, when I begin to fade and falter, the answer is to explicitly recollect a few events in my life that have brought sharply to my attention what living my life memorializes. Recollecting the visible tips of the largely invisible icebergs of memory helps resituate me, bringing me back to who I am, putting me back into the larger context of memory. So let me finish today by sharing with you a few of those recollections.<br><br>I share them with some trepidation. Sacred experiences are not to be shared easily, like political slogans or loose change. One should be careful about sharing them, for sharing them too often or under inappropriate circumstances strips them of their sacred character. They become commonplace rather than sacred. Nevertheless, there are times when we can share sacred recollections with each other to strengthen the testimonies of both those who testify and those who hear the testimony. I pray that today is such an occasion.<br><br>The first experience I recall is that of my conversion. My father met the missionaries through a friend at work, Robert Clark. I met them through my parents when my mother cajoled me into taking part in a "cottage meeting" at our house. Though I began reluctantly, once I started listening, I was hooked. I enjoyed the missionary discussions and liked the missionaries, and I enjoyed learning what they taught. To be honest, I didn't read the Book of Mormon, and I didn't pray about the Church very much. However, after several months of discussion, with the rest of my family, I wanted to join the Church.<br><br>Since we hadn't been to church yet, the missionaries arranged for us to attend the next Sunday so that we could be baptized the Saturday after that--the first one of February 1962. Sitting on the left side of the chapel, watching the meeting begin, I was not particularly impressed. It looked very much like the Protestant services I was accustomed to, except that there were more people on the stand, the table for communion--what Latter-day Saints call the sacrament--was to the right of the room rather than in the middle, those to say the prayers over the sacramental elements were surprisingly young, and the meeting was almost shockingly informal and unpolished. Though I had decided to be baptized, as yet I remained a curious onlooker more than a convert.<br><br>As the sacrament was blessed and passed, the bread came to me. In my former church, the Disciples of Christ, we believed that everyone present should take the sacramental emblems, and though the missionaries had told my parents that this wasn't the Latter-day Saint practice, no one had told me. As the bread tray came around, I took a piece and put it in my mouth.<br><br>As I placed the bread in my mouth, I was overcome by the most intense spiritual experience I had ever had. Instantly I knew something of what Paul had experienced on the road to Damascus. Without being especially worthy of it, without having sought it any more than superficially, I had been touched by the Holy Ghost. My entire soul--body and spirit--was electrified and on fire. Now, rather than thinking that it would be a good idea to be a Mormon, that LDS theology was interesting, and so on, I<i>knew</i>that I had to join this church. I was no longer an interested spectator. I knew that what I had learned from the missionaries and what I would learn later was true. I knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet, as was David O. McKay, the prophet at the time. Though I had as yet read only a passage here and a passage there in the Book of Mormon, I knew it was the word of God. Though I had believed in Christ all my life, for the first time I knew that Jesus Christ had died for my sins and I understood something of what that meant.<br><br>With that experience, I suppose there was a sense in which I could still choose not to be baptized. Nevertheless, there was a more profound sense in which I no longer had any choice. I knew that my life from that point on would be inextricably bound to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I didn't know what that entailed, but I knew it was true.<br><br>I do not know why I was privileged to have such an experience when others are not. I cannot explain what happened. I only know that the experience has provided an anchor for my soul, something to which I can return in recollection when I begin to falter, something that returns me to the ordering of the gospel and the order of the Church. This is a recollection that returns my memory to me and returns me to it. It is something for which I am deeply and eternally grateful.<br><br>That first taste of the sacrament has been the most important spiritual experience of my life because it<i>converted</i>me, changing my life. On the whole, since then I have lived a relatively mundane life; though spiritual experiences are common, they are rarely dramatic. I do not regret that. It is important to learn to see the spiritual in the mundane, to find spirituality even when not emotionally wrought, to recognize that the Spirit usually brings peace (John 14:27) and speaks quietly. That is more important than having dramatic experiences, and we must be wary of equating our emotional and our spiritual lives. Nevertheless, my first experience with the sacrament was not the only such emotionally powerful spiritual experience.<br><br>Shortly after we were baptized, my father was assigned to the Korean Military Advisory Group for the South Korean Army and was allowed to take his family to Korea with him. We were privileged to grow up in the Church while in Korea, to be taught and guided by such families as the Terrys and the Hogans, and to be inspired by wonderful Korean Saints like Honam Rhee and Cha Bong Kim, now on our faculty. In those days in Korea we did not have stake or district conferences for people in the armed services. We had "servicemen's retreats," occasions when those who could get time off could go to Seoul and spend two or three days meeting and sharing testimonies. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was the visiting General Authority for Asia, and he was often able to attend our retreats, so they were a special occasion for us.<br><br>One year, during late fall or winter, we had a retreat in Seoul, and Elder Hinckley attended. As we met in our final meeting, a testimony meeting, many bore their testimonies, including my younger brother. I recall nothing said in those testimonies (though President Hinckley has such a prodigious memory that he can still tell what my brother said), but I felt the Spirit as strongly then as I had when I first received my testimony. I particularly remember Elder Hinckley bearing his testimony, telling us that the Spirit in our meeting was as strong as he had ever felt it, as strong even as he had felt it in meetings of the Twelve in the temple. He said that there were angels in the room witnessing our testimonies.<br><br>I knew that what he said was true. I could see no angels. Tears were streaming down my face so heavily that I couldn't see anything, much less angels. But I knew, absolutely knew, what I had learned with my first experience with the Spirit: the Church is true; the priesthood is real, and it is the power of God. I had a feeling that I take to be a premonition of what it means finally to be sanctified, for like King Benjamin's people, for a short time I had "no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). I could not and did not want to separate myself from the Church that made such an experience possible or from the gospel taught in that Church, pointing as it does to salvation in Jesus Christ. That experience with the Spirit in the presence of one of the Twelve became another anchor for my soul.<br><br>The Lord has not ceased to give me such anchors. One of the more recent was in August of 1994. My second son, Matthew, was to return from his mission to Pôrto Alegre, Brazil. He asked that his mother and I meet him and do some traveling, but we couldn't do that. However, we compromised and I went to Pôrto Alegre to pick him up. Matthew and I stayed in Pôrto Alegre for a few days and then set out to São Paulo by bus. The day we were to leave for Curitiba, we discovered that we would have to wait until late afternoon to get the bus, but we had already checked out of our hotel and didn't have anything left that we wanted to do in Pôrto Alegre.<br><br>Matthew had the idea to take a bus to some point midway between Pôrto Alegre and Curitiba, spend the day there, and then catch the bus to Curitiba as it came through our stopping point at night. He asked the woman selling tickets to tell us a good place to go. "Rosário," she said. "It is a nice resort town with a beach." We bought our tickets and headed to Rosário.<br><br>When we stepped from the bus in Rosário, we were surprised. There were mountains, but no beach. We were obviously inland and rather high. We decided to get some lunch and see what Rosário had to offer. If worst came to worst, we could sit in the bus station and read.<br><br>As we turned the corner of one of the first streets we passed, two boys, one a teenager and the other perhaps 11, came running down the street shouting, "Elders! Elders!" Matthew stopped and talked with them, explaining that although I was wearing a white shirt and tie, only one of us was a missionary and that we were to be there for only a few hours. They were excited anyway, not caring that I wasn't a missionary as long as someone was. We must go to see their mother. The older boy ran off to find her, and the younger boy led us toward her. As we came around another corner, a middle-aged woman came running down the street, tears flowing, also crying, "Elders! Elders!" Again Matthew explained that he was the only missionary there and that we would be there only a short time, but that was irrelevant to her. Her prayers had been answered. She said, "Fine, but have family home evening with us, please."<br><br>We couldn't refuse, so we agreed to go to their home early that evening for family home evening. We spent the afternoon in the town wandering around, buying some presents for Matthew's sisters, and sitting in the park, reading and talking. Then we went to their house. We visited with them and sang a hymn. Matthew taught a lesson, and we prayed with them. As we were finishing, the sister told us that we must visit a young man in town who was inactive. (I wasn't sure how one knows that another is inactive when there is no branch or Church activity in a town, but she knew--and she was right.)<br><br>We walked across the small town to the highway where this young man owned a truck stop. He fed us a gigantic, definitely nonvegetarian dinner and talked at length with Matthew. As Matthew later explained to me, the young man had had a dream the night before. In the dream the missionaries came to visit him and told him that he must return to Church--and there we were. (He could attend church in a neighboring city by hitching a ride with truck drivers, but he had stopped doing so.)<br><br>I was thunderstruck. I could not believe the faith of these people. I could not believe how desperately they hunger for what I take for granted. I could not believe how much the Lord loves them as individuals. I could not believe that he had used our seemingly chance wandering around Brazil to bless a few of his children. As I sat on the bus that night, I had difficulty sleeping, not because the bus was uncomfortable (which it was), but because I was so overcome with a vision of the love that the Father and the Son have for us, of the need for missionaries in places like Rosário, of the beautiful faith of people like those I had just met, of my own unworthiness in comparison to theirs, and of my ingratitude for the blessings I have received.<br><br>Those few hours in Rosário, Brazil, gave me a deepened appreciation for the love God has for his children. I was reminded that his love is not a general love but a love for each specific person. Though what we brought to the Saints in Rosário was relatively little, that we could be instruments for bringing it renewed my understanding of the Lord's power to save--to save from difficulty, from oppression, from loneliness, and especially from sin. It made me ashamed of taking for granted the access I have to the Church and the temple, to inspired leadership and instruction. It showed me why the missionary effort is so important and must expand, for here was a group of 10 or 15 people to whom the Church could not yet come because, in spite of the large numbers of young people who serve missions, there are still not enough missionaries in the field. Like the previous experiences, those few hours in Rosário became another anchor for my soul, something I recollect as a way to continue to remember the covenants I am part of and the obligations that have come to me.<br><br>I live in a world that gets its significance from memory: memory manifest in wedding rings and garments and sacramental emblems, in ordinances and practices and customs, in speech patterns and names and literature, in universities and libraries and classes. I have learned that I live not on my own breath but also on that of the Spirit, without which there is only recollection at best and no memory, without which emblems, ordinances, and society are dead and hollow shells. Memory--manifest in my speech, our customs and habits, our relations, our ordinances and commandments--transcends and encompasses me, making the world I live in possible by giving it meaning and structure.<br><br>Recollection, calling various things to mind, isn't memory. Nevertheless, recollection can resituate us in memory. As I recollect--<br>re-collect--my experiences with the Spirit, I take my place again in the memory that makes life possible and good, that strengthens and continues my testimony. Most of you have experienced moments of spirituality to which your souls are anchored. Those who have not will--sometimes in answer to prayer, sometimes unbidden. My prayer is that, when you face doubt or difficulty, you will re-collect your souls by recollecting those anchoring experiences. And, though I have no authority to offer spiritual promises, based on my experience, I promise that if you will so recollect, you will continue not only to recollect but also to remember the everlasting gospel, the covenants you have made, and the holy name of Jesus Christ, in whose name I speak today. Amen.<br><br><i>James E. Faulconer was a BYU professor of philosophy and dean of General Education and Honors when this devotional address was delivered on 23 June 1998.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Recall is a psychological event. Memory is what we share and participate in. As such, it gives us direction (intention) beyond our subjective intentions, often intentions we do not know. It also creates expectations of us that are beyond our will.<br><br>2. My thinking about memory is heavily influenced by the Belgian philosopher Paul Moyaert. For more on these issues, see my paper "Scripture as Incarnation," forthcoming in a volume on the historicity of scripture edited by Paul Y. Hoskisson and published by the BYU Religious Studies Center.<br><br>3. Remember that I distinguish memory from recall. Though the ring remembers for me, it does not always or even usually recall for me. Perhaps it never does.<br><br>4. This should make us wary of sudden or drastic changes in the university. Revolutions, whether cultural or political, rarely succeed, because they propose to cut themselves off from the very memory that makes them possible and meaningful. Progress can be important (though we often overrate it), but it rarely, if ever, requires what have come to be called, in a mistaken understanding of the philosophy of science, "paradigm shifts." Even when it does, such shifts are events that happen as we work and learn but that we can rarely, if ever, engineer.<br><br>5. Nephi's language seems to be influenced by Psalms. See Psalms 25:6: "Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old"; 40:11: "Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me"; 51:1: "Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions"; 69:16: "Hear me, O Lord; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies"; 77:9: "Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?"; 79:8: "O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low"; 103:2, 4: "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: ... Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies"; 119:77: "Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight"; 119:156: "Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to thy judgments"; 145:9: "The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works."<br><br>6. The Book of Mormon as a whole begins with such a call. Its preface tells us that the book was provided<i>to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever--And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.</i>Lehi's descendants will learn what the Lord did for their fathers, and the Jew and Gentile will be convinced that Jesus is the Christ by seeing that God has revealed himself to all nations--in other words, by seeing what the Lord has done for the descendants of Lehi as well as for those in Jerusalem. Moroni's preface confirms Nephi's thesis statement: In the Book of Mormon we are reminded that the tender mercies of the Lord are over the faithful to their deliverance.<br><br>7. See also Exodus 3:15–16; 4:5; 6:3, 8; 33:1; Numbers 32:11; Deuteronomy 1:8; 6:10; 9:5, 27; 29:13; 30:20; 34:4; 2 Kings 13:23; Matthew 8:11; 22:32; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37; Acts 3:13; 7:32; 1 Nephi 6:4; 17:40; 19:10; Mosiah 7:19; 23:23; Alma 29:11; 36:2; 3 Nephi 4:30; Mormon 9:11; D&amp;amp;C 27:10; 136:21.<br><br>8. The Word of Wisdom may also direct our attention to the coming of Christ. Since anticipation is a form of memory, it may call the Second Coming to our remembrance. The Savior says: "But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom" (Matthew 26:29). Perhaps by ourselves not drinking of the fruit of the vine now, we remember the Savior's promise that he will drink with us when he returns.<br><br>9. Notice that Alma makes bearing witness (recollection) dependent on our relation with others (memory): "mourning with" and "comforting" make testimony possible, suggesting that it is not truly possible without such relations to our fellows.<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>rtance of Balance - W. Eugene Hansen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a very special experience to be on the campus of this great university and to feel the spirit of so many who are here for the right reason and with the right attitude. Time and time again we hear the comments of groups and individuals who have visited here as an extension of their trip to Church headquarters. It's so reassuring to hear their praise and compliments of the school and the student body and the spirit that they perceive as they walk the halls and the grounds taking careful note of what they experience.<br><br>Most every one of these visitors remark that this campus is different. There is a sense of enthusiasm and industry, a sense of respect and determination, a sense of confidence and spirituality--all of which inspires confidence by the visitors, in you the student body, the faculty, and the Church.<br><br>That should be reassurance to you of how the world needs a generation of young people who know why they are here and where they are going and the direction they need to take to get there. We commend you.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about some things that I hope will be helpful in your lives as students, as spouses, and as parents. I have titled what I'll say "The Importance of Balance."<br><br>It has been my experience that balance is sometimes very elusive as we struggle to meet the pressures and challenges that are ever present. So I hope I can share some thoughts that will be useful in the challenging experience we call life. I think of the definition someone coined: "Life is what happens while you are making other plans."<br><br>First may I congratulate you on meeting the academic, citizenship, and moral requirements to gain admission here--you have instant credibility with me. Not that you won't be required to continue to verify those requirements as you pursue your education. Of course you will, but it should make you feel good just knowing that you made the team.<br><br>I commend you for having exhibited the mental and physical discipline that brings you to this point in your life. No doubt you realize the importance by now of maintaining that discipline in both the academic and moral aspects of your lives. As you continue to make the right choices, you will have tremendous opportunities for continued growth and development.<br><br>It is so sad to see poor choices being made at critical times, choices that have very seriously limited the options a person has for future opportunity. No doubt you will continue to see the "poor-choices" factor operating all the days of your life. Consider it ongoing evidence for you to make good choices and to be consciously striving to improve yourself each day.<br><br>I recall a motivational speaker during my teenage years making the statement, "I know of no one to be pitied more than one whose future is in the past." What a sobering thought--bad choices seriously compromising opportunities of the future.<br><br>So if you are tempted to take that dare or to get involved in activities that may appear exciting, give it careful thought. Don't be swayed by the urgings of peers. Is the potential thrill worth the risks and the baggage that accompany questionable conduct? You have come so far. Don't let bad choices put a ceiling on your upward mobility and, even more important, bring heartache and sorrow and loss of self-respect into your life.<br><br>I continue to be amazed at the frivolous way in which choices are made by some, both young and old alike--decisions that have eternal and everlasting consequences. I refer to such things as experimentation with drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. I refer to conduct that leads to loss of virtue or harm or injury to self or other people.<br><br>I recall a situation that came to my attention while I was practicing law some years ago. It involved a very well-educated and initially successful physician. He had spent years gaining the education and training required for a very coveted and much sought after specialty in medicine.<br><br>Just when it seemed that he "had everything," he attended a party where drugs were available and tampered with by many in attendance. With an air of abandonment--an attitude of "What will it hurt to give it a try"--he consented to an injection of a substance that his tempter said he would really enjoy.<br><br>Little did he realize that this would be the beginning of a nightmare that ultimately cost him his family, his practice, and his ability to function. He later admitted that when he took that first dare, so to speak, he knew that he was hopelessly addicted.<br><br>What a price to pay for such a moment of abandonment, a moment of thoughtlessness. Of course, not every case of addiction or promiscuity or a wasted lifestyle results from just one experiment or just one drink or just one immoral encounter, but unfortunately we are not able to determine just how strong we will be in a given situation or what effect harmful substances will have on us.<br><br>I am reminded of a wise father's counsel: "If you never take the first one, you'll never need to worry about the second one."<br><br>We should all keep in mind that there is no neutral ground between where the Lord's boundary ends and the adversary's begins. The safe rule to remember is to stay on the Lord's side of the line.<br><br>Well, you might keep that in mind as a motivator while you are striving for excellence in whatever pursuit you follow.<br><h2><b>Personal</b></h2><br>With balance comes happiness and inner peace. How unfortunate it is that some work a lifetime on a goal like making money or attaining social status, only to find that these things do not bring real happiness.<br><br>Too often we conjure up thoughts in our minds of things we imagine will make us happy. To some extent we may even become jealous or covetous: If only we could afford the nicer clothes that others have or a better house or new furniture or perhaps a different car. If we had just been blessed with a beautiful singing voice or smaller feet or a more perfect profile or athletic prowess, then we could be happy.<br><br>I remember spending a troublesome quarter in college, despairing over the fact that I was not an athlete. I almost talked myself into feeling that I was a failure because I was foolishly focusing on something that was impractical for me.<br><br>I had other talents and many other opportunities. But for a period of time I almost lost my effectiveness and made myself miserable worrying about something that really was not indispensable to my progression and happiness.<br><br>Sometimes we let reverses or unpleasant experiences undermine our confidence and create more turbulence in our lives than they should. Here I don't mean to imply that all you need to do is keep a smile on your face and everything will be all right. Many have had those experiences in life when it hurts so badly inside that, for a short time at least, it may seem hard to go on.<br><br>If you ever commence feeling that way, you might try quietly humming the hymn "Count Your Blessings" and reviewing the words in your mind. Think of the pioneers and the great faith and courage they had as they pushed westward, leaving their homes, ever sacrificing, and enduring untold hardships.<br><br>Think of the problems and difficulties of others who have been required to bear so much. You might also think in terms of "What could I do to be of greater service to others?"<br><br>I believe it was the legendary jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, "I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving" (<i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>[1858], ch. 4). I endorse that concept. At any given time in a person's life we may have feelings of inadequacy or ineptness or lack of confidence or ability. But that will fade as you conscientiously stretch and put forth the effort to become a better student--or better at whatever you're doing, or being a more loving husband, wife, and parent. As we hold fast to correct principles, we will continue to move in the right direction.<br><br>I hope I go to my grave never having "peaked out," but rather striving to improve, to do better, to be better, to enhance my ability to serve, and to learn something worthwhile each day.<br><br>I recall visiting President Marion G. Romney, who was a member of our stake and who for some time prior to his death was homebound. As his stake presidency, we made periodic visits to see him. I still remember one occasion, as we were leaving, asking if President Romney had any counsel for us as his stake presidency. President Romney paused and then gave us a sermon in a sentence: "Live a little better each day."<br><br>It has always been my belief that a keen sense of personal accountability is necessary to keep a person in balance. Our moral compass needs to be operating efficiently and accurately. Often I sense an individual is tempted to make bad choices through the urging of the adversary. He quietly suggests, "No one will ever know." But we should constantly keep in mind that our Heavenly Father always knows. And he is saddened when we do not live up to what we are capable of.<br><br>We all know how important prayer is in maintaining balance. If you have trouble remembering, here's a suggestion. Years ago I read about Brigham Young following the practice of never taking any food or drink in the morning before he had his personal prayer. I have followed that practice for more than 20 years now--in fact, ever since I was called as a bishop. I commend that practice to you, and I guarantee you won't forget your prayers.<br><br>I also found that as a young father with several children at home and a busy schedule, it was very difficult to set aside a period of time in the morning for reading the scriptures. I also discovered a simple way to handle that. The purchase of a small cassette player and tapes of the standard works plus other gospel texts and general conference tapes was the answer. As I stepped out of the shower in the morning to get ready for work, I could plan on 15 to 20 minutes of scripture every day. It's easy to do. It's uninterrupted time that would otherwise be lost.<br><br>Read your patriarchal blessing from time to time. I received mine when I was just about 12 years of age, and it has been a source of inspired direction my entire life. In fact, one of the reasons I stayed active in the army reserve for 30 years was largely because of counsel given in my patriarchal blessing.<br><br>Recognize the difference between pleasure and happiness, and then pattern your lives in such a way that you will seek happiness as opposed to mere pleasure.<br><br>If adversity strikes, don't succumb to the temptation to counsel the Lord. Pray for strength to get you through. President Harold B. Lee used to say: "Never put a question mark where the Lord has put a period."<br><br>Wise counsel is also helpful. Dear Elder Neal A. Maxwell called at our home the evening that our son was killed and gave us some very comforting counsel that really made a difference. He said: "I know this is very hard for you, but try to think of it this way. You now have a son where we all hope to be someday."<br><br>Work at developing self-control. Here are some words from author William George Jordan:<br><br><i>At each moment of man's life he is either a king or a slave. As he surrenders to a wrong appetite, to any human weakness, as he falls prostrate in hopeless subjection to any condition, to any environment, to any failure, he is a slave. As he day by day crushes out human weakness, masters opposing elements within him, and day by day re-creates a new self from the sin and folly of his past--then he is a king. He is a king ruling with wisdom over himself. Alexander conquered the whole world--except Alexander.</i>[<i>The Kingship of Self-Control</i>(Old Tappan, New Jersey: Fleming H. Revell Company, n.d.), p. 9]<br><h2><b>Family</b></h2><br>A very important part of achieving balance is having a good family life. We all have the responsibility to be dutiful children, and as we find our life's companion, to be a good spouse and a good parent. We will never be released from these responsibilities. I doubt the Lord will want to know as much about the number of court cases I have won as about the kind of son, husband, parent, or neighbor I have been.<br><br>It is so important to realize that children need both a dad and a mom. It's pretty hard for one to do both. And we shouldn't try to justify our absence or neglect by reasoning that we're doing all this for a spouse or children. Often our time is the most precious and valuable gift we can give our children.<br><br>While trying to stay close to each of our children as they were growing up, I was busily involved in many pursuits. But I found that an opportunity would present itself from time to time to take one of them with me on a short business trip. That one-on-one experience provided some of the most productive time I had with my children.<br><br>As another means of demonstrating how important my family was, I had a private phone line installed in my law office, and family members were the only ones who had the number. They knew that whenever I was at the office, I was only a direct phone call away.<br><br>Yes, there were some interruptions even when I was involved in some fairly heavy meetings with clients, but when the phone rang, I would simply tell them, "Excuse me, but this is my wife's phone." I seldom had anyone who complained, and women clients were especially impressed.<br><br>I have one other important suggestion with respect to the family. I always tried to let the children feel their father's testimony and know how important the gospel was in my life.<br><br>Prayer was an important part of our family life. We had a rule in our home that none of our children left the house in the morning without having family prayer. We defined family prayer as a kneel-down prayer with both of the parents--depending on availability--or with at least one if the other was gone. Sometimes it was necessary to have more than one family prayer in the morning, as we would not wake up the youngest children to have prayer when others were leaving for early morning meetings, classes, or seminary activity.<br><br>We also followed the custom of giving father's blessings each year as school began and at such times during the year as there was need for comfort, direction, guidance, or healing, as the case might be.<br><br>You may also want to dedicate your home when you are fortunate enough to have one. I believe it was eight years before we were able to extricate ourselves from the rental game and purchase our first home. And remember, it's not necessary to have it all paid for before you dedicate it.<br><br>Now, an important tip: You may not want to wait until your children have finished college, the home is paid for, two late-model cars are in the garage, and you have a tidy sum for retirement in the bank account before you do a few things as husband and wife. We enjoyed traveling, and consequently we took some trips during the early years of our marriage. Not long ones. Usually less than a week. Often members of our extended family were able to help with the children.<br><h2><b>Church</b></h2><br>We have always accepted Church calls and assignments as they have come. It seemed we found a way to take care of those responsibilities and yet felt we were not neglecting our family or professional obligations. As you do the Lord's work, you receive blessings in so many ways--blessings that make up for the extra time and effort that go into fulfilling a Church calling with a "well done, thou good and faithful servant" result (Matthew 25:21).<br><br>And it goes without saying, we should keep the commandments, attend our meetings, pay our tithes and offerings, read the scriptures, show respect for parents and Church leaders, and always be conscious of the importance of example.<br><h2><b>Work</b></h2><br>One of the greatest challenges is balancing work and family responsibilities in order that neither go wanting. Of course the family must have sufficient money to take care of needs, but, beyond that, money has very little to do with happiness. It has been my observation over the years that if you approach your work with the principal intent to gain riches, you will surely miss the mark.<br><br>Remember the counsel in Jacob 2:18–19:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i><br><br>As we continue to lead busier lives, it seems we never have time to do all the things we would like to do or perhaps even need to do. My father gave me some helpful advice as a young man. It has application to both men and women: "Do the most important thing first." That rule along with setting sound priorities is the best way I know of balancing work with the other aspects of living.<br><br>Early on in the legal profession I determined if I could not practice my religion and practice law, then I would not practice law. But I found that I could do both. And I think it's possible with most occupations.<br><h2><b>Maintaining Spirituality</b></h2><br>Now a few words concerning spirituality. If we who have received the greater light the gospel gives are to be true to the faith and effective in our various fields of endeavor, we must be ever sensitive to our level of spirituality.<br><br>We should be constantly providing nourishment to our spiritual side. Scriptures, conference reports, counsel given by the Brethren, lesson manuals, and gospel texts provide excellent sources for "treasuring up" the word.<br><br>Fasting and prayer also provide nourishment for the soul.<br><br>In addition to seeking the positive, we should also avoid the negative. In the apostle Paul's epistle to the Romans, you will recall he says, "I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil" (Romans 16:19). We don't need to view R-rated movies to know that they are not good for us. Nor do we need to become familiar with the ways of the world in order to know that certain conduct or practices are demeaning and offensive to the Spirit.<br><br>If those who have been endowed in the temple live worthy of and have a current temple recommend in their possession, high levels of spirituality will be maintained.<br><br>In summary then, if we are to achieve balance in our lives, we must have our priorities in order.<br><br>And my priorities go something like this:<br><br>Wife<br>Family<br>Church<br>Work<br><br>I am so grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored upon the earth in these, the latter days. I'm thankful that the Lord has provided us the pattern that will see us safely home to dwell with him.<br><br>And if we will but follow the Lord's prophets here on earth, there will be joy, happiness, and success in this life and the greatest of all the gifts of God--the gift of eternal life.<br><br>President David O. McKay, the ninth prophet and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation, eloquently summarizes the purpose of life:<br><br><i>The true end of life is not mere existence, not pleasure, not fame, not wealth.</i>[From the Latter-day Saint's standpoint,]<i>the true purpose of life is the perfection of humanity through individual effort, under the guidance of God's inspiration.</i><br><br><i>Real life is response to the best within us. To be alive only to appetite, pleasure, pride, money-making, and not to goodness and kindness, purity and love, poetry, music, flowers, stars, God and eternal hopes, is to deprive one's self of the real joy of living.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1963, p. 7]<br><br>May you develop qualities of courage, faith, and self-control. Use your background and experience in analyzing the choices that are constantly before you. Draw on the Holy Ghost that you are privileged to have and your decisions will be much wiser.<br><br>Don't let habits and excuses interfere with proper choices.<br><br>Those who rely on excuses at best have only the<i>excuse</i>and not the<i>blessing.</i><br><br>Hear Elder Richard L. Evans on this subject:<br><br><i>No matter how good an excuse may be, no reason for failure or defection is ever so satisfying to ourselves or to anyone else as is actually doing what we should do, or delivering on the date that something is due. Excuses are at best a second-choice substitute.</i><br><br><i>It is a surpassing quality in life to follow through, to keep commitments, to keep the commandments, and no matter how ingenious our excuses are, they don't cancel commitments, or justify our failures, or relieve us from answering before the highest bar, unless they are founded on real, valid reasons--and not merely on our comfort or convenience.</i>[Richard L. Evans,<i>From the Crossroads</i>[New York: Harper, 1955], p. 20]<br><br>As we note in 2 Nephi, the Lord leaves to us the freedom of choice:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><h2><b>In Closing</b></h2><br>Often as I work at the table in our family room, I watch the dawn break in the east. And I know it will always keep its appointed hour of arrival, because the universe is controlled by the Almighty, who operates within laws that are eternal.<br><br>And just as that dawn breaks every morning at a precise time that is predetermined according to the season of the year, I know there are other eternal laws that pertain to this world and are not changed by the whims or fancies of those who inhabit this earth. And we are all subject to those laws.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball provides us with an appropriate reminder:<br><br><i>The Lord's program is unchangeable. His laws are immutable. They will not be modified. Your opinion or mine does not alter the laws. Many in the world, and even some in the Church, seem to think that eventually the Lord will be merciful and give them the unearned blessing. But the Lord cannot be merciful at the expense of justice.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 249]<br><br>I'm so pleased to have my father here with us. He is in his 94th year and still farming up in East Garland, in northern Utah. It took a little talking to get him to leave the farm even for a day, but I'm so happy to have him here. He's a good dad.<br><br>In closing I'd like to share a missionary story that took place in the 1920s, while my father was serving his mission.<br><br>Two young missionaries traveling without purse or scrip walked down a dry and dusty country road in the back country of Ohio.<br><br>They were in their third day of a trek to an isolated branch some 80 miles east of Columbus, Ohio. The first night they had a bed in a farmhouse and a 4:00 a.m. breakfast the next morning. That next night they were not as fortunate. The best offer they were able to get was a farmer's haystack that came without breakfast. They were now into their third day, and it had been a long time since breakfast the day before.<br><br>It was August. The humidity was high. The weather was hot. As the sun bore down on these two young elders, they began to become weary. They had been sent out earlier that week to tract without funds, as was the custom in those times. It was now late afternoon, and they were feeling the pangs of hunger. Their efforts for breakfast or lunch had been unsuccessful.<br><br>As they rounded a bend in the road, they saw what they thought must be a mirage--a huge sign that read: The Biggest Little Country Store in the World. They thought they needed a store about that size to match their hunger. But they had no money. They talked briefly and decided it would be appropriate to step inside the store and ask if there was any stale bread or broken sacks of crackers or cookies or something they might get to ease their hunger pangs.<br><br>As they entered the store, they were immediately met by a clerk, who scrutinized them suspiciously. As they explained their plight and asked about stale food or damaged merchandise, they observed a man on a balcony at the rear of the store stand up and peer over the rail. He left his desk, came down a short flight of stairs, and walked toward the elders.<br><br>They were uneasy as he approached them. They explained that they were elders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, fulfilling missions and traveling without funds. The man listened intently. Then, to their surprise, he excused himself and picked up the telephone behind the counter. They thought he was going to call the sheriff. Instead, the call was to his wife. He indicated he was bringing two young men home. He asked her to put a roast of beef in the oven and prepare a nice meal for them and then see to it that they had hot baths and a place to stay for the night.<br><br>Well, after hearing that, you couldn't tell these young elders that prayers aren't answered. They had a prayer in their hearts all afternoon that the Lord might provide for them.<br><br>As the elders completed a wonderful meal that evening, they heard the story explaining why the store owner was almost expecting and waiting for them. A few years earlier he and his wife had traveled to Salt Lake City to attend a grocers convention. He told how he had made reservations at the Hotel Utah, but as they arrived at the hotel, they were surprised and disappointed when the desk clerk indicated they had no record of any reservation. Since the hotel was filled to capacity, there was simply nothing the clerk could do. He also advised them that with the national convention in town, all of the other hotels were also full.<br><br>The couple stepped away from the desk. As they stood in the lobby pondering their predicament, a tall, slender, stately man approached. He asked if he could be of assistance. They indicated they were in Salt Lake City from Ohio to attend a grocers convention, and they had been told their reservations were lost, and they were without a place to stay. The gentleman warmly indicated that they had no problem. He invited them to use his home as their headquarters and stay as long as they needed.<br><br>At the conclusion of the convention, they attempted to pay their gracious hosts, but, of course, their offers were refused. Instead, then Elder George Albert Smith, later to be President George Albert Smith, indicated to his guests that he certainly would not want to take any money, but he did say, "We have missionaries serving in many parts of the world. They are young people who serve at their own expense and who many times must rely on the goodness of the people they labor among to provide them with food and shelter." Elder Smith went on, "If you ever have an opportunity to assist any of our missionaries, that will be payment enough for what we have provided here."<br><br>The next morning the missionaries arose early to a wonderful country breakfast and then bade good-bye to their hosts. They were given a supply of roast beef sandwiches to take with them on their trek. They, of course, had an opportunity to bear their testimonies before moving down that country road.<br><br>I know that is a true story because my father was one of those young missionaries.<br><br>May we be wise enough and valiant enough to embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ; may we cleanse the inner vessel; may we come unto Christ and be perfected in him and deny ourselves of all ungodliness. And may we strive to achieve the balance that will bring everlasting peace and happiness into our lives.<br><br>This is his work, Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This is the true Church. It is guided and directed by prophets, seers, and revelators. Of these things I bear solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>W. Eugene Hansen was a member of the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 June 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<i>Reconciliation</i>is not an uncommon word. We hear it used in reference to reconciling one's bank account, to bringing one's own records into harmony with the bank's records. We hear it used in reference to a husband and wife who, after going their separate ways, have come back together, as one, becoming reconciled. The basic meaning of reconciliation is resolving differences and returning to peace and harmony. Until we make good on our resolves, covenants, pledges, and promises, we are out of balance, not reconciled, and we suffer the consequences. When we substitute self-interest values for true, eternal values, we only deceive ourselves.<br><br>Stories help bring home the meaning of reconciliation. There once lived a young king whose wife died, leaving him an only daughter. The king's name was Midas. His daughter was sweet and loving, and Midas loved her very much. In his treasure chamber Midas kept tons of gold: gold dust, gold bars, gold coins, gold platters, gold goblets, gold statues, even gold cooking pots. Every day he would go down into his treasure chamber, locking the door behind him, and there he would play with his riches, gloating in the power and influence he thought these would bring to him.<br><br>For hours he would sit on the floor and count his money. He would toss it into the air and laugh as it rained gold on his head. He would wallow in the gold dust, and he would dance on it. "Except for my daughter, my little Merigold, it is gold that is my treasure. Merigold's beauty, like that of a flower, will fade. Only gold is forever beautiful. How I love to touch it. If I can only get enough gold, I'll be happy forever."<br><br>One day as he was gloating over his treasure, he suddenly became aware there was someone standing beside him. It was an immortal visitor come down from heaven.<br><br>"Well, Midas, you have a lot of gold, I see."<br><br>"Oh, it's not so much. Really, it's only a little."<br><br>"You are not satisfied then?"<br><br>"No. I want more, much more."<br><br>"How much more would it take to satisfy you?"<br><br>"Oh, I wish I could create gold by the touch of my hand."<br><br>"Create gold by the touch of your hand? Are you sure that with such power you would then be satisfied?"<br><br>"Oh, yes. Nothing else in the world would bring me such happiness."<br><br>"Are you sure you would never regret it if everything you touched with your hand turned to gold?"<br><br>"Never."<br><br>"The temptation would not be more than you could handle?"<br><br>"Oh, believe me, I could handle it."<br><br>"Then it shall be as you wish. From tomorrow at sunrise, whatever your hand touches, it will turn immediately into gold."<br><br>The next morning Midas began to experiment with his marvelous new power. Just as the immortal visitor had promised, everything he touched turned to gold.<br><br>He took a walk in his flower garden, touching the flowers one by one to test his magic gift. Sure enough, no sooner did he touch a flower than it turned into gold.<br><br>"Isn't that marvelous!" he laughed as he danced about, touching one flower after another. He would have turned all the flowers into gold, but seeing that it was breakfast time he went inside.<br><br>Just then his servant brought in his breakfast. The king reached out to take a piece of fruit. Putting it into his mouth without looking, he found that it, too, had turned to gold. He almost broke his teeth trying to bite into it. He took a cup of tea, but before he could bring it to his lips, the cup and the tea turned to gold. The thought struck him: "If I can't eat or drink, I'll soon starve to death." But looking at the fruit and the cup of tea, he only shook his head and marveled at their shining beauty.<br><br>At that moment little Merigold came running in, laughing joyously. Looking at her, the king thought: "She is as radiant as the sun." He reached out his arms to her, but as he touched her hand she instantly turned into a lifeless statue of gold. In a panic, Midas fell to his knees and cried out, "No! No! Oh, what have I done? God, forgive me! In my lust for gold I have destroyed my own daughter."<br><br>Just then the immortal visitor appeared again before him.<br><br>"Midas, you are weeping. What has happened?"<br><br>"Oh, immortal visitor, I am of all men most miserable."<br><br>"Is it that I did not keep the promise I made you?"<br><br>"No, you granted me my wish. Whatever I touch turns to gold."<br><br>"You told me that that power would bring you happiness, but now you tell me you are of all men most miserable. How can this be?"<br><br>"Oh, I didn't realize how evil my selfish wish was. My lust for gold has robbed me forever of happiness."<br><br>"But, Midas, is not gold the most beautiful thing in all the world?"<br><br>"I detest the very sight of it."<br><br>"Tell me, is not gold the most valuable thing in all the world?"<br><br>"Immortal visitor, tell me wherein gold has its value."<br><br>"Well, surely it is more valuable than a cup of tea, is it not?"<br><br>"No. A cup of tea is of more worth than all the gold I possess."<br><br>"Surely gold is more valuable than a piece of fruit, do you not agree?"<br><br>"No. A piece of fruit is of more worth than all the gold I possess."<br><br>"Is gold not more valuable than a daughter's love?"<br><br>"Oh, immortal stranger, you don't understand. I have come to see that the common things of life: our children, our friends, even the ordinary things we see and touch every day, these are our real treasures."<br><br>Seeing that the king's sorrow was genuine, the immortal visitor took pity on him and said, "Would you have me remove the power I gave you, and let you restore your daughter's life?"<br><br>"Oh, noble stranger, do this and I will give you all my gold."<br><br>"Then, Midas, go and wash your hands in the river. And bring back a pail of water. With the water from the river, sprinkle whatever you have touched and it will return to its normal state. Then use your gold to help your people."<br><br>King Midas took a pail and ran to the river, washed his hands, and ran back to his palace with the pail of water. He splashed water on the gold statue of his daughter, and she was at once restored to life. Then he fell to his knees, took his daughter in his arms, and sobbed: "Oh, Merigold, forgive me! God, forgive me!"<br><br>After that, King Midas lived a happy life, for he found true value in his family, his friends, and even the ordinary things of life that all of us see and touch every day.<br><br>Among the scriptures that have profoundly moved me since I first read it in my youth is one given by the Lord to Joseph Smith in these words: "Lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>Truly, Joseph Smith's life was characterized by extraordinary charity--lifting up hands that hung down and strengthening feeble knees. William W. Phelps, a member of the First Presidency and Joseph's intimate friend and confidant, left the Church and became a traitor to the cause of Zion, an enemy who brought enormous injury and irreparable damage to the Saints and to the Church. Robbed of peace in the Lord, he wrote a letter to Joseph Smith, humbly seeking reconciliation. Here is part of that letter:<br><br><i>I ... ask my old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . I ask forgiveness ... of all the Saints, for I will do right, God helping me. I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:142]<br><br>Here is part of Joseph Smith's letter in answer:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Phelps: ...</i><br><br><i>. . . We have suffered much in consequence of your behavior--the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us. ...</i><br><br><i>However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God's dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal. ...</i><br><br><i>"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</i><br><br><i>For friends at first, are friends again at last."</i><br><br><i>Yours as ever,</i><br><br><i>Joseph Smith, Jun.</i><br><br>[<i>HC</i>4:162–64]<br><br>Reconciliation. How marvelous its power. How sweet its blessing.<br><br>On the eve of his betrayal, Jesus told his apostles: "All ye shall be offended because of me this night."<br><br>Peter said: "Although all shall be offended, yet will not I."<br><br>Jesus answered prophetically: "Even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."<br><br>Peter responded the more vehemently: "If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise" (Mark 14:27, 29–31).<br><br>As you know, that night Judas the traitor led a mob to the Garden of Gethsemane to betray his master, who he knew was there with Peter, James, and John. Peter at first boldly resisted the mob. But once Jesus was arrested, Peter and the others fled. As Jesus was led away, Peter followed at a safe distance. He did not enter the hall where Jesus was accused by false witnesses, buffeted by his accusers, and unjustly condemned to death.<br><br>Peter was in a room below, warming himself by the fire, hoping not to be recognized as a follower of Jesus. A woman noticed him and said: "Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."<br><br>Peter denied it and went out on the porch. Hearing a cock's crow, Peter was no doubt stricken with shame but summoned new resolve. Another woman accused him of being one of the followers of Jesus: "This is one of them."<br><br>Peter's resolve melted. He denied it again. Now several who had noticed his Galilean accent came over and accused him: "Surely thou art one of them." This time Peter cursed and swore by an oath: "I know not this man of whom you speak." The cock's crow was heard a second time. Realization of what he had done swept over Peter, and he wept. Was not abandoning his master, even denying him, equal to Judas' betrayal? (See Mark 14:66–72.)<br><br>No written records describe Peter's agony over the next days. Did he stand by helpless as Jesus bore his cross through the streets to Calvary? Was he there as the Roman soldiers drove nails into his master's hands and feet?<br><br>Peter's story continues after the Resurrection, when the Lord appeared to the apostles, and to Peter in particular gave a sacred trust: "Feed my sheep" (John 21:17). Reconciliation? Oh my! Blessed reconciliation.<br><br>For me the message of reconciliation sank deep when my beloved teacher, Manuel Tun, told the parable of the prodigal son in his own words in the Maya language of Yucatán. Allow me to retell it, with adaptations, as he gave it to me.<br><br>A father had two sons. I'll call the younger son Johnny. Johnny's father was rich. He had hired hands who worked in his fields. Johnny and his brother and father worked hard alongside the hirelings.<br><br>To each son the father gave a gold ring to symbolize fidelity to God and to family. Working and talking with his father and brother, Johnny felt contented. His eyes shone, and there was a peaceful expression on his face. He was twelve years old. He was responsible. He was obedient. He was polite and respectful.<br><br>Three years passed. He was fifteen now and had new friends. But these boys didn't like to work. They only liked to play. They teased him: "Johnny, your father takes advantage of you." And Johnny began to believe them. Often he played all night with them, and in the morning he was too tired to get up and work. He thought: "Why should I work? Why should my father exploit me? I have my own life."<br><br>Quarrels erupted between him and his brother, and unkind feelings developed between Johnny and his father. Now Johnny no longer prayed. He no longer read the word of God. He didn't like to spend time with his family. At home he felt bored. He didn't want to work with his father and brother, or even talk with them. He only wanted to play with his friends. He didn't notice that the warm feeling that was in his heart had disappeared, together with the light that formerly shone in his eyes.<br><br>One day his friends said to him: "Your father is rich. Why should you work? Let your father's hirelings do the work. Go to your father and demand your inheritance. Then you can leave home and be your own boss."<br><br>And Johnny thought: "That's right! I'll leave, and I'll never come back. With my inheritance I can live like a king. I don't need my family. I'll live with friends."<br><br>The decision made, Johnny went to his father and said:<br><br>"I want my inheritance now! Here's your ring, your 'symbol of family unity.' It has no meaning for me anymore. I'm leaving, and I don't plan to come back."<br><br>"Your inheritance? You want it now? Johnny, have you thought this over thoroughly?"<br><br>"I won't discuss it, Dad. Just give me my money now!"<br><br>Johnny took his inheritance money and left. He made his way to a far city, feeling immensely rich and totally free. Where he went we don't know, but we can imagine that he went to a place where he was sure no one would recognize him. In the city he found friends, and with them he squandered his inheritance, leading a debauched life. One day he woke up to find that the money that he figured would last forever was all spent. And soon he found that his friends were no friends at all. There was no one who cared for him. He was alone and frightened.<br><br>Shortly after the money was all spent, there came a famine, and Johnny began to suffer from hunger. I can just see him standing on a street corner. A cold wind is blowing, and he is clutching a tattered blanket about him. He is hungry, but more than that, he is ashamed. People look on him with pity for the misery he has brought on himself, and children mock him for his wretchedness.<br><br>I note the painful expression on his face as he shouts out: "You make fun of me, but my father is richer than you all. Don't you know who I am?" But no one pays any attention. No one helps.<br><br>Now he had lost everything. He had no home, no family, no dignity. He had thrown away everything. In his desperation he thought of sending a letter to his father, asking for money. He still thought money could solve his problems. He did not yet see that the void in his heart could only be filled by reconciliation with his father.<br><br>One day a neighbor traveling abroad saw him in this sad state. "So, Johnny, this is where you are. I see you're in dire straits. Listen, lad, before setting out, I told your father I was coming here. He said: 'Please, if you happen to see my Johnny, tell him I still love him and want him to come home.'"<br><br>"What? Does my father speak of me?"<br><br>"Does he speak of you? Every day he speaks of you. Johnny, his heart aches for you."<br><br>"Tell my father I'm okay. I'll manage."<br><br>But Johnny couldn't manage. He begged a citizen: "Sir, help me, I am hungry. Give me something to eat." The man looked on him with pity and gave him work. He sent him into his fields to feed swine.<br><br>Emaciated and weak, Johnny ate pig fodder and swill. Soon sick, and with no one there to attend to his desperate need, he cried out in agony: "Oh, God, what have I done? Help me, God. Help me return to my father. I'll say to him: 'Father, I am no longer worthy to be called thy son. Make me only as one of thy hired servants.'"<br><br>Now Johnny got up and set out for home. I can imagine him walking along dusty roads, climbing hills, descending into valleys, passing through fields and wilderness. He is aching within. Sweat mixed with tears streams down his face, but his every step is quickened by hope.<br><br>Nearing his father's lands, he wondered, "What if Father's heart has turned against me?" (Oh, but how little he knew of his father's heart!) How he longed to see his father's fields. He remembered the happy days of his childhood, pleasant hours spent at play with his brother, times that he was working, playing, singing, and chatting with his dad and mom.<br><br>Now Johnny came within sight of his father's house. His father was standing on a hill from where he could look down on the road. Every day he had stood there, hoping to see if by chance his lost son might be coming up the road. And that day, as always, he was there hoping and praying. Suddenly he saw the figure of a young man approaching. His heart jumped. The boy's clothes weren't recognizeable. They were tattered and dirty. The boy was limping. His hair was long and disheveled. But the father recognized his son, and his heart filled with compassion. Johnny had come home! He ran joyously to meet his son and threw himself on his neck and kissed him. "Johnny, my son, you've come back!"<br><br>But the son said to his father, "Father, I have sinned against God."<br><br>"Yes, Johnny, I know."<br><br>"I have sinned before you, Father."<br><br>"Yes, my son, I know."<br><br>"Oh, I am ashamed, Father. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."<br><br>"Johnny, my son, my son. How terribly<i>you</i>must have suffered."<br><br>The father called to his servants: "Bring clean clothes and dress my son. Put shoes on his feet. Put this ring back on his finger. Come, let us celebrate. For this my son was lost but now is found. This my son was dead but has returned to life."<br><br>There is more to the parable, but I'll leave it there, adding only a quote from a talk by Elder Bruce D. Porter in general conference.<br><br><i>Like the errant son of the Savior's parable, we have come to "a far country" (Luke 15:13) separated from our premortal home. Like the prodigal, we share in a divine inheritance, but by our sins we squander a portion thereof and experience a "mighty famine" (v. 14) of spirit. Like him, we learn through painful experience that worldly pleasures and pursuits are of no more worth than the husks of corn that swine eat. We yearn to be reconciled with our Father and return to his home.</i><br><br>How long we have wandered<br>As strangers in sin,<br>And cried in the desert for thee!<br><i>("Redeemer of Israel,"</i>Hymns,<i>1995, no. 6)</i>[Bruce D. Porter, "Redeemer of Israel,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 15]<br><br>Another story of the marvel of reconciliation begins in Canaan, which I will paraphrase from Genesis 37–46. Joseph, Jacob's 11th son, is destined to become a great prophet, and his preparation for that begins early in life when he finds it difficult to get along with his 10 older brothers. Much like Laman and Lemuel with Nephi, they are offended by Joseph and cruelly torment him.<br><br>One night 17-year-old Joseph has a prophetic dream. In it he sees a symbolic representation of his brothers bowing down before him. Joseph tells his dream to his brothers. They are infuriated and vow to punish him.<br><br>Soon after, Joseph's 10 older brothers take their father's flocks to distant fields to feed. Sent by his father to find them, Joseph sets out on a journey of no return. His brothers see him coming, and Simeon, the meanest of them, says: "Here comes the dreamer of dreams. Let's slay him. We'll see what will become of his dreams."<br><br>But Reuben, the eldest, says, "Let not<i>our</i>hands shed his blood. Let's strip him and cast him into a pit here in the wilderness. Then we will be rid of him." They grab him, strip him, and throw him into a deep pit, intending to leave him there to die.<br><br>Joseph has no doubts about their murderous intentions. When they sit down to eat at the top of the pit, he cries out in anguish. But so intense is their hatred that their hearts are unmoved by his desperate cries.<br><br>As they are about to abandon him, they see a camel caravan passing nearby. The fourth brother, Judah, says: "What profit is it if we leave our brother to die in the pit? Let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh. Let us sell him." So they haul the bruised and shaken lad out of the pit and sell him to the caravan merchants for a few pieces of silver.<br><br>I can see their dark faces as Joseph stands the last time before them. His eyes move searchingly from face to face as he appeals to them: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, and the rest--but there is no softening, no mercy. Their faces are resolute, their hearts untouched. They are rid of Joseph forever--or so they think. Little do they realize that this vicious crime against their younger brother will fester in their hearts and rob them of peace until the day of reconciliation.<br><br>The terrible deed done, the brothers kill a goat and spatter its blood on Joseph's coat to take to their father as evidence of his death. Then they take an oath never to even speak of their crime again.<br><br>You remember what follows: Taken to Egypt, Joseph is sold as a slave. He finds grace in the house of Potiphar, even becoming overseer over his master's property. But then, falsely accused, he is cast into a dungeon, where he is doomed to spend many years of his life.<br><br>In prison, Joseph's prophetic powers are made known when he interprets the strange dreams of two fellow prisoners. Later the great pharaoh has troubling dreams that no one can interpret. Learning that a Hebrew prisoner in the dungeon has interpreted dreams, he commands that the prisoner be brought to him. Pharaoh reveals his dreams to Joseph, and God gives Joseph the interpretation thereof: "There shall come seven years of abundant harvest in all the land of Egypt. Then will come seven years of drought that will consume the land."<br><br>Pharaoh sets Joseph as lord over all the land of Egypt. "According to your word shall my people be ruled," he says. "I only will be greater than you." Joseph is 30 years old. Thirteen years have passed since he was betrayed by his brothers.<br><br>For seven years Egypt is blessed with abundant harvests. Each year grain is stored up against the coming drought. In the eighth year the drought begins, and its suffocating grip begins to be felt in all the land of Egypt. Joseph has storage bins opened up, and grain is dispensed to the people. In the land of Canaan to the north, the drought brings severe hardship. Jacob calls his sons to him and says: "There is grain in Egypt. Go down and buy grain, and bring it here so that we may live and not die." Joseph's 10 older brothers go with their donkeys to Egypt to bring grain. Only Benjamin, Joseph's younger brother, is not allowed to go, because of his father's fear that some accident might befall him.<br><br>Picture in your minds the sight of the 10 brothers leading their donkeys into the hot, dusty square in Egypt. Joseph is there and recognizes his brothers. But they fail to recognize him. He gives orders to have them brought to him privately. Coming before his face, the brothers bow to him with their faces to the earth, not realizing they are fulfilling part of Joseph's prophetic dream from many years before.<br><br>Joseph puts the unsuspecting brothers through a series of trials that humble them. To begin with, after having them confined in a room for three days--figuratively cast into a pit--he has them brought before him. Through an interpreter he commands: "Go, take grain to your families. But until you bring your youngest brother who you say stayed with his father in Canaan, one of you remains here as hostage." It is Simeon, the most abusive of Joseph's brothers, whom the guards seize and place in confinement.<br><br>Thinking that this great man cannot understand Hebrew, the brothers break their vow of silence: "It is because of our sin against Joseph that God has brought this punishment upon us. When he called out to<i>us</i>from the pit, we saw the anguish of his soul but would not listen. Now his blood will be required of<i>us.</i>" Hearing this, Joseph hurriedly leaves the room to hide his weeping.<br><br>Returning to Canaan, they are sustained for a time with the grain brought from Egypt, but when the grain is nearly consumed, Jacob calls his sons to him and says: "You must go again to Egypt and buy grain, lest we perish." Judah is spokesman for his brothers: "Father, the lord of Egypt said with an oath: 'If your brother come not with you, you will not be allowed to see my face.' You must send Benjamin with us. With my own life I guarantee his safe return. If I bring him not back, let me bear the blame forever."<br><br>"Then go, and take Benjamin, that we might live. And may God give you mercy before the great man of Egypt so that he will release Simeon and you will all return home again."<br><br>Now the brothers, including Benjamin, go down to Egypt. As they enter the dusty square, Joseph sees them, and he sees Benjamin is with them. He commands his servants: "Bring these men to my house, release their brother locked in confinement, and make ready a feast for us all." The startled brothers are ushered to Joseph's own mansion, Simeon is brought out to them, and they are told that the governor invites them to feast with him. They find no explanation for this. At noon Joseph comes in. His brothers again bow down before him.<br><br>Looking at Benjamin, Joseph asks: "Is this your brother of whom you spoke?"<br><br>"Yes, it is he."<br><br>"God be gracious to you, my son," Joseph says, choking up. Again, Joseph hurries out of the room and retires to his chamber to weep where he cannot be heard. After gaining control of his emotions and washing his face, he returns to his brothers, and they feast together.<br><br>Before they depart, Joseph gives secret commands to his servants: "Fill their sacks with grain, and put my silver cup in the mouth of the youngest brother's sack." When they had gone a short distance with their sacks of grain, Joseph commands his guards: "Go after them, and when you overtake them, say to them: 'Our master's silver cup is missing. One of you must have stolen it.' You will find the cup in the youngest one's sack."<br><br>The guards catch up to the brothers. To their accusation Judah answers: "We are not thieves. We have stolen nothing. Search our sacks. If you find the cup, let him in whose sack it is found be killed, and the rest of us will be your slaves." Then, in the order of age from the eldest to the youngest, each takes down his sack to be searched. Alas, there in Benjamin's sack the silver cup is found.<br><br>They are brought back under arrest to Joseph's mansion. Seeing him, the 11 brothers fall down before him. Through an interpreter Joseph says: "What deed is this that you have done?"<br><br>And Judah replies: "What can we say to my lord? How can we clear ourselves? Benjamin and all of us, we are your slaves."<br><br>Joseph says: "Only he in whose sack the cup was found shall remain with me as my slave. The rest of you will return to your father."<br><br>Desperate, Judah speaks: "My lord asked us if we had a father or brother. We answered that we had a father who was old and a child of his old age. One brother is dead, so he alone was left with his father. My lord said: 'Bring him down to Egypt; if he does not come, you will not see my face.' When we returned to our father, we said: 'We cannot go back to Egypt without our brother.' Our father said: 'If you take my last son also from me, you will bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to the grave.' Oh, Great Ruler, when my father sees that our brother is not with us, he will go down in sorrow to the grave. Before setting out on our way here, I said to my father: 'If I do not bring our brother back to you, then shall I personally bear the blame forever.' Oh, Great One, how can I go back to my father if I do not bring Benjamin with me? I beg thee, let me stay in his stead as a slave to my lord, and let him return to his father."<br><br>Joseph can hold back no longer. "Let everyone leave. I will speak alone with these men." All go out--even the interpreter, leaving Joseph alone with his brothers. Now Joseph stands up from his chair before his brothers to speak, but his words will not come out. His voice bursts forth in uncontrolled weeping. Finally he gains control over his emotions and addresses his brothers in Hebrew: "Do you not know who I am?"<br><br>There is a long pause as the brothers look at each other in wonder. "I am Joseph. I am your brother."<br><br>His revelation stuns them. They cannot speak. "I am Joseph your brother." The older brothers are stabbed again with awareness of their terrible crime against their brother. They know they stand convicted before him who now has the power of life and death over<i>them.</i>Surely he will return evil for evil. Heads bowed, they wait for his terrible condemnation. But Joseph speaks softly: "Let your hearts be at ease. God sent me to Egypt and made me ruler in all the land so that I might save your lives. Now, make haste. Go to our father and tell him: 'Thy son Joseph lives. He is lord of all Egypt.' Then, all of you, come here with our father and your children and your children's children. In Egypt I will nourish you and you will be saved."<br><br>Now, one by one, Joseph embraces each of his brothers and they weep together. Such is the miracle of reconciliation, coming to peace. The brothers return to Canaan and tell their father: "Joseph is yet alive. He it is who is lord over all of Egypt." Then with excruciating agony they confess the terrible secret that has robbed them of peace ever since and tell of the reconciliation with their brother.<br><br>What a marvelous preshadowing of Jesus Christ, who would be rejected by his own but whose teachings and atoning sacrifice would open the way to reconciliation with our Father in Heaven.<br><br>A story I read long ago helped me see that<i>my</i>words can change someone's life. It was written by a woman about herself when she was a child just entering first grade. I don't know the author's name or where her story was published, but I remember the title: "Seven Words That Changed My Life." I'll tell it as I remember it.<br><br>Excruciatingly shy, her face disfigured by a cleft palate, and her hearing severely impaired in one ear, Alice lived in self-destructive misery, an invalid in a cocoon of her own making. She had closed herself off from the outside world, feeling unloved and not wanting anyone to see her ugly face or detect her disability. Fearing the inevitable stares and cruel taunts of other children, she panicked at the thought of attending school. How could she hide her ugliness and her deafness? Yet somehow she was made to go to school that first day.<br><br>Left early with the teacher, before the other children came, Alice took a seat at the back of the class and hid her face from the others as they came in. After the class began, the teacher announced that they would first have a simple hearing test. One by one the children were to come to the door and stand, waiting until the classroom was absolutely quiet. Holding a hand tightly over one ear and then the other, they were to listen as the teacher whispered something to them. The simple test was to repeat back the teacher's words.<br><br>Alice sat almost in tears. Not only would everyone see her ugly face, but they would find out she was deaf in one ear. She sat with lips quivering as each of the other children passed the test. Now it was her turn to be seen and tested.<br><br>Hiding her face in her hands, she walked to the front. Trembling, she turned her face to the wall and covered her good ear, but left enough opening so she could hear the whispered words. Then her teacher spoke seven soft words, words that broke open the floodgates of tears and changed Alice's life forever: "I wish you were my little girl."<br><br>Do we not all have in our memory times when we have failed to lift up arms that hung down and to strengthen feeble knees, times when by our words or actions we have denied our Lord, times when we have betrayed someone's trust or looked only to our own needs and wants while slighting the needs of others?<br><br>Reconciliation with God is at the core of the gospel. Reconciliation is, after all, the object of the Atonement wrought by the Son of God. Reconciliation with each other through words and acts of kindness and through caring service is also at the core of the gospel. The Master's life and teachings show us the way.<br><br>The Savior said:<br><br><i>If ye ... desire to come unto me, and rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee--</i><br><br><i>Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to</i>[him],<i>and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you.</i>[3 Nephi 12:23–24]<br><br>Reconciliation is a gift we can and must give to others. It is a gift we can and must receive from others. Ultimately it is a gift we can receive from our Father in Heaven, even being reconciled with him through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>May we give the gift of reconciliation to others, and may we ourselves receive from our Lord his gift of reconciliation, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert W. Blair was a BYU professor of linguistics when this devotional address was given on 7 July 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ng and Caring - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A junior high school student was once having problems learning math. His teacher struggled with him day after day and assigned him extra work to do each evening. The student would always return the next morning with the assignment uncompleted. After this had gone on for some time, the teacher vented his frustration by asking the student in an irritated tone, "What is it with you? Are you really ignorant or just apathetic?"<br><br>The student casually shrugged his shoulders and replied, "I don't know, and I don't care."<br><br>I am going to talk today about knowing and caring, the relationship between those two concepts, and what that relationship means to us at this university. My starting point is a passage from the New Testament--1 Corinthians 8. In this portion of his epistle to the members of the Church in Corinth, Paul is answering a series of questions apparently put to him by the Saints in an earlier communication. Chapter 8 specifically addresses the propriety of eating meat that has been offered as sacrifice to idols.<br><br>A bit of background concerning this practice helps us understand both the nature of the Corinthian inquiry and the true significance of Paul's response. The sacrifice of animals to the pantheon of Greek and Roman gods was a well-established part of Greco-Roman life long before Paul arrived in Corinth.<sup>1</sup>At the time Paul was writing, such sacrifices were performed not only for purely religious occasions, but also at state festivals and various private functions, such as birthday and wedding celebrations.<sup>2</sup>Thus, as Bible scholar Richard B. Hays explained:<br><br><i>For those few Corinthian Christians who were among the wealthier class . . . , their public and professional duties virtually required the networking that occurred through attending and sponsoring such events. To eat the sacrificial meat served on such occasions was simple social courtesy; to refuse to share in the meal would be an affront to the host.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Many scholars agree that this group of more educated, socially conscious Corinthian Church members was the likely source of the inquiry to which Paul was responding in chapter 8.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Being familiar with these customs, Paul addresses the propriety of eating meat sacrificed to idols from two perspectives: that of knowing and that of caring--or, to use his terms,<i>knowledge</i>and<i>charity.</i>The former is the perspective apparently taken by the Saints who made the inquiry; the latter seems to be the one Paul hopes to persuade them to consider. As several scholars have suggested, Paul seems to restate the contention of the Corinthian inquirers concerning what knowledge teaches them about the issue and then to respond to their position from the perspective of charity.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Using the perspective of knowledge, Paul states:<br><br><i>We all have knowledge. . . .</i><br><br><i>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</i><br><br><i>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth . . . ,</i><br><br><i>But to us there is but one God, the Father. . . .</i><br><br><i>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</i>[1 Corinthians 8:1, 4–6, 8]<br><br>In other words, Paul acknowledges--at least for the sake of his response--that the Corinthian inquirers "know" that the idols to whom the meat is sacrificed are not real, that there is but one true God whom they worship, and that it does not really matter whether the meat has been prepared as part of what is essentially a meaningless ritual. It is still meat. Thus the "knowledge" that the Corinthian inquirers possessed had freed them--at least in their eyes--to make an enlightened choice about whether to eat the meat sacrificed at these social occasions.<br><br>This part of Paul's response would undoubtedly have pleased many of his more educated inquirers, because it placed such a high premium on knowledge or<i>gnosis,</i>to use the Greek term. There were few, if any, things in Greek culture that exceeded gnosis in importance. Thus, as Hays observed, the Corinthian inquirers might well have thought that "the strong Christian, armed with the appropriate<i>gnosis,</i>can go without compunction to the pagan temple and eat whatever is offered there; indeed, doing so may be a way to demonstrate one's spiritual maturity and freedom."<sup>6</sup>Further, Hays theorizes the inquirers "probably appealed to Paul to set the record straight by encouraging the weak to overcome their qualms and enter the world of spiritual freedom enjoyed by those who possess<i>gnosis.</i>"<sup>7</sup><br><br>If that was in fact the motive of the Corinthian inquirers, they were to be sorely disappointed by Paul's response, which highlighted the difference between the perspective of knowledge they had adopted and the perspective of charity Paul advocated. Without contesting the correctness of what the Corinthian Saints knew, Paul invited them to look at the issue from another point of view.<br><br>Paul first reminds them, in chapter 8, that "there is not in every man that knowledge" and that "some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol" (v. 7). He then warns them to "take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak" (v. 9), explaining that<br><br><i>if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</i><br><br><i>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</i>[vv. 10–11]<br><br>Paul thus appeals to the Corinthians who thought they had full knowledge concerning the subject to consider the impact of their actions on their fellow Saints. Although the "educated" might well understand that there was no religious significance to the consumption of meat offered to dumb idols, others might not have the same knowledge, and seeing the well-educated Saints eating at the idol's temple, these so-called "weaker" Saints might well assume that there was something to this idol worship. Thus the knowledge of the inquiring Corinthian members of the Church might lead to the destruction of their fellow Saints for whom Christ had given his life.<br><br>Given the differences in these two perspectives, Paul informs the Saints of the course that he will follow: "Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend,<sup>8</sup>I will eat no flesh while the world standeth" (v. 13). Having the perspectives given by both knowledge and charity, Paul apparently opts for the course indicated by the latter. He seems to be saying that although knowledge may teach that one can eat meat offered to idols without incurring any spiritual damage, charity demonstrates that such conduct may constitute a "sin . . . against the brethren" (v. 12). Given that choice, Paul not surprisingly decides that he will eat no meat offered to idols, even if he "knows" in one sense that it does not really matter whether or not he does.<br><br>Although Paul saves his personal resolution of the issue until the last verse of chapter 8, he had clearly indicated to the inquirers where he was headed with his summary of the matter in verse 1 when, in answer to their assertion that "we all have knowledge,"<sup>9</sup>he stated, "Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."<br><br>Paul's message at this point seems fairly clear. He appears to be saying that having charity is much more important than having knowledge. Indeed, he seems to imply that the two are polar opposites. Knowledge artificially inflates or puffs up one's selfish ego and leads one to "sin . . . against the brethren, and . . . against Christ" (v. 12). Charity, on the other hand, edifieth, or, to use the Greek term<i>oikodomeo,</i>"builds up" or "strengthens" the entire community of Saints.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Given this seemingly clear message, we at a university dedicated to the acquisition and advancement of knowledge must pause somewhat and ask ourselves two questions. First, is it possible that caring is that important? And second, is it possible that knowing is that harmful?<br><br>Let's consider each of these questions in turn. First, is caring, or charity, that important? The scriptures amply demonstrate that the answer to that question is an unequivocal yes. Paul himself addresses the issue in words that are familiar to us all:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:1–2]<br><br>The ancient American prophet Mormon picks up the theme in words recorded by his son, Moroni: "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all" (Moroni 7:46).<br><br>Nephi made a similar observation when he said, "The Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity. . . . And except they should have charity they were nothing" (2 Nephi 26:30).<br><br>In his abridgement of the Jaredite record, Moroni sums up the matter, stating that "except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which [Christ] hast prepared in the mansions of [his] Father" (Ether 12:34).<br><br>Clearly, charity is very important. In fact, it is essential to our exaltation. Without it we are nothing compared to what we could be. It is the "very core" of the gospel,<sup>11</sup>the very core of the exalted life to which we all aspire.<br><br>Thus far, Paul's apparent message to the Corinthians seems to be right on target. Charity is that important. But, turning to the second question, is it also true that knowledge pales by comparison, that it is indeed harmful because it inevitably gets in the way of charity, as Paul seems to suggest? To put it more bluntly, are we all wasting our time here at this university where we are expected to expend so much effort in studying and acquiring knowledge? Isn't it enough if we just learn to be really nice to everyone? Again, scriptural and prophetic statements supply the answer--but this time the response is an emphatic no.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants informs us that "it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). Similarly, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity."<sup>12</sup>Furthermore, the knowledge we are to acquire is not limited to what we might narrowly classify as religious matters. In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord instructs us to learn<br><br><i>of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:79]<br><br>This sounds like a description of general education courses at most universities.<br><br>It therefore appears that both charity and knowledge are important--indeed, that both are essential to our exaltation. So why does Paul seem to go to such great lengths to disparage knowledge in his response to the Corinthians' inquiry about eating meat offered to idols? Why does he not simply inform them that it is not the charitable thing to do and, therefore, not advisable?<br><br>The answer, I believe, is that Paul wanted to teach the Corinthian Saints about more than the propriety of eating meat offered to idols. He wanted to teach them something about knowledge and its relationship to charity. It seems that the Corinthian inquirers had confused awareness of factual information with complete knowledge. Paul does not dispute the fact that idols are not real or that there is only one true God. But mere awareness of these factual realities--which the Corinthians apparently thought constituted complete knowledge of the matter--was only a partial or incomplete knowledge, a kind of knowledge that puffs one up in an artificial way. Thus Paul warns the inquirers, "If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know" (1 Corinthians 8:2). True knowledge does not puff up; it humbles. When we have true knowledge, we are not so much impressed by all that we know as we are humbled by all that still remains for us to learn. Accordingly, if we think we know everything on a subject, it is a pretty good sign that we really know "nothing yet as [we] ought to know." And Paul seems to indicate that the missing link--the element that transforms the mere accumulation of factual information into complete knowledge--is charity.<br><br>To understand how this works, one might view factual information as isolated, random dots on a page. Knowledge consists of making connections between the dots in such a way that an ordered picture appears, as in a dot-to-dot puzzle. When we begin to see connections between the various bits of factual information we have at our disposal, we begin to acquire knowledge. However, if we do not consider the impact our actions and knowledge have on others, we will see neither all the dots on the page nor the multitude of connections that might be made to give more clarity and texture to the picture.<br><br>The perspective of charity thus allows us to see things in a new and more complete way. It permits us to make connections that we would not otherwise make. The result is a more detailed, accurate picture of things--one that may differ as much from that produced by incomplete knowledge as a Rembrandt differs from a child's simple stick-figure drawing. Charity can therefore provide the context in which our knowledge can become complete. It was only when the Corinthian inquirers began to place the facts they "knew" in the context of their impact on others--when they began to look at the matter from the viewpoint of charity--that they could begin to see that their knowledge was not as certain or complete as they had initially thought.<sup>13</sup><br><br>Paul therefore seems to be teaching the Corinthian inquirers the same thing Peter taught the members of the early Church when he directed them to add to their knowledge "brotherly kindness" and "charity," among other things (2 Peter 1:6–7). "For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:8). Although Peter may have been talking about a specific kind of knowledge, the lesson seems to apply to all learning. It is only when factual information is coupled with charity that it can be fully productive and complete; otherwise it too often remains mere awareness of "barren" and not fully connected items of data.<br><br>Similarly, Paul seems to be saying not that knowledge is bad, but that it is unproductive, barren, and incomplete without charity. He seems to be saying there is some kind of critical relationship between knowledge and charity.<br><br>And just what is that relationship? I confess at the outset that I do not have the complete answer to that question. But I do have some thoughts that I hope will lead you to consider more fully and accurately what that answer might be.<br><br>First, I suggest that there is some kind of symbiotic relationship between knowledge and charity, that they feed one another, that the possession of knowledge helps us be more charitable, and that the attribute of charity helps us be more knowledgeable. Let me illustrate with a couple of simple examples.<br><br>In a 1988 address to the Democratic National Convention, the Reverend Jesse Jackson told about his mother, "a working woman," he said, who on "so many of the days . . . went to work early, with runs in her stockings."<sup>14</sup>He implied that others made fun of her because of the condition of her nylons. Although he does not elaborate, given the era and the coldheartedness of some human beings, one can imagine that some of her coworkers might well have whispered to one another behind her back, in tones just loud enough for her to hear, "Look at that dumb woman. She doesn't even know enough to wear good stockings to work." Apparently responding to such observations, Reverend Jackson stated, "She knew better, but she wore runs in her stockings so that my brother and I could have matching socks and not be laughed at at school."<sup>15</sup><br><br>A charitable act? Undoubtedly. And, I suggest, made more so by the fact that Reverend Jackson's mother did indeed know what was proper work attire. Had she been completely unaware that wearing nylons with runs in them was not the style, her act, although still laudable, would not have been quite as selfless--not quite as charitable. Her knowledge of the way things were, though perhaps making her choice a bit more difficult, allowed her to exercise charity at a higher level than would have been possible had she been ignorant of the price she was being asked to pay. The same is true of our charitable offerings: When we see things as "they really are" (Jacob 4:13), we are in a position to give an even greater gift than when we see "through a glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12).<br><br>Moreover, knowledge can make our charitable acts more productive and fruitful. Although all our hearts may go out to a person who has been deprived of sight, an ophthalmologist with knowledge of the workings of the human eye is in a much better position to do something about it. Jesus' charitable compassion for the blind was made all the more powerful and productive because of his knowledge of the principles concerning how such defects could be cured.<sup>16</sup>Knowledge can therefore both deepen charity and make it more productive.<br><br>Conversely, charity can both deepen knowledge and make it more productive. This is demonstrated by the story of Bartolomé de Las Casas, who in 1514 was a rather ordinary 40-year-old Catholic priest living what was the typical gentlemanly life of a Spaniard on his estate in Cuba. Like many of his fellow countrymen in the Americas at the time, he owned ample land and numerous Indian slaves. Although he was a university graduate, he had not, up until that time, shown much interest in, or aptitude for, scholarly things. Fifty-two years later, when he died at the age of 92, Las Casas had become one of the greatest scholars of the Spanish empire, producing thousands of pages of materials, including works on law, history, anthropology, political theory, and theology.<sup>17</sup>Moreover, Las Casas' scholarship was as productive as it was extensive, and he became a vocal advocate of the Native American people. His scholarly reputation was such that when the king of Spain convened a conference in 1550 to consider the most pressing issue of the day--the manner in which the Spanish should deal with the indigenous population of the New World--Las Casas was one of only two scholars invited to debate the matter.<sup>18</sup><br><br>What triggered this sudden outburst of scholarly productivity, this seemingly unquenchable search for knowledge? It was Las Casas' arrival at the conclusion that the indigenous people of the New World were being treated unjustly and that they, of all people, were in need of the love of Christ. The way in which Las Casas arrived at that conclusion demonstrates how charity can transform awareness of factual information into the kind of deep and productive knowledge that only a lifetime of dedicated searching can produce.<br><br>Shortly before Christmas in 1511, Las Casas was part of a congregation in Hispaniola that heard a stern sermon from the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos concerning the Spaniards' mistreatment of the indigenous people. Although Las Casas remembered Montesinos' words well enough to record them in a work he began more than 16 years later,<sup>19</sup>they had no immediate impact on him. Las Casas "took no steps to change his way of life and for more than two years after the sermons continued to play the role of comfortable gentleman-ecclesiastic."<sup>20</sup>Without charity, Las Casas' awareness of the plight of the Indians remained unconnected and isolated dots of information. He had, at best, incomplete knowledge of the matter.<br><br>Yet something began to work within Las Casas once he began to view this information from the perspective of charity. While preparing a sermon to deliver at the Pentecostal mass at the newly established settlement of Sancti Espiritus in 1514, Las Casas came upon a verse from chapter 34 of Ecclesiasticus:<sup>21</sup><br><br><i>Tainted his gifts who offers in sacrifice ill-gotten goods! . . .</i><br><i>Like the man who slays a son in his father's presence is he who offers sacrifice from the possessions of the poor.</i><br><i>The bread of charity is life itself for the needy, he who withholds it is a person of blood.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>These powerful words greatly affected Las Casas. As historian Lewis Hanke explains:<br><br><i>Pondering on this text for several days and turning over in his mind the doctrines preached by the Dominicans, Las Casas became increasingly convinced "that everything done to the Indians thus far was unjust and tyrannical." The scales fell from his eyes, he saw at last what was to be forever after the truth for him, and experienced as complete a change of life as did Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Once Las Casas viewed the information he had from this new perspective, previously unperceived connections began to appear everywhere. Thus he said, more than four decades later:<br><br><i>Never have I read a book . . . all these interminable forty-four years, in which some argument or authority was not adduced to prove and corroborate the justice of these Indian peoples and to condemn the injustices and evils and harm done to them.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>The same charitable impulses also motivated Las Casas to make this more expanded knowledge productive. He not only preached the sermon at Sancti Espiritus, he immediately gave up his Indian slaves and embarked on a lifelong journey to acquire and use all the knowledge he could on behalf of the Indian people, making repeated arduous trips across the Atlantic to persuade the Crown to alter its policies toward them.<br><br>Sparked by what he called "the charity of Jesus Christ, which knows no measure nor seeks any rest while on this pilgrimage,"<sup>25</sup>Las Casas' knowledge was both deepened and made more productive.<br><br>Near the end of his life, Las Casas wrote: "For forty-eight years I have studied and sought to make clear the law; I believe, if I do not deceive myself, that I have penetrated to the pure waters of principle."<sup>26</sup>How many of us can say that we have worked hard enough on a subject that we have penetrated to "the pure waters of principle"? If we have not, perhaps we need to work as hard at acquiring more charity as we do at gathering more factual data.<br><br>I do not mean to suggest by these simple examples that only those who are charitable can gain knowledge or that only those who are knowledgeable can have charity. It only takes one as brilliant and yet uncaring as the Unabomber to make it clear that the relationship is a little more complex than a one-to-one correlation between knowledge and charity. However, it is still possible to conclude that knowledge allows one to be more charitable than one otherwise could be and that charity can lead one to be more knowledgeable than one would have been in the absence of that attribute.<br><br>Moreover--examples such as the Unabomber notwithstanding--it is still possible to conclude that one cannot possess<i>full</i>knowledge without charity and that one cannot possess<i>full</i>charity without knowledge. It may well be that the Savior's atoning sacrifice--the epitome of charity--became possible only when he fully understood what was going to be required of him in order to carry out that sacrifice. Perhaps only when he completely realized the full measure of the pain he was being asked to bear was it possible for Christ to exercise the kind of pure love that constitutes full charity. And conversely, some aspects of the full knowledge the Savior possesses may have been obtained only because he had the charity required to make that atoning sacrifice. Perhaps his full understanding of how to succor each individual in each individual trial came about only as a result of the love that motivated him to shrink not from drinking even the dregs of that bitter cup.<br><br>Indeed, the relationship between charity and knowledge may be even deeper than that. It may well be that charity is a large part of that which distinguishes knowledge from the more complete and divine attribute of intelligence, the attribute that makes God a god. As we at this university are well aware, the Lord states in the Doctrine and Covenants that "the glory of God is intelligence" and that intelligence is "light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). The Lord also explains that "truth is<i>knowledge</i>of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24; emphasis added). And what is the light component of the equation? Although I am sure the matter is complex and that I am far from understanding it in even the most elementary way, I suggest that at least a portion of that light--a portion of the power by which all things exist (D&amp;amp;C 88:7–13)--is the divine attribute of charity.<br><br>After the apostle John informed the Saints in his first epistle that "God is light" (1 John 1:5), he stated that "God is love" (1 John 4:8), using the Greek term<i>agape,</i>the same term that is translated as "charity" in 1 Corinthians,<sup>27</sup>thereby suggesting some critical link between light and charity. Distinguishing intelligence from mere knowledge, Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated, "Knowledge can be obtained and used in unrighteousness. . . . But intelligence presupposes the wise and proper use of knowledge, a use that leads to righteousness and the ultimate attainment of exaltation."<sup>28</sup>Could any more wise, proper, and exalting use be made of knowledge than to effectuate a comprehensive atonement for all mankind, an act that was clearly motivated by charity, or "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47)?<sup>29</sup><br><br>If charity is indeed an essential component of the intelligence equation, Elder McConkie's observation that "the devil has tremendous power and influence because of his knowledge, but . . . is entirely devoid of the least glimmering of intelligence"<sup>30</sup>could highlight the power implicit in the attribute of charity and explain why Paul, Mormon, and others view it as so critical. Seen from this perspective, the presence or absence of charity may be the key factor in determining whether our knowledge exalts us or condemns us.<br><br>Regardless of the exact relationship between charity and knowledge on the one hand and intelligence, or light and truth, on the other, it is clear that charity and knowledge are both essential to our exaltation and that the two are related to each other in a profound way. The last thing I want to consider then is, What does all this mean to us at BYU today? Let me make three suggestions.<br><br>First, as we engage in this lifelong process of acquiring knowledge, we should consider the impact our knowledge has on others, keeping in mind that our knowledge will likely be incomplete and unproductive if we do not view things from the perspective of charity. Bruce C. Hafen, a former dean of the BYU Law School, illustrated how incomplete knowledge can manifest itself when he wrote about the way some students react to the knowledge they acquire in law school.<br><br><i>I have seen some of them try out their new intellectual tools in some context like a priesthood quorum or a Sunday School class. A well-meaning teacher will make a point they think is a little silly, and they will feel an irresistible urge to leap to their feet and pop the teacher's bubble. If they are successful, they begin looking for other opportunities to point out the exception to any rule anybody can state. They begin to delight in cross-examination of the unsuspecting, just looking for somebody's bubble up there floating around so that they can pop it with their shiny new pin of skepticism.</i><sup>31</sup><br><br>When we begin to use knowledge in this way, we can rest assured that we have neither charity nor complete knowledge. The acquisition of both will be enhanced if we remind ourselves of the need for caring and humility in our educational endeavors.<br><br>Second, even though the acquisition of knowledge is properly a major focus of our lives, we should make equal efforts to acquire charity. It requires just as much energy and perseverance to acquire charity as it does to obtain knowledge. It requires that we "keep the commandments of God," as King Benjamin told his people, for such actions cause us to "be filled with love towards God and all men" (Mosiah 2:4). Moreover, according to Mormon, it requires that we pray "with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love" (Moroni 7:48), for, ultimately, charity, like knowledge, is a gift from God (see 1 Corinthians 12:8, D&amp;amp;C 46:18).<br><br>Third, in order to make the knowledge we acquire more productive and to increase our charity, I suggest we look for ways to use the knowledge we have to help others and that we regularly do so without monetary remuneration. After making clear the need to develop charity, Nephi observes that if we "labor for money [we] shall perish" (2 Nephi 26:31). This implies that we can never fully develop charity nor make our knowledge fully productive if we do things for others only when we expect monetary compensation in return.<br><br>My colleague Cole Durham once told me of an important lesson he learned about such things from Lowell Bennion, who at the time was the director of the LDS institute of religion at the University of Utah. When Cole was growing up, his father suffered from multiple sclerosis. Cole's father was able to provide for his family because he was a lawyer, but there were still some things his physical limitations prevented him from doing. On one occasion, when Brother Bennion saw that the Durham house was in need of a new coat of paint, he offered to perform the task, knowing that Cole's father was physically unable to do so. After working long hours, Brother Bennion finished the job. As he was cleaning up, Cole's father asked him, "How much do I owe you, Lowell?"<br><br>"You don't owe me anything," came the reply.<br><br>Cole's father protested, "But we can afford to pay."<br><br>Brother Bennion kindly responded, "But I couldn't afford to do it for money."<br><br>I suggest that all of us would do well to adopt that same principle--that we all commit to use the knowledge we acquire to help others, and that at times we do so without payment. Among lawyers there is a professional obligation to provide a certain amount of pro bono, or free, legal work each year. Although I admit there are a number of lawyers who do not fulfill this obligation and an even larger number who do so grudgingly, a personal commitment to provide pro bono service would be appropriate for all of us, regardless of the occupation we choose. On one occasion when we were discussing the lawyer's obligation to perform pro bono work, one law student resisted the notion by stating, "Why should<i>we</i>have to provide services for free? No one expects the local grocer to give away groceries for free." Although no one may expect it, nothing prevents anyone, including grocers and others, from providing their services and their knowledge for free.<br><br>For nearly 40 years a man I know and respect greatly operated a store in the coal-mining community of Price, Utah. The store was somewhat akin to a general store, stocking everything from hardware and hunting equipment to furniture and fishing poles and plenty of toys at Christmas. When the store closed on Christmas Eve, there were sometimes toys, bikes, and other goods that had earlier been placed on layaway that had still not been retrieved, often because those who, a month or two earlier, had hoped to give these items as gifts had discovered there was simply no money to pay for them. On numerous occasions this man made a detour or two on his way home on Christmas Eve to anonymously drop off items that would never be paid for but that would also never be forgotten. Such acts and such an attitude are critical components of charity and, I suggest, of true knowledge.<br><br>We should always remember that we need to know<i>and</i>we need to care. And we need to know and care in the most profound ways if we are to succeed in what is our ultimate purpose in this life. We should realize that such deep knowledge and charity come about only as a result of hard work on our part, work we should be anxiously engaged in at this university. But just as important, we need to remember that all this is possible only because someone else cared in the most profound way. Charity, after all, is "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47). Without his love, and the atoning sacrifice that it produced, we truly would be nothing. Knowledge of that fact is the most important knowledge we can have because it becomes the building block and the motivating factor for all other important knowledge we can acquire.<br><br>May we ever strive to be like him--perfect in both knowledge and charity--is my prayer, in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was a professor of law in the BYU J. Reuben Clark Law School when this devotional address was given on 21 July 1998.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. For a description of the history and significance of sacrifice in the Greco-Roman culture, see Wendell Lee Willis,<i>Idol Meat in Corinth: The Pauline Argument in 1 Corinthians 8 and 10</i>[Chico, California: Scholars Press, 1985], pp. 1–64.<br><br>2. Willis,<i>Idol Meat,</i>p. 13; Richard B. Hays,<i>First Corinthians</i>[Louisville, Kentucky: John Knox Press, 1997], pp. 136–37.<br><br>3. Hays,<i>First Corinthians,</i>p. 137.<br><br>4. See Hays,<i>First Corinthians,</i>p. 137. Hays refers to the inquirers as "<i>gnosis-</i>[or knowledge] boasters" (p. 145).<br><br>5.

Hays,<i>First Corinthians,</i>p. 136.<br><br>7. Hays,<i>First Corinthians,</i>p. 136. Hays suggests:<br><i>The Corinthians who advocated this position may actually have argued that their more scrupulous brothers and sisters--the "weak," as the Corinthian letter called them--should try to build up the strength of their own consciences by attending such ceremonies and eating the idol meat. If they would only do that, they would see that no harm comes of it, and their consciousness would be raised.</i>[p. 136]<br><br>8. The Greek term used,<i>skandalizo,</i>means to "entrap, i.e., trip up . . . or entice to sin" (James Strong,<i>Strong's New Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</i>[Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1986], Greek dictionary item 4624. See note a of 1 Corinthians 8:13: "cause my brother to stumble, falter."<br><br>9. That "all have knowledge" is one of the few Corinthian assertions that Paul expressly rejects, for he makes clear in verse 7 that "there is not in every man that knowledge."<br><br>10. See note d of 1 Corinthians 8:1. Strong's concordance notes that<i>oikodomeo</i>derives from the term used for "house-builder" and connotes something that constructs or confirms (Strong,<i>Concordance,</i>Greek dictionary item 3618).<br><br>11. Addie Fuhriman, "Charity,"<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1992], 1:264: "The concept of charity is fundamental to the teachings and the procedures of the Church, being the very core of all it does."<br><br>12. Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>sel. Joseph Fielding Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1938), p. 217.<br><br>13. That the issue was more complex than the Corinthian inquirers had assumed is made clear by the remainder of Paul's response, which continues through chapter 10. In verses 18 through 21 of chapter 10, Paul provides additional instruction on the impropriety of eating meat offered to idols.<br><br><i>Are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? . . .</i><br><br><i>But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.</i><br><br>Thus, joining in festivals at which meat was offered to idols was wrong not only because it might cause others to sin, but also because it was in some way incompatible with true devotion to the Lord. Indeed, the issue had already been resolved at an earlier conference in Jerusalem, at which the apostles, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, had arrived at the conclusion that while Gentile converts did not need to be circumcised, they were to "abstain from meats offered to idols" (Acts 15:29). The exact relationship between all these verses--as well as others in chapter 10 that seem to suggest that one can eat meat offered to idols if one remains ignorant of that fact--has provided considerable grist for the scholarly mill of Bible commentators.<br><br>14.

Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, is a part of the Apocrypha included in the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate; see Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>2nd ed.

Although the Apocrypha was included in the original King James Version, "since the early part of the 19th century it has been excluded from almost all protestant Bibles," due to doubts concerning its authenticity (McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>p. 41).

See also notes 9 and 10 from p. 47 of Gutiérrez,<i>Las Casas,</i>found on p. 484.<br><br>23. Hanke,<i>Bartolomé,</i>p. 20. There is some dispute as to the rapidity of Las Casas' conversion process.

There also appears to be a correlation between the power of God and his charity. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord instructs us that the "powers of heaven"--that is, the powers of God--"cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36). And what are those principles? "Persuasion, . . . long-suffering, . . . gentleness and meekness, . . . love unfeigned; . . . kindness, and pure knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42). Compare these qualities with those that Mormon uses in his effort to describe charity:<br><br><i>Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i>[Moroni 7:45]<br><br>Although there is not an exact match, there are remarkable similarities between Mormon's description of charity and the Lord's articulation of the principles upon which heavenly power is based.<br><br>30.

<h1>itual Eyeglasses: What You See Is What You Get - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am so happy to be able to share some ideas with you today that I know have been directed by Heavenly Father. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will help me communicate the thoughts I have received, according to the desire of the Lord. What a blessing this assignment has been to me.<br><br>I want to borrow a term I first heard at a workshop conducted by the Franklin Institute, now Franklin Covey. They introduced me to the concept of the<i>belief window,</i>which I have identified with ever since. I can still visualize a clear window suspended in front of the eyes of a cartoon face, illustrating the idea that we see the world through our belief window. The beliefs that we have are the lenses of reality for each of us. I would like to expand upon this idea and talk about your<i>spiritual eyeglasses</i>and leave you with the notion that<i>what you see is what you get</i>or<i>what you see is what you are,</i>as far as eternity is concerned. It is very important that gospel truths make up our belief window so that we can see the celestial kingdom clearly.<br><br>Let me illustrate. The world looks very different for me depending upon the lenses, or glasses, through which I look. For instance, this first pair of glasses I am putting on has very thick lenses, and they distort my view to the point that, if I wear them very long, I am frustrated and not able to clearly see the path before me. In fact, they give me a headache.<br><br>This next pair of glasses, with the eyeballs on springs, changes my view with each movement of the springs. Once again the path before me is distorted and even comical.<br><br>With this pair of sunglasses I am having a hard time seeing anything at all in this room. They shut out the light.<br><br>This next pair of glasses doesn't aid my vision at all, but they glow in the dark and draw attention to me and my eyes in a dark room. I have used them for effect several times when I wanted to solicit a reaction from people. They are a fun icebreaker, but that's all. They don't aid my vision.<br><br>This final pair of glasses totally changes others' perceptions of me. With these lenses I can create a fictitious image of who I am. I have created a distorted picture of myself and what my belief window contains. Thank goodness for my own prescription lenses.<br><br>Now I can see you as well as the printed words before me and, I hope, the path to the celestial kingdom. It really is very important that we wear the proper pair of glasses--or, in other words, that our belief window is correct.<br><br>The message that I am bringing today is that your beliefs are the lenses through which you see the world. What you believe determines your focus and in turn your actions. You are seeing things as you<i>believe</i>they are--not so much as things<i>really</i>are, but rather as<i>you</i>are. Our challenge is to "finally see as God sees," as Ann Madsen prompts us (BYU Women's Conference, May 1998). If your beliefs are based on gospel perspectives, your glasses or belief window will allow you to see eternity from a celestial kingdom perspective. On the other hand, if your belief lenses are made from a non-gospel or worldly prescription, you will see just the opposite and earn your place for eternity in one of the lower kingdoms. So, what you see is what you get--literally.<br><br>One of the children in the Edgemont Eleventh Ward Primary humorously illustrated my point. President Patty Shumway asked the children who the Book of Mormon prophet was who preached repentance standing on a wall. One child responded, "Humpty Dumpty." The "wall" belief window of this child only included Humpty Dumpty. We hope that scriptural tales will sometime be part of this child's belief window.<br><br>Today I would like to elaborate on three different beliefs that are part of our individual prescription lenses, or belief window, through which each of us views the world. I chose these three beliefs because I think comprehending them from a gospel perspective is vital in seeing and staying on the path to the tree of life and eventually returning to live with God and our own family. The three beliefs, or pairs of glasses, I'm going to explore are<br><br>1. individual worth;<br><br>2. the physical temple, or body; and<br><br>3. the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Barbara Lockhart and I have discussed many of these ideas to the point that they have been incorporated into the courses we teach at BYU. Those of you who are my students have heard many of these ideas before.<br><br>First, I want to discuss the concept of<i>individual</i>or<i>intrinsic worth.</i>I maintain that how we view ourselves and others determines how we behave, as well as how we treat those around us. It is vital that we are looking through a clear and true belief window concerning<i>worth.</i>It is also my conviction that the adversary has many of us believing that our worth is determined by how we look or what we have accomplished or how much money we have acquired or what others think of us or the positions of power that we hold.<br><br>The scriptures, however, don't support this view. In Jacob 2:21 we are taught that "one being is as precious in his sight as the other." Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 states, "The worth of souls is great in the sight of God," and Doctrine and Covenants 109:43 declares from the Kirtland Temple dedication prayer, "Souls are precious before thee." I gather from these scriptures that<i>all</i>souls are equal in the sight of God and that our worth is a given and always in place for each of us. It isn't to be earned or proven, and it doesn't change. If we believe the scriptures I just quoted, we know we are all born into this world precious and with great worth. I find that far too many of us do not fully comprehend and internalize this principle. I was sprouting gray hairs before I really understood this absolute truth, and sometimes, even now, I have to remind myself that my worth is a given.<br><br>It is only when we make a distinction between worth and behavior (two different things) that this concept becomes clear, and it is imperative that we do this. Worth is constant and comes from God. Behavior changes and is a result of our actions. It comes from the world. Our worth is great. Our behavior can be good or bad. Our worth doesn't change. Our behaviors are variable and do change. If we get these two concepts confused, we will have a distorted picture of ourselves. It is often hard for people to accept what I have been saying because the world usually doesn't portray this view. The media tells us that we are more worthwhile if we use a certain toothpaste or drive a certain car or smoke a certain cigarette or express emotions in a certain way. The view of the world is often in direct opposition to that of the gospel. If we try and harmonize with the world, our identity becomes confused.<br><br>Let me illustrate what I am saying. I think all of you have experienced holding a newborn baby or puppy or kitten. What is it that makes you want to cuddle or kiss the newborn? The newborn has done nothing with the purpose of enticing these feelings of love or the desires to cuddle it. It just came that way, emulating love and warmth. We would all agree the newborn's worth is great, else why would we have these desires? Now envision this young babe as it grows. It starts making messes, literally: writing on the walls and maybe even throwing a tantrum, especially as a teenager. Has the worth of the young one changed, or is it the behavior that has changed? Of course it is the behavior. Remember, worth is a given and is constant.<br><br>If behaviors remain questionable or unwholesome, patterns develop that are hard to change. When this happens we often put a false sense of worth, for ourselves and others, into our belief window. We believe individuals are not worthwhile because they exhibit behaviors that are unacceptable. Sometimes we feel the behaviors of others are not acceptable because they are different from our own, and therefore these persons are not of worth. If others do not think or behave as we do, it is easy to put them down and discredit them. In this frame of mind, it becomes hard to separate worth from behavior.<br><br>I work closely with athletes as they prepare to be coaches and teachers. I find that some of them associate their worth with their behavior in the athletic arena. I remember a young track star who blew out her knee in a pickup basketball game during the off-season. Her world was shattered, and her identity was that of a good-for-nothing--useless. She was depressed and unproductive for several months because she felt her worth was dependent on her accomplishments, and she felt she would not be able to accomplish much now that she was injured. She worked very hard at her rehabilitation to get back to her earlier running form, and this story does have a happy ending. She did return to athletic glory. At that point in time, for her, her worth was determined by her athletic abilities. When I saw her with her young child several years later and asked her about her running, she remarked that wasn't the focus of her life anymore. Perhaps love for her baby had helped her to understand that worth is not determined by accomplishments or talents or possessions or power or appearance. It's a given from God and is always there. Remember what 1 Samuel 16:7 states: "For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart"--or, as I would add, our inherent worth.<br><br>If our own belief window reflects our worth as inherent, we will be able to overcome the trials and tribulations that are impossible to escape. In John 16:33 Christ declared, "In the world ye shall have tribulation." If we internalize this absolute truth concerning worth, we will love ourselves and others even when behaviors don't warrant such. We will know that we are all capable of changing behavior but that our worth is constant and great. We will also know that we are okay when others doubt our worth and let us know they don't approve of our behaviors. Confucius said, "The orchid that grows in the deep gorges does not withhold its fragrance because of lack of appreciation." I have done several things in my life that seemed very strange to those around me, but I knew they were directions the Lord had outlined, and I followed the promptings.<br><br>I read an article about an intriguing study of college valedictorians in a recent<i>Parade</i>magazine (see Michael Ryan, "Do Valedictorians Succeed Big in Life?"<i>Parade,</i>17 May 1998, pp. 14–16). It was reported that these valedictorians at graduation were the hardest working, but they were not always the students with the highest ACT scores. They were popular, not the stereotypical misfits who studied all the time. It was interesting to me that some of the very brightest students didn't become valedictorians, and some valedictorians had not progressed as far as their potential predicted. Those in the group who did not fulfill their potential included first-generation college graduates, women, and minorities. I wondered as I read this what a study of how they viewed their intrinsic worth would reveal about motivation. I can only speculate upon that.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell tells us that with the restoration of the gospel came a clear understanding of our true identity (see<i>Men and Women of Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991], p. 40). Further, one of the great but under-appreciated blessings of the restored gospel is that it richly assures us of our intrinsic value and our eternal and ultimate worth. In my mind it is vital that we live our lives with this perspective of worth and view ourselves, and others, as God views us. If we do this, we will always know that we are loved. Elder Holland has told us:<br><br><i>The first and great commandment on earth is for us to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength (see D&amp;amp;C 59:5; Matt. 22:37) because surely the first and great promise in heaven is that he will always love us that way.</i>["Look to God and Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, p. 14]<br><br>And I emphasize<i>always love us.</i><br><br>I believe that if we know our worth we will repent when we get off the straight and narrow because we know behavior can be changed. The Savior suffered on the cross to ensure this great blessing. If we know our worth we will want to return to live with God the Father and Christ the Savior because we know they love us very much. We will strive to keep the commandments to ensure that reunion. We will want our family and friends there with us, and our love and encouragement will help them live better lives.<br><br>If you don't know that you are of great worth, I encourage you to do what I did after I began to grasp this absolute truth. I was in my 40s. (But don't wait as long as I did to do this.) As it says in Moroni 10:4, I asked God "with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ" if he really loved me and if I had worth, even after some of the crazy things I had done. The experience I had after that prayerful encounter is what keeps me going whenever I doubt. I felt his love encircle me completely and with incredible warmth and compassion. I have never forgotten that feeling. For some of you, asking God these questions will be a leap of faith because you only know what the world has told you. You may feel you are not of worth and that you are beyond help. You may have settled into pleasurable or addictive behaviors that you'd rather not or think you cannot change. It will have to be for you, as Malcolm Muggeridge tells us, "faith that bridges the chasm between what our minds can know and what our souls aspire after" (<i>Jesus: The Man Who Lives</i>[New York: Harper and Row, 1975], p. 20). I encourage all of you to take that leap of faith and ask our Heavenly Father. He loves each of us enough to catch and steady our jump.<br><br>I would like to complete our discussion of the belief window of individual worth with some advice from Marc Gellman, who wrote<i>"Always Wear Clean Underwear": And Other Ways Parents Say "I Love You."</i>He said:<br><br><i>When you are told to stand up straight, your parents are really trying to teach you this:</i>Show everyone that you believe in yourself.<i>Standing up straight makes you look like you have confidence. ... Standing up straight sends the message that no matter how many people give up on you, you won't give up on yourself.</i><br><br><i>Slouching is your body's way of showing that you are feeling low, just like smiling is your body's way of showing that you are feeling happy. It's strange how the way you look on the outside can show just exactly how you're feeling on the inside. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . It's good to stand up straight, because even on your worst days, you're still terrific. You're a good person with a bright future, and people love you and believe in you and want you to be the very best you can be. All those people who love you can't be wrong! They must see something in you that on your bad days you can't even see in yourself.</i><br><br><i>. . . Lots of things in your life will try to squash you. There is just no good reason to squash yourself.</i>[Marc Gellman,<i>"Always Wear Clean Underwear": And Other Ways Parents Say "I Love You"</i>[New York: Morrow Junior Books, 1997], pp. 73–74; emphasis in original]<br><br>In the chapter titled "If You Can't Say Anything Nice, Don't Say Anything at All," Gellman said:<br><br><i>When nobody is saying anything nice about you here on earth, God and the angels may be talking about you in heaven. Maybe they are talking about how special you are and about all the blessings you have and will bring to others. Maybe when nobody is cheering for you here, everybody is cheering for you there.</i>[<i>"Always Wear Clean Underwear,"</i>p. 57]<br><br>I know that they are cheering for you because you are all worth cheering for. I've just expounded on all the reasons why that is true. You need to know your worth so you believe in yourself and so your belief window will project this positive view of yourself and others at all times. As Anonymous once said, "How can I help myself if I am not on my side?"<br><br>The second belief window I want to explore is the one through which we view our physical body, or temple. I teach about the body almost every day and have come to reverence its sacredness. Some of you may believe that because your body has a big nose or protruding ears or excess fat or malfunctioning parts or any other such attributes, your worth is less than others. Some of you may not identify with your body for these reasons. I used to believe some of these ideas myself. As I studied and prayed, I discovered wonderful truths about my body that have totally changed my perception of myself. Our body should be esteemed. It is sacred. First of all, we are literal offspring of heavenly parents. We are created in the image of God. We have a body of flesh and bones, just as he does, even though what flows in our veins is different from what flows in his. President Hinckley told us in general conference in October 1989 that God "is our Creator. We are made in His image. These remarkable and wonderful bodies are His handiwork" ("The Scourge of Illicit Drugs,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 50). We are told in 1 Thessalonians 4:4 that we "should know how to possess [this] vessel in sanctification and honour." Stephen L Richards declared:<br><br><i>The human body is sacred, the veritable tabernacle of the divine spirit which inhabits it and ... it is a solemn duty of humankind to protect and preserve it from pollution and unnecessary wastage and weakness.</i>[<i>Where Is Wisdom?</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1955), p. 208]<br><br>Those words greet you as you walk into the Richards Building right here on campus.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 88:15 helps us to further understand the sacredness of the body: "The spirit and the body are the soul of man."<br><br>James E. Talmage told us, "Nowhere, outside of the Church of Jesus Christ, is the solemn and eternal truth taught that the soul of man is the body and the spirit combined" (<i>CR,</i>October 1913, p. 117). The importance of this declaration comes from the Prophet Joseph Smith. He stated:<br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. . . .</i><br><br><i>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 181]<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith told us:<br><br><i>The greatest punishment ever given was proclaimed against Lucifer and his angels. To be denied the privilege of mortal bodies forever is the greatest curse of all. These spirits have no progression, no hope of resurrection and eternal life! Doomed are they to eternal misery.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1965, p. 28]<br><br>Are you starting to get a feel for the wonderfulness of your mortal body? All of us probably have something about our body we wish we could change, and some of you have impairments that will be changed in the next life. Nevertheless, this magnificent creation, our body, is vital to our progression and should be cherished.<br><br>Further enlightenment about the body is offered by Elder Boyd K. Packer, who told us that the body "is the instrument of your mind and [the] foundation of your character" ("The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promises,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, p. 18). As I read these words, I don't envision either the spirit or the body being more important but rather them being in a partnership in which both parts are vital. Both have different functions and are probably in different stages of progression, but both are necessary to the integrity of the other. As Elder Rex D. Pinegar explained:<br><br><i>The soul has expanded capacity in this mortal life because of the expanded nature of being, which includes spirit and body. These expanded capacities and joys are most evident when there is a harmony of body and spirit, and harmony with eternal commandments.</i>[Personal notes]<br><br>For there to be harmony, I envision a complete and happy union. I don't picture the body as a building protecting the more important spirit that is housed inside. Rather, I see it as stated in 1 Corinthians 3:16–17:<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i><br><br>This scripture tells us that a harmony of body and spirit creates a sacred temple in which the Holy Ghost can dwell.<br><br>It takes time to achieve this harmony. Elder Pinegar explained why this is so:<br><br><i>The spirit is able to remain on the level of understanding achieved in the spirit world</i>[the premortal existence],<i>but the body functions at a telestial level, having more recently come into existence. Hence the flesh is weak until directed to use the truth of its creation at a celestial level by the spirit within.</i>[Personal notes]<br><br>In other words, the spirit controls the body until the body catches up. I believe our challenge is to get the body and spirit functioning together in harmony--eventually both at a celestial level. To do this, we must value each as sacred. Truman G. Madsen explained that "only when the spirit and body are 'inseparably connected' or resurrected, in a celestial condition, will we receive a fullness of glory and thus a fullness of joy" (<i>Eternal Man</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1970], p. 48).<br><br>Modern science has now documented the partnership of the body and spirit. Candace B. Pert, in her book<i>Molecules of Emotion,</i>authenticates the discovery of receptors in all cells of the body sensitive to neurotransmitters that carry information from the brain to the cells (see<i>Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel</i>[New York: Scribner, 1997], p. 61). What we are thinking and feeling in the brain is being transformed into peptide substances there, and through a chain of chemicals and receptors the brain and nervous system are in communication with the body. This means we have intellect in every cell.<br><br>Deepak Chopra substantiates in<i>Quantum Healing</i>how scientists are able to photograph the brain as it thinks or feels pain and actually track the formation of chemicals produced through this process to cells throughout the body (see<i>Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine</i>[New York: Bantam Books, 1989], pp. 64–65). This is exciting. If we are feeling the presence of the Holy Ghost or love or faith, this is felt in every cell of the body. On the other hand, if we are feeling depressed or angry or stressed, this is also evidenced throughout the body. According to Pert, these chemicals produced in the brain actually have the ability to bolster the immune system as well as keep disease organisms from entering cells (see<i>Molecules,</i>pp. 171–72, 190, 282). Feelings such as love, forgiveness, joy, and peace bolster the immune system. On the other hand, people who feel powerless, helpless, and out of control generally have compromised immunity. This phenomenon is explained in a gospel perspective by Parley P. Pratt:<br><br><i>The gift of the Holy Ghost ... invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i>[<i>Key to the Science of Theology</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 61]<br><br>The body-mind-spirit connection that Pert and Chopra verify scientifically, members of the Church identify as the Holy Spirit. If you have realized your own individual worth and take joy in it, the effects are evidenced in your body.<br><br>A harmonious partnership of body and spirit is vital to your eternal progression. Elder Pinegar explains further:<br><br><i>We can learn truths by way of the spirit, but</i>by the way of the body we learn to be like Heavenly Father.<i>The body constantly reinforces truth and is a constant testimony of truth; truly when kept pure the body is filled with the Light of Christ. The body is a source of fullness for the spirit because</i>through the body the spirit learns how to feel. [Personal notes; emphasis added]<br><br>Wow, I don't completely understand this process, but it is exhilarating to realize the power that is possible from a partnership of body and spirit. This partnership is clearly evident at a viewing of a departed loved one. The spirit has left, and every cell of the body is empty and thus dead. Likewise the spirit in this life is mute without the body to act out its intentions.<br><br>A reverence for your body could mean increased health benefits for you. Researchers have substantiated that active Mormons who adhere to the Word of Wisdom and exercise moderately on a regular basis and get eight hours of sleep each night are healthier and will live longer--white males 11 years longer than others in the U.S. and females six years longer (see James E. Enstrom, "Health Practices and Cancer Mortality Among Active California Mormons,"<i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>81, no. 23 [6 December 1989], pp. 1807–14, and Elizabeth VanDenBerghe, "Religion and the Abundant Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1994, pp. 32–45). The American College of Sports Medicine defines healthy exercise as 30 minutes of intermittent, moderate intensity activity each day. So walk to the store, mow your lawn, shovel the snow, climb the stairs to upper campus, and<i>accumulate</i>30 minutes each day. That's not too hard. Those of you whose bodies are presently impaired--they will be whole in the next life--do what you can.<br><br>The third belief window I want to briefly discuss pertains to the Holy Ghost. Elder Neuenschwander told us in his May 1998 devotional to rely on the Holy Spirit to avoid deception (see "Knowing What You Believe, Believing What You Know,"<i>BYU 1997–98 Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1998]). How will you know if the ideas I have just presented to you, or other beliefs, are true? It is through personal revelation, directed by the Holy Ghost. Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 confirms this: "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost. ... Behold, this is the spirit of revelation." In his book<i>Following the Light of Christ,</i>John M. Pontius explains this in a way that makes perfect sense, but as I had never thought of it before. He defines the iron rod, or word of God, as personal revelation (see<i>Following the Light of Christ into His Presence</i>[Anchorage, Alaska: Daybreak Books, 1996], p. 28). This means that if we are hanging on to the iron rod, as spoken of in conjunction with the tree of life, one of the things that is happening to us regularly is personal revelation from God through the Holy Ghost.<br><br>We are also told in 2 Nephi 32:5, "If ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do." What more could we ask than that? Wouldn't we all like to know all things that we should do? We wouldn't make any of those dumb mistakes that we all make. President Monson told us at his devotional on March 10 of this year, "Never ever ignore a prompting." No wonder Brigham Young stated, "I want to see men and women breathe the Holy Ghost in every breath of their lives, living constantly in the light of God's countenance" (<i>JD</i>9:288–89). Without the Holy Spirit our belief lenses do not correct for astigmatism nor for near- or farsightedness.<br><br>It has been a revelation to me how these three belief windows I've been talking about are so intertwined with each other. Blaine Yorgason, in<i>Spiritual Progression in the Last Days,</i>discusses this link:<br><br><i>Because our spirits are housed in physical bodies, the effect of the Holy Ghost influencing our spirits and minds is almost always accompanied by at least some physical reaction;</i>our bodies feel the workings of the Spirit. [<i>Spiritual Progression in the Last Days</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994), p. 184; emphasis added]<br><br>The opportunity to feel the influence of the Holy Ghost is a compelling reason to reverence our body and allow it to be as sensitive to the Spirit as possible. If it is dulled with drugs or overpowered with insatiable appetites, it is not likely that the Spirit can communicate effectively. Yorgason points out several ways the Holy Ghost affects our feelings and our physical bodies: (1) a burning in the bosom, (2) a quaking frame, (3) a still, small voice, (4) crying or weeping, (5) enlightened minds or sudden strokes of ideas, (6) peace in the mind and heart, (7) a constraining or impression not to say or do a specific thing, (8) a stupor of thought, and (9) comfort from distress or sorrow (<i>Spiritual Progression,</i>pp. 184–86). None of us will always respond to the Spirit in the same way, and we must become accustomed to our own personal physical witness so we can react when the communication comes. And it<i>will</i>come! President James E. Faust declared, "The voice of the Spirit is universally available to all. ... The voice we must learn to heed is the voice of the Spirit" ("The Voice of the Spirit,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1994, pp. 7, 8).<br><br>As I see it, our challenge today concerning the Holy Ghost is twofold. First, we must be worthy to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. If we worthily partake of the sacrament to renew our pledge of obedience, this will be a reality. We covenant each Sunday, when we partake of the sacrament, to remember the Savior and keep his commandments, and he covenants with us that we will always have his Spirit to be with us if we do (see Moroni 4, 5). John Pontius counsels us, "Spend less energy and emotion trying to figure things out, and put that effort into developing faith and obedience" (<i>Following the Light,</i>p. 133). Second, once worthy, we must also be able to hear and recognize this voice. Elder Henry B. Eyring tells us that this voice "is so quiet that if you are noisy inside, you won't hear it" (<i>To Draw Closer to God</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 18). The voices of the world and the adversary will be loud and persistent. However, Truman Madsen comforts us with this insight: "The devil is shrewd with the stratagems ... , but one thing he cannot counterfeit is the witness and power of the Holy Ghost" (<i>Joseph Smith the Prophet</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1989], p. 17).<br><br>What I am saying is especially important to you young students. President Faust told you:<br><br><i>The rising generation will be bombarded with evil and wickedness like no other generation. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . In some ways it will be harder to be faithful in the future, perhaps even more challenging than pulling a handcart across the plains.</i>[Faust, "The Voice of the Spirit," p. 8]<br><br>You must have on the right glasses: know your worth and follow the direction of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Finally, I would like to close with this counsel from President Faust. He sums up everything I have tried to say today:<br><br>[Following the voice of the Spirit]<i>requires patience in a world that demands instant gratification. It is quiet, peaceful, and subtle in a world enamored by that which is loud, incessant, fast-paced, garish, and crude. It requires us to be contemplative while our peers seek physical titillation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This solution of listening to and following the Spirit may not be popular; it may not get us gain or worldly power. ...</i><br><br><i>We must learn to ponder the things of the Spirit and to respond to its promptings. We must filter out the static generated by Satan.</i><br><br><i>Hearkening to the "voice of the living God" (D&amp;amp;C 50:1) will give us "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23). ...</i><br><br><i>I believe and testify that our spirits are special spirits and were reserved until this generation to stand strong against the evil winds that blow, and to stand straight and upright with the heavy burdens that will be placed on us.</i>[Faust, "The Voice of the Spirit," p. 10]<br><br>I pray that you will put on the glasses of which I have spoken and that we will all stand up straight declaring to the world our great and precious worth. I pray that we may esteem the sacredness of our body so that it may be an authentic receptacle for communications emanating from the Holy Ghost. As Brigham Young said, "Live [so you] can enjoy the light of the Holy Spirit, or [you] will have no confidence in [yourselves], in [your] religion, or in [your] God, and will sooner or later turn from the faith" (<i>JD</i>8:65). I testify to you that these things are true in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Connie L.

At our last devotional we heard a musical tribute to our friend and colleague Brother Dale Link, who passed away a few weeks ago. It was a beautiful work about American Sign Language entitled "They Carry Words in Their Hands." I, too, would like to pay tribute to this good man, my friend, who exemplified the spirit of the Y, the spirit of optimism, unselfishness, and service.<br><br>In 1949 Fulton Oursler published a book on the life of Christ entitled<i>The Greatest Story Ever Told.</i>A few years later it was released as a movie by the same title. Truly the life of Christ is the greatest story ever told, but we know only the smallest part of it. At the end of his gospel, John tells us that he has given only a very small account of all of the things that Jesus did and said, and then says, "But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name" (John 20:31).<br><br>Because of the Restoration we know much more about his life: as the Holy One of Israel in ancient times, as the Mortal Messiah in the meridian of time, and as the resurrected Christ. And because of the Restoration we know more about his central role in the great plan of redemption. Doctrine and Covenants 76 and 3 Nephi are two of the greatest sources of revealed knowledge concerning the Messiah and his mission. But these sources, illuminating as they are, constitute only a small part of all that the Lord could convey to us of this "greatest story ever told." Both accounts state that they are fragmentary--enough to produce faith and knowledge for our earthly progression but incomplete.<br><br>In 3 Nephi 26, Mormon tells us that the book of 3 Nephi, the abridgment that he has written of Christ's ministry in America, contains only the smallest part of all that Jesus taught these early Saints. Mormon refers to it as "a lesser part of the things which he taught the people" (v. 8). He then speaks of this abridgement being delivered to us, the Gentiles of the last days, and says: "When they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them" (v. 9). We have a promise then, if we are faithful to the great truths of the Book of Mormon we have been given, we will someday be given more of the story.<br><br>At the end of Doctrine and Covenants 76, the Prophet Joseph Smith tells us that the account of his vision of the three degrees of glory is likewise only a small part of all that he and Sidney Rigdon saw:<br><br><i>This is the end of the vision which we saw, which we were commanded to write while we were yet in the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>But great and marvelous are the works of the Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed unto us, which surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in dominion;</i><br><br><i>Which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet in the Spirit, and are not lawful for man to utter;</i><br><br><i>Neither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and purify themselves before him;</i><br><br><i>To whom he grants this privilege of seeing and knowing for themselves.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:113–17]<br><br>It seems to me that a central message of the Atonement and the plan of redemption is the great love of the Father and the Son for each of us and the great worth to them of every soul:<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</i><br><br><i>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10–11]<br><br>What a wonderful thing to contemplate that the most powerful being in the universe is also magnificently kind, wise, gracious, benevolent, merciful, and loves and values each of us beyond anything we can imagine. It could have been otherwise. Imagine the gloom, darkness, and despair of living in a universe dominated by a tyrant. Or even imagine living in the existentially empty universe portrayed by so many of the nihilistic philosophers of our time. Fortunately for them, as well as for us, they are wrong. In contrast, listen to this description the Lord gives of himself and of his stance toward us in the beginning of section 76:<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i><br><br><i>And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations.</i><br><br><i>And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</i><br><br><i>For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–10]<br><br>He delights to bless us. He delights to pour out knowledge and wisdom upon us as we are ready to receive it. And bless us he does. All but the sons of perdition will finally obtain a kingdom of glory, as explained in verses 40 to 44:<br><br><i>And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us--</i><br><br><i>That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;</i><br><br><i>That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;</i><br><br><i>Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, he saves all except them.</i><br><br>A crucial part of understanding how he can save all the works of his hands is an understanding of the doctrine of the redemption of the dead, that which the Prophet Joseph Smith referred to as "this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 128:17). This doctrine makes clear how salvation comes to all of the sons and daughters of Adam and how exaltation comes to all who will finally be valiant in the testimony of Jesus as they are permitted to learn the gospel, whether they receive it upon the earth or beyond the veil. And he further blesses us by giving each of us a part to play in this great drama of the redemption of the human family, both in earth life and also beyond the veil. It matters not whether that part be large or small, but only the devotion that we give to it. The genius of Church organization is that each of us has a calling, a part to play in carrying out the mission of the Church in our own ward. And, as I heard President Joseph Fielding Smith so eloquently state, "It matters not where we serve; it only matters how we serve."<br><br>We all love the stories of President Thomas S. Monson. He is a master at portraying for us the heroism in the lives of ordinary Latter-day Saints. Each has a noble part to play in the redemption of the human family, as do all of those who will come unto the covenant and be faithful, whether here or in the spirit world. God does his work through the humble. The honorable, good people of the earth of ordinary station are deserving of our honor and respect. Great things await them through the Atonement of Christ.<br><br>I believe that all of this is part of the plan of redemption. To understand this great plan in its fullness is to understand the meaning of the lives of the "numberless concourses of people" (1 Nephi 8:21) that Lehi described in his dream of the tree of life, to understand the plan for how the Redeemer saves every living soul with that which each is willing to receive.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "when men receive their instruction from Him that made them, they know how He will save them" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 12). Sometimes we see the macrostructure of this great plan in the sweeping panorama of the Apocalypse, such as John the Revelator's portrayal of the seven seals, the scenes typifying the 7,000 years of the earth's temporal existence. Sometimes we see it in visions of major historical events before they happen, such as Nephi's vision in chapter 11 of 1 Nephi of the tree of life in Jerusalem--the ministry of Christ among the Jews. Or his vision in chapter 12 of the tree of life in America--his visit to the children of Lehi. Or his vision in chapters 13 and 14 of the unfolding of the events of the last days, beginning with the many nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles in medieval times and culminating in the foundation of a nation of freedom in which the gospel could be restored.<br><br>Sometimes we see the plan of redemption in the very personal histories of the lives of individual Saints, such as the stories of Ruth, Esther, and Job. Or we see it in emerging communities of believers, like the story of the joy of Alma's converts at the Waters of Mormon or the stories of the lives of individual Saints and pioneers in our time in the scenes from the new Church video called<i>Ensign to the Nations.</i><br><br>We will spend our entire earthly lives, and perhaps well beyond, learning this great story of the redemption of the human family. Whenever we begin to discover and uncover more of the great plan our Father has for us, it is joyful and edifying. It unfolds for us throughout our earthly lives if we are diligent and continues after we pass beyond the veil.<br><br>Truly the doctrines of the Restoration are from God, and truly they are doctrines of optimism. Regardless of the ignorance, the darkness, the oppression, the evil, and the gloomy and arrogant false philosophies we may encounter upon the earth, we can rejoice in the knowledge that Christ has overcome the world and that he "saves all the works of his hands" (D&amp;amp;C 76:43). No wonder the Prophet Joseph would close his discussion of the doctrines of the redemption of the dead in section 128 with the poetry of rejoicing:<br><br><i>Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them! ...</i><br><br><i>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:19, 23]<br><br>With respect to the vision of Doctrine and Covenants 76, Joseph said:<br><br><i>Nothing could be more pleasing to the Saints upon the order of the Kingdom of the Lord, than the light which burst upon the world through the foregoing vision. Every law, every commandment, every promise, every truth, and every point touching the destiny of man, from Genesis to Revelation, where the purity of the Scriptures remains unsullied by the folly of men, go to show the perfection of the theory (of different degrees of glory in the future life) and witness the fact that the document is a transcript from the records of the eternal world. The sublimity of the ideas; the purity of the language; the scope for action; the continued duration for completion, in order that the heirs of salvation may confess the Lord and bow the knee; the rewards for faithfulness, and the punishments for sins, are so much beyond the narrow-mindedness of men, that every man is constrained to exclaim: "It came from God."</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 11]<br><br>I have a great love for the Book of Mormon. I love to teach from its pages. It brings together so many parts of the plan that may at first seem disparate but are in fact all of one. Indeed, the phrase "the great plan of redemption" is from Amulek in the Book of Mormon (Alma 34:31). The Book of Mormon is a window on the Old Testament that clearly explains the Abrahamic covenant. Nephi's commentary in the first two books is an illuminating tutorial in the sublime poetry of Isaiah. And in the first verse of 3 Nephi 23, the Messiah himself picks up the Isaiah commentary that Nephi began, and he commends Isaiah's words to us: "Great are the words of Isaiah," and "a commandment I give unto you that ye search these things diligently." The Book of Mormon integrates the words of the prophets of ancient Israel into the gospel plan and brings the Old Testament and New Testament together.<br><br>I have a good friend who is a rabbi as well as a psychologist. I brought him here about 10 years ago to teach summer term at BYU--a class in psychology and one on Jewish traditions. It was wonderful to have him here. He brought Susan and me a gift of the Torah, edited by Gunter Plaut, his favorite source. It was a big book with a dark blue cover, and inside the front cover was: "To Bruce and Susan from Aron and Sarah." We went to the distribution center in Salt Lake City and found a large-print copy of the Book of Mormon, also with a dark blue cover and about the same size, and we gave it to them: "To Aron and Sarah from Bruce and Susan." To my surprise, he immediately began reading it and showing me things I'd never seen. I remember him saying, "This is a book written by a Jew to a Jew in a very unself-conscious way." After he showed me, I could see many ways that the book assumes knowledge of Jewish tradition. It was something of a mystery to him, for, as he said, "Knowledge of Judaism was in short supply on the American frontier in 1830."<br><br>He showed me, for example, that the backdrop to the story in 1 Nephi includes the celebration of three of the fundamental feasts of the law: the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. You can read about these three feasts and their themes on pages 672–74 of the Bible dictionary, alphabetically listed under the heading "feasts." Additional information is given on pages 765–67 under the heading "sacrifices." In ancient Israel sacrifices were not just offered at random times but were an integral part of these three major feasts and involved instruction, celebration, and fellowship. They are much like our Thanksgiving but are combined with ritual and instruction. I picture them as a combination of the delight of learning and instruction that we have at general conference, but together with a wonderful Thanksgiving feast with one's family and friends in a yearly cycle. The feasts are one of the central ways our ancestors rejoiced in and taught each other about the things of God. Each feast celebrates a different aspect of the great plan of the redemption of God's people.<br><br>The instruction and ritual of these three major feasts centers upon three themes. The first feast is Passover. The theme is freedom, emancipation, the joy of deliverance from bondage, and going out from among the wicked to establish Zion in the wilderness. The second feast is the Feast of Weeks, and its theme is the joy of scripture, a celebration of receiving the Torah on Mount Sinai. The third great feast is the Feast of Tabernacles, in October at the end of the feast season. The theme is the joy of harvest, symbolic of the harvest of souls in the end of days.<br><br>My rabbi friend saw something in the Book of Mormon that I had never noticed. Lehi and his family offer sacrifices three times in the book of 1 Nephi, and each time it fits the appropriate theme of these three major feasts of ancient Israel where sacrifices were to be offered. First, in chapter 2, they go out from among the wicked of Jerusalem to find a promised land, and they then offer sacrifice, consistent with the first theme of deliverance from bondage. Second, in chapter 5, they offer sacrifice in conjunction with their rejoicing in having received the brass plates of Laban, their Torah. Third, they offer sacrifice at the end of chapter 7 after having brought the family of Ishmael out of Jerusalem as converts to their divine mission, consistent with the theme of the harvest of souls. In chapter 17 Nephi rehearses for his brothers the story of the Exodus and how the children of Israel rebelled against Moses in the wilderness. As a family they would have celebrated and discussed this every year in connection with Passover, but it is now as if Nephi is saying to them, "Guys, pay attention here. This time we are doing it for real! We are reenacting the Exodus, going out from among the wicked to find the promised land, and you are acting just like the rebels in ancient Israel."<br><br>Alma speaks to this Passover theme in the fifth chapter of his book: "Have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers?" (Alma 5:6). The focus of Passover is upon the deliverance from the captivity of the house of Israel in Egypt, where "the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage" (Exodus 1:13–14). Alma expands his discussion of deliverance to apply to the deliverance of his people from King Noah, a tyrant in the likeness of Pharaoh, and their deliverance from the Lamanites. He finally expands this theme of captivity to deal with their deliverance from the bondage of sin. In verses 6 and 7 he says:<br><br><i>Have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</i><br><br><i>Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word.</i>[Alma 5:6–7]<br><br>Alma thus ties the theme of Passover to the doctrine of spiritual rebirth: "And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (Alma 5:14). This is also the theme of going out from among the wicked to establish Zion in the wilderness. In 3 Nephi 20:41–42, in his extensive quotation of and commentary on Isaiah 52, Jesus gives these two verses from Isaiah:<br><br><i>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her</i>[Babylon];<i>be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel shall be your rearward.</i><br><br>Even as freedom and the deliverance from oppression is joyous, so also is the great emancipation of the mind and soul that comes from the word of God. In 1989 I had a chance to experience the Feast of Weeks, the celebration of the Torah, in Jerusalem with Aron, my rabbi friend. We stayed up nearly the whole night reading and discussing the scriptures, as is their yearly custom. Since that time I have read 1 Nephi 5 in a different way. After the sons returned with the brass plates of Laban, we read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel.</i><br><br><i>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</i>[1 Nephi 5:9–10]<br><br>For the next six verses there is a rehearsal of the marvelous things that Lehi found in the brass plates, and then it says:<br><br><i>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed--</i><br><br><i>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</i>[vv. 17–18]<br><br>In the Bible dictionary it tells us that the third feast, the Feast of Tabernacles, is the greatest, the most joyous of all. It involves, among other things, the illumination of the temple courts by four golden candelabra and the drawing of water from the pool Siloam and its libation (pouring out) upon the altar: "Of this it was said that he who has not seen the joy of the drawing of water at the Feast of Tabernacles does not know what joy is" (Bible dictionary, p. 673). These thematic elements of light and water are dealt with by the Messiah himself in the seventh and eight chapters of the Gospel of John. The libation of water represents the Spirit of God being poured out upon the nations, particularly at the great harvest in the end of days. In John 7:37–41 we read:<br><br><i>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</i><br><br><i>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</i><br><br><i>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</i><br><br><i>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</i><br><br><i>Others said, This is the Christ.</i><br><br>The illumination of the four golden candelabra represent the Light and Life of the World: "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).<br><br>Just before this final feast, the Feast of Tabernacles, in October at the end of the feast season, there is a fast day--the Day of Atonement--the most solemn and holy of all of the days of ancient Israel. The Day of Atonement is actually the culmination of the 10 high holy days (from the first to the 10th days of the seventh month), during which time the people of Israel were to put their lives in order in preparation for their fasting on the Day of Atonement--the one day in the year when the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to offer atonement for the sins of the people, obviously symbolizing the great Atonement of the Son of God. During these 10 days the people would turn inward to make themselves right with God, and then on the 15th day of the seventh month, the Feast of Tabernacles would begin and they would turn outward to other men.<br><br>We live in the great harvesttime, this time when we turn outward, when the gospel is to go to all the world. When we speak of the threefold mission of the Church, two of these--"proclaim the gospel" and "redeem the dead"--have to do with harvest: the first the harvest of souls upon the earth, and the second the harvest of souls beyond the veil. Abinadi spoke of our time when he said, "And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (Mosiah 15:28). In this same discourse to Noah and his priests, he quoted from Isaiah 52: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace" (Isaiah 52:7). He spoke of how this refers to the missionaries in every dispensation of the world who preach the word and of how these messengers all go forth in the likeness of Christ: "For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people" (Mosiah 15:18). It is joyous to serve as a missionary and it is joyous to be one of those who hears the message of redemption and comes out from Babylon.<br><br>There is great joy in doing our part as a missionary and great joy in doing our part in the redemption of the dead, turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers. We should not think of these twin charges to every member of the Church as an onerous burden. They are two of the greatest blessings in earth life, to have a part to play in the work of the Father in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. I travel quite a bit, and I have made it a habit to always take a Book of Mormon with me to read on the airplane and to give to the person I happen to sit by. Last month, on the way back from Washington, D.C., I sat by a young woman from Detroit. She asked if I were a Mormon, and she told me about a wonderful man who works with her who is LDS. She said that she wanted to know more about the Church but that because they both work for the government he was not able to share literature about the Church with her. I asked her if she would like a Book of Mormon, and she said that she would and that she would read it. Because she seemed interested, I showed her many of my favorite passages in the book.<br><br>A few weeks ago I took my six-year-old granddaughter for a walk over at the new Timpanogos Hospital while we were waiting for her new little brother to be born. In the hospital entry there was a crisp, bright new American flag. She touched some of the gold tassels hanging from it and asked me, "Which is more important, freedom or family?" I really didn't have an answer, but I thought about her question for a while. Family is central to the great plan of redemption. So is freedom, emancipation from bondage--the great theme of Passover.<br><br>In the last three chapters of 1 Nephi, Nephi quotes two chapters from Isaiah concerning the redemption of the house of Israel and finally of the whole world. First, in chapter 20 (Isaiah 48), he speaks of the redemption of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity and how the noble Cyrus, king of the Medes and the Persians, will be the instrument in the hand of the Lord in delivering his people. I love verses 15 to 17, where the Lord explains that even though Cyrus was the visible means of deliverance, in reality it was the hand of the Lord that had delivered them.<br><br><i>I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called him to declare, I have brought him. ...</i><br><br><i>And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it.</i>[1 Nephi 20:15, 17]<br><br>It is my testimony to you that he is the one who brings about these marvelous events in the history of the world, who delivers us from bondage.<br><br>Then, in chapter 21 (Isaiah 49), Isaiah speaks of the Gentiles carrying the children of Israel on their shoulders. In Nephi's commentary on this chapter in chapter 22, he says that this symbolizes the gospel coming from the Gentiles unto the house of Israel--carrying them on their shoulders and ultimately blessing all of the families of the earth: "It meaneth that the time cometh ... that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land" (v. 7). He is speaking of the establishment of this free land of America. He then says:<br><br><i>The Lord God will proceed to do a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders.</i><br><br><i>And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[vv. 8–9]<br><br>This is obviously talking about our time, the last days, when the Lord will gather together all things in one and the gospel will be preached in all the world. Then, in the next two verses, Nephi quotes from Isaiah 52:10 to say something very interesting:<br><br><i>And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.</i>[1 Nephi 22:10–11]<br><br>What does it mean for the Lord God to make bare his arm? And why is it necessary for him to do so in order for the families of the earth to be blessed by Abraham's seed? In the case of Cyrus returning the Jews to their homeland, it was indeed the arm of the Lord that had done it, but not obviously so. But in preparation for the gospel to go to all the world in the end of days, the Lord will reveal himself in a way that is obvious to all. This has been a century of much evil and much suffering, and many have been held captive by oppressive and tyrannical governments. For the gospel to come to them, for them to be blessed by Abraham's seed, there must be a deliverance. And for many there has now been a deliverance.<br><br>I believe this is speaking of miracles like the one we have witnessed in the past 10 years in the opening of the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to the preaching of the gospel. What a wonderful surprise it was for the people of the earth when the Berlin Wall came down. Who would have supposed that it could happen? Who but the Lord could have brought it about? One of my favorite movies at the BYU International Cinema is entitled<i>The Promise.</i>It deals with the despair of those caught behind the Iron Curtain but ends with the contrast of the pulling down of the Berlin Wall in 1989, with people from the east side and the west side wandering about, mixing with one another in wonder, amazement, and joy at this great gift from the Holy One of Israel, this deliverance from bondage.<br><br>I am an optimist. I believe there will yet be many such wonderful surprises from the Lord. It helps my optimism to remember that the greatest, most powerful being in the universe is also the kindest and most loving Father of us all. I remember years ago hearing my friend and colleague Richard Draper give a lecture on the revelation of Saint John and the message of that book--that Satan is limited. The clear implication of the book is that God is in charge, that beasts and dragons can have power for a time, but only as it is allowed by God to fulfill his purposes. Regardless of the evil we see in the world, it is liberating to know that it is limited--ultimately under God's control and therefore not to be feared.<br><br>Both David and Jonathan in ancient Israel understood that great truth: It matters not whether there be few or many, "for the battle is the Lord's" (1 Samuel 17:47). That knowledge gave Jonathan and David great courage. The destruction of the kingdom of evil in the last days in preparation for the millennial reign is also a part of the story of the redemption of the world.<br><br>It is interesting to see the preparation of the great prophets of our time. As I was looking through some of my old issues of<i>BYU Studies,</i>I found a poem about the tragedy of Berlin by President Spencer W. Kimball. The heading to the poem, an entry from his journal, reads:<br><br><i>Friday, August 26, 1955: I arose very early as was my custom. No one was around. I strolled out across the street, around the block, for several blocks and wept at the sight of the devastation. I plunged into a reverie and fell into the mood to write it down and returned to the typewriter.</i><br><br>President Kimball's poem is two and a half pages long, but I will quote just a few lines:<br><br><i>Ten years now since the world war tragedy!</i><br><i>High fences</i><br><i>Rusty fences</i><br><i>Proud, haughty fences around the former grand estates leveled in humiliation</i><br><i>Windblown gates unkept now hang and creak on rusty hinges</i><br><i>Ghosts of yesterday</i><br><i>Ghost houses, ghost yards</i><br><i>Broken swimming pools remind of luxury of the forgotten rich</i><br><i>Proud estates, spectre houses, all so still</i><br><i>No playful shouts, no children laugh</i><br><i>Silent walls, silent houses, silent death</i><br><i>Empty mailboxes--no letters ever more for them</i><br><i>Buildings leveled, pride leveled, innocence suffering</i><br>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Berlin,"<i>BYU Studies</i>25, no. 1 (winter 1985), pp. 54–56]<br><br>In the spring of 1974 our family lived in the Orem 32nd Ward. Elder Rulon G. Craven, who later became a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, was our home teacher. At the time he was serving as secretary to the Quorum of the Twelve and as a regional representative of the Twelve. One Sunday evening, following a fireside in our ward, he told us about a wonderful experience. He had been present when President Kimball addressed the mission presidents of the Church in April of 1974. He said that it was one of the most powerful and stirring addresses he had ever heard, that he felt as if he were sitting at the feet of Moses. I will never forget what he said and the impact it had on us. Later, in November of 1974, this talk was published in the<i>Ensign.</i>It is the one we all know so well and that we have quoted for so many years, where President Kimball told us to lengthen our stride and that the day would come that there would be missionaries in Moscow. He told us we need many more missionaries--worthy missionaries--and that each young man should prepare and anticipate his mission with great joy. He also asked us to pray to the Lord that he would touch the hearts of the leaders of nations that the nations of the earth would be opened to missionary work. For 20 years we prayed in our families for these things, and then, in 1989, the miracles happened.<br><br>For many years now I have owned the<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>and I had read the first volume, but it was not until after the Berlin Wall came down in the fall of 1989 that I noticed a remarkable discourse by Elder Parley P. Pratt, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve at the beginning of this dispensation. He was speaking at a patriotic service in Salt Lake City on July 4 of 1853, just a few years after the Saints arrived here in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains. He expanded our view of July 4 as not just a celebration of the freedom of America but as a celebration of the emancipation of the whole world. He said that freedom would spread outward from this nation until it fills the whole world. These are his words:<br><br><i>When we contemplate the designs of</i>[America],<i>and its influence, we contemplate not merely our own liberty, happiness, and progress, nationally and individually, but we contemplate the emancipation of the world, the flowing of the nations to this fountain, ... blending together in one common brotherhood. They will thus seek deliverance from oppression, not in the style of revolution, but by voluntarily emerging into freedom. ... I do not view it as do many, who suppose a revolution should take place in France, in Austria, in Germany, and the other nations, and that one revolution following another, would gradually emancipate mankind in every nation. ... But Providence opens the way whereby they may liberate themselves.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:141–42]<br><br>It was as though Elder Pratt had seen the events of the past 20 years. He spoke of how communication would increase in the earth until people in every nation would begin to know of the affairs of people in other nations, and those who had been held captive by the tyrants of Europe would voluntarily walk into the light of freedom. How else could one explain what happened? He said that "to two hundred millions of people on the American continent, dignified by the principles of American freedom, Europe must bow, by the indirect influence which must necessarily be exercised on those despotic nations" (<i>JD</i>1:143). Clearly, he was talking about our time--hundreds of millions of Americans living under the institutions of freedom.<br><br>Elder Pratt spoke of the beginnings of this "emancipation of the world" in the inspired voyage of Columbus, then of the coming of many others to America seeking freedom, the founding of this mighty nation, and how all of this would finally culminate in the great millennium:<br><br><i>Hence we contemplate that small beginning made by the American pioneers, by Columbus as the first pioneer, and by our fathers the pioneers of religion and liberty; we contemplate how that influence has spread and increased in the earth, influencing the feelings of individuals as well as national institutions. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . We can only borrow the language of the Prophets, which is also insufficient to convey the idea properly, that is, The earth shall be full of knowledge, light, liberty, brotherly kindness and friendship; none will have need to teach his neighbor to know the Lord, but all will know Him from the least to the greatest; darkness will flee away, oppression will be known no more, and men will employ blacksmiths to beat up their old weapons of war into ploughshares and pruninghooks. Their occupation will be to develop the inexhaustible resources of nature, improve the intellect, and lay hold of the Spirit of the Lord, and live by it. The world will be renovated both politically and religiously.</i><br><br><i>These are but partial ideas. To view the subject in its true light, would lead the mind to contemplate all the practical truths in the universe, that are within the grasp of mortal man; indeed it may reach into immortality. We will acknowledge the hand of God in the movements of men, and in the development of minds, the result of which will be the fulfillment of what the Prophet has spoken--the renovation of our race, and the establishment of a universal Kingdom of God, in which His will will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:143]<br><br>Let me close with my testimony to you that the prophets and seers see, that they know the great plan of redemption. I am grateful for the Prophet Joseph Smith, this great prophet who said he intended to revolutionize the world with friendship. I am grateful for our wonderful prophet of energy, optimism, and enthusiasm: President Gordon B. Hinckley. It is my testimony to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the World; that in him shall every good thing come; and that the great plan of redemption is true, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce L. Brown was a BYU professor of psychology when this devotional address was given on 4 August 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
Elder Eyring, President Bateman, family, faculty, friends, and fellow students, Sister Nelson and I are delighted to be with you. We are pleased to see so many here to enjoy an opportunity to learn together. "The glory of God is intelligence,"<sup>1</sup>and you confirm that fact. You look glorious to me!<br><br>I bring greetings from President Gordon B. Hinckley, his counselors, and my associates of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We thank you for your faith and devotion. We are grateful for your desire to learn and to serve.<br><br>Knowledge is a wonderful thing. Not all information is of equal importance, however. Nothing can reach the pinnacle of knowledge spoken by the Lord to his Heavenly Father: "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<sup>2</sup><br><br>As one among the "special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world,"<sup>3</sup>I believe I would serve you best if I teach and testify of him. First, I might ask you the same questions that he once posed to the Pharisees: "What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?"<sup>4</sup><br><br>These questions often come to mind as I meet with leaders of governments and various religious denominations. Some acknowledge that "Jesus was a great teacher." Others say, "He was a prophet." Others simply do not know him at all. We should not be totally surprised. After all, Christianity is a minority religion in the world. And members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are but a small minority among those who claim to be Christians.<br><br>In a world populated by more than five billion people, our large numbers here, augmented by many more watching on television, are really but a relative few. Our circumstance today was foreseen centuries ago by Nephi:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few . . . ; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>That righteousness, that power, that glory--indeed, all of our many blessings--stem from our knowledge of, obedience to, and our gratitude and love for the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>During his relatively brief sojourn in mortality, the Savior accomplished two overarching objectives: One was his "work and [his] glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>6</sup>The other he stated simply: "I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done."<sup>7</sup><br><br>His first objective we know as the Atonement. This was his magnificent mission in mortality. To the people of ancient America, the resurrected Lord gave his mission statement:<br><br><i>I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i><br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>In continuing his sermon, he revealed his second objective--to be our exemplar: "Ye know the things that ye must do . . . ; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do."<sup>9</sup><br><br>His first objective I have defined as his<i>mission.</i>His second objective I would like to identify as his<i>ministry.</i>For our discussion today, let us review these two components of his life--his mission and his ministry.<br><h2><b>The Mission of Jesus Christ--The Atonement</b></h2><br>His mission was the Atonement. That mission was uniquely his. Born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father, he was the only one who could voluntarily lay down his life and take it up again.<sup>10</sup>The glorious consequences of his Atonement were infinite and eternal. He took the sting out of death and made temporary the grief of the grave.<sup>11</sup>His responsibility for the Atonement was known even before the Creation and the Fall. Not only was it to provide for the resurrection and immortality of all humankind, it was to enable us to be forgiven of our sins--upon conditions established by him. And his Atonement opened the way by which we could be united with him and with our families eternally. This prospect we esteem as eternal life--the greatest gift of God to man.<sup>12</sup><br><br>No one else could effect the Atonement. No other person, even of the greatest wealth and power, could ever save one soul--not even his own.<sup>13</sup>And no other individual will be required or permitted to shed blood for the eternal salvation of another human being. Jesus did it "once for all."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Though the Atonement was consummated during the time of the New Testament, events of Old Testament times frequently foretold its importance. Adam and Eve were commanded to offer sacrifices as "a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father."<sup>15</sup>How? By the shedding of blood. From their own experience they confirmed the scripture that "the life of the flesh is in the blood."<sup>16</sup><br><br>May I say how significant that statement is to a medical doctor? Physicians know that whenever blood ceases to flow to an organ, trouble begins. If blood flow to a leg is interrupted, gangrene may follow. If flow to the brain is stopped, a stroke may result. If blood fails to flow normally through a coronary artery, a heart attack may develop. And if hemorrhage is uncontrolled, death ensues.<br><br>Adam, Eve, and generations to follow learned that whenever they shed blood from an animal, its life was terminated. For their sacrificial rite, not just<i>any</i>animal would do. It was to be a firstling of the flock, and one without blemish.<sup>17</sup>These requisites were also symbolic of the eventual sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God.<br><br>Adam and Eve were given a commandment: "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore."<sup>18</sup>From that day to the meridian of time, animal sacrifice continued to be a type and shadow of the eventual Atonement of the Son of God.<br><br>When the Atonement was accomplished, that great and last sacrifice fulfilled the law of Moses<sup>19</sup>and terminated the practice of animal sacrifice, which had taught that "the life of the flesh [was] in the blood." Jesus then explained how the elements of ancient sacrifice were subsumed by the Atonement and commemorated by the sacrament. I read from the book of John, chapter 6, verses 53 and 54. Note again references to the life, the flesh, and the blood.<br><br><i>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</i><br><br><i>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</i><br><br>Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all mankind, even as many as will, shall be redeemed. The Savior began shedding his blood for all mankind not on the cross but in the Garden of Gethsemane. There he took upon himself the weight of the sins of all who would ever live. Under that heavy load, he bled at every pore.<sup>20</sup>The agony of the Atonement was completed on the cross at Calvary.<br><br>The importance of the Atonement was summarized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. He said:<br><br><i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>With that authority and with profound gratitude, I so teach and testify of him today.<br><h2><b>The Ministry of Jesus Christ--The Exemplar</b></h2><br>The Lord's second far-reaching objective in mortality was to serve as an example for us. His exemplary life constituted his mortal ministry. It included his teachings, parables, and sermons. It encompassed his miracles, his loving-kindness, and his long-suffering toward the children of men.<sup>22</sup>It embraced his compassionate use of priesthood authority. It included his righteous indignation when he condemned sin<sup>23</sup>and when he overthrew the tables of the money changers.<sup>24</sup>It also included his heartaches. He was mocked, scourged, and disowned by his own people<sup>25</sup>--even denied by one of his disciples.<sup>26</sup><br><br>Wonderful as his ministerial acts were, they were not and are still not unique to him. There is no limit to the number of people who may follow the example of Jesus. Similar acts have been done by his prophets and apostles or others among his authorized servants. Many have endured persecution for his sake.<sup>27</sup>In your own time, you know brothers and sisters who have earnestly striven--even at a terrible price--to emulate the Lord's example.<br><br>That is as it should be. That is his hope for us. The Lord asked us to follow his example. His appeals are crystal clear:<br><br>• "What manner of men ought ye to be? . . . Even as I am."<sup>28</sup><br><br>• "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."<sup>29</sup><br><br>• "I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done."<sup>30</sup><br><br>These and other similar scriptures were not written as suggestions. They are divine imperatives! We are to follow his example!<br><br>To facilitate our desire to follow him, perhaps we could consider qualities of his life that we can emulate. Time would not permit us to list all of them, but perhaps we could identify five specific aspects that would be helpful to us.<br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>If I were to ask which characteristic of his life you would identify first, I think you might name his attribute of love. That would include his compassion, kindness, charity, devotion, forgiveness, mercy, justice, and more. Jesus loved his Father and loved his mother.<sup>31</sup>He loved his family and the Saints.<sup>32</sup>He loved the sinner, without excusing the sin.<sup>33</sup>And he taught us how we can show our love for him. He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."<sup>34</sup>Then, to underscore that his love was not<i>unconditional,</i>he added: "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love."<sup>35</sup><br><br>Another expression of our Savior's love was his service. He served his Father, and he served the people with whom he lived and labored. In both ways, we are to follow his example. We are to serve God, "to walk in all his ways, and to love him."<sup>36</sup>And we are to love our neighbors by serving them.<sup>37</sup>We start with our families. The deep love that binds parents to their children is forged by service to them through their period of total dependence. Later in life, dutiful children may have the opportunity to reciprocate that love when they serve their aging parents.<br><h2><b>Ordinances</b></h2><br>A second aspect of the Savior's exemplary life was his emphasis upon sacred ordinances. During his mortal ministry he demonstrated the importance of the ordinances of salvation. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River. Even John asked, "Why?"<br><br>Jesus explained: "For thus it becometh<i>us</i>to fulfil all righteousness."<sup>38</sup>Not only was the ordinance essential, but the example set by Jesus and John was also essential.<br><br>Later the Lord instituted the ordinance of the sacrament and linked it to that of baptism. He so instructed his disciples: "Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized . . . shall ye be baptized."<sup>39</sup>He again explained the symbolism of the sacrament and administered its sacred emblems to his disciples.<sup>40</sup><br><br>Our Heavenly Father also gave instruction regarding ordinances. He said:<br><br><i>Ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory.</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>During the Lord's postmortal ministry, the higher ordinances of exaltation have been revealed.<sup>42</sup>He has provided for these ordinances in his holy temples. In our day, washings, anointings, and endowments are granted to individuals who are properly prepared.<sup>43</sup>In the temple, an individual may be sealed to husband or wife, to progenitors, and to posterity.<sup>44</sup>Our Master is a God of law and order. His focus on ordinances is a powerful part of his example to us.<sup>45</sup><br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>A third aspect of the Lord's exemplary ministry is prayer. Jesus prayed to his Father in Heaven and also taught us how to pray. We are to pray to God the Eternal Father in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<sup>46</sup>I love the great intercessory prayer offered by the Lord recorded in John, chapter 17. In it he communicates freely with his Father on behalf of his disciples, whom he loved. It is a model of effective and compassionate prayer.<br><h2><b>Knowledge</b></h2><br>A fourth aspect of the Lord's example is the use of his divine knowledge. As mentioned earlier, many non-Christians acknowledge that Jesus was a great teacher. Indeed, he was. But what truly distinguished his teaching? Was he a skilled instructor of engineering, mathematics, or science? As Creator of this and other worlds,<sup>47</sup>he surely could have been. Or as Author of scripture, he could have taught literary composition very well.<br><br>The feature that distinguished his teaching above that of all other teachers was that he taught truths of<i>eternal</i>significance. Only he could have revealed our purpose in life. Only through him could we learn of our<i>premortal</i>existence and of our<i>postmortal</i>potential.<br><br>On one occasion, the Master Teacher told his skeptical listeners that they had three witnesses of him:<br><br>• John the Baptist,<br><br>• The deeds that Jesus had accomplished, and<br><br>• The word of God the Eternal Father.<sup>48</sup><br><br>He then proffered a fourth witness: "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."<sup>49</sup><br><br>The word<i>think</i>in that phrase may at first seem to be out of place. But it is vital to the meaning Jesus was trying to convey. He knew that many of his listeners did actually<i>think</i>that eternal life was in the scriptures. But they were wrong. The scriptures alone<i>cannot</i>bestow eternal life. Of course there is power in scripture, but that power comes from Jesus himself. He<i>is</i>the Word:<i>Logos</i>. The power of eternal life is in him, who "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."<sup>50</sup>Then, because of the stubborn stance of his skeptics, Jesus went on to rebuke them: "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have [eternal] life."<sup>51</sup><br><br>The Master could overwhelm us with his supernal knowledge, but he does not. He honors our agency. He allows us the joy of discovery. He encourages us to repent of our own mistakes. He permits us to experience the freedom that comes from our willing obedience to his divine law. Yes, the way he uses his knowledge provides a great example for us.<br><h2><b>Endure to the End</b></h2><br>A fifth aspect of the Lord's ministry I have chosen to emphasize is his commitment to endure to the end. Never did he withdraw from his assignment. Though he experienced suffering beyond our comprehension, he was not a quitter. Through deepening trials he endured to the end of his assignment: to atone for the sins of all humankind. His final words as he hung from the cross were, "It is finished."<sup>52</sup><br><h2><b>Application to Our Lives</b></h2><br>These five aspects of his ministry--love (including obedience and service), focus on ordinances, prayer, use of knowledge, and a commitment to endure to the end--can be applied in our own lives. Surely the best evidence of our adoration of Jesus is our emulation of him.<br><br>When we begin to realize who Jesus is and what he has done for us, we can understand, to some degree, the logic of the first and great commandment: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength."<sup>53</sup>In other words, all that we think and do and say should be steeped in our love for him.<br><br>Ask yourself, "Is there anyone whom I love more than the Lord?" Then compare your answer to these standards set by the Lord:<br><br>• "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."<br><br>• "He that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."<sup>54</sup><br><br>(Some of you may wish to add a boyfriend or girlfriend to that list.)<br><br><i>Love</i>for family and friends, great as it may be, is much more profound when anchored in the love of Jesus Christ. Parental love for children has more meaning here and hereafter because of him. All loving relationships are elevated in him. Love of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ provides the illumination, inspiration, and motivation to love others in a loftier way.<br><br><i>Ordinances</i>provide a focus for service of eternal worth. Parents should consider which ordinance is needed next by each child. Home teachers should think of an appropriate ordinance needed next in each family they serve.<br><br>The Savior's example of<i>prayer</i>reminds us that personal prayer, family prayer, and prayerful pursuit of our assignment in the Church should become part of our lives. To know and to do the will of the Father provides great spiritual strength and confidence.<sup>55</sup>To be on the Lord's side is where we want to be.<br><br><i>Knowledge</i>"of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be"<sup>56</sup>allows us to act upon true principles and doctrine. That knowledge will lift our level of behavior. Acts that otherwise might be driven by appetite and emotion will be superseded by deeds shaped by reason and right.<br><br>A commitment to<i>endure to the end</i>means that we will not ask for a release from a call to serve. It means that we will persevere in pursuit of a worthy goal. It means that we will never, no never, give up on a loved one who has strayed. And it means that we will always cherish our eternal family relationships, even through difficult days of disease, disability, or death.<br><br>Now may I administer a quiet quiz to help you evaluate your answer to my opening questions: "What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?"<br><br>With your silent declaration in mind, ask yourself two more questions:<br><br><i>What does his mission--his Atonement--really mean to me?</i><br><br><i>What does his ministry--his example--really mean to me?</i><br><br>To help you to be even more specific, let me ask:<br><br>• What do you think about when you partake of the sacrament?<br><br>• What do you do with your precious eyesight? What do you read? What do you watch on TV or look for on the Internet?<br><br>• What do you do with your ability to hear? To whom do you really hearken?<br><br>• What topics are worthy of your most intensive study?<br><br>• What do you allow into your body--your unique temple and gift from him?<br><br>• What kind of language is spoken from your lips?<br><br>• How does Jesus affect the way you use your time and talents?<br><br>• How does he influence the use of your means and resources?<br><br>• How does he influence your love for your wife or husband? Parents? Children? Brothers and sisters? Friends? Associates?<br><br>• How do his mission and his ministry affect who you really are? And who you may become?<br><br>With all my heart I pray that the transforming influence of the Lord may make a profound difference in your lives. I leave my love and blessing with you, along with my testimony that God lives. Jesus is the Christ. His mission and his ministry can bless each of you now and forever more, I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1>e Serve at BYU? - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I begin by expressing gratitude to the hundreds of friends who have prayed or sent messages of concern for my wife, June, who was the first lady of BYU for nine years ending in 1980. She was a great lover of BYU and its people and all its efforts. These prayers and messages were strengthening to her and to me. Many have asked how I am getting along since her death just over a month ago. I always answer, "As well as can be expected." Thank you, dear friends.<br><br>Your conference theme is "Neglect Not the Gift That Is in Thee." One of the gifts that is in all of the workers of BYU stems from the difference between employment at BYU and employment at any other college or university outside the Church Educational System. I wish to speak about that gift--that difference--with special emphasis on the subject of service at BYU. I do so by wisdom and not by commandment (see D&amp;amp;C 28:5). What I have to say is based on my experience in law, in higher education, in Church education, and in the leading councils of the Church, but I am not assigned to speak by way of commandment.<br><br>My message can be summarized in one paragraph. BYU faculty and staff have a<i>contract</i>relationship with their corporate employer and a<i>covenant</i>relationship with its sponsoring Church. This twofold relationship of both contract and covenant puts BYU employees in a position that is uniquely different from the employees of other colleges and universities outside the Church Educational System. It also puts BYU employees in a unique position by comparison with Church members who do not have a contract relationship with a Church entity. The rest of my message will discuss some of the implications of these unique positions. Applying them to the subject of service at BYU, I will urge you to neglect not the unique gift of your difference from others.<br><br>Because you have a<i>contract</i>relationship, you are compensated and you are subject to laws and regulations and contractual responsibilities and consequences that do not apply to Church members generally. You have employment duties and you are subject to employer authorities not applicable to other members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Even more important, because BYU employees-members have a<i>covenant</i>relationship with the Church that owns and controls BYU, you also have covenant obligations beyond your contract obligations. (I will describe the special position of non-LDS employees of BYU later.) The interplay of these two relationships on your service at BYU is the subject of my talk.<br><br>The fact that the BYU worker's position is different is not understood or accepted by some interested observers--and even by some of our own faculty, staff, and students. This is evident from what some choose to do or choose to say. I will not give examples but only ask you to supply your own as my message procee<br><h2><b>I</b></h2><br>Service at BYU is different from other colleges and universities because BYU is owned and controlled by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has commissioned BYU to accomplish a special kind of teaching. To some extent that teaching is like the teaching done by other colleges and universities. This tempts us to conclude that BYU is no different from the others. In contrast, to some extent the teaching done by BYU is like the teaching done by called servants of the Lord, including general and local authorities, missionaries, and teachers. That has caused some critics to charge that BYU teaching is like Sunday School teaching. Both conclusions are wrong. Both overlook the dual character of BYU's mission. Both ignore the complexity of the assignment to accomplish a twofold task with workers who have dual responsibilities, one undertaken by contract and the other by covenant.<br><br>Here I pause to cite some authorities on my conclusion that BYU is different. Consider these words by one who knew:<br><br><i>It has been said the Saints will be saviors upon Mount Zion, that they are destined to redeem the world. Redeem the world from what? From the thralldom of sin, ignorance, and degradation! In order to do this, Zion will have to take the lead in everything and consequently also in education. . . .</i><br><br><i>A glance over the conditions of mankind in this our day with its misery, discontent, and corruption, and disintegration of the social, religious, and philosophic fabrics, shows that this generation has been put into the balance and has been found wanting. A following, therefore, in the old grooves, would simply lead to the same results, and that is what the Lord has designed shall be avoided in Zion. President Brigham Young felt it in his heart that an educational system ought to be inaugurated in Zion in which, as he put it in his terse way of saying things, neither the alphabet nor the multiplication table should be taught without the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>Thus was started this nucleus of a new system.</i>[Karl G. Maeser, "History of the Academy," in<i>Educating Zion,</i>eds. John W. Welch and Don E. Norton [Provo: BYU Studies, 1996], p. 2]<br><br>Those words were spoken in 1891 by President Karl G. Maeser at Brigham Young Academy's first Founders Day exercises.<br><br>A more modern statement of BYU's uniqueness is this familiar declaration by President Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--not only for the "whole man," but also for the "eternal man." Where all universities seek to preserve the heritage of knowledge that history has washed to their feet, this faculty has a double heritage--the preserving of knowledge of men and the revealed truths sent from heaven.</i><br><br><i>While all universities seek to push back the frontiers of knowledge further and further, this faculty must do that and also keep new knowledge in perspective, so that the avalanche of facts does not carry away saving, exalting truths from the value systems of our youth.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," reprinted in "Climbing the Hills Just Ahead: Three Addresses,"<i>Educating Zion,</i>pp. 43–44]<br><br>Highly relevant to this subject is Paul's plea, quoted in your conference theme, that we "neglect not the gift that is in [us]" (1 Timothy 4:14). Also relevant to our circumstances are these words of the apostle Paul written to Timothy just a few verses before the direction that is your theme:<br><br><i>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</i><br><br><i>These things command and teach.</i>[1 Timothy 4:10–11]<br><br>As President Kimball taught, BYU's responsibility to educate for eternity requires a curricular and behavioral concern for the things of eternity as well as the things of mortality. This concern for revealed truth as well as earthly knowledge requires a concern for our students' personal values and conduct as well as their academic achievements. As other colleges and universities have abandoned or substantially weakened their behavioral concerns, our Church Educational System institutions have come to stand almost alone on this matter. In Paul's words, because we "trust in the living God" in seeking to carry out our dual teaching assignment, "we both labour and suffer reproach," but we consider ourselves under covenant to "command and teach" these things.<br><br>The unique twofold teaching responsibility of Brigham Young University requires that it be concerned about the personal conduct of its employees, especially its teachers. In the contractual relationship that concern is reflected through the requirement of temple recommend worthiness as an expectation of employment. But it is reflected even more importantly through the covenant relationship member-employees have with the Church, which sponsors BYU. Church members are under covenant to serve one another. For every employee of Brigham Young University the primary opportunity for covenant service is through their BYU employment, and their covenant responsibilities for service exceed their contractual responsibilities.<br><br>President Kimball described one important aspect of our covenant obligations in these words:<br><br><i>It would be my hope that twenty thousand students might feel the normalcy and beauty of your lives. I hope you will each qualify for the students' admiration and affection. It is my hope that these youth will have abundant lives, beautiful family patterns, after the ideal of an eternal family, with you for their example. . . .</i><br><br><i>I would like these youth to see their instructors in community life as dignified, happy cooperators; in Church life as devout, dependable, efficient leaders; and in personal life honorable, full of integrity; and as President John Taylor said, "Let us live so . . . that angels can minister to us and the Holy Ghost dwell with us."</i>["Education for Eternity," in "Climbing the Hills,"<i>Educating Zion,</i>pp. 50–51]<br><br>University employees who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints do not have a covenant relationship with the Church. However, they are contractual employees of a university that has a particular mission. They contract by employment to further and not to detract from that mission. For these employees the contract is sufficient, and as a group they have been remarkably true to their responsibilities.<br><h2><b>II</b></h2><br>Having stated some general principles of your dual relationship to BYU and to its sponsoring Church, I now wish to discuss some of the ways these principles affect your responsibilities of service at BYU.<br><br>After I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve, I gave my first address in general conference in October 1984. I reflected on the significance of my calling and the callings of others. I addressed the subject of why we serve. This evening I have concluded to repeat some of the ideas I felt impressed to share at that time, to enlarge them to include a few thoughts about contract as well as covenant service, and to apply these ideas to the specific subject of service at BYU.<br><br>Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ and a covenant obligation of those who belong to his Church. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, "Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matthew 20:27). In latter-day revelation the Lord has commanded that we "succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5). Alma's great teaching about qualifications for baptism and the effect of the baptismal covenant refers to willingness "to bear one another's burdens" (Mosiah 18:8) and "a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments" (Mosiah 18:10). Holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood receive it upon a covenant to use its powers in the service of others. Truly, all members of the Church of Jesus Christ have a covenant obligation of service to others.<br><br>Whether our service is to our fellowmen or to God, it is the same (see Mosiah 2:17). If we love him, we should keep his commandments and feed his sheep (see John 21:16–17).<br><br>When we think of service, we usually think of the acts of our hands. But the scriptures teach that the Lord looks to our thoughts as well as to our acts. One of God's earliest commandments to Israel was to love him and "serve him with all your heart and with all your soul" (Deuteronomy 11:13). Latter-day revelation declares that the Lord requires not only the acts of the children of men, but "the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind" (D&amp;amp;C 64:34). Similarly, the prophet Alma taught that if we have hardened our hearts against the word of God, we will "not dare to look up to our God" at the final judgment because "all our works will condemn us . . . ; and our thoughts will also condemn us" (Alma 12:14).<br><br>In these latter days we are commanded to "seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 6:6). Unfortunately, not all who accomplish works under that heading are really intending to build up Zion or strengthen the faith of the people of God. Other motives can be at work.<br><br>These scriptures make clear that in order to purify our service it is necessary to consider not only<i>how</i>we serve but also<i>why</i>we serve. For BYU workers that inquiry is complicated by the dual relationship I have described. Consequently, it will be desirable to consider both why we serve under<i>contract</i>and why we serve under<i>covenant.</i><br><br>People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. None of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.<br><br>Why do we serve? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six different reasons for service. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater.<br><h2><b>1. For Riches or Honor</b></h2><br>Some serve others for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve their fellowmen in an effort to increase income, to aid in acquiring wealth, or to achieve prominence or obtain worldly honors. If you are thinking of your contractual relationship to BYU, you may be saying, "What's wrong with serving for income or other personal advantage?" And I would say, "Nothing," so far as contractual responsibilities are concerned. But covenant service is another thing. It is ironic that the first reason for<i>contract</i>service is the least worthy reason for Church or<i>covenant</i>service. The scriptures teach this.<br><br>Service that is ostensibly unselfish but is really for the sake of riches or honor clearly comes within the Book of Mormon definition of priestcraft, which is to "preach" or serve "that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion" (2 Nephi 26:29). Such service surely comes within the Savior's condemnation of those who "outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within . . . are full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (Matthew 23:28). Such service earns no gospel reward.<br><br>So what is a BYU employee to do in respect to gospel service? Obviously, we accept and serve in our Church callings. But what about the majority of our time that is spent in employment activities?<br><br>I suggest that in addition to fulfilling their contractual obligations, BYU workers are obliged by their gospel covenants to engage in personal activities and to use their personal influence to preserve the spirit of gospel service. Speaking here in 1975, then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley said this:<br><br><i>Service to mankind must ever be the ideal of this great university. It was established in the name of Jesus Christ, who gave his life that all men might live. It was founded and built and helped through its early years of struggle by men whose faith was more precious than life and whose concern for others was above concern for self. If we ever lose that spirit, we have lost everything.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Second Hundred Years: A New Level of Achievement," in<i>Annual University Conference 1975,</i>Brigham Young University, p. 56]<br><br>What does this mean in practice? It surely does not mean that we cannot be compensated in our contractual relationship. But it does mean that we should not act solely for compensation or seek compensation for everything we do in an employment relationship. If we do not go beyond our contractual duties and extend and magnify our efforts as a matter of gospel service, we will neglect the gift (the unique position we occupy) that is in us. We must never lose that "concern for others . . . above concern for self" that President Hinckley described as the "spirit" we must retain, or we will cease to be worthy of his description of BYU as "the university of the Church of Jesus Christ" (<i>Annual University Conference 1975,</i>p. 52). Those who succeed at covenant service may yet experience the irony of enjoying<i>eternal</i>advantage from the inadequacy of earthly compensation for all they have done.<br><br>Here I insert a footnote. After I wrote the words I have just spoken I had an impression that I had spoken of this subject once before. I found that I had. Eighteen years ago this month I gave a commencement address just as I was leaving my service at BYU. My subject was "Challenges to BYU in the Eighties," and one of those challenges was the subject of BYU compensation. Though I did not use the terms I now use to contrast contract service and covenant service, I did speak of that contrast:<br><br><i>I have also been very uneasy about trying to match other universities on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the salaries paid at BYU. We have a unique sponsorship and a sacred mission. Each of us should feel a special relationship with our sponsoring Church, our Board of Trustees, and the sacred mission we have to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ as well as our professional subjects. Generations have taught at BYU for less than they could have been paid in other employment, and we stand on the foundations laid through their sacrifices. Those foundations of Church sponsorship, spiritual mission, and personal sacrifice are essential to what sets us apart and makes us worthy to survive. As we strive for excellence in terms recognizable in the world of scholarship, we must not lose touch with the spiritual endowment that qualifies us for leadership.</i><br><br><i>I wish I had a formula for balancing the countervailing pressures of market and sacrifice. We must not lose the spirit of sacrifice in employment at Brigham Young University, but neither must that sacrifice be exploited or become an excuse for unrealistic compensation policies in the university. After nine years of worrying over this problem, I have now left it behind for President Holland as one of the problems I have been unable to solve or ameliorate. I suspect that the only feasible solution is to be explicit about the issue, but to leave it to be balanced and resolved in the hearts and minds of individual faculty members and administrators.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Challenges to BYU in the Eighties," BYU commencement address, 18 August 1980, in<i>The Bond of Charity: BYU August 1980 Addresses,</i>p. 35]<br><h2><b>2. To Obtain Good Companionship</b></h2><br>Another reason for service--probably more worthy than the first in gospel terms but still in the category of service in search of earthly reward--is that motivated by a personal desire to obtain good companionship. We surely have good associations in our Church service, but is that why we serve?<br><br>Persons who serve only to obtain good companionship are more selective in choosing their friends than the Master was in choosing his servants or associates. Jesus called most of his servants from those in humble circumstances. And he associated with sinners. He answered critics of such association by saying, "They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance" (Luke 5:31–32).<br><br>As applied to gospel service, these first two reasons for service are selfish and self-centered and unworthy of Saints. As the apostle Paul said, we who are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so "to please ourselves" (Romans 15:1). Reasons aimed at earthly rewards for gospel service are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.<br><h2><b>3. Fear of Punishment</b></h2><br>Some may serve out of fear of eternal punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with<br><br><i>a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</i>[Mosiah 2:38]<br><br>Such descriptions surely offer sufficient incentive for keeping the commandment of service. But service out of fear of eternal punishment is a lesser motive at best.<br><h2><b>4. Duty or Loyalty</b></h2><br>Other persons may serve out of a sense of duty or out of loyalty to friends or family or traditions. These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked in gospel service without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. I am sure they are blessed and loved of God. "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:7). We have all benefited by the good works of persons who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes. These are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.<br><h2><b>5. Hope of an Eternal Reward</b></h2><br>Although those who serve out of fear of punishment or out of a sense of duty undoubtedly qualify for the blessings of heaven, there are still higher reasons for service.<br><br>One such higher reason for covenant service is the hope of an<i>eternal</i>reward. By "covenant service" I mean service beyond what we are required to do by contract, and by "eternal reward" I mean rewards beyond the compensation we receive for contract service. Hope of an eternal reward is one of the most powerful sources of motivation for gospel service. For example, I believe it is a significant motivation for the unending service we give to one another in our families. As a reason for service, this motivation necessarily involves faith in God and in the fulfillment of his prophecies. The scriptures are rich in promises of eternal rewards. For example, in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in June 1829, the Lord said, "If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><h2><b>6. The Highest Motive for Service</b></h2><br>The last motive I will discuss is, in my opinion, the highest reason of all. In its relationship to covenant service, it is what the scriptures call "a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31).<br><br>"Charity is the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47). The scriptures teach that this virtue is "the greatest of all" (Moroni 7:46). The apostle Paul wrote:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. . . .</i><br><br><i>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor . . . , and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:1–3]<br><br>We know from these inspired words that even the most extreme acts of service profit us nothing unless motivated by the pure love of Christ. If our gospel service is to be most efficacious, it must be accomplished for the love of God and the love of his children. The Savior illustrated that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, where he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us (see Matthew 5:44).<br><br>Service for the love of God and our fellowmen is surely a different kind of service than that prescribed by contract, where we receive value and give equivalent value in return. The Savior explained that difference in this same teaching when he said, "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?" (Matthew 5:46). Similarly, as he continued his Sermon on the Mount, he declared:<br><br><i>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</i>[Matthew 6:1–2]<br><br>This principle--that our gospel service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive--is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. Immediately after commanding that our covenant service include loving our enemies, he gave this great commandment: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>This principle of service is reaffirmed in section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 4:2]<br><br>Service with all of our heart and mind, which goes far beyond service with all of our might and strength, is a high challenge for all of us. It goes far beyond the quid pro quo of contract service. It is unique to our service by covenant. It is free of selfish ambition. It is motivated only by the pure love of God and our fellowmen.<br><br>If we have difficulty with the command that we serve for love, a Book of Mormon teaching can help us. After describing the importance of charity, the prophet Moroni counseled:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.</i>[Moroni 7:48]<br><br>I testify that God expects us to work to purify our hearts and our thoughts so that we may serve one another for the highest and best reason, the pure love of Christ.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this Sunday evening fireside address was delivered at the BYU Annual University Conference on 23 August 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Young University in the New Millennium - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The new millennium will begin January 1, 2001. By then problems associated with the year 2000 will be solved, and we will be looking forward to the completion of I-15, the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, and a new century. As Brigham Young University enters the third millennium since Christ's birth, what will its future be? What are the forces that will shape BYU in the years ahead? What role will the university play in the kingdom? Will it become more or less important to the future of the Church?<br><br>I believe there are four key factors that will determine answers to the above questions and shape the university in the early part of the next millennium. These forces include (1) the Lord's plan for the university, (2) Church growth, (3) advances in technology, and (4) the financial resources available. I begin with the Lord's plan.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Plan and the Importance of Education</b></h2><br>Is the Lord interested in Brigham Young University? Is it an integral part of the Church? Does he have a plan for BYU? Prophetic statements provide a "yes" answer to the three questions. Although we do not know the details of the plan, we do have specific statements specifying the value of education in the kingdom and the Lord's commitment to the university. We are all familiar with the revelations that specify the value the Lord places on learning: "The glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). "If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life . . . , he will have so much the advantage in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 130:19). "It is impossible for a man [or a woman] to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). These scriptural statements make clear the importance of lifelong learning. In this regard, President John Taylor stated:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>21:100]<br><br>A story involving President John Taylor is even more instructive with regard to the Savior's interest in and commitment to the university. Some months after becoming president of the Church, President Taylor was visited by<br><br><i>Zina Young Williams, the dean of women of the Brigham Young Academy in Provo and a daughter of Brigham Young. The academy was less than a decade old and was experiencing serious financial difficulties that, if not resolved, would mean its closing. After listening to Sister Williams's plea for help, President Taylor took her hand "in a fatherly way" and said:</i><br><br><i>"My dear child, I have something of importance to tell you that I know will make you happy. I have been visited by your father. He came to me in the silence of the night clothed in brightness and with a face beaming with love and confidence told me things of great importance and among others that the school being taught by Brother [Karl G.] Maeser was accepted in the heavens and was a part of the great plan of life and salvation; . . . and there was a bright future in store for . . . preparing . . . the children of the covenant for future usefulness in the Kingdom of God, and that Christ himself was directing, and had a care over this school."</i>[Leonard J. Arrington, ed.,<i>The Presidents of the Church</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1986), pp. 108–109]<br><br>What does it mean for the university to be "accepted in the heavens" as "a part of the great plan of life and salvation"? For any person associated with BYU, it is humbling to contemplate that a prophet has stated that "Christ himself [is] directing, and [has] a care over this school." And the purpose of the university is to prepare "the children of the covenant for future usefulness in the Kingdom."<br><br>It is clear from President Taylor's statement that the university is an integral and important part of the Lord's kingdom. It has played and will continue to play a central role in educating members. There are times, however, when it would be helpful to have the Lord's blueprint for the university for all to see--but that is not how he operates. Generally the Savior provides a broad outline and a set of principles. He then asks his servants to seek and listen to the Spirit in order to fill in the details. For example, the charge to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve is to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, but the Lord does not tell them how or when or where except through the quiet whisperings of the Spirit. The same is true for Brigham Young University. Guidelines have been given by the Lord, and it is important that all of us listen to the whisperings of the Spirit--not only the board, but also the administration, faculty, staff, and students.<br><br>As noted, the Lord has given some broad guidelines with regard to education in the Church that apply to the university. First, every member is to be "nourished by the good word of God" (Moroni 6:4). Nourishing is an educational process. The nourishment needed is both spiritual and temporal and is an important part of each member's development and a key component of the Lord's retention program. One peculiar aspect of Church membership is that the more educated people are, the more active they are. This relationship is unusual; the opposite is observed in a number of other faiths. (See Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity,"<i>BYU Studies</i>29, no. 2 [spring 1989]: 100–103.) Education is an important part of the plan of salvation, and the emphasis it receives in the Church increases student demand for higher education over time.<br><br>A second principle is that an educated membership in each country is important for the long-term development of the Church. Wherever President Hinckley goes, he encourages the youth of the Church to obtain an education. He understands that education is not only important for their temporal and spiritual welfare, but also educated people are important assets in building the kingdom. As the Church moves beyond the first generation in foreign lands, LDS student demand for higher education will increase.<br><br>There is a corollary to the "nourishment" principle and the importance of a worldwide educated membership. It is that the educational status of Church members across the world will improve over time because of the impact of Church teachings on each individual. Revealed truths regarding the importance of education, combined with prophets emphasizing the same, raise expectations among faithful members and increase their efforts to improve themselves. In other words, revealed truth increases the demand for education. Brigham Young University has been, is, and will continue to be in the center of this educational revolution.<br><br>Before examining the most important factor that will affect BYU's future growth and the Church's growth, I wish to emphasize again that we are given broad outlines but little detail. Consequently we often underestimate the Savior's involvement in our work. The Lord knows the intricacies of the pattern he is weaving, but we often fail to appreciate the intimate nature of his involvement in our personal lives and in the life of the university. I learned this lesson a few years ago. I spent 15 years studying and consulting in West Africa, believing that my work was unrelated to anything of a spiritual nature. From 1963 through 1978 I visited West Africa at least two or three times per year. I taught at a West African university. I served as a consultant to West African governments. I developed a strategy for their export markets. During these visits I had occasional contact with Africans interested in the Church. After investing considerable time and energy in the economics of that part of the world, I was invited to a meeting on the BYU campus in late 1977 with President James E. Faust. At the time he was president of the Church's International Mission. He learned that I had two trips to West Africa planned for the first half of 1978 and asked if I would visit some African members. Upon my return from the second trip in May 1978, I suggested to President Faust that a fireside be held for African students at Brigham Young University. The purpose was to provide direction for African members when they returned home.<br><br>The fireside was held in May 1978, with Edwin and Janath Cannon as the speakers. Brother Cannon was a counselor to President Faust in the International Mission presidency, and Sister Cannon was a member of the Relief Society General Presidency. Two weeks later the priesthood revelation was announced. A few days later I received a telephone call from President Faust inviting me to his office. During the meeting a call was issued inviting me to escort Brother Cannon through West Africa to meet with various groups who were interested in the Church and inform them of the priesthood revelation and tell them that missionaries would arrive soon. During July and August of 1978, Brother Cannon and I toured West Africa, meeting with many groups who had waited long years for missionaries to teach them the gospel. Upon our return we wrote a report for President Faust. It was then determined that Brother Cannon and I should meet with the First Presidency and give them a report. I will never forget the instructions received from David M. Kennedy, the First Presidency's international ambassador, just prior to meeting with President Kimball and his counselors. His instructions were: "Be succinct. Take no more than 30 minutes." We were prepared to do just that. Two hours later we were still being interviewed by the First Presidency. President Kimball, President Tanner, and President Romney had an insatiable interest in learning as much about the Africans and their circumstances as possible.<br><br>Following the July and August 1978 trip to West Africa, my trips there ceased. I did not return to that part of the world for another nine years. From 1963 through 1978, my temporal assignments had taken me in and out of West Africa multiple times per year. During that 15-year period I believed my work in West Africa was temporal and unrelated to the Lord's work. Looking back, I marvel at the way in which the many trips were a preparation for one special trip, and then the odyssey ended.<br><br>Was it coincidental that the African trips concluded with the 1978 journeys? Was it in the Lord's plan to use my work in Africa as a stepping-stone to accomplish his work? Although the contribution was small and the Lord easily could have achieved his purposes in other ways, it has been a reminder of the Lord's quiet, effective involvement in our lives.<br><br>In like manner, the Lord is shaping the destiny of Brigham Young University. Do we fully appreciate the Lord's intentions for this institution? Where will it be 25 years from now relative to other major universities? Will its role in the kingdom be more or less than it is now? I think of the outstanding honors that have come to our faculty during the past year and the accomplishments of the staff. I suspect that we do not understand or foresee the eventual impact of many happenings associated with the campus. For example, is the Lord weaving a mosaic with Professor Milton Lee's honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and Paul Cox's appointment to the king of Sweden's Chair for the Environment? Is Erlend Peterson's work with various Scandinavian government, business, and educational leaders part of a plan? How interested the Lord must be in Professor Cole Durham's work on religious freedom and the doors he has opened and kept open in central and eastern Europe.<br><br>There are many at the university performing scholarly work associated with the family. What will be the ultimate impact of the NGO Family Voice and our David M. Kennedy Center personnel on the United Nations' family policy? Will the new School of Family Life increase the visibility of our faculty's excellent research on family issues? Brigham Young University has been invited to take the lead in cohosting the next World Congress on the Family. Is the invitation part of a plan?<br><br>During the past year new relationships with the Islamic world have been formed as a result of Professor Dan Peterson's Islamic translation project. Additional books will soon be off the press. As scholars at the university communicate their interest in and appreciation for the Muslim world, what will be the outcome?<br><br>When one contemplates the creations of our music and fine arts faculty or the recent contributions of the religious education faculty as they have interacted with leaders of other faiths or the teaching of more than 50 foreign tongues by the language faculty, one is awestruck with the power of this institution where so many are working in concert to advance knowledge and improve the world.<br><br>What will be the long-term consequences of the new and growing relationships between our faculty and scholars at other universities? Advances in electronic communications are significantly reducing costs and shortening response times that make practical research collaboration, planning conferences across continents, disseminating research results, etc. As will be noted later, these forces will have a profound effect on the quality of both research and teaching at this and other universities. Above all, do we appreciate the cumulative impact we are having on this planet as 8,000 young people graduate annually and move forward as "children of the covenant" to make their contribution to the kingdom and the world?<br><br>I submit that our myopic view does not allow us to see the full mosaic or to appreciate the agenda set for the university. Nevertheless, there are key influences at work that will shape BYU in the years to come. In suggesting what may lie ahead for the university during the early part of the next millennium, I will discuss the likely impact of Church growth on BYU and then briefly examine the technological opportunities available to improve teaching, to support research, and to extend the reach of the university across the world. Also, I will provide an update on the capital campaign; suggest how some of the new, unrestricted resources will be allocated; and outline what the future may hold with regard to financial support. Along the way I hope to point out the responsibility we have individually and collectively to build a unique, world-class institution of higher learning.<br><h2><b>The Impact of Church Growth on BYU</b></h2><br>Church growth is one of the most important factors that will define the future of Brigham Young University. As one looks to the future, membership growth will produce hundreds of thousands if not millions of first-generation young adults. Some will have prepared themselves to pursue an education at an institution of higher learning. Others will not be so fortunate. Many of these young men and women could benefit immensely if taught some basic skills and encouraged to obtain further education. For the most part, their problem will not be intellectual capacity. They will be constrained by economic and sociological barriers. If historical patterns prevail, it will take two or three generations in the Church before members overcome the personal and social barriers and acquire the financial resources to attend a university.<br><br>Church population surpassed 10 million members near the end of 1997, with 50 percent in North America, 36 percent in Latin America, and the rest spread across the other continents. In 10 years' time, the year 2008, membership is forecast at 15 million--a 50 percent increase. If present trends continue, Church membership will total almost 30 million by the year 2025--three times the current number. At that time approximately 55 percent of the members will live in Latin America, 30 percent in North America, 10 percent in Asia, and the remaining 5 percent in Africa and Europe. The bulk of the Church's population will still be in the Western Hemisphere.<br><br>Today Church membership between the ages of 18 and 25 totals 1.5 million. By the year 2025 there will be 4.5 million members in this age cohort. Today the missionary force totals 59,000 in 160-plus countries and territories. By the year 2025, a reasonable estimate is 175,000 missionaries. I suspect they will be teaching in every nation and working among every kindred, tongue, and people.<br><br>Church growth will bring increased recognition of and esteem for the Church. Increased visibility will occur not only because of increased numbers but also because Church principles produce a people who are healthy, frugal, honest, hardworking, charitable, service minded, committed to strong families, well educated, and culturally diverse but unified by covenant.<br><br>The Church Humanitarian Services and the welfare program will make the Church even more visible, especially in times of crisis. For more than 100 years Church contributions for humanitarian purposes have occurred through other international organizations--Catholic Charities, Lutheran Care, the International Red Cross, etc. With the formation of LDS Charities, a recognized NGO, the Church may now be aiding disaster victims on-site.<br><h2><b>Consequences of Church Growth for BYU</b></h2><br>What does Church growth mean for this university? First, the pool of potential faculty, staff, and students will increase by three times or more. There will be an even more select group from which to draw. During the last 25 years the average freshman GPA has risen from 3.3 to 3.7 on a 4.0 scale while the ACT score has advanced from 22 to 27. What will these statistics be in the next 25 years, given a 29,000 student body cap? One way to forecast is to examine the top third of today's entering class. If the pool of potential students in 2025 will be three times larger than the current pool, today's top third will approximate the average in 25 years. The average GPA for the top one-third of the 1998 entering class is 3.9. Their average ACT score is 31. If entrance criteria remain the same, only those students in the top 5 percent of the high school graduating class will be admitted to BYU. Unless admissions criteria are changed dramatically, the academic quality of the student body will continue climbing.<br><br>Church growth will affect the potential pool of faculty in the same way. A greater and greater percentage of BYU graduates will attend graduate school. More and more LDS undergraduates at other universities will pursue graduate degrees. The pool of potential faculty will increase three or four times. The pool of experienced LDS faculty teaching at other universities will grow. I believe that the impact of these changes resulting from Church growth is that the quality of education at BYU will improve faster than at other institutions of higher learning. I also suspect that these changes will bring additional pressure on the university to increase its graduate programs. The university's emphasis on undergraduate education will be tested in the future, as it has been in the past.<br><br>Not only will the quality of students, faculty, and staff improve in the years ahead but the university will become more diverse. The number of foreign students will rise. Currently from 7 to 8 percent of the student body comes from foreign countries. One suspects that the percentage will increase to 15 to 20 percent, given Church growth outside North America. Because there are some advantages to being educated in one's native land and because economic barriers will continue to exist, the growth rate in foreign student demand may not keep pace with the growth of the Church in foreign countries. Still, the increasing quality of BYU will be a magnet for students no matter where they live.<br><br>One suspects that racial and cultural diversity at the university will increase faster than overall Church growth. Convert growth rates are higher outside North America, and my impression is that conversion rates for Hispanic and black Americans are higher in North America when compared with the rate for Caucasians. There will be strong, natural forces increasing the racial, ethnic, and cultural mix on campus.<br><h2><b>On-Campus Education</b></h2><br>Although some universities may struggle to maintain on-campus enrollment, it will not be a problem for BYU in the coming years. Increased Church membership is a key reason, but there are others. Face-to-face discussions, seminars, and labs led by an expert and aided by new technologies will continue as the most effective form of learning. Also, the university as a physical space will continue to provide a forum for social interaction. Young people will desire association with each other in educational as well as other social settings as they prepare to make marital choices. This will be true of young LDS adults even more than their nonmember counterparts because of Church teachings regarding the importance of the marriage decision.<br><br>On-campus education will be streamlined over time with the aid of technology. Lectures, data, class assignments, reading materials, exams, and other tutorial materials will be online and on CD-ROM. Students will access online information from their homes before they arrive, from their dorms after arrival, from the library, from other buildings on campus, and eventually by antennae from any location. When used appropriately, new technology has the capacity to reduce lecture time and allow for more discussion groups, seminars, and labs. To the extent that technology increases learning effectiveness, it may increase opportunities for students to be involved in research projects and free up time for faculty research. We believe that students will be able to spend a semester off campus with some courses taught at a distance. Pilot projects exploring these possibilities are underway.<br><h2><b>Distance Learning Opportunities</b></h2><br>BYU's Division of Continuing Education currently services more than 40,000 students. Most of the courses at present are on paper and through the mail. During the past year approximately 20 university courses have been converted to the Internet. Plans call for 50 courses on the Internet by the end of 1998, with 300 or more courses available electronically within the next five years. The new Internet courses are enriched well beyond their paper predecessors. A student anywhere in the world may enroll in a course by accessing BYU's main Web site. Payment for the course may be done over the Internet, and a password is given that allows access to the course. Eventually all of the materials will come over the Internet. Currently a CD-ROM sent to the student contains the video materials, and the disk works seamlessly with the Internet.<br><br>Hot links access video materials that include the professor describing course objectives, outlining the course, and lecturing. Hotlinks embedded in the course also take students to other Web sites and to the CD-ROM that contains enriched materials. The first BYU course on the Internet was Religion 324, the first half of the Doctrine and Covenants. The first person to sign on was a member in Japan. The first person to complete the course was a young, nonmember woman at a university in California. She was studying comparative religions and received permission to take the BYU course as part of the series.<br><br>As the number of Internet courses multiplies, so will the number of students served across the world--and at a much reduced cost. We expect the number of students enrolled in distance learning courses to multiply many times as students learn about the courses on the Web. The quality of interactive multimedia material available online will improve considerably with time and will become even more effective in both transmitting knowledge and in providing a learning experience.<br><h2><b>Brigham Young University's Responsibility</b></h2><br>The number of full-time students on the Provo campus will remain at 29,000. The percent of Church college-age students at BYU will decline from 3 percent in 1998 to 1 percent or less by 2025. One might ask the question "In terms of the Church, how does the university continue its important role in the kingdom and keep from becoming peripheral?" I believe the answer is twofold. First, we must focus our resources and energies to provide a world-class education for on-campus students. As new initiatives are put forward, we also must be willing to drop programs that are less valuable. We must concentrate our efforts. Professor Fuhriman's responsibilities will include the development of planning and assessment processes that help in this regard. Our undergraduate enrollment will be four times the size of Harvard's, Princeton's, or Stanford's, with our students academically equivalent to theirs. In addition, our students will have special qualities not always found on these other campuses. It is vital that we provide them with a first-class educational opportunity. The foundation is in place to do this.<br><br>Today's<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>rankings place us among the top 100 universities in the United States--in the top half of the second tier. That is a major advance from the third-tier rankings of recent years. Although I appreciate the move up in the rankings, the magazine still underestimates the quality of a BYU education. The new ranking did make some adjustments for the effects of missions on freshman retention and on graduation rates. However, these factors would improve further if we could take into account the full impact of missions. Also, 25 percent of the weighting is based on how we are viewed by the administrations of other universities. Although they learn something about our quality from the students we send them for graduate work, most administrators are not involved in teaching. Generally their views are formed by the candidates they interview for faculty positions and the research reputation of a university's faculty. The limited number of PhD programs on this campus reduces BYU's visibility to the administrators of other institutions. Over time, however, they will come to know more about us through our students and our research.<br><br>The second condition to be met so that BYU continues playing a central role in the kingdom is that we leverage the excellence on campus to provide educational opportunities for LDS students who are unable to come here. Using distance learning courses is one approach, but there are other ways as well. Through faculty collaboration with scholars across the world, scholars at other institutions will learn to value us as a people and, therefore, create opportunities for qualified LDS students to enter their halls of learning. May I illustrate the possibilities with a short video.<br><br>[The BYU College of Engineering video illustrates two-way televideo communications between BYU in Provo; Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho; the Institute of Higher Education in Monterrey, Mexico; and the University of Tokyo in Japan. The video depicts BYU faculty and students working with faculty and students at the other locations, sharing computer hardware and software, and designing products. In addition, faculty and students at the distant locations are able to run expensive milling machinery at BYU in Provo using the Internet and their connection to BYU's computer facilities. The video also shows BYU faculty and students teaching students at Ricks College how to operate the computer equipment and other pieces of equipment on campus. Because the distance learning connection is over the Internet, the communications costs are very low.]<br><br>The engineering video illustrates the potential power of distance learning in a number of settings. My purpose in showing the video, however, is to illustrate the collaboration between BYU and two of the finest universities in the world--the Institute of Technology in Monterrey, Mexico, and the University of Tokyo. What if there were LDS Japanese or Mexican students interested in learning how to use the engineering software? Could they be invited to participate with the other students in Monterrey or Tokyo? Or if BYU could certify student quality, would a Brazilian university admit an LDS student who had not traveled the prescribed admissions path? I believe the day will come when our reputation and credibility will open doors for LDS students wherever they may be.<br><br>As we look forward to the next century, we must build links in a natural way between BYU and the best universities in the world. Faculty collaboration is one means. Faculty and student exchanges are another. Visits to this campus by educational leaders is a third way. The natural ties and associations BYU has with other institutions will open doors for our young people in foreign nations to obtain an education.<br><br>I also foresee the day when BYU Web programs will prepare LDS students in foreign lands to enter universities and/or find employment. Retired professors and their wives will be called on missions to serve as tutors in foreign countries to help young adults complete BYU Web courses and prepare for entrance exams. If our reputation is strong enough, LDS students living outside the U.S. will complete a university degree by taking a combination of BYU courses over the Internet and completing courses at the local university. Currently, pilot projects in Monterrey, Mexico, and São Paulo, Brazil, are laying the foundation for these possibilities.<br><br>For the above to happen, BYU must be a world-class university. This distinctiveness will come if we follow the counsel of Elder Oaks given in last night's fireside. We must be willing to go the extra mile in our teaching and research because we have the "covenant of fire" within. If we are covenant disciples, we will not neglect the gifts we have to offer, and our sacrifice will build a Zion university that excels. Over time, faculty and administration must work together to attract and support the finest LDS faculty available as well as outstanding non-LDS scholars who share our values and support our mission.<br><h2><b>Financial Resources</b></h2><br>If the destiny of Brigham Young University is to become world-class, from where will the financial resources come? Fortunately the board of trustees is committed to building an extraordinary institution. In the history of religious universities, there is no parallel to the Church's financial commitment to Brigham Young University. Will it continue? President Gordon B. Hinckley reiterated the Church's commitment at the April 1996 capital campaign public announcement. It is my sense that the Church will continue funding BYU near current levels, with moderate annual increases.<br><br>In addition, capital donations from individuals, foundations, and corporations are beginning to supply the university with resources that will make a difference. Four years ago President Rex Lee initiated a capital campaign with the approval of the board of trustees. The goal was to raise $250 million in a six-year period. To date, approximately $225 million has been received, with another $90 million pledged. With 20 months left, it appears that the campaign will raise more than $300 million. An important aspect of the capital development program is that a foundation is being laid for continued giving by friends of BYU. Relationships are being forged so that donations to the university will continue at an annual rate of $50 million after the campaign ends with the expectation that the giving level will increase over time.<br><br>Of the $225 million raised to date, $40 million has been contributed for student scholarships. Most of the scholarship donations are restricted to various colleges, departments, and programs. Consequently these funds are in the hands of the deans and department chairs. More than $50 million of the total received is in the form of gifts in kind. These gifts include expensive equipment, software, and various other materials that aid research.<br><br>Donations for the Howard W. Hunter Law Library and the Harold B. Lee Library addition total approximately $20 million. Approximately $30 million has been raised for direct faculty support, including chairs, professorships, curriculum development, and research. The income flow from the unrestricted portion of the faculty support funds will be used to support new university professorships. The balance of the funds are restricted to special programs. However, a number of the restricted program gifts also support faculty research.<br><br>During the past few months, Vice President Alan Wilkins and his staff have been working with deans and department chairs to select faculty to occupy a number of new university professorships that will be funded from capital donations given for that purpose. Within the next few days the recipients of 11 new professorships will be announced. The new professorships will carry a stipend and provide funds for teaching and research support.<br><br>Given the opportunity to redesign courses and take advantage of new technology, a curriculum development fund is being established. Discussions with deans, department chairs, and faculty will establish the guidelines for allocating funds to support courseware development. Additional funds for research projects will also be made available.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>As the university approaches the new millennium, the future of Brigham Young University holds great promise. The link between the Church and the university will become stronger than ever. Church growth will continue to be a catalyst pushing us forward in the academic world. The uniqueness of the university with its dual mission of academic and spiritual development will enhance the university's standing in relation to its sister institutions--academically and otherwise. The number of faculty recognized internationally will grow exponentially. The number of graduates receiving honors from the outside world will increase in like manner.<br><br>In all sincerity I cannot think of a better time to be at Brigham Young University. The Lord is directing its course. We are beginning to scale the mountains in front of us, but there are many more to climb. (See Spencer W. Kimball, "Climbing the Hills Just Ahead: Three Addresses,"<i>Educating Zion,</i>eds. John W. Welch and Don E. Norton [Provo: BYU Studies, 1996], p. 77.) May the Lord bless us as we lay our gifts on the altar is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was President of Brigham Young University when this address was given at the Monday morning session of the BYU Annual University Conference on 24 August 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>y: Our Sacred Honor - Marilyn S. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My subject today concerns one of the values from the Young Women Theme. I suspect that almost all of the women in the audience are familiar with this standard and could say it with me. As an introduction to my topic, would the women stand and repeat with me the Young Women Theme:<br><br><i>We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us, and we love him. We will "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" as we strive to live the Young Women Values, which are:</i><br><br><i>Faith</i><br><i>Divine Nature</i><br><i>Individual Worth</i><br><i>Knowledge</i><br><i>Choice and Accountability</i><br><i>Good Works and</i><br><i>Integrity</i><br><br><i>We believe as we come to accept and act upon these values, we will be prepared to make and keep sacred covenants, receive the ordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessings of exaltation. (See Mosiah 18:9.)</i><br><br>[<i>Personal Progress</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1989), p. 6]<br><br>Thank you for assisting me. There is power in unity. We hope that the brethren realize not only how beautiful you are but appreciate your commitment to these principles.<br><br>All of us are on earth for a sacred and glorious purpose. It is not by chance that you have been reserved for this time--the dispensation of the fullness of times. Your birth was foreordained in the eternities. You are the "youth of the noble birthright" ("Carry On,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 255).<br><br>In a very literal sense you are children of God. He is the Father of your spirit. Elder Boyd K. Packer said, "Spiritually you are of noble birth. . . . However many generations [there may be] in your mortal ancestry . . . , the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line. You are a child of God!" ("The Message: Your Test of Courage,"<i>New Era,</i>March 1990, p. 6). You have inherited your spiritual DNA from God the Father.<br><br>The Young Women Theme lists seven important virtues that we must come to understand and incorporate in our lives. As these virtues or principles are internalized, they give us the power to "keep sacred covenants, receive the ordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessings of exaltation."<br><br>Today I will focus on the value of integrity. It is one of the cornerstones of character. Integrity implies honesty, moral soundness, and a quality of being undivided. Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, "A [person] of integrity is . . . particularly strict about fulfilling the trusts reposed in him by others" (<i>MD,</i>p. 385). President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated, "Without personal integrity, there can be no confidence. Without confidence there can be no prospect of permanent success" (<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 267).<br><br>The first part of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America establishes that all people have certain rights that include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Americans, as well as those of other nationalities, are passionate about their rights and the protection of those rights. In fact, many go to great lengths in asserting them. As I have thought about the concern that people have with rights, I believe it would be well for all of us to pay attention to the last line in the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson concluded the document with these words: "We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."<br><br>The last paragraph of the declaration is as important as the earlier ones. The signers of the Declaration of Independence pledged everything they owned, including their lives and their sacred honor, in order for America to become a free nation. Today we enjoy the blessings of a free land because of their sacrifice. The signers knew the risks when they put their names on the document. The declaration represented an act of treason against the British Crown. The penalty was death by hanging if caught. Each became a hunted man.<br><br>One of the signers, Francis Lewis, a delegate from New York, "saw his home plundered and his estates completely destroyed by British soldiers. His wife was captured and treated with brutality. Though she was later exchanged for two British prisoners through the efforts of Congress, she died from her abuse" (Rush Limbaugh, Jr., "Lives, Fortunes, Sacred Honor,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>July 1998, p. 165). Other signers experienced similar fates. Some lost their lives. Some of their family members lost theirs. Many lost their fortunes in support of the patriotic cause. But all of them were true to the promise of loyalty to their new country and to each other.<br><br>As citizens today we have a claim on the rights earned by these early patriots. It is my belief that the great land of America and its citizens also have claim on each person to be honest and true--to be people of integrity.<br><br>Honesty is one of the basic elements of integrity. One's honor is based on personal integrity maintained without legal or other obligations. President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>An honorable man or woman is one who is truthful; free from deceit; above cheating, lying, stealing, or any form of deception. An honorable man or woman is one who learns early that one cannot do wrong and feel right. A man's</i>[or a woman's]<i>character is judged on how he</i>[or she]<i>keeps his word and his agreements.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>p. 368]<br><br>Mohandas K. Gandhi is one of the greatest statesmen of this century. He is honored and revered in his country as one of its most dedicated leaders. He was known for his integrity. A story about Gandhi illustrates his desire for his actions to be congruent with his beliefs, regardless of the cost. Gandhi's "mother taught him that to eat meat was wrong, inasmuch as it necessitated the destruction of life, so Gandhi pledged to his mother that he would remain a strict vegetarian throughout his life." Later, Gandhi became seriously ill. "His physicians tried to persuade him that if he would drink a little beef broth, his life might be saved, but Gandhi said, 'Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me--to die, but never to break my pledge.'" Because of his integrity, his "followers renamed him the Mahatma, or the Great Soul" (Sterling W. Sill,<i>The Laws of Success</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975], pp. 186–87). We may or may not agree with Gandhi's commitment, but we admire his honor. To him the pledge made to his mother was sacred.<br><br>Each person at Brigham Young University has given his or her pledge that they will abide by the principles set forth in the Honor Code. Because of that commitment, you have been admitted to the university. It is a serious pledge because your honor is at stake. How you keep your word defines who you are. The fastest way to lose your good character is to break the pledge. "Great Learning and superior abilities, should you ever possess them," Abigail Adams told her son, John Quincy, "will be of little value and small Estimation, unless Virtue, Honour, Truth and integrety [<i>sic</i>] are added to them" (in William J. Bennett, ed.,<i>Our Sacred Honor</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997], p. 219).<br><br>BYU is a "city . . . set on an hill [which] cannot be hid" (Matthew 5:14). What happens here is noted throughout the country. There are millions of people watching our moves and listening to our words. Each of us is a representative of the whole. If we live honest, true lives, the attribution is to everyone. If some lack honor and integrity, it reflects on all of us as well. There is much expected, given our moral code and standards of behavior. The ways of the world are constantly challenging us to compromise. We may not be at war with nations presently, but we are at war with many of society's standards.<br><br>Members of the BYU community are covenant makers. Covenants with God are not to be taken lightly. In Doctrine and Covenants 98:14, the Lord says, "I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy." President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>Complete and constant integrity is a great law of human conduct. There need to be some absolutes in life. There are some things that should not ever be done, some lines that should never be crossed, vows that should never be broken, words that should never be spoken, and thoughts that should never be entertained.</i>["Integrity, the Mother of Many Virtues,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1982, p. 48]<br><br>My dear friends, maintain your integrity. Stay true to yourselves. Seek to live by the Spirit. May we all strive to live the commandments is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, the wife of Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address on 8 September 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ents: Children of the Covenant - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Sister Bateman and I approach the beginning of each school year with excitement as we greet 7,000 new and 21,000 returning students. We extend a special welcome to everyone, including more than 6,000 missionaries who have returned to campus during the last year. The safe arrival of each student is of utmost concern. Labor Day weekend, with many students traveling home and then returning, is of concern. Historically it is a dangerous time, as lives are sometimes lost. We are pleased to report that no accidents resulting in death have been reported as of this morning.<br><br>At the beginning of each new year, we are excited to meet the freshman and transfer students and feel their energy and enthusiasm. The meeting two weeks ago with parents of new students was a special highlight, as was the freshman commencement that concluded a week of orientation. Conversations with parents of new students revealed a deep appreciation for Brigham Young University and its mission. As the world drifts farther away from well-proven principles, parents are concerned for the moral and spiritual welfare of their young people as they leave home for college life. An e-mail message received last week from the father of a new freshman is typical of parents' feelings. The message reads:<br><br><i>Dear President Bateman,</i><br><br><i>Thank</i>[s]<i>for taking the time to speak with us new-student parents last Thursday afternoon.</i>[The parent meeting]<i>and the "commencement" later that night were a . . . highlight in our trip to bring our daughter to school. I was especially impressed by two things:</i><br><br>• [The]<i>sincere effort to get the freshmen involved;</i><br><br>• [The]<i>down-to-earth manner in discussing the challenges students will face.</i><br><br>The father then concluded his message with the following statement:<br><br><i>I felt something in those meetings that I haven't felt for a long time; the excitement of being a part of a community that is really doing something important, meaningful, and beneficial to the world. We know our daughter is in good hands and are thrilled that she's able to attend BYU.</i><br><br><i>Best regards . . .</i><br><br>The theme for my remarks centers on the father's feelings of "being part of a community that is . . . doing something important." There are two parts to the statement. I wish to discuss both and then suggest ways in which each member of the community can live up to the opportunities that are here.<br><br>The father indicated that he felt the "excitement of being part of [the Brigham Young University] community." What is the BYU community? What is the source of excitement felt by the father? Is BYU making a meaningful contribution to the world? I believe that BYU's mission is among the most important on earth! What is it? In the next few minutes I wish to address these questions in the hope that our view of the university will be broadened and our commitment deepened.<br><h2><b>The Mission of Brigham Young University</b></h2><br>Two weeks ago at the Annual University Conference I shared a story with the faculty and staff concerning the mission of BYU. Since the students were not there, let me repeat it for their benefit. The incident took place in 1885, 10 years after the founding of Brigham Young Academy. In those days the school was funded by local donations with little support from Church headquarters, and the college had fallen on hard times. There was not enough money to pay teachers or provide supplies. The situation was desperate, and it appeared that the academy's doors would close. Zina Young Williams, dean of women and a daughter of Brigham Young, initiated a meeting with President John Taylor in the hope of obtaining Church help. The story unfolds as follows:<br><br><i>After listening to Sister Williams's plea for help, President Taylor took her hand "in a fatherly way" and said:</i><br><br><i>'My dear child, I have something of importance to tell you that I know will make you happy. I have been visited by your father. He came to me in the silence of the night clothed in brightness and with a face beaming with love and confidence told me things of great importance and among others that the school being taught by Brother [Karl G.] Maeser was accepted in the heavens and was a part of the great plan of life and salvation; . . . and there was a bright future in store for . . . preparing . . . the children of the covenant for future usefulness in the Kingdom of God, and that Christ himself was directing, and had a care over this school."</i>[Leonard J. Arrington, ed.,<i>The Presidents of the Church</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1986), pp. 108–9]<br><br>In spite of the dark hour overshadowing the academy in 1885, one can say with hindsight that it had a "bright future." As one compares today's marvelous campus nestled against the Wasatch Mountains with those early beginnings in downtown Provo, the connection is almost unrecognizable in physical terms. The small seedling Zina Young Williams tried to protect has developed into a mature forest. There is a stark contrast between the few dozen students gathered from local communities in 1885 and today's almost 30,000 students assembled from all 50 states and 117 foreign countries. But elaborate facilities and a large student body are not sufficient to fulfill President Taylor's dream. Brigham Young's statement to President John Taylor is fulfilled only if the university prepares "children of the covenant for future usefulness in the Kingdom of God." The mission of BYU encompasses the academic but is more--much more. Who are the "children of the covenant," and how does the university prepare them to be useful in the kingdom and the world?<br><h2><b>The Children of the Covenant</b></h2><br>The BYU community is composed of children of the covenant. In order to know who these people are, one must know something about the covenant. The revealed gospel of Jesus Christ is called the "new and everlasting covenant." We believe that it embraces every set of promises that God has made or will make with men and women on this earth (D&amp;amp;C 132:5–7, 133:57). One enters into this covenant through faith, repentance, and baptism. One continues in the covenant through obedience to gospel principles and by participation in even higher covenants.<br><br>The "new and everlasting covenant" is the most potent force shaping the destiny of Brigham Young University. It produces the light that helps us see the university's mission. It generates the power that draws us together and focuses our energy in the discovery of knowledge. The bond that creates the special BYU community is not just the contractual relationship each person has with the university but the covenantal relationship that exists between us and the Lord. Elder Dallin H. Oaks discussed this special relationship in the Annual University Conference fireside two weeks ago (see Dallin H. Oaks, "Why Do We Serve at BYU?" BYU Annual University Conference fireside, August 23, 1998). He pointed out that members of the Church have covenanted at baptism and in the temple to live a righteous life and to contribute to the building of the kingdom. The university is part of the kingdom. Since his presentation I have given considerable thought to the status of non-LDS persons associated with BYU.<br><br>A large portion of the faculty, staff, and students are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As such, they have entered into covenants with the Lord through Church ordinances. What about non-LDS members of the BYU community? They have not participated in these ordinances. Are they covenant makers or is their relationship only contractual? It is my view that nonmember faculty, staff, and students may enjoy more than a contractual relationship with the university. It is my belief that non-LDS faculty and students become covenant participants when they agree to support the university's mission and participate with full heart to preserve the covenantal environment. I arrived at this conclusion after reflecting on many conversations with nonmember faculty and after reading a letter written by a new member of our faculty who is non-LDS. The letter was written by him to former colleagues explaining why he left his position at their university to join us. With his permission, I share a portion of the letter:<br><br><i>For those of you who are unfamiliar with BYU, it is the flagship university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. . . . Neither</i>[my wife]<i>nor I are members of the LDS Church, but as embodied in its university and the warmth of its members' acceptance of us, we have found it to represent a remarkable testament to God's work on earth. Indeed, Brigham Young University is one of the rare remaining examples of what all religiously affiliated universities once aspired to be--an institution that sees its students as persons of infinite worth and believes that their education for faithful lives represents the world's best hope for a humane and productive future. The educational program and student experience at BYU</i>[are]<i>built around such core values.</i>[Letter from Professor Tom Morgan to George Washington University law faculty, January 12, 1998]<br><br>The letter's message closely parallels Brigham Young's statement to John Taylor. The letter illustrates the faculty member's understanding of and willingness to contribute to the university's mission. He is committed to prepare students for "faithful lives" in the hope of building a better world. He understands that each person is of infinite worth and is prepared to treat them as such. He is committed to working in a covenant environment. His heart and mind indicate that his relationship is more than a contractual one.<br><br>During the past three years, conversations with other non-LDS faculty at BYU have revealed the same commitment and attitude. Almost all see students in an infinite light. We are grateful that non-LDS faculty assembled at BYU are true to the university's purpose and that your standards are our standards. We express appreciation for the contributions you make and want you to know that you would be as comfortable in the temple with us as you are in the classroom.<br><br>All of us, members and nonmembers, are affected by the covenantal environment that exists. The infinite and eternal relationship is the engine that empowers us to change lives intellectually and spiritually. President Gordon B. Hinckley described the unique features of BYU in his devotional one year ago. With regard to the faculty, he stated that they<br><br><i>feel as much at home in the house of the Lord as they feel in the classrooms of this university. When all is said and done, it is not this elaborate campus that really counts. It is the faculty who teach you, who lead you, who encourage you, who help you find your way as you go forward with your studies. This . . . is an element of the singular BYU experience.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The BYU Experience," BYU Devotional, November 4, 1997, p. 3]<br><br>Although I have suggested that all members of BYU are children of the covenant, President Young's reference was directly applicable to students. His concern was with you, the student body. The "bright future" that lay in store for the university is now your present. The purpose of the university is to help you become useful in the kingdom of God. The Lord's definition of intelligence encompasses both intellectual and spiritual acumen (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37). He is concerned with you as a whole person. That is why Brigham Young wanted the students to experience every subject taught under the influence of the Spirit.<br><br>There are data that confirm the status of BYU students as "children of the covenant." You are different in many respects from students at other universities. In the most recent survey of 311 colleges by The Princeton Review, BYU students ranked first on the "stone-cold sober" list. Just as important, you also ranked first for "students [who] pray on a regular basis." You helped BYU rank second in the "town-gown relations" category. (See<i>The Best 311 Colleges--1999 Edition</i>[New York: Random House, 1998].) This is important. BYU is a significant part of the Provo-Orem community. We must be good citizens. Civic leaders in both communities are working closely with BYU to solve the housing, parking, and traffic problems that beset all of us. There is a cooperative spirit, and solutions will be forthcoming.<br><br>There is another survey in which BYU students participate that highlights some other characteristics. It is called the "College Student Experiences Questionnaire," in which 30 major universities participate. Participants include students from Duke, Pennsylvania State, UCLA, Washington State, Southern Methodist, and others. The survey is a nationally normed, stratified, random sample of 25,000 students with 1,500 BYU participants. The survey has been administered over the years, with the last survey taken in March 1997. Some interesting comparisons between BYU students and their counterparts are the following:<br><br>• BYU students spend significantly more hours per week doing school work.<br><br>• BYU students spend significantly more hours per week working at a job.<br><br>• BYU students are much less likely to have their expenses paid by their family.<br><br>• The parents of BYU students are more educated than their counterparts.<br><br>• BYU students are more likely to engage in activities relating to art, music, and the theater.<br><br>• BYU students experience a significantly higher number of writing experiences in the form of essay exams, term papers, and written reports.<br><br>The questionnaire also revealed that BYU students are above average in gaining a broad general education, in acquiring knowledge and skills for work, and in developing their own values and ethical standards. The data are highly complimentary of this student body. Research has shown that the most important factor in student learning is the quality of effort students themselves apply to their institution's available resources. It is clear that our students are more mature and more committed as they devote additional time and energy to both study and work. These characteristics suggest that you take seriously your responsibilities as "children of the covenant."<br><br>Not long ago an international diplomat visiting campus asked two questions that reflect on us as a covenant people. He had spent the morning lecturing and visiting with students and faculty. He then came to my office for a brief exchange. The first question he asked was, "Are all the buildings new?" When told that some were 50 to 60 years old, he replied, "But they are so clean." The second question asked was, "Why is everyone so happy?" Because he knew little about us, my answer centered on our beliefs and our standards of behavior. The short answer, had he known more about us, could have been, "Because we are a covenant people!"<br><br>During the past few weeks, as preparations were made for the Annual University Conference and the beginning of a new school year, a number of impressions and feelings came regarding the mission and destiny of Brigham Young University. Some of these feelings and insights were shared with the faculty and staff three weeks ago. There is one impression that was not shared. It concerns the current status of BYU in the Lord's plan. I arrived at the University in January 1996 believing that Brigham Young University was "in the process of becoming a 'Zion university'" (Merrill J. Bateman, "A Zion University," included in "Learning in Zion: Two Addresses,"<i>Educating Zion</i>[Provo: BYU Studies, 1996], p. 251). It was my belief then that considerable progress had been made over the years in achieving the goal of academic excellence in a climate of faith but that there was still a long road to travel before the designation "a Zion university" would be appropriate.<br><br>In contrast to my views of three years ago, the recent impression was that Brigham Young University<i>is</i>a Zion university. At first I resisted the notion. None of us believes that we have reached our potential--either as scholars or as Saints. On the other hand, perhaps Tessa Meyer Santiago was right when she implied that Zion is not a destination but a covenant people with "a knowledge of the gospel and the resurrected Christ in [their] hearts," all journeying to the promised land (Tessa Meyer Santiago, "Under Covenant Toward the Promised Land: Section 136 as a Latter-Day Type,"<i>BYU 1996–97 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1997], p. 241). No wonder the father of the young freshman daughter felt the excitement and sensed the importance of this university. He felt the influence of the Lord's Spirit as all of us are committed to preparing the children of the covenant for useful lives in God's kingdom.<br><h2><b>The Challenge</b></h2><br>I close with a challenge for all of us to be true to the promises we have made--both to the university and to the Lord. Obedience to true principles is not a burden when one's relationship to God is understood and when one has a burning within regarding the verity of the restored gospel. May each of us recommit on our sacred honor to the journey of a Zion university. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was the president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 8 September 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> to Succeed in Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
No one with any degree of spiritual sensitivity can stand at this place in the presence of such a concentration of devoted, righteous students, faculty, staff, and Church leaders and not feel overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation. I am deeply moved in contemplation of what will occur in ensuing years from the experiences you will gain at this unique university. The students enrolled in this university have the potential for making deep and abiding contributions throughout the world, to form eternal families, to orient and raise righteous children, to strengthen a host of professions, to give service in countless ways, and to be a leaven for good in a world that desperately needs it. I welcome the 6,000 of you who have recently begun your university career as well as all who are continuing your education at this cherished institution that has such a prophetic mission to fulfill. You are part of that mission.<br><br>My purpose is to share suggestions to help each of you make the most of this exceptional opportunity for building capacity, strength, understanding, and focus in your life. While most of the remarks are directed to you as students, I pray that some of the insights shared will be of benefit to you who form the exceptional, devoted faculty and administration of this university.<br><br>Before giving specific suggestions, I want to take advantage of a unique teaching moment that we all are currently experiencing. It is my intent to draw from the lives of men of world renown, exceptional in their capacities and their accomplishments, yet who are at opposite poles of peace and personal satisfaction at this moment. I refer to the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, and to the prophets of God and presidents of this Church we revere. President Clinton has expressed anguish and concern for the consequences of his improper choices that have seriously affected him personally, his wife, his daughter, individuals who work closely with him, this nation, and others throughout the world. I will briefly describe what in my own opinion has occurred, then ask you to draw conclusions from those events to guide your own life. Then I will speak of our prophets, that they may continue to inspire you personally. Please listen carefully to not misunderstand what I say. I pray to be led in the statements that follow.<br><br>President Clinton has made declarations of incorrect decisions in his personal life. What is proper for him and the others who have responsibility to act to do? What should you and I do about it? I am not placing myself in a position to exercise judgment on those who are deeply involved in this matter. I simply want to point out what I understand the Lord has said and what the laws of this nation require. Learning from this experience can be of great personal benefit in helping you make correct choices in life.<br><br>First, concerning unchangeable standards, our Father in Heaven has made it very clear that the covenant of marriage is most sacred. The responsibilities that attend it are very clearly defined in His scriptures. The Ten Commandments state: "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14). The Savior taught: "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27–28). "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22). "Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery . . . , nor do anything like unto it" (D&amp;amp;C 59:6). And, "He that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive" (D&amp;amp;C 42:25).<br><br>The central purpose of the Savior's life on earth was to atone for the transgressions of all mankind who would accept His commandments and live them. His sinless life was voluntarily given to take upon Himself the consequences of the demands of justice for all who violated any commandment, large or small. He has provided the process of repentance to help every individual rectify mistakes made on this earth through the power of mercy. Mercy does not overcome the demands of justice but satisfies them through His payment of those demands when earned by our complete, sincere repentance as defined in His teachings. He has promised, "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more. By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43). President Clinton recently stated in a prayer breakfast with religious leaders that he has begun that process. That matter should now rest in the hands of the president, his religious advisors, and the Lord to see that it is thoroughly and properly performed.<br><br>Don't read or otherwise fill your mind with the salacious details of this controversy. No good will come of that. For some it could lead to destructive experimentation in absolute violation of the commandments of God.<br><br>What should you and I do regarding this matter? The Lord has said, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10). I understand that means to forgive another's offense against me. I have forgiven the president of any personal offense. I continue to pray for him, his wife, and his daughter and ask the Lord to strengthen and guide him and help him make the right choices in this time of difficulty. I pray for the others who are adversely affected by his decisions.<br><br>However, that forgiveness does not wipe out the consequences of those improper choices. They must be faced before the Lord and before those who are charged with the responsibility to evaluate any violation of trust that President Clinton took upon himself with the oath of office and the acceptance of the resultant responsibilities as president of the United States. The Lord has said, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). There are other passages of scripture that confirm that we are not only responsible for our individual acts but must be accountable for those we influence when we have positions of responsibility. That is true for a father or mother, a bishop or stake president, or a civic leader who has made a promise to be honorable in carrying out his or her office. When there is a violation of that trust, there is a need to follow the procedures that are established to rectify it. As far as President Clinton is concerned, that process has begun and is in the hands of Congress, which has the constitutional responsibility to evaluate it and to take the appropriate action. Let us pray that all involved in that process will be led to make the correct decisions.<br><h2><b>Decision Making</b></h2><br>There are two patterns for making decisions in life: The first I will call<i>Decisions Based upon Circumstance;</i>the second,<i>Decisions Based upon Eternal Truth.</i>I have chosen the experience of President Clinton and the lives of our prophets to illustrate each of these patterns and their consequences. The guiding principle in the pattern of life where decisions are based upon circumstance is to make them according to the outcome desired. There is no underlying set of values or standards used to consistently guide those decisions. Each one is made upon what appears to be the best choice at the moment. One who chooses this path of action is left to his own strength and capacity and the support of others that can be influenced to act in his favor. Satan encourages choices to be made in this manner because it gives him the greatest possibility to tempt an individual to make decisions that will be harmful and destructive even though they appear most appealing when a decision is made.<br><br>The prophets have followed the second pattern--that of making Decisions Based upon Eternal Truth, the pattern of the Lord. They have consistently centered their lives in the commandments of God. Their decisions have been and are made in accordance with those unchanging truths. In addition to his own strength and capacity, a prophet enjoys the blessings derived from divine inspiration and, when needed, power from God--as do you when you follow the same pattern. His actions are predictable and bless the lives of all those who look to Him for guidance. Those who follow the counsel of a prophet will not be led astray nor disappointed. He lives a life of peace and happiness.<br><br>Such men are instruments of tremendous good throughout the world. All who follow their example and counsel will be blessed. I am grateful to have known and loved prophets of God. The individuals that have been called by the Lord to be president of this Church are the most important human beings on earth. The Lord places on their shoulders a responsibility and trust that exceeds that of any other man. A prophet can be trusted for what he<i>is</i>even more than for what he has the capacity to do. The worthy character of these humble men is like a fabric woven from countless threads of correct choices--some small, some great, some difficult to make, others less challenging. You can form worthy character in the same way.<br><br>I spoke earlier of repentance. Let me add that serious transgressions such as immorality require the participation of one who holds the keys of authority, such as a bishop or stake president, to quietly work out the repentance process to make sure that it is complete and appropriately done. That priesthood officer has a responsibility to determine what action regarding membership should be taken and if there is the required broken heart and contrite spirit to allow the miracle of the Atonement to cleanse and purify the life of the transgressor (see 2 Nephi 2:7). This process is confidential and is carried out privately under the direction of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Never make the mistake of believing that because you have confessed a serious transgression you have repented of it. That is an essential step, but it is not all that is required. Nor assume that because someone did not ask you all the details of a transgression you are free from the responsibility to mention them. Where a transgression such as immorality requires intervention of a judge of Israel, you personally have the responsibility to make sure that he understands all of the details so that he can properly help you through the process of repentance to full forgiveness. Should there be anyone among us today that requires that further evaluation, please talk to your bishop now.<br><br>Make sure that as you are seeking an eternal companion that nothing is done that will offend the Spirit. Satan tempts a weaker individual to rationalize when two are in love and agree that sexual intimacies can be performed, that such things are acceptable. They positively are not. The boundaries of appropriate behavior are defined by God Himself. In the sacred, private parts of the body there are centered powerful emotions intended to be used within the covenant of marriage between a husband and wife in ways that are appropriate and acceptable to them both. They are not to be stimulated or used for personal gratification outside of the covenant of marriage. Do not touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body to stimulate those emotions nor allow anyone to do that with you--with or without clothing. Do not stimulate those emotions in your own body. These things are wrong. Do not do them. Such actions place barriers to the Holy Spirit. You need that direction to guide you in the important choices you make here at the university. Such practices would undermine your ability to be inspired in the vitally important decisions you must make here.<br><br>I know that you have chosen to make decisions based upon eternal truth or you would not be here today. Please never allow yourself to make an exception to that pattern of life to gain a temporary, appealing advantage or to participate in an experience you know to be unworthy. How can you keep your resolve to live worthily? How can you be sure that determination in your heart will not be eroded by the pressures around you?<br><br>Choose good friends--those who have made a similar decision in their lives--from among the student body, the faculty, and your priesthood leaders: those like yourself who elect to keep order and restraint and to use time wisely. Students who go astray generally choose the other kind of friends. Be surrounded by those who are true friends who accept you the way you are and leave you better because of their association.<br><br>Remember the sound teachings you've gathered thus far in your life. Much of the disappointment and tragedy that one encounters in university life come from the new freedom to do anything desired. At this time of transition where you have increased control of your life, make decisions wisely. You will be helped by the guidance of the Holy Ghost because of your determination to obey the Lord.<br><br>There is no guarantee that life will be easy for anyone. We grow and learn more rapidly by facing and overcoming challenges. You are here to prove yourself, to develop, and to overcome. There will be constant challenges that cause you to think, to make proper judgments, and to act righteously. You will grow from these challenges. However, there are some challenges you never need to encounter. They are those associated with serious transgression. As you continue to avoid such mistakes, your life will be simpler and happier.<br><br>Now I would like to discuss the three levels of learning that are available to you here at Brigham Young University and mention some suggestions to help you obtain the maximum benefit from each one of them.<br><h2><b>Formal Instruction</b></h2><br>The first level of learning I would call formal instruction. This is the level you are most familiar with. You have worked hard to get here, you have chosen a field of study, and you are busy garnering what you can from the classes you have selected and the professors and their assistants who help you. Formal instruction is focused on what you hear, read, and write, as well as on your expressions in class, your study, and your effort to acquire an understanding of the materials shared with you. Success in formal instruction requires discipline, the wise use of time, and scheduling your study to minimize conflicts of overlapping assignments and competing activities. Consistent study habits that focus on daily application of effort to learn are far more effective than panicked cramming near times of testing. Consistent learning allows you to grasp the essentials of your courses so that you may apply them throughout your life. Formal instruction is generally built on a sequence that employs previously learned material. Hence, concentrated, sporadic study won't allow you to attain the understanding you need to master the materials. Formal instruction in a university requires self-motivated initiative. It is enriched when you can go beyond the minimum requirements and do extra work. That requires a balance in the load you carry. Condition that academic load to be a reasonable evaluation of your capacity--not too much and certainly not too little. If you are struggling with how to set those limits, seek help. You will have to initiate that request for help. You are not alone here, but part of your growth and experience is to learn how to find needed assistance. Those abilities will help you throughout life's journey, for we all need help to succeed.<br><br>You may be tempted to say, "I have so much to do I can't take on anything more. The struggle I have just to meet minimum academic requirements is almost more than I can handle." I am not suggesting that you work harder, unless you are not tugging at your limits of capacity already. I am encouraging you to work more intelligently. Let me share with you how. It is by using two other levels of learning. At first it may seem like just more to do, but as you consistently use these guides, your university experience will be easier--as will the rest of your life.<br><h2><b>Social Interaction</b></h2><br>The second level of learning is that obtained through social interaction. By this I mean how to deal effectively with others--how to live and serve together productively at all levels. Often those who do extremely well scholastically lack confidence in their social skills. At this university that challenge can be met and overcome. The most important lessons can be learned by careful observation. Study how those who make friends easily act. Study those who seem to be natural leaders and therefore contribute much. What motivates them? How do they relate to others? These lessons you can learn in the classroom and in extracurricular activities.<br><br>Yet there is no way to learn more effectively than through service to others. Each of you has the opportunity of giving of yourself through your ward or stake activities. That can either be formal service by accepting a call when it is made or it can be by observing a need and administering to it in the life of another individual. Learn to serve here--not to be served. There is immense happiness in selfless service. Selfless service will lead you to learn the principles of effective, harmonious human interaction.<br><br>Carefully observe what goes on about you in the classroom, and especially out of it. It is not likely that the most treasured truths you will carry away from this educational experience will occur at the feet of a master teacher. Rather, they will be distilled from many careful observations and crucially important promptings that can pass unperceived or unrecorded in your consciousness unless you search for them.<br><br>In the society of today--where you will grow as an individual, as a member of a family, and as a professional--there is increasing need for skill in interaction with others. Learn it while you are here. Observe what yields enduring good and develops the kind of relationships that are desirable. Determine how they are obtained. Put them in practice. Remember, the core principle is to give of yourself while showing genuine interest in others.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Direction</b></h2><br>The third level of learning comes from qualifying to obtain spiritual direction in your life. It is the most rewarding yet possibly the most difficult initially to feel confident in using. It is centered in that quality of being called "righteousness." To be righteous is to seek intently to be obedient to the commandments of God. It is to be clean in thought and act. It is to be honest and just.<br><br>Continually bless your life with the power of righteousness. Righteousness engenders trust. It builds confidence. It yields enduring worthy achievement. Righteousness is shown more in acts than in words. A clever individual without foundation principles can at times acquire--temporarily--impressive accomplishments. Yet those accomplishments are like sand castles. When the test of character comes, they crumble and fall, often taking others with them. Despite how carefully a transgressor seeks to keep violations of commandments secret and hidden, in time they nearly always become publicly known. Satan himself sees to that. He and his angels are determined to cause the greatest possible harm to each of Father in Heaven's children. One serious act of disobedience or violation of trust invariably raises questions of whether or not there are others. It undermines the faith and confidence of others in that individual, whether warranted or not.<br><br>Worthy character centered in truth, fortified by continuing correct decisions, and anchored in integrity is what I know you have decided to acquire in your life or you wouldn't be here. Let me help you understand how to do that. This is a time to set your course for life, a time to establish fundamental priorities. One of the opportunities you now have is to be able to differentiate among the many good and bad things that can be done and to select those that are righteous and truly essential. Here you enjoy a personal freedom that likely you have never had before. That freedom can be a friend or enemy, depending upon how it is used. You will come to find that the restraints provided by the teachings of the Lord actually form a platform leading to greater freedom. Should they be hurriedly dismantled in the excitement of increased personal choice, serious problems can result. Carefully consider your options and make correct choices to establish the proper priorities in this critical phase of your life. Continue to be one who invariably makes choices consistent with the commandments of God, and you will be on a secure path. He who is tempted to temporarily set aside standards to gain an attractive advantage is on the path that leads to heartache and disappointment. The BYU Honor Code is a tool to help you to consistently follow the correct pattern of life, the one the Lord has outlined.<br><br>I have discussed three levels of learning. Conscientiously use each of them. Your objective is not to<i>get through the university</i>but to<i>absorb and use</i>the experiences that can be acquired here, the knowledge that can be obtained through righteous effort, and the lessons that can be learned from consistently facing and resolving the challenges that you will encounter in your academic, social, and private life. The inspiration of the Spirit will help you do that.<br><br>In this university you not only can learn knowledge essential to your chosen field, but you can learn how to live life to its fullest. As you augment your learning by<i>what you observe</i>and<i>what you perceive by the Spirit,</i>you will greatly increase your capacity to be successful in life. You will be led to establish objectives for life that will likely be more enduring, productive, and satisfying than you otherwise would select. You will discover more of your true potential.<br><br>If your focus at BYU has been primarily to excel only in formal instruction, you have not understood the rich potential available here for you. Formal instruction can be obtained at any good university. Be wise. Benefit by consistently using all of the levels of learning available to you here.<br><br>In closing, may I speak from my heart to each individual present. The Lord has a purpose for you, individually, to be at this singular campus as a student or member of the faculty or staff. Discover it and fulfill it. It will likely not be revealed all at once but will be unfolded line upon line. As you pray and work hard, you will find threads of understanding that will lead you to the path the Lord wants you to follow for the greatest enduring, meaningful attainment, contribution, joy, and peace of mind. Faithfully and courageously follow those threads of understanding and direction.<br><br>As a student it will require focused effort, stretching your capacities, and often setting aside things that would be pleasant and enjoyable to do in preference to essential things that must be done. Here you can find the beginnings of what the Lord has intended for you to accomplish in life. I feel to promise you that as you continually learn from the three different levels we have discussed, you will gain the training, orientation, and capacities that the Lord would have you acquire while here. They will yield much joy and a productive life now and eternally.<br><br>As a member of the faculty it will mean concentrating more on what you feel the Lord wants done here with your capacity and strengths than on gaining the recognition and acceptance of your professional peers throughout the world.<br><br>I am on the executive committee of the board of trustees that oversees this university. We anguish over the reality that because of limited resources many of the choice youth, gifted faculty, and highly skilled professionals among the membership of the Church cannot experience the blessings of being at Brigham Young University. I am aware of the very large investment of the Church in this institution, both in money and in human resources. I ask sincerely that if anyone who hears or reads this message has decided to concentrate only on formal education, ignoring the other unique opportunities here; or if a faculty member has chosen to be more concerned about peer acceptance than meeting squarely the goals and objectives of the university; or should there be anyone who has any intent to break the Honor Code, please consider fulfilling your expectations at another university. Your ambition can be adequately met there, and you would open a place for another to fully utilize the unique experiences offered at this university. As an ecclesiastical leader, if you find someone in any of these categories, help them change to gain a broader vision or help them go elsewhere.<br><br>In an exercise of a sacred privilege that can be used when prompted by the Holy Spirit, I invoke a blessing of the Lord upon each of you, a blessing by which--according to your faith in Jesus Christ, your obedience to His commandments, and your diligent effort--you may be strengthened and guided in your efforts to live righteously. Also, that you will succeed in your chosen field and can develop those skills that will lead you to live productively and joyfully. I invoke a blessing that according to your righteousness and your faith and commitment to live worthily, you will be given support to resist the efforts of Satan to cause you to violate your standards so that you may remain morally clean, pure, and righteous.<br><br>I bear witness that the Savior will guide you through the Holy Ghost as you steadfastly do what is right and make the correct choices according to His teachings using the pattern of Decisions Based upon Eternal Truth. That pattern of life will lead you to success, accomplishment, peace, happiness, and great joy.<br><br>I solemnly bear witness that you are precious and special spirits who have the opportunity to be here. We pray for you; we love you; we want the best for you. I know the vast majority are already doing the things I've talked about. Help others you come across who haven't found that way. I know that Jesus Christ lives. I solemnly witness that He lives, loves you, and will help you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G. Scott was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at BYU on 15 September 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> A Journey of Discovery - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This past summer I had occasion to visit the DUP Museum in Salt Lake City. While there, I was struck by the hundreds of pioneer portraits assembled by those inveterate collectors of Utah history, the Daughters of Utah Pioneers. Most of the silent faces lining the walls of four floors of the museum stared sternly into space, barely a shadow of a smile softening their earnest expressions. The men appeared awkward in their tightly collared shirts and high buttoned suits. The women were hardly less so in their modestly adorned silk dresses, their hair almost uniformly parted in the middle and combed severely to the back into a braid or bun. Only occasionally did a wayward curl or soft wave individualize the otherwise uniform pattern of portraits.<br><br>As artifacts of the past and tangible evidence of lives once lived, these portraits hold intrinsic value to families and museum collectors alike. But as I came to one I recognized--that of my own progenitor, Joseph Cornwall--I thought how well those fixed and impassive expressions masked the panorama of human experience each one represented. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s drove my great-grandfather to Scotland, but once there he encountered some Mormon missionaries with a life-changing message. On the ship that brought him to America he met his future wife, Charlotte, alone and very homesick. Their courtship began on that hazardous journey. Disaster waited, however, until he crossed the plains, where an accident crushed one of his legs, making him a permanent cripple. But joy followed his dismay when he reached the Zion of his dreams, married his beloved Charlotte, and, for the first time in his life, owned the land he worked. It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words, but, in this instance, I think the 76 words I used to describe Joseph Cornwall were far more telling than his picture. As a historian I readily admit my bias toward the written word, and it is only when I put words with faces do portraits come alive to me.<br><br>It is the lives of ordinary people--like those represented in that gallery of faces--recorded in honest and compelling detail in their own writings, that are the stuff of history today. No longer is it concerned only with affairs of state--the economic, military, political, and diplomatic decisions made by men in power--and based on the institutional documents those men created. Interest in the way all people lived in the past, their interactions with each other and the tasks and relationships that made up their everyday lives, has challenged the traditional emphasis on power structures and institutions as a focus of historical research. This interest developed from the rise of movements by the historically disfranchised to claim a place in American society and a page in the history books. The stories of women and racial and ethnic groups, in particular, have always been marginal, if not ignored, in the more traditional histories of our nation, but the entry of these groups into the field as scholars of their own histories has democratized the profession and "disrupt[ed] a familiar pattern of knowledge," moving us to "a whole new order of understanding" (Douglas Birkhead, "A Field That's Beyond Gender," in Common Carrier,<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>Sunday, 18 June 1989, p. A-14).<br><br>New configurations of historical evidence and new interpretations are emerging as historians bring all elements of human existence within the scope of their inquiry. Many old assumptions are no longer valid, and we have come to acknowledge that the social politics we struggle with today have their genesis in the inequities of yesterday. More important, however, is that this broadened base of historical scholarship and the retrieval of neglected lives have returned history to people long dispossessed of their past--and living without a past, columnist George F. Will once wrote, "is a heavy burden." "For individuals," he said, "deprivation of a collective past is death of the spirit" ("Cracking the Ice,"<i>Newsweek,</i>19 June 1989, p. 72).<br><br>In recent decades historians engaged in the recovery of women's historical experiences, the field in which I work, have mined the rich veins of women's records long dormant in archives across the nation. The discovery from these records of women's participation in the major movements in American history--such as industrialization, abolitionism, or progressivism--has altered traditional emphases and conclusions about these social forces and enlarged our knowledge of their impact on people and communities.<br><br>The century-long struggle of women to gain legal equity and political equality, to obtain opportunities for education and economic self-reliance, as well as their ubiquitous efforts to address social welfare and community needs are all stories formerly excluded but integral to what we call American history. Moreover, they are fascinating accounts that introduce a whole roster of intelligent, capable, articulate, and imaginative women into the pantheon of American heroes. We women today are their heirs, beneficiaries of their convictions and their courage to turn those convictions into reality. If one is left a legacy from an unknown source, there is usually a natural curiosity to know the identity of that source and to discover the connections that have linked them together. This kind of curiosity has driven the interest in women's historians to connect with their own past and to write the missing pages of history. They are not like physicians dispassionately dissecting the corpse of history. They are both intellectually and emotionally connected to their task. As women, our lives have been shaped by our collective history. It has given us "a usable past," a frame of reference in which we can better understand ourselves and our own personal histories.<sup>1</sup>To be deprived of that past is indeed a loss of an enriching and motivating spirit.<br><br>Recognition of the neglect of women in historical writing is not a contemporary phenomenon. More than a hundred years ago, Emmeline B. Wells, editor of the<i>Woman's Exponent,</i>a Mormon women's paper founded in 1872, noted, "History tells us very little about women; judging from its pages, one would suppose their lives were insignificant and their opinions worthless. . . . Volumes of unwritten history yet remain" ("Self-Made Women,"<i>Woman's Exponent</i>9, no. 19 [1 March 1881], p. 148). Emmeline turned the<i>Woman's Exponent,</i>which she edited for 37 of its 42 years, into a repository of Mormon women's history. For all those years it was the public voice of LDS women. The biographies and compilations of women's achievements printed in its pages are invaluable, but the letters, autobiographies, and commentaries on the volatile events of that period are priceless. They give us entrée into the little known but vivid world of our Latter-day Saint foremothers. The<i>Exponent</i>today serves as a major source of LDS women's history, a growing field of inquiry that not only reflects the intense interest of Mormon women to know their own history but highlights the enormous repository of personal writings available to document that history.<br><br>My study of Emmeline B. Wells resulted from that interest and the availability of numerous resources relating to her life. Not only the editor and principal contributor to the<i>Woman's Exponent,</i>she was also an avid letter writer and diarist. Forty-seven volumes of her diary reside in the archives here at BYU. These documents reveal her dedication to defending and uplifting the women of the Church. A political activist in the suffrage movement, delegate from the Church to national women's conventions, organizer of literary clubs, friend and correspondent with most of the national women's leaders of her time, personally acquainted with four United States presidents, and general president of the Relief Society (appointed at age 82 and serving 11 years), she left a long paper trail for me to follow. Through her voluminous writings and astute observations, she has navigated me through the circuitous currents of Mormon women's history. One thread of her private life, however, remained elusive. What happened to James?<br><br>Emmeline joined the Church in 1842 in the rural Massachusetts village of New Salem. The next year she married James Harris. Both of them were just 15. In 1844 they traveled with his parents to Nauvoo. Two months later the Prophet and his brother were assassinated, and soon after, the elder Harrises, Elias and Lucy, left the Church. They urged James and Emmeline, with their newborn son, Eugene, to return with them to Massachusetts, but the young couple refused. When Emmeline and James also refused to allow James' parents to take the baby with them, until the young parents were more settled, the Harrises left Nauvoo alone, leaving bad feelings behind. The baby, unfortunately, died soon afterwards, and James, unable to find any satisfactory work in Nauvoo, took a boat to Saint Louis, promising to return for the bereaved Emmeline as soon as he found employment. Alone in Nauvoo, Emmeline found a place to stay with the Aaron Johnson family, waiting day after day for word from James.<br><br>"I hope soon, very soon, to see him and hear words of love and affection," she wrote in her diary. But those words never came. Nor did James. Emmeline carried the heartache of his desertion throughout her life, and I assumed this chapter of her life was closed. Then, in one of those cases of pure serendipity, a diary came into my hands that had not been deposited in the archives. In it Emmeline recorded her return to New England 40 years after leaving it. Besides giving me details about her early life there, as she revisited the scenes of her girlhood, the diary picked up the thread of the James Harris mystery. While in New Salem, Emmeline visited her former mother-in-law, Lucy Harris, then Mrs. Blackinton. The visit was cordial if awkward, but it reconnected the two women and opened the door for another visit to the Blackinton home a few years later, after Lucy's death. While there the second time, Emmeline came across a packet of letters. They were from James--addressed to her--written before his death at sea. His mother had never forwarded them. Emmeline drove directly to Lucy's grave and, in the words of her sister and niece who were with her, the diminutive Emmeline "raised her arms to heaven and called down a curse upon her mother-in-law that made us tremble--and no doubt caused the wicked one to writhe in her shroud" (quoted in a letter from Geneva Ramsey Kingkade to Carolyn Chouinard, 24 August 1970, copy in possession of author).<br><br>What am I to do with such a story? That was startling behavior, to say the least, for this earnest, devoted Latter-day Saint woman. Here was an incident that did not fit neatly into the pattern I thought I had discerned of Emmeline's life. In all the tragedies, difficulties, and disappointments that wove themselves into that pattern, all of them signal opportunities for similar emotional outbursts, I wondered why this was the one that allowed it to emerge. The incongruity of her action was enormous. Perhaps the story was apocryphal, merely family legend, I reasoned--but in questioning its validity I realized I was exposing my own expectations and judging the incident by those standards.<br><br>Historians, unfortunately, cannot totally dismiss their own orientations or preconceptions. They see the past from the perspective of their own historical horizons. The challenge, as German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer has noted, is how to fuse their horizons, or worldviews, with that of the era they are studying, thus minimizing, if not wholly erasing, the tension between the historian and the texts of the past. Gadamer wrote:<br><br><i>We are always affected . . . by what is nearest to us, and hence approach, under its influence, the testimony of the past. Hence it is constantly necessary to inhibit the overhasty assimilation of the past to our own expectations of meaning. Only then will we be able to listen to the past in a way that enables it to make its own meaning heard.</i>[Hans-Georg Gadamer, "The Historicity of Understanding," in Kurt Mueller-Vollmer, ed.,<i>The Hermeneutics Reader: Texts of the German Tradition from the Enlightenment to the Present</i>(New York: Continuum, 1985), p. 272]<br><br>By listening intently and holding in check our own biases and orientations, we can become better writers and readers of history.<br><br>As mediators of the past and present, then, historians bear a heavy ethical responsibility to be honest with the past. They do not all hear the same meaning from the documents. But it is the effort to hear that meaning as clearly as they are able and to transmit it as honestly and effectively as possible that makes the study of history so consistently challenging and exciting.<br><br>The key to unlocking the vast wealth of human experience still waiting to be explored is the personal narrative--the diaries, letters, reminiscences, and stories of ordinary people. "In them," as author and professor William Mulder once noted,<br><br><i>we find something of the daily living and dying of men and women both weak and valiant. Their story is not epic except as life and many days together give it sweep--it is the sweep of daily existence, the great movement that is the result of countless little movements.</i>[William Mulder, "Mormonism and Literature," in Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert, eds.,<i>A Believing People: Literature of the Latter-day Saints</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974), pp. 208–11]<br><br>Pulitzer Prize winner Laurel Ulrich demonstrates in her book<i>A Midwife's Tale</i>how a single diary can be the historical centerpiece in reconstructing a life, a community, and an era. Skillfully weaving together with other available sources the daily jottings from the diary of Martha Ballard, a common midwife in post-Revolutionary America, Professor Ulrich demonstrates her understanding of the social order of that period and transports the reader into another time, another place, another world. It is not the world of constitution writing and diplomatic negotiating, but the world of those most vulnerable to those acts of state (see Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,<i>A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785–1812</i>[New York: Vintage Books, 1991]).<br><br>Such life writings as Martha Ballard's tell us not only what people did--the rituals of their daily life--but they give us a glimpse into the attitudes, values, and traditions of their social universe. Although public records are passive and cold, personal writings are alive with action, mood, and emotion. Statistical records, for instance, tell us that the Nauvoo Temple was built of high quality limestone, measured 128 by 88 feet, had several floors, and cost more than a $1 million. It was formally dedicated in May 1846, and it burned in 1848. Around 5,600 Saints received their endowments there. (See Daniel H. Ludlow, ed.,<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>4 vols. [New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1992], s.v. "Nauvoo Temple," 3:1001–3.) But the spirit of that beloved building, its power and promises, are in the writings of the people who experienced it.<br><br>Sarah Pippen Jolly wrote of the hardship her family endured when her husband and sons were enlisted to give full time to its construction. "But," she added, "it was good. I don't complain. I had the privilege of going through the temple with my husband so I am paid for all of my trouble" (Sarah Pippen Jolly, "Reminiscences," LDS Church Archives).<br><br>Widow Elizabeth Kirby helps us realize how deep was the commitment to give one's all to its completion: "I gave my husband's watch," she wrote, "which I could hardly bear to part with, but I gave it to help build the . . . Temple and everything else I could possibly spare and the last few dollars that I had in the world, which altogether amounted to nearly $50" (Elizabeth Terry Kirby Heward, "A Sketch," 13, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>And Sarah DeArmon Rich drew strength from its spiritual power as she left Nauvoo with her young family in 1846. The temple blessings, she found,<br><br><i>caused us joy and comfort in the midst of all our sorrows, and enabled us to have faith in God, knowing He would guide us and sustain us in the unknown journey that lay before us. For if it had not been for the faith and knowledge that was bestowed upon us in that Temple by the influence and help of the spirit of the Lord, our journey would have been like one taking a leap in the dark; to start out on such a journey in the winter as it were, and in our state of poverty, it would seem like walking into the jaws of death.</i>["Reminiscences of Sarah DeArmon Pea Rich (1885–93), LDS Church Archives]<br><br>In reading these accounts, the spirit of the past, as George Will noted, can touch us, and if we are open to it we find our own temple experience enhanced by it.<br><br>It is from these private writings that we can come to understand the impact of large social forces and decisions on the lives of the people subject to them. The creator of a Broadway production depicting a history of blacks in America found his inspiration in the popular culture of his people, preserved not in written documents but in its oral traditions, rituals, and values. George C. Wolfe wrote:<br><br><i>If you actively unearth popular culture and look inside it, you can find all kinds of secrets and truths and rhythms of a time period. . . .</i><br><br><i>I'm fascinated by bold movements, and how very large decisions made by people in power have an impact on the personal dynamics of human beings--the human complexities that come into play when history makes bold shifts.</i>[George C. Wolfe, Playbill,<i>Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk,</i>1998]<br><br>Although historians use words, Wolfe used dance in a powerful and moving way to convey his understanding of his people through time and their emotional and psychological responses to the forces that shaped their lives.<br><br>Mormon history also comes alive through the human responses to the large decisions and bold movements of that history. The decision to take the gospel to foreign lands less than a decade after the Church was organized, the westward movement to establish Zion in a safe place, and the religious, political, and economic accommodations made to preserve the institution of the Church, when the federal government almost destroyed it, were just some of the bold organizational shifts to which the Saints were subject. The human dimension of these transforming events emerges from the diaries and recollections of the men and women who experienced them. The decision to move west, for example, triggered tremendous spiritual, emotional, and physical struggles among the Saints.<br><br>When Louisa Barnes Pratt heard the announcement that Nauvoo was to be abandoned, this young mother of four daughters, whose missionary husband labored far away in Tahiti, was devastated. This was a major shift that few were expecting as they watched the temple--surely a sign of permanence, they thought--nearing completion. "[The news] fell on my ear like the funeral knell of all departed joys," Louisa lamented.<br><br><i>What could I do I thought, with my little means, and my helpless family in launching out into the howling wilderness. I had no male relative to take charge of my affairs. . . . I was almost in despair when I reflected on the burden I had to bear, and my companion on the opposite side of the globe.</i>[Reminiscences of Louisa Barnes Pratt (1879), LDS Church Archives]<br><br>But in a brighter moment she declared, "I will show them what I can do," and<i>that</i>she did, safely conveying her children, her possessions, and herself all the way to Utah on her own (ibid.). She was an ordinary Mormon, little known beyond her own circle, but her story, like those of so many other ordinary people, is compelling. Their responses to such uprootings not only show the human face of major institutional decisions in our Church history, but they are the human dimension of our collective past, the connective threads that bind us to our history. And as much as any of our doctrines, our history defines us as Latter-day Saints.<br><br>As traditional topics of history make room for the innovative studies of people's lives, perhaps traditional notions of history as a boring, lifeless subject might also diminish. One historical adventurer who made that transition found the excursion into his own people's history an exhilarating experience:<br><br><i>If you can leap past whatever psychological or historical obstacles that keep you from drinking from the incredibly nourishing and replenishing water of one's history; you can do anything. . . .</i><br><br><i>When you fully claim your history, you can soar.</i>[Wolfe, Playbill,<i>Bring in 'Da Noise</i>]<br><br>That kind of exhilaration I found in abundance last June when my husband and I guided a tour to the British Church history sites, culminating in the dedication of the Preston Temple. In our group were descendants of the original nine apostles who opened the British mission in the late 1830s, all eager to see the scenes of their ancestors' missionary labors. But it was our British friends--members but descendants of neither the apostles nor the earliest converts--who laid special claim to that history. For them, the otherwise unexceptional--and usually rainy--town of Preston took on a luminous quality because it was the first town in England to hear the message of the restored gospel and served as the gateway for the gospel not only to England but also to Europe. The Preston ward, they were proud to say, "was the longest continuously meeting congregation in the Church," and they assured us they were doing all they could to keep that legacy alive.<br><br>We went to the Preston marketplace where the early missionaries agreed that the slogan "Truth Will Prevail" appearing on a political banner there was a good omen. Then, at the home on Wilfred Street, where the missionaries lodged, one of our friends who accompanied us recited the long struggle of Heber C. Kimball and his companions against a siege by evil spirits that occurred there the night before their first baptisms were to take place. Afterwards we walked through the beautiful Avenham Park to the River Ribble, where those nine baptisms did indeed occur, on Sunday, July 30, 1837. "The gospel found a home in England that Sunday morning," declared our friend, "and we are the beneficiaries of the events of that day."<br><br>The missionary labors of President Hinckley as a young elder in Preston only added to their appreciation of that city's historical significance. The Preston Temple was the tangible link for them between the events of that Sunday morning in 1837 and June 1998. As one who frequently draws from our history when he speaks to the Saints, President Hinckley noted at the dedication that it was historically, as well as spiritually fitting that a temple should be built there. The power that knowledge of the past has on the present--enriching it, providing perspective, confirming identity, and deepening appreciation for one's own heritage--was clearly manifest to me on that occasion. In claiming their history, these Saints truly soared.<br><br>Besides events of importance to our lives, history also introduces us to a host of people once living whose influence can be as direct and forceful as that of any of our contemporaries. Biographer Thomas Mallon suggested that "one cannot read a diary and feel unacquainted with its writer." Life writings, he added, in a twist on the book of John, "are the flesh made word" (Thomas Mallon,<i>A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries</i>[New York: Ticknor and Fields, 1984], p. xvii).<br><br>In making the acquaintance of past lives through their words, however, the historian often encounters the imperfections, the inexplicable and unresolvable paradoxes that are so much a part of the human condition. Some historians are drawn to the underside of human actions and to institutional inconsistencies. Certainly historians must be responsive to the particulars of the story they are telling. But they are also responsible for the whole story, the broad pattern that emerges when all the evidence is considered. This lesson came to me in a powerful way when I wrote<i>Journey to Zion.</i>The many trail journals I read in preparing this volume were written at a time of unrelieved stress by men and women whose lives were dramatically uprooted by conversion and the call to gather. They recorded their disagreements, their frustrations, their disappointments, and their tragedies. But they also recorded their irrevocable faith. The cumulative effect of such testimony expressed in diary after diary simply overwhelmed me. In the midst of the most trying of circumstances they could write, like British convert Ellen Douglas, "I for one feel to rejoice and to praise my God that he ever sent the Elders of Israel to England and that he ever gave me a heart to believe them" (Ellen Briggs Douglas to Family, Nauvoo, Illinois, April 14, 1844, LDS Church Archives, reprinted in Carol Cornwall Madsen,<i>In Their Own Words: Women and the Story of Nauvoo</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994], p. 118).<br><br>As the Saints struggled through the dark days at Winter Quarters, they could bear witness to nonbelieving relatives with the strength of Phoebe Chase's testimony: "The Lord has blest us in obeying his command in gathering with the saints and helping on the work of the latter-day w[h]ich you think is not the work of the lord[,] but my children it is the work of the lord for no man ever could bring about so great and marvelous a work" (Phebe Chase to her children, ca. 1840–42, in Charles Marsh Correspondence, photocopy, Nauvoo Restoration, Inc., LDS Church Archives). I cannot adequately describe the impact of those testimonies on my own. They made my spirit soar.<br><br>Like our books of scripture, they read like sacred texts and are a latter-day testament of God's dealings with his covenant people. As Alma said of the sacred records in his keeping, it is "wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people . . . and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls" (Alma 37:8). It has been wisdom that these latter-day records have been preserved. We can claim them as our own sacred history.<br><br>In collapsing the academic distance between themselves and their subjects, historians allow the documents of the past to speak to their spirit as well as to their intellect, often creating a reciprocal bond between themselves and the text. I do not have to suspend belief when I read Elizabeth Ann Whitney's account of the spiritual manifestation that led to her conversion. As a seeker for religious truth, she prayed with all the force of her soul, and one night she seemed to be surrounded by a luminous cloud from which came the words "Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!" She was not surprised when, within months, Parley P. Pratt brought her the message of the gospel, which she immediately witnessed as the truth she had been seeking (reported in Edward W. Tullidge,<i>The Women of Mormondom</i>[New York: Tullidge and Crandall, 1877], p. 42). The life of the spirit for Elizabeth Whitney and, indeed, for the other women I have studied, was the life they chose to live, and to understand them one must acknowledge this truth. Emmeline Wells' feeling of kinship with the women who made up her Mormon world resonated clearly to me. They were more than friends to her, she wrote, "because our faith and work were so in tune with our every day life" (quoted in Annie Wells Cannon, "Mothers in Israel,"<i>Relief Society Magazine</i>3, no. 2 [February 1916], p. 68).<br><br>Whether history answers a desire to connect with something or someone beyond our own time and place, or satisfies our curiosity about times outside our own realm of experience, it gives us all a sense of belonging to the human family and shows us our place in the chain of human events. It helps us to know who we are. Indeed, the Latter-day Saint knowledge of our premortal existence underscores the purpose and importance of mortality and enables us to see the inextricable connection of past, present, and future.<br><br>It has been more than professional interest that has pulled me into history. Like many others, I have wanted to seek out my own roots, to come to know myself better by learning who I was. My curiosity about women's little-known past has led to this search for origins, for a recovery of roots and an affirmation of my Latter-day Saint identity. I was quite unprepared for the rich and vibrant discovery that resulted from that search. I have come to know many women in our history, most of them unknown because they were outside the focus of the institutional lens. It has been tremendously satisfying to discover these past residents of our Mormon world and bring them back to life by retrieving their stories. I have learned much from the humor and intelligence of Hannah King, the single-mindedness of Eliza R. Snow, the generous spirit of Martha Cragun Cox, the resilience of Harriet Hanks, and so much more from so many others.<br><br>Like Emmeline Wells I am grateful that I have made friends of such women, both past and present, who are like kin to me because we share a faith and work that are so much a part of our everyday lives. My studies have provided historical and spiritual connections that have rooted my life in something solid and enduring. I have discovered that our history can be an anchor in a transitory world and ballast for an uncertain tomorrow.<br><br><i>Carol Cornwall Madsen was a BYU professor of history and a research professor with the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute when this devotional address was given on 29 September 1998.</i><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>1.

<h1> Teachings of the Scriptures - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I have taught scripture classes at BYU during the past 26 years, I have been pleasantly reminded of the many great works of God through the ages. One of the most enduring memorials of Heavenly Father's work has been the preservation of the scriptures. The written word of God has not only survived through millennia of political, social, and moral changes, but the scriptures have provided ethical guidelines and spiritual light for millions of readers and listeners through the ages.<br><br>According to a belief statement from the book<i>Principles and Practices of the Restored Gospel,</i>the major purposes and values of God's holy writ are as follows:<br><br><i>SCRIPTURES are pearls of divine wisdom and gems of sacred writing that</i><br><i><b>Record</b>God the Father's plans and works,</i><br><i><b>Teach</b>his commandments and covenants,</i><br><i><b>Inspire</b>expressions of his truths through great literature and profound doctrine,</i><br><i><b>Verify</b>his prophecies and promises, and</i><br><i><b>Testify</b>of him and his Son.</i><br>[Victor L. Ludlow,<i>Principles and Practices of the Restored Gospel</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1992), pp. 131, 641; emphasis added]<br><br>Today I wish to talk about one of these primary purposes of the scriptures. In fact, we find it stated on the title page of the Book of Mormon. If I were to ask you, "What is the first stated purpose of the Book of Mormon as recorded on its title page?" what answer would go through your mind? The standard response is usually something about "the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ." That is a major role of the Book of Mormon, but it is<i>not</i>the first stated purpose. Indeed, the statement about convincing Jew and Gentile is prefaced with the words<i>And also,</i>indicating that something else precedes it.<br><br>The first stated purpose of the Book of Mormon is found in the second paragraph, beginning in the fourth line: "Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel whatgreat things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the<i>covenants</i>of the Lord" (emphasis added). The first purpose of the Book of Mormon is to<i>teach</i>the covenants of the Lord. And then, building on that foundation, it<i>testifies</i>of Jesus as the Christ.<br><br>Understanding covenants can, without exaggeration, be identified as a major key to unlocking the scriptures. Covenant concepts are found throughout the standard works, and we'll highlight some of them as found in the Bible and the Doctrine and Covenants, and then we will return to the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Covenant teachings are an important part of the Bible. Some of the earliest English translations of the Bible were divided into two portions--the Old and New Covenant, for what we today call the Old and New Testament. To begin to understand the Lord's covenants, one should study Genesis 12–50 to see how the covenant promises were established with Abraham and his family down to Joseph and Ephraim. Next one will want to read Deuteronomy carefully. The book of Deuteronomy is structured as a covenant contract between the Lord and the Israelites, with Moses as the intermediary. Isaiah and Jeremiah also present important Old Testament teachings about covenants. The Old Testament provides an ancient context to discuss "what is a covenant?" and "what are its essential elements?"<br><h2><b>What Is a Covenant?</b></h2><br>Let's review first what a covenant is. The standard definition of a<i>covenant</i>is "a solemn agreement between two or more parties." A covenant is a compact between these parties in which promises are made and conditions are agreed upon, usually in the presence of witnesses. As the conditions are fulfilled, the promised benefits are bestowed. "A solemn agreement between two or more parties" implies that all parties are willing participants in the covenant arrangement. Granted, one of the parties may have drafted the terms of the contract and may have greater power and administrative authority in the covenant agreement--such as a king entering into a vassal treaty with a lesser ruler or God providing and defining our covenant opportunities with him. Ideally all parties are anxious to enter into covenants with each other.<br><br>Heavenly Father has always seemed anxious to make covenants with us. Early in our premortal existence he made promises that resulted in our present circumstances on this earth. The scriptures contain so many of his covenants and promises with us that another common definition of<i>covenant</i>is "a promise of God to his children."<br><h2><b>What Does It Mean "to Covenant"?</b></h2><br>Let us move from English definitions to the language roots of the Old Testament and discuss some ancient meanings of<i>covenant</i>and<i>covenant making. Covenant</i>as a noun derives in the Old Testament from the Hebrew word<i>be'rith,</i>which has Semitic roots in the languages of the ancient Near East. The noun<i>be'rith</i>also joins with a common verb in order to describe the process of entering into a covenant. The technical phrase for "making a covenant" that is used most frequently in the Old Testament is<i>karat be'rith,</i>meaning literally "to cut a covenant." This Hebrew construct is similar to the English legal phrase "to cut a contract," or, as expressed in the vernacular, "to cut a deal." The origin of this expression may lie in the ancient covenant ceremony practice of sacrificing animals by<i>cutting</i>their throats, which symbolized a point of finalization and personal commitment in the contractual process. In other words, when the two parties came to an agreement, they would indicate it through an unusual act--such as cutting the throat of an animal to be used as a sacrificial offering or as the main dish for their feast of celebration. Today we would probably just "shake hands on it." Depending upon which language etymology one follows, the term<i>be'rith</i>seems to have three possible meanings, each of which will be recognized by Latter-day Saints in our covenant tradition.<br><br>First, one meaning of<i>be'rith</i>derives from the Hebrew root<i>bara,</i>meaning to "select" or "choose." This root conveys the analogy of a woodcutter going into the forest to select or mark with the cut of his axe certain trees for the harvest. God does not arbitrarily enter into a covenant relationship with each and all of his children. As those with faith choose to come unto Christ and are baptized, Heavenly Father enters into a covenant relationship with them. His Holy Spirit "makes a mark" upon them as they are sanctified and born anew. Thus a covenant is a selective choice carefully entered into by both parties. The union is marked with signs or tokens that each party has accepted the covenant arrangement. By the way, the Native American custom of people becoming "blood brothers" by cutting a mark on their wrists and then pressing them together could be considered as a type of this covenant process.<br><br>The second meaning of<i>be'rith</i>is a "bond" or "joining together." Scholars believe this context derives from the Akkadian root<i>biritu,</i>which means to "fetter" or "chain." We may feel uncomfortable with such strong language of being fettered or chained because, for us, a covenant is not an obligatory or forceful type of binding together; it is to be a voluntary relationship. However, when there is a joining in mutual commitment between two parties, once they have made their pact, they are bound together! As Latter-day Saints, we talk about a "new and everlasting covenant" and being "sealed together," such as in temple ordinances. This joining together represents an absolute, binding compact between God and his children (see D&amp;amp;C 82:10–11).<br><br>Indeed, when one looks at covenant making and the meaning of "cutting" a<i>be'rith</i>in this second context, the symbolism of the cutting motion can represent a penalty involved if one breaks a solemn oath. A list of such penalties, such as cutting a mark on the body or slitting the throat of the offending party, is found in the text of ancient Near Eastern contracts. So to "cut a bond" can also mean to commit yourself to dire consequences if you break your promise. However, when we think of "cutting a bond," there is also a positive dimension and the implication of a liberation if one maintains vows with a powerful, loving God. In a gospel context, as we cut ourselves from the chains of sin by entering into a covenant relationship with Jesus Christ, we free ourselves from spiritual bondage and hell to achieve our ultimate, eternal destiny. This promise of freedom was also given in the Book of Mormon as King Benjamin spoke to his covenant Israelites in Mosiah 5.<br><br>The third root of<i>be'rith</i>has a more unusual meaning. According to some scholars, the Hebrew root<i>bara</i>in<i>karat be'rith</i>really means "to break bread" together with someone. This concept is best understood in the Semitic tradition of hospitality and guest protection. According to the Arabian and Bedouin customs, even if someone had been your fierce enemy or a complete stranger, when you invite that person into your home or tent and share bread with him or her, you are duty-bound to defend and protect this guest--even at peril of your own life. This external, physical act of breaking bread together symbolizes an internal, moral commitment that obligates the host to protect his guest. Likewise there are some examples in the Old Testament of special ceremonial meals as a part of covenantal experiences, such as when Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek and they partook of blessed bread and wine together; when Jacob and his father-in-law made a covenant with each other and ate bread together over a stone altar; and when Moses placed Israel under covenant and then went on the mountain where he, Aaron, and the 70 elders saw God and did eat and drink (see Genesis 14:18, 31:44–54; Exodus 24:7–11). It seems to have been a common pattern in the ancient Near East to eat bread as a symbol of a covenant commitment.<br><br>Although we in modern society might find this act of eating bread a bit unusual as a covenant process, it is very much a part of covenant making in the lives of most Latter-day Saints. We renew our covenants weekly as we partake of the bread of the sacrament. The eating of bread may be much closer to covenant making in the ritual sense than we generally think. Among the direct parallels between the performances of sacrifice in the Old Testament and the sacrament in the New Testament, we remember that the important and common peace offering was ritually cut or divided and then eaten by the Levitical Priesthood holders and the Israelites together as a part of their covenant-making and covenant-renewal process. We, as modern covenant Israelites, follow this same procedure as our priests separate or break the bread, representing Christ's sacrifice, and we eat it together in a covenant-type meal.<br><br>In review, a covenant is a binding, solemn agreement between God and man, conditional upon certain stipulations as recorded in the scriptures. To enter into a covenant implies a voluntary, binding process between the covenant parties, often symbolized by some special act, such as eating bread together. As all parties choose to enter into this relationship, they are then committed to adhere to the terms of the contract.<br><h2><b>What Are the Basic Elements of a Covenant?</b></h2><br>In any covenant, certain and constant elements help to define and solidify the commitment relationship between the respective parties. Understanding these elements helps us appreciate the different dimensions of our covenant relationships. The basic elements of a covenant are sixfold, and all six elements are found in the book of Deuteronomy:<br><br><i>First,</i>there is a preamble, prologue, or preface in the covenant contract that introduces the involved parties and the basic nature of the covenant. This introduction simply brings the parties together so they can now enter into their agreement. For example, the first five verses of Deuteronomy 1 review how the Lord and Israel came together as they prepared to enter a covenant relationship (note especially verse 3).<br><br><i>Second,</i>the historical context of the covenant is presented, sometimes in great detail. This may seem unnecessary, but it is in ancient vassal treaties and in many scriptural contexts. Chapters 1 through 4 of Deuteronomy provide this historical context.<br><br><i>Third,</i>the stipulations of the covenant are explained. This "fine print of the contract" is what we usually think of and what we should seriously study when we evaluate any specific covenant. Before we enter into any covenant, we should understand exactly what we are agreeing to. Chapters 5 through 26 of Deuteronomy present general as well as specific stipulations--the major commandments and the particular laws that the Lord expected of Israel.<br><br><i>Fourth,</i>for any covenant to be binding, it must be duly witnessed or, as we say today, "notarized by proper officials." To solidify the covenant arrangement, a multitude and variety of witnesses are involved. Scattered throughout the last chapters of Deuteronomy we find the following witnesses: Moses, the 70 elders who with him saw God on Mount Sinai, the priests and Levites, a variety of written records, and a special hymn. Indeed, all heaven and earth and various signs and wonders were called forth as special witnesses.<br><br><i>Fifth,</i>a listing of blessings and curses or, as we would say in today's politically correct language, "incentives and penalties" are a part of the covenant. The rewards for proper and prompt adherence and punishments for the neglect or disregard of covenant promises are an essential part of the contract. Chapters 27 through 33 in Deuteronomy contain many lists of blessings and curses.<br><br><i>Sixth,</i>a record of the covenant is made, and steps for its perpetuation are outlined. A covenant, especially one with God, is rarely for just one time and place. Sometimes the covenant document needs to be brought forth and read aloud in the presence of the covenant parties. It usually needs to be reviewed, maybe even revised, and regularly renewed so that it can continue to bless the relationship between the individuals. These elements of preservation and perpetuation are in chapters 27 and 31 of Deuteronomy.<br><br>These same six covenant elements are found in Isaiah 48 as Isaiah prepared the Israelites of his time to renew their covenant relationship with the Lord. This same chapter is cited by Nephi in 1 Nephi 20 as he prepared the Lehite community to become a covenant people after their arrival in the new land.<br><h2><b>What Covenant Models Do We Have in the Church?</b></h2><br>Lest we think these six covenant elements only belong to ancient Israelite or Nephite communities, let's review how they are found in the Church today. In fact, these elements are so much a part of our being a covenant people that we may not appreciate how much they permeate our Latter-day Saint society. For example, we could talk about our membership in the Church and how it is a solemn covenant commitment. Simply stated, we were first introduced to the gospel and then we were instructed about the Restoration, which provided the historical framework of our membership. We also learned the stipulations or commandments that were expected of us as Church members. Our formal entrance into the Church at baptism was duly witnessed by two priesthood holders. Blessings and/or punishments followed us as Church members, and we are reminded of them in a variety of Church settings and as we study the scriptures. Finally, as members of record, we have weekly opportunities to perpetuate our covenant relationship through the sacrament.<br><br>Our most consistent covenant model is found in the sacrament, which is a precise covenant ordinance. Following the same six elements, we first come together to renew our covenants. The sacrament hymn then provides the historical framework as we come out of a worldly environment (and our wondering why the bishop called<i>that</i>person to the calling we just sustained), and our thoughts are turned to places like Gethsemane, Golgotha, and the Garden Tomb. In the precise wording of the sacramental prayers, we agree to take Christ's name upon us, to always remember him, and to keep his commandments. The sacrament covenant is not only witnessed by the priesthood leaders, but we witness it to each other as we individually partake of the bread and water. Those around us can see and witness that we have done an external act as a symbol of an internal commitment. A wonderful blessing, the companionship of the Holy Spirit, is promised in the prayers. Once we have experienced that blessing, to lose the Spirit is indeed a curse. And, finally, partaking of the sacrament is the latest renewal of our covenant relationship with God.<br><br>The temple provides the most solemn covenant opportunities for Latter-day Saints. Although one would expect to learn a lot of details and specifics about temple covenants during the endowment session, the covenants themselves are usually just introduced and briefly defined and explained in the temple. However, we are told where we can learn more about them--in the scriptures! Thus a conscientious study of the scriptures is an excellent preparation for going to the temple so we can review the covenant framework and the Lord's expectations before we go into his house and make solemn promises to keep specific temple covenants. Like the ancient Israelites, we Latter-day Saints are indeed a covenant people.<br><h2><b>Covenant Teachings in the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants</b></h2><br>In addition to the foundation covenant teachings of the Old Testament, we find valuable covenantal concepts in the New Testament. Some of them are connected, such as Jeremiah's promise of a new covenant in Jeremiah 31 and Paul's witness of this covenant's fulfillment in Hebrews 8. The blessings of this new covenant were first offered to the Jews in Galilee and Judea, and they were received by many--such as John, Peter, James, and others. But as most Jews turned away from the gospel, Christ's new covenant was offered to the Gentiles. As Christ taught, the great symbol of his new covenant or new testament was his blood that he shed for our sins (see Matthew 26:28). Eventually all nations and peoples were to hear Christ's gospel and enter into the new covenant, but persecution and early Christian apostasy prevented this from happening (see Matthew 28:19). Thus the full blessings of the new covenant were short-lived as recorded in the New Testament.<br><br>Covenant teachings are also important in the latter-day work of scripture containing the writings of the Prophet Joseph Smith--as evidenced in its title: The Doctrine and<i>Covenants.</i>Covenant references appear 94 times in the Doctrine and Covenants, about once every three pages--roughly the same ratio as in the Book of Mormon. When we think of covenant concepts in the Doctrine and Covenants, we first usually identify one of two sections: either section 84, where the oath and covenant of the priesthood is presented, or section 132, where the new and everlasting covenant of marriage is taught. Indeed, section 132 has more covenant references, 16 of them, than any other section or chapter of scripture. Section 107 also contains important covenant teachings connected to the priesthood. And section 42 has some valuable teachings about the law and the covenant.<br><h2><b>Why Do We Have Covenants?</b></h2><br>Obviously, the idea of being a covenant people is important for Latter-day Saints. I believe there are at least four sets of reasons why covenants are so valuable for us as members of Christ's Church.<br><h3><strong><i>Teachings and Guidelines</i></strong></h3><br>First, covenants provide valuable teachings and guidelines. As we prepare to enter into covenants, we receive instruction about the doctrinal framework of the covenant. We are taught the commandments that God expects of us. This instruction provides gospel teachings and guidelines that give us direction and focus as we commit ourselves to keep his commandments.<br><h3><strong><i>Incentives and Rewards</i></strong></h3><br>Second, covenants give us incentives and rewards. Sometimes the blessings of a particular commandment or covenant are so important to us that we receive extra motivation to be obedient. Such incentives can be a positive influence in our lives to counter the many negative enticements that surround us. Granted, eventually we will want to do good for good's sake and to keep our covenants because that's really what we want to do. But in the meantime, and as motivators in moments of weakness, covenant incentives and rewards encourage us on the path toward God.<br><h3><strong><i>Gateways and Ordinances</i></strong></h3><br>Third, covenants are required gospel gateways and ordinances if we want to return to God's presence. An obvious role of covenants is to define essential commitments and ordinances that God requires of us as we seek to return to his celestial realm. Certain covenant gateways, such as baptism, are absolutely essential for all of us, even Jesus, the Son of God. We must participate in these covenants if we want to fulfill our divine destiny.<br><h3><strong><i>Patterns and Measurements</i></strong></h3><br>Fourth, covenants develop patterns and measurements of righteous behavior. As we not only enter into but also keep our many covenant commitments, patterns of obedience make it easier for us to make and keep higher and higher levels of covenants. Knowing God's expectations for us and then formalizing our commitment to them through a covenant act provides us with a somewhat objective means of measuring our religious performance. Our progress on the path of life is verified, and we feel trustworthy for greater opportunities of service. By keeping covenants and being faithful in what may seem to be little things, we are proven worthy to receive greater things.<br><br>In summary, covenants help us in many ways as we sojourn through life. Covenant teachings and guidelines give us direction. Covenant incentives and rewards encourage us to stay on the correct path. Covenant gateways and ordinances define what is expected of us and where we should be along the way. And covenant patterns and measurements develop further righteous behavior and reinforce our sense of fulfillment. Without covenants, we would be lost and frustrated, eternally. With covenants, we not only draw nearer to our Heavenly Father and Elder Brother, but we also become more like them, eternally.<br><h2><b>Covenants in the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>Some of the clearest and most profound covenant teachings are found in the Book of Mormon. The word<i>covenant</i>in one form or another appears 154 times in this work of scripture. The first reference is on the title page, as cited earlier, and the last one is in the next to the last verse of the Book of Mormon as Moroni exhorts us to receive the covenant of the Father that we might become perfect and holy (see Moroni 10:33). There are two types of covenant relationships presented in the Book of Mormon: horizontal and vertical.<i>Horizontal</i>covenants are where human beings enter into a peer covenant relationship with each other. For example, Captain Moroni made covenants both with some Nephites that they would keep the peace in the land (see Alma 46:31) and with some Lamanites that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites (see Alma 62:16). There are 41 such horizontal covenant references in the Book of Mormon, especially in the books of Alma and Helaman.<i>Vertical</i>covenants are between God and mortals, either individually or collectively. The teachings of Nephi, Jacob, King Benjamin, Alma, Mormon, and Moroni enrich our understanding of God's covenants (see 1 Nephi 13–15; 2 Nephi 9–10; Mosiah 5–6, 18; 3 Nephi 29; Mormon 8; Moroni 10). There are 113 vertical covenant passages in the Book of Mormon. The great majority of them are found in three books easily remembered with a single name, but with different numerical prefixes: 1, 2, and 3 Nephi.<br><h2><b>The Savior's Covenant Sermons in 3 Nephi</b></h2><br>The great teacher of covenants in the Book of Mormon is the resurrected Savior during his three major public sermons--each with a covenant context. The first sermon, the so-called Sermon on the Mount (or, in its 3 Nephi setting, the sermon at Bountiful or the temple), begins with a covenant contract. As stated in the first two verses of 3 Nephi 12, the Savior's teachings are directed to those who will believe in his words and be baptized in a covenant relationship. The Sermon on the Mount establishes the contract between Christ and his covenant followers. It has also been called the "constitution of Christianity" because it outlines our rights and responsibilities as members of his kingdom.<br><br>The Savior's second sermon, found in 3 Nephi 15 and 16, is referred to as the "Law and Covenant Discourse." In it, Jesus clarifies some important distinctions between the law and the covenant. He explains that the<i>law</i>, which was given to Moses about 1300 years earlier, had been fulfilled by him, the Savior. Yahweh, the premortal Lord, had given the law to Moses at Mount Sinai. And Jesus, the Anointed One, had fulfilled the law at Gethsemane, Golgotha, and the Garden Tomb. But, Christ goes on to explain, the<i>covenant</i>he had made with his people was not yet all fulfilled. The covenant, which was given to Abraham around 1900 b.c., had been partially fulfilled in the intervening two millennia, but there were many wonderful covenant promises waiting to be fulfilled, especially in these latter days.<br><br>The Law and Covenant Discourse distinguishes the Mosaic law, which was completed at Christ's first coming, from the Abrahamic covenant, which will be fulfilled at his second coming. In the classic pattern of "the last shall be first, and the first shall be last," the covenant that was made earlier with Abraham will be fulfilled in the end of days, whereas the law, made later with Moses, was already completed in the meridian of time.<br><h2><b>The Abrahamic Covenant</b></h2><br>This would be an appropriate time to highlight the Abrahamic covenant. As recorded in Genesis 12 and later passages, three profound promises were given to Abraham. First, he would be the literal father of many nations and a countless posterity. Second, his descendants would inherit and rule the lands of the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Third, through his lineage all nations and families of the earth would be blessed.<br><br>The fulfillment of these promises started very slowly for Abraham. After many years he fathered eight sons with three different wives. He had about three dozen grandsons, and the numbers have multiplied until today hundreds of millions of people on this planet are the literal descendants of Father Abraham.<br><br>As far as governing great lands was concerned, Abraham was no great ruler or emperor. His obituary might have mentioned his many travels, his teaching sojourn in Egypt, his successful military campaign as he rescued Lot and others, his honorable relations with his neighbors, and his growing flocks and family--but he was no major historical figure in the world scene of his time. Indeed, at his death the only property that he controlled was a small grove of trees and a cave that became the family cemetery near Hebron. But after his lifetime, Abraham's posterity went on to control the lands originally promised him as well as other territories in Asia and Africa. In addition, further lands of inheritance were promised Abraham's family here in the Americas, as confirmed by the Savior in 3 Nephi 16:16.<br><br>The third promise, that Abraham's posterity would bless the earth, has found fulfillment in many, many ways. First and foremost, the Savior and the blessings of his life and atonement are eternal legacies of one of Abraham's "sons." Associated with them are the spiritual blessings of Christ's church, priesthood, and gospel, which have enriched millions through the ages and will endure into the eternities. In addition, the moral, intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and material/financial areas of our lives have been enriched through Abraham's seed. As examples, the messages and moral-ethical values of the Bible have established the foundation for Western society. Indeed, much of our modern civilization might not even have been established without the great classical works of science, philosophy, drama, and mathematics that the Arab descendants of Abraham preserved through the Dark Ages. Arab society provided important incentives and resources for the European renaissance. Also, the Jews, although only one small remnant of Abraham's lineage, have constantly demonstrated the capacity to bring forth notable advancements in science, medicine, and other areas of human endeavor. This is recognized by identifying the high percentage of Jews in any annual listing of Nobel Prize recipients. Although Jews only make up about one out of 400 people in the world, they will often receive one out of four Nobel awards as they enrich and bless the lives of others. Thus through the centuries Abraham's descendants have made major contributions to world civilization through their advances and discoveries in government, philosophy, science, commerce, arts and letters, and many other areas of our lives.<br><br>Religious historians recognize that within a couple of years there will be as many Latter-day Saints on this earth as Jews. In the year 2001 do you think that one out of four Nobel Prize recipients will be Latter-day Saints? Last year one was--but we would need three or four from an LDS background every year to begin to match the annual average of the Jews in this area of world recognition. Granted, Latter-day Saints have many ways whereby they benefit humanity, but I see especially great potential in the current generation of LDS youth and university students. I fully expect to see some of their pictures on the front covers of<i>Time</i>magazine when future Nobel Prizes are announced. What contributions are you making and how are you blessing others? Remember--as Abraham's heirs,<i>you</i>will provide many future blessings through missionary, temple, and Church work, and<i>you</i>contribute to society and make discoveries and improvements with<i>your</i>gifts and talents. So when the Savior told the Nephites that the covenant was not yet all fulfilled, he knew that further numbers and wonderful blessings were yet to be provided by Abraham's family, especially in this dispensation of the fulness of times.<br><h2><b>The Savior's Covenant People Discourse</b></h2><br>Returning to Jesus' ministry in 3 Nephi, after quoting some Isaiah and completing the Law and Covenant Discourse, the Savior admonished his listeners to return to their homes and to ponder and pray about the things that he had taught them. Continuing his teachings the next day, he delivered his profound "Covenant People Discourse," found from 3 Nephi 20:10 to 3 Nephi 23:5. Most of us have probably not studied this sermon in great depth because of its eloquent style, its elaborate prophecies, and the fact that a lot of Isaiah is quoted in it. Suffice it to say, if the contents of this sermon of Jesus were to be discovered and verified in some ancient archive in the Middle East, it would be the most significant archaeological discovery of this millennium. What an addition to the scriptures it would be! And yet we who have this unique sermon may not have appreciated its value and the keen insights, signs, and promises it reveals for us as Christ's covenant people in the latter days. In fact, the word<i>covenant</i>appears 10 times just in 3 Nephi 20--more times than in any other chapter of the Book of Mormon--highlighting the covenant nature of this sermon.<br><br>In essence, the Covenant People Discourse begins with a promise that when the prophecies of Isaiah are fulfilled, then Heavenly Father's covenant with Israel will be fulfilled. The threefold promise to Abraham will be completed as the remnants of Israel (Abraham's posterity) will return to their lands of inheritance (the places promised them in the covenant) and as they become a blessing of righteousness (fulfilling their covenant commitments and opportunities of service) for all peoples of the earth. The Savior then cites significant prophecies of Isaiah and Micah to be fulfilled as the New Jerusalem is established and as Jesus, himself, dwells on earth.<br><br>Jesus continues in chapter 21 with a promised sign so that we can know when these covenants are being fulfilled--because as the covenants are fulfilled, then Christ's millennial reign will be established. Would you like to know what that sign is? You have probably read it many times but may not have recognized its significance.<br><h2><b>The Promised Sign That the Covenant Is Being Fulfilled</b></h2><br>Let's pick up the Covenant People Discourse in the last verse of chapter 20. Jesus has just finished quoting most of Isaiah 52. He then summarizes:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things</i>[these prophecies of Isaiah]<i>shall surely come, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled.</i><br><br>He then continues in verse 1 of chapter 21:<br><br><i>And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the time when these things shall be about to take place</i>[Which things?]--<i>that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them my Zion.</i><br><br>And in verse 2 he continues, "And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign." But before he tells us the sign, he explains the significance of some things that he has revealed or that he will yet reveal. And then he tells us about the Gentiles being established in this land and the great works he will show forth among them. And soon we are in verse 7, where he tells us that when the latter-day Lamanites "begin to know these things--it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant."<br><br>Wait a minute! In verse 1 the Savior promises us a sign so that we can "know the time when these things shall be about to take place." Note the future tense in promising something "about to take place." It's still ahead, but it seems to be close at hand. Then, in verse 7 Jesus tells us that the Lamanites knowing these things will be a<i>sign</i>that we can know "that the work of the Father hath already commenced." Note the past tense here: it "hath already commenced," or, as we would say, "It has already started." So somewhere between verse 1 and verse 7 we pass from a<i>future</i>promise to a<i>past fulfillment.</i>To go from the future to the past we have to pass through the present. Somewhere in the middle verses we missed the sign that would be the transition from a time when something was about to take place to the time when it had already commenced.<br><br>Maybe a couple of suggestions will help with these verses. First of all, note that verses 1 through 7 of chapter 21 are punctuated as one long sentence--one very long, complicated sentence. English teachers would require numerous large blackboards just to diagram the grammatical parts of this sophisticated sentence. Then theologians would take hundreds of hours trying to understand the doctrinal meanings of this profound sentence. So don't be discouraged if you don't comprehend this sentence the first few times you read it.<br><br>Second, the Savior has some techniques to alert us to when something important is coming up. He could speak in a loud voice to let us know about something important! And maybe he did, but that does not carry over into the printed text. But he does give us some "attention getters" in the text to let us know when something important, something<i>very</i>important, is coming up. He uses foremost the word<i>verily.</i>Note in verse 3 the double use of<i>verily,</i>indicating that what is coming is<i>very, very</i>important. Another attention getter is the word<i>therefore.</i>Note how it introduces verse 5. So let us read verses 3 to 5 and see if we can recognize the important promised sign. As I read these verses, I'll insert some definitions of key terms as established in the earlier verses:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I</i>[the Savior]<i>say unto you</i>[the audience in Bountiful],<i>when these things</i>[of the Book of Mormon]<i>shall be made known unto them</i>[the Gentiles]<i>of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father, from them unto you;</i><br><br><i>For it is wisdom in the Father that they</i>[the Gentiles]<i>should be established in this land</i>[America],<i>and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things</i>[as found here in the Book of Mormon]<i>might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed</i>[the Lamanites],<i>that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;</i><br><br><i>Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be wrought among you hereafter</i>[as later recorded in the Book of Mormon]<i>shall come forth from the Gentiles, unto your seed.</i><br><br>Then, continuing in verse 7:<br><br><i>And when these things come to pass that thy seed</i>[the Lamanites]<i>shall begin to know these things</i>[of the Book of Mormon]--<i>it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who are of the house of Israel.</i>[3 Nephi 21:3–5, 7]<br><br>So the sign is when the Book of Mormon comes from the Gentiles to the Lamanites and they begin to accept it! Then is the time of the fulfillment of the covenant promises in preparation for Christ's millennial reign. Although many attempts were made in earlier Church history to take the gospel and the Book of Mormon to the Lamanites, it wasn't really until the 1960s that they began to accept the teachings and come into the Church in great numbers. Thus the sign as promised by Jesus in the Covenant People Discourse has finally been given, and now is the generation for the fulfillment of the covenant promises!<br><br>This profound sentence with its promised sign is the pivotal point in the Covenant People Discourse. The second half of the discourse is, in many ways, a mirror image of the first. Passages from Micah and Isaiah 54 are quoted as covenant promises are highlighted. The Savior concludes the Covenant People Discourse with an admonition and a promise. The admonition is to "search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah" (3 Nephi 23:1). And the promise is similar to the one at the beginning of the sermon--that all things that Isaiah spoke either have been or will be fulfilled, even according to the words he spoke (see verse 3). So in addition to studying the covenant teachings found in the Book of Mormon, we need to continually study Isaiah's writings in the Bible.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, Heavenly Father is a covenantal God. His creation of this earth and our existence here is a covenantal act as promised in the premortal councils. His sending forth of his Son and the prophets is to instruct, prepare, supervise, remind, and perpetuate the covenants among us, the children of God on earth. His priesthood keys and the temples and tabernacles provide places for us to enter into covenant relationships and to receive instruction from living prophets about covenant teachings. By covenant, we become his representatives to the world as we seek and encourage others to enter into covenants with him. By covenant, we commit ourselves to build and perfect each other in Christ's kingdom. By covenant, we open the gates of heaven as we enter the house of the Lord and make solemn promises with God. We cannot draw close to Heavenly Father and we cannot dwell in his celestial realms without being in a covenant relationship with him. This covenant relationship must be administered by his Son and must be verified by the Holy Spirit.<i>Covenants are our bond with the Divine!</i><br><br>"I am a child of God, And he has sent me here" to follow a covenant pathway back to his presence (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 301). I hope that as we study the covenant teachings of the scriptures we will be inspired to more fully honor our sacred covenants. By following Christ's example, and with the sanctifying companionship of the Holy Spirit, I know we can truly keep our past and future covenants with Heavenly Father. I pray that we will do so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Victor L.

<h1> Truths That Make a Difference in Our Lives - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I had some difficulty deciding on what ought to be the title and theme of my remarks today. I finally settled on "Powerful Truths That Make a Difference in Our Lives."<br><br>We are all grieving today because of the senseless acts of violence that took the life of Elder MacKintosh and seriously injured Elder Borden in Ufa, Russia. Reportedly, the terrible crime was committed by an individual, or individuals, in a drunken condition.<br><br>Have you ever given much thought to how dramatically the world would be changed for the better if just one of the truths revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith more than 160 years ago--the Word of Wisdom--would be lived by people around the world? Most of the tragedies, immorality, and violence caused by those under the influence of alcohol or drugs would be eliminated, including those we experience in this country in almost every city and setting due to campus binge drinking that is so prevalent.<br><br>Also, we suffer more today at the loss of Elder MacKintosh's life because we understand that he is much more than just an individual. He is a part of us. He is really family, and he was on the Lord's errand--serving as a missionary like so many of our own are serving today all over the world. We share, at least in part, the grief experienced by his parents and brothers and sisters, because they, too, are part of our family.<br><br>How comforting it is to know that as a result of other revealed truths we have been blessed to receive, as a result of the restoration of the sealing power of the priesthood, the Mackintosh family can anticipate a glorious reunion with their son and brother in the world beyond the veil. We know that Elder MacKintosh's spirit is yet very much alive and that his missionary efforts have merely been transferred to another zone of experience.<br><br>Well, now, to what I have prepared to share with you. In light of these sad events, I hope that for the next few minutes we will think carefully, seriously, and gratefully about these powerful truths that really make a difference in our lives.<br><br>October 20 is quite a date! I hadn't remembered that on this date in 1803 the Senate ratified the Louisiana Purchase. Likewise I didn't recall that it was on October 20 in 1944, during World War II, that General Douglas MacArthur--two and a half years after he had said, "I will return"--waded ashore at Leyte in the Philippines. And since I don't keep up on such matters, I didn't remember that on this date in 1968, the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy.<br><br>But October 20 has a very special personal significance for me because on this date in 1948--exactly 50 years ago today--Elder Blair Thomas and I left the mission home in Salt Lake City. We checked our suitcases and other paraphernalia and boarded a bus and made the long ride to El Paso, Texas. We crossed the Mexican border to Ciudad Juarez. We then spent two full days on a train to Mexico City on our way to the Mexican Mission, which at that time encompassed all of Mexico<i>and</i>all five Central American countries.<br><br>That was the beginning of a tremendous experience! Hardly a day has passed since then but what I have remembered something about those 31 months of life-shaping experiences as a missionary.<br><br>I know that there are thousands of you who are returned missionaries. I'm confident that most of you have similar vivid memories and could even remember the exact date you began your service. Most of you young freshman and sophomore men have not yet served a mission. I hope every one of you will fulfill that sacred priesthood obligation. Some of you young women also--though not obligated--will have that special opportunity for service come into your lives.<br><br>You returned missionaries have paid the price of time and effort to help build the kingdom, to proclaim the gospel, to strengthen the stakes of Zion, and to help in the establishment of the Church. You have responded to the call from a prophet of the Lord to lay on the altar your personal offering of approximately a "tithing" of your life to this point.<br><br>When I think of the impact that comes from serving a full-time mission, I am reminded of an experience we had with Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve, who has to be one of the greatest missionaries of all time--of this or of any dispensation.<br><br>By the time he was 96, he no longer drove his car. As a result, whenever he came to Provo to speak at the Missionary Training Center, we had the privilege of going to Salt Lake City and providing transportation for him.<br><br>On one of those trips, we asked him a question something like this: "Elder Richards, after all the years you have lived, all the places you have been, and all the things you have done, what do you consider to be the most significant experience of your life?" We thought that maybe he would refer to an outstanding spiritual experience such as with the Brethren in the temple or something like that.<br><br>He didn't hesitate for a moment in making this enthusiastic response: "Why, it was my first mission to Holland!" He then proceeded to share with us some of the choice and challenging experiences he had when he left home and arrived in Holland without knowing a word of Dutch. He said that even the dogs understood the language but he didn't. But he supposed if the dogs could learn to understand Dutch, he probably could also--and that he did.<br><br>In his journal Elder Richards described some of the experiences he had at the end of that first mission:<br><br><i>In the evening meeting I spoke first to give my farewell. As I walked into the pulpit and viewed the faces of the brothers and sisters ..., a feeling came over me that I had never had before. To think how I had preached them the word of the Lord with all the power the Lord had given me. ... I had learned to love them, and they in turn placed me far above what I really am. ... I never in my life felt happier than under the influence of the Spirit present this evening.</i>[Lucile C. Tate,<i>LeGrand Richards: Beloved Apostle</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), p. 52]<br><br>Before leaving his mission, Elder Richards went to the home of a woman who, with her family, had come into the Church as a result of his missionary efforts. His biographer described the occasion:<br><br><i>She was so short that she had to look way up to him. ... When he went to leave, tears rolled down her cheeks and she said, "Elder Richards, it was hard to see my daughter leave for Zion a few months ago, but it is much harder to see you go."</i><br><br><i>He went to bid another convert good-bye, a man who stood erect in the uniform of his country. This friend got down on his knees and took the elder's hand in his, hugged and kissed it, and bathed it with his tears of gratitude for the gospel the missionary had brought. Elder Richards said upon leaving him, "I wept all the way from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, thinking that I might never see those friends of mine again.</i>It was much harder to leave them than it was my own family when I left on my mission." [Tate,<i>LeGrand Richards,</i>pp. 52–53; emphasis added]<br><br>Many of you returned missionaries can relate to those feelings, can't you?<br><br>Now, getting back to the experience we had with Elder LeGrand Richards when we brought him to the Missionary Training Center to speak. It was a short time before he passed away. As I mentioned, he was 96 years of age and was having a variety of difficulties with his health. (I suppose we all might have some difficulties with our health if we live to age 96!)<br><br>He had some heart and circulation problems and walked with a cane. Before he died he had a portion of one of his legs amputated. He quipped that he was glad that they had started on that end.<br><br>On that Tuesday evening, he addressed about 1,700 missionaries. He gave a stirring message quoting missionary scriptures and sharing those lively missionary experiences to illustrate them. In a remarkable way he held the missionaries on the edges of their seats for almost an hour. At the conclusion of the meeting I asked Elder Richards if he would share with the missionaries what he had told us earlier, just before the devotional began, when we had asked him how he was.<br><br>In his good-natured and enthusiastic way he returned to the pulpit and said:<br><br><i>This is just for a little fun. I am past 96, as you know, and when people ask me how I am, I say "fine," if you don't want details. If they want details, I tell them: "Well, I've lost my hair. These are not my teeth. I can't see out of that eye. I can't hear out of this ear. My feet and legs don't percolate like they used to. The house I am living in is a bit dilapidated."</i><br><br>[And then, raising his clenched hand above his head, he said,]<i>But LeGrand Richards IS ALL RIGHT!</i><br><br>It was<i>electric!</i>That whole congregation of missionaries rose spontaneously to their feet and gave this great missionary apostle a standing ovation. I share the experience for two reasons: one, because it was one of those interesting and unforgettable experiences at the MTC, but two, and more important, because of what I learned from the occasion.<br><br>Here was a brother who knew the gospel very well and had a powerful testimony of it. He had studied it for years. Elder Richards had taken the pieces of the gospel puzzle and put them together in his speaking and writings in such a way that literally hundreds, if not thousands, have come to know and understand gospel ideas and truths, and they have become converted.<br><br>He had come to the time of life--as one of the Brethren described it--when the "warranty on our parts runs out," but, with all of the physical problems within his system, he was still able to say with enthusiasm, "But LeGrand Richards IS ALL RIGHT!"<br><br>He had a testimony of those powerful life-changing and life-shaping gospel ideas and truths that missionaries share with investigators. Truths that let him know who he really was. Elder Richards had come to know that our Heavenly Father is a divine and glorified Personage rather than some indefinable Being. He understood that he was much more than merely a creature brought into existence by God out of nothing--or ex nihilo, as we read in Latin. He was not burdened by the heavy anxiety that the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich described when he wrote:<br><br><i>Being created out of nothing means having to return to nothing. The stigma of having originated out of nothing is impressed on every creature. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . And therefore man realizes that he is the prey of nonbeing.</i>[<i>Systematic Theology,</i>vol. 1 [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951], pp. 188, 196]<br><br>In contrast, Elder Richards knew that his spirit--that which gave him life, the "real" LeGrand Richards--was not created out of nothing but rather was literally a spirit son of his loving Heavenly Father. He knew that his relationship with our Heavenly Father was Father-to-son and not creator-to-creation, as the neoorthodox philosopher Emil Brunner starkly described about the distance, and hence the alienation, many mortals feel from God, their creator. He wrote:<br><br><i>There is no greater sense of distance than that which lies in the words Creator-Creation. ... The greatest dissimilarity between two things which we can express at all--more dissimilar than light and darkness, death and life, good and evil--is that between the Creator and that which is created.</i>[Emil Brunner,<i>Man in Revolt: A Christian Anthropology,</i>trans. Olive Wyon (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1947), p. 90]<br><br>Elder Richards did not accept the pervasive, traditional Christian creeds--such as the Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, or Westminster Confession--that teach of a Trinity consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are described as three in one and one in three and without body, parts, or passions. He also understood well that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--the Only Begotten Son of the Father in the flesh--is a separate, distinct, and glorified Personage. With that knowledge came an understanding of who he was and the important purpose of his life in mortality.<br><br>Further, Elder Richards understood something about where he was going after this mortal life. Sister Richards had preceded him in death several years before, and through those lonely months and years of being without her companionship, he knew that, subject to faithfulness, they would be reunited as husband and wife and with their children--all of whom were sealed together for time and all eternity by the overarching power of the priesthood.<br><br>Having a testimony of these powerful truths helps all of us face whatever challenges come to us during our mortal lives. These are the truths that can change us for the better and are blessing literally millions of converts' lives around the world. Any of us who are faithful and are blessed to become aware of these truths can say with understanding and assurance--regardless of our physical problems--that "We are all right!"<br><br>Such are the ideas that you missionaries had the privilege of sharing with those who had never known them before. These ideas and truths are so powerful that once understood, they change us for the better, forever.<br><br>Years ago I learned from the following personal experience that such powerful truths continue with us.<br><br>One summer while teaching a Latter-day Saint doctrine and philosophy course at the institute of religion adjacent to a university to the north of us, I attempted, as was customary, to become acquainted with the class members on the first day. One of the students introduced herself as a nonmember. She was a very bright and attractive third-year student. Having a nonmember in the class was stimulating to all of us. She asked a lot of questions and participated freely in class discussion.<br><br>Generally things seemed to me to be going along well in the class. We had considered our Latter-day Saint ideas relating to the nature of God and mankind, our relationship to God, and revelation from God through living prophets to man.<br><br>Then, three weeks before the summer session was to end, she stopped coming. I wondered and frankly worried about what I might have unintentionally said that could have offended her in any way. We had no further contact until September, when students were registering for the fall quarter. She called my office and arranged to come and visit for a few minutes.<br><br>When she arrived, she said, "Last summer I registered for your course so I could find out more about what you Mormons believe. I had met a returned missionary from your Church, and we had dated a few times. He's a medical student, and I was interested in him. I decided I wanted to find out more about his beliefs in a setting where he was not present and I would feel free to ask any questions I had on my mind.<br><br>"As it turns out, all that is behind us. We are not going together anymore, and for a while that was hard for me to adjust to."<br><br>She glanced down at her handkerchief that she had wound around her fingers and continued, "I suppose you are wondering why I stopped coming to your class last summer."<br><br>I nodded, and she continued, "Well, on the first day I missed the class, as I was walking across campus toward the institute building, the thought crossed my mind, 'What if all this is true?' That thought upset me so much that I decided not to go back to class again. I would just drop the course and get away from it. I returned to my own church. I joined the choir. I even joined the civic action program sponsored by the church. I was there every Sunday and in between. I immersed myself in all the activities, but in spite of all my efforts,<i>the ideas would not let me go.</i>Is there something more that I could study about the Church?"<br><br>She enrolled in a Book of Mormon course and also met with the missionaries. She became a member of the Church because these gospel ideas and truths "would not let her go."<br><br>The powerful truths of the gospel stretch our minds and spirits, and after knowing and believing even some of them, our lives are changed forever. We learn about who we really are and how we relate to a loving Heavenly Father as well as how we relate to all that we see around us in the world. We come to know more about our Savior Jesus Christ and his coming to earth not merely to do his own will but rather that of the Father in carrying out the Atonement and the Father's plan for all of us, his children.<br><br>A nineteenth-century Protestant minister by the name of Paxton wrote these words about the power of ideas: "Ideas go booming through the world louder than cannon. Thoughts are mightier than armies. Principles have achieved more victories than horsemen or chariots" (W. M. Paxton, in<i>The New Dictionary of Thoughts,</i>revised and enlarged edition, comp. Tryon Edwards [New York: StanBook, 1977], pp. 286–87). Such are the ideas that all of you returned missionaries were privileged to teach during your time of service, and they came to us through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>In 1863 Brother William Fowler wrote the lyrics to the hymn "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet," and the congregation has sung that hymn in virtually every general conference since that time. Each time I sing that hymn, I gratefully think of at least two prophets: the Prophet Joseph Smith and the current president of the Church.<br><br>As you remember, in the hymn we sing, "We thank thee for sending the gospel<i>To lighten our minds with its rays"</i>(<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 19; emphasis added). That is exactly what the restored gospel does for us. It enlightens our minds. It illuminates us. It brings us peace of mind. It brings us meaning to our everyday lives. We are indebted to the instrument in the hands of the Lord who brought these ideas to us--the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>One cannot fully appreciate the powerful truths contained in the restored gospel without some understanding of the remarkable contribution of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These influential gospel truths and principles have come to us through him.<br><br>Even though he was blessed with many talents and capacities, Joseph Smith could not have accomplished what he did without divine help.<br><br>One of the greatest aspects of Joseph Smith's ministry was the continuous flow of revelation that came through him to become scripture. President Stephen L Richards, who became a member of the First Presidency, gave an address about the contributions of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>His literary labors must not be forgotten. He produced more scripture, that is, the revealed word of God, than any other man of whom we have record. Indeed, his total scriptural productions would almost equal those of all others put together. Within the pages of the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, which came to the world through him, are to be found such truth gems as, "The glory of God is intelligence"; "Men are that they might have joy"; it is the work and the glory of God to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man; and a clear statement of the purpose of good and evil in the world--a philosophical problem which has baffled the scholars of all times--and many other truths of inestimable value. There also came from him such memorable sayings as, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance"; "A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge"; "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life it will rise with us in the resurrection." He wrote history and dissertations on many subjects and was an orator of magnetism and convincing force.</i><br><br><i>The world's enlightenment of the century following his life has not disclosed a single error in his theological and philosophical pronouncements, and the society which he established is without question the peer, and many students not belonging to it maintain it is the superior, of all social systems on the earth.</i>[Stephen L Richards,<i>CR,</i>October 1936, p. 32; also published in a pamphlet,<i>Contributions of Joseph Smith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1958), p. 7]<br><br>That he was able to accomplish all of this before he turned 39 years of age continues to be amazing to me. During his short life the Prophet Joseph Smith was forced out of three states--New York, Ohio, and Missouri--and into Illinois, where he was finally martyred. In the process of his life he was often a fugitive, he was harassed during those years by more than 40 lawsuits, and he had the emotional and temporal concerns of a young husband and father of nine children, of whom four were buried along the way.<br><br>Way back in 1823, the angel Moroni had told Joseph that his name would be had for good<i>and</i>evil among the nations of the earth (see JS--H 1:33). He certainly suffered at the hands of those who held his name for evil, but there were and are others who hold his name for good.<br><br>For example, the great Russian statesman, author, and philosopher, Count Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoi, had a very high opinion of the work of the Prophet Joseph Smith, as indicated in the account of his conversation about a century ago with Dr. Andrew D. White, former president of Cornell University and U.S. foreign minister to Russia:<br><br><i>"Dr. White," said Count Tolstoi, "I wish you would tell me about your American religion."</i><br><br><i>"We have no state church in America," replied Dr. White.</i><br><br><i>"I know that, but what about your American religion?"</i><br><br><i>Patiently then Dr. White explained to the Count that in America there are many religions, and that each person is free to belong to the particular church in which he is interested.</i><br><br><i>To this Tolstoi impatiently replied: "I know all of this, but I want to know about the</i>American<i>religion. Catholicism originated in Rome; the Episcopal Church originated in England; the Lutheran Church in Germany, but the Church to which I refer originated in America, and is commonly known as the Mormon Church. What can you tell me about the teachings of the Mormons?"</i><br><br><i>"Well," said Dr. White, "I know very little concerning them. They have an unsavory reputation, they practice polygamy, and are very superstitious."</i><br><br><i>Then Count Leo Tolstoi, in his honest and stern, but lovable manner, rebuked the ambassador. "Dr. White, I am greatly surprised and disappointed that a man of your great learning and position should be so ignorant on this important subject. The Mormon people teach the American religion; their principles teach the people not only of Heaven and its attendant glories, but how to live so that their social and economic relations with each other are placed on a sound basis. If the people follow the teachings of this Church, nothing can stop their progress--it will be limitless. There have been great movements started in the past but they have died or been modified before they reached maturity. If Mormonism is able to endure, unmodified, until it reaches the third and fourth generations, it is destined to become the greatest power the world has ever known."</i>[LeGrand Richards,<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</i>rev. ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 435–36; emphasis in original]<br><br>Dr. Harold Bloom, a distinguished professor of humanities at Yale University, published his book<i>The American Religion</i>in 1992. He included several chapters dealing with the work of Joseph Smith. I do<i>not</i>agree with many of his statements, but I certainly agree with several that laud the Prophet. Bloom wrote:<br><br><i>Whatever his lapses, Smith was an authentic religious genius, unique in our national history.</i>[<i>The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1992), p. 82]<br><br><i>I also do not find it possible to doubt that Joseph Smith was an authentic prophet. Where in all of American history can we find his match? ... In proportion to his importance and his complexity,</i>[Joseph Smith] remains the least-studied personage, of an undiminished vitality, in our entire national saga. [p. 95; emphasis added]<br><br><i>If there is already in place any authentic version of the American Religion then, as Tolstoy surmised, it must be Mormonism, whose future as yet may prove decisive for the nation, and for more than this nation alone.</i>[p. 97]<br><br>There are other bright individuals who are recognizing the Prophet for good. Heikki Raisanen, a Finnish theologian, commented on the Prophet's work and pointed out that "Joseph's teachings provide solutions for most, if not all, of the genuine problems and contradictions of the Bible with which scholars have wrestled for generations" (quoted in Edwin O. Haroldsen, "Good and Evil Spoken Of," unpublished article).<br><br>I share the positive enthusiasm of President Brigham Young, who said:<br><br><i>I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained, and to whom He gave keys and power to build up the kingdom of God on earth and sustain it.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:51]<br><br>I have tried to remember when I first came to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I searched my memory and finally concluded that I can't recall when I didn't know that he was a prophet. This knowledge seems to have always been a part of me. My testimony of the Prophet is one of my most valuable possessions, for which I will be eternally grateful. Over the years I have read many accounts of apostates and anti-Mormons who have written negative things about him. Still the deep conviction continues to grow within me that Joseph Smith in very deed was a prophet of the Lord.<br><br>I resonate to so much of what President John Taylor wrote about the Prophet Joseph Smith. Elder Taylor possessed great intellect and an unusual command of the English language. He also had extensive personal contact with the Prophet. He wrote:<br><br><i>I testify that I was acquainted with Joseph Smith for years. I have traveled with him; I have been with him in private and in public; I have associated with him in councils of all kinds; I have listened hundreds of times to his public teachings, and his advice to his friends and associates of a more private nature. I have been at his house and seen his deportment in his family. I have seen him arraigned before the tribunals of his country, and have seen him honorably acquitted, and delivered from the pernicious breath of slander, and the machinations and falsehoods of wicked and corrupt men. I was with him living, and with him when he died, when he was murdered in Carthage jail by a ruthless mob ... with their faces painted. I was there and was myself wounded; I at that time received four balls in my body. I have seen him, then, under these various circumstances, and I testify before God, angels, and men, that he was a good, honorable, virtuous man--that his doctrines were good, scriptural, and wholesome--that his precepts were such as became a man of God--that his private and public character was unimpeachable--and that he lived and died as a man of God and a gentleman. This is my testimony.</i>[John Taylor,<i>The Gospel Kingdom,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1943), p. 355]<br><br>John Taylor also said about Joseph Smith: "God chose this young man. ... I have never met a man so intelligent as he was" (<i>JD</i>21:163). About the truths that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, President Taylor wrote one of my favorite quotations. (Incidentally, I usually like to have a dictionary close at hand when I read his writings.) Here is the quote:<br><br><i>Truth</i>[these powerful ideas that will not let us go]<i>will stand proud and erect, unsullied and uncontaminated by the pestiferous breath of calumniating mortals, and no power can stay its progress.</i>[<i>The Gospel Kingdom,</i>p. 356]<br><br>And so it is that we can sing with real feeling "We thank thee for sending the gospel<i>to lighten our minds with its rays."</i>Thank heaven for a rational theology that enlightens and lifts us. As missionaries, how grateful we should be for the privilege of teaching these life-shaping truths to all who will listen. Our message is powerful and unique. There is nothing comparable to it in all of traditional Christianity.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is growing rapidly throughout the world, including countries behind the former Iron Curtain. Whoever would have dreamed that we would live long enough to see the day! If the predictions of non-Latter-day Saint Dr. Rodney Stark are correct and the Church's growth trends continue, there will be 265 million members of the Church by the year 2080 (see "Modernization and Mormon Growth: The Secularization Thesis Revisited," in<i>Contemporary Mormonism: Social Science Perspectives,</i>eds. Marie Cornwall, Tim B. Heaton, and Lawrence A. Young [Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois, 1994], p. 13).<br><br>Of the Church, Dr. Stark said, "We are observing an extraordinarily rare event. After a hiatus [or break] of fourteen hundred years, in our time a new world faith seems to be stirring" (Rodney Stark, "Modernization," p. 22; see also "The Rise of a New World Faith,"<i>Review of Religious Research</i>26, no. 1 [September 1984]: 18–27).<br><br>I believe that even though our numbers are relatively few, the prediction of Count Leo Tolstoi will be realized completely: the Church will literally become the greatest power the world has ever known. With or without you and me, it will go forth. But it will go forth a lot better with us than without us!<br><br>Now what does this mean for all of us? Here are a few suggestions.<br><br>1. We should study more about the Prophet and the truths and ideas he was inspired to share with us because no one has yet plumbed the depths of what could be learned about his life or teachings. We should commit ourselves to thoughtful study and consideration.<br><br>2. We should prepare ourselves to be the knowledgeable missionaries we are expected to be, either full-time or informally, throughout our entire lives.<br><br>3. And, of great importance, we should accept the challenge presented by President Stephen L Richards:<br><br><i>If any man has received in his heart the witness of the divine truth embraced in the contributions of the Prophet Joseph, I charge him to be true,--true to his testimony, true to the Prophet, the founder, true to the cause and its duly commissioned leaders, true to the covenants he has made in holy places, and true to the brotherhood of man in the service that he renders. If any man has not received this witness, I appeal for his thoughtful, prayerful, sympathetic consideration.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1936, p. 33; also<i>Contributions of Joseph Smith,</i>p. 9]<br><br>President Richards offered promises to those who would receive and apply the teachings of Joseph Smith. I believe them with all my heart. I have taken the liberty of adapting them to you personally:<br><br><i>1. You will be made happy.</i><br><br><i>2. Doubt and uncertainty will leave you.</i><br><br><i>3. Glorious purpose will come into your life.</i><br><br><i>4. Your family ties will be sweeter.</i><br><br><i>5. Your friendships will be dearer.</i><br><br><i>6. Your service will be nobler.</i><br><br><i>7. The peace of Christ will be your portion.</i><br><br>[Adapted from<i>CR,</i>October 1936, p. 33; also<i>Contributions of Joseph Smith,</i>p. 9]<br><br>Our life-shaping missions have given us an opportunity to teach these powerful ideas and truths that can help us say with enthusiasm along with Elder LeGrand Richards--even if we live to be 96 years of age--that we, the<i>real</i>we, are all right! We have taught truths that once learned "will not let people go"--ideas that change individuals for the better forever.<br><br>As we read in scripture, may we realize that indeed "Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3).<br><br>Joseph Smith was truly a prophet and witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we know great truths about our Father in Heaven and his great plan of happiness that bring supernal meaning into our lives forever. And so this morning I testify with all my heart that Joseph Smith was a prophet; that our Heavenly Father lives, he loves us, and he knows every one of us by name; and that Jesus is the Christ. I have never known that more surely than today. I know that this is his church and that it is led by a living prophet of God, our president and prophet Gordon B. Hinckley. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Joe J.

<h1>e &quot;Devil’s Throat:&quot; We Believe in You! - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, I speak to you as one who stands on the edge of eternity. From that perspective, I see you as the choicest spirits ever placed on the earth. The promises in your generation's patriarchal blessings, if you are faithful, seem to exceed the promises in Sister Faust's blessing and in mine. You know better than I the challenges of living in the world today. The "Teenagers' Bill of Rights" declares: "Please support us by believing in us rather than fearing for us" (Lia Gay, Jamie Yellin, and others, in Jack Canfield,<i>Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul: 101 Stories of Life, Love and Learning</i>[Deerfield Beach, Florida: Health Communications, 1997], p. 307). I want you to know that I believe in you. I believe you can be in the world but not of the world.<br><h2>The Devil's Throat</h2><br>In the world there are many things of value to discover and much more to live for and hope for; however, as you move forward, you should be careful not to get too close to the Devil's Throat. As a young man I served a mission to Brazil. It was a marvelous experience. I have returned many times since then in my Church assignments. One of the wonders of the world in that great country is Iguaçu Falls. In the flood season, the volume of water spilling over the brink is the largest in the world. Every few minutes, millions of gallons of water cascade into the chasm below. One part of the falls, where the deluge is the heaviest, is called the Devil's Throat. Large rocks are situated just before the water rushes down into the Devil's Throat. Some of the braver Brazilians used to take passengers in canoes to stand on those rocks and look down into the Devil's Throat. The water above the falls is usually calm and slow-moving and the atmosphere tranquil. Except for the roar of the water below, there was no way to anticipate the danger that lay just a few feet beyond. A sudden, unexpected current could have taken the canoe into the rushing waters, over the cliff, and down into the Devil's Throat. While standing on a rock, a loss of footing or vertigo would have the same effect.<br><br>Spiritually, a Devil's Throat is concealed beneath the deceptively calm tranquility of our lives and the world in which we live. Each of you has to have the strength and integrity not to get too close to the Devil's Throat. Bravado in the face of certain death, physical or spiritual, is foolhardy.<br><br>At this time in your lives you sometimes challenge things, such as parents' authority, society, values, religion. When I was a lawyer I had a client who was a very successful contractor. But he challenged things. For instance, he argued that the earth is flat. I really think he knew it is round, but he would challenge it. By that time in my life I had traveled around the world. In World War II, I was assigned over a period of time to go west from San Francisco to Cairo and West Africa, and later to Brazil, and then home. But I knew the earth was round before I circled the globe.<br><br>You will do well not to challenge some things in life. This is particularly so with the commandments of God. I am very grateful for the principle of repentance, for we all make mistakes. But it is far better to make the right choice in the first place. This can be applied to marriage. Too many marriages fail, but it really is much better to get it right the first time. Recently Sister Marjorie Hinckley spoke on the subject of marriage to a large audience in Houston, Texas. Recalling the early days of her marriage to President Hinckley, she said, "Early on I realized it would be better if we worked harder to get used to each other than constantly try to change each other" ("President, Sister Hinckley Share Counsel," in<i>Church News,</i>26 September 1998, p. 4).<br><br>The song in<i>The Sound of Music</i>says, "Let's start at the very beginning." If we are to understand the purpose of our lives, the beginning is indeed a very good place to start. Each of you is a son or daughter of God. We are created in His image and likeness. What does that do for us? It raises us up so we can live above the ugly and sordid things all around us. It does not mean that temptation is eliminated, but rather that the Lord gives us strength to overcome all things. This is one of the reasons why we believe in you.<br><h2><b>I. You Can Be Honest</b></h2><br>We believe in you because we know you can be honest. Recently, a local television channel ran the story of a 10-year-old boy named Josh Bowers from West Jordan, Utah. He found a wallet that had $530 in it. Josh didn't hesitate. He picked it up and took it to his mother. The wallet belonged to a mother of four, and the $530 was rent money she couldn't live without.<br><br>Josh had some compelling reasons to keep the money. His father had recently been disabled on the job, so his family is living on Social Security. Then there were all the things Josh could have bought with the money. What he really wanted, as he said, was a new bike. But he knew the money was not his and that someone needed that money. The relieved young mother gave Josh $40 for returning the wallet and the money. Josh planned to use some of the money to get his old bike tire fixed. But a viewer, on hearing the story, had Josh pick out a brand-new bike "to reward him for being an honest guy." Interestingly, the donor of the bike wanted to remain anonymous, but he said: "Josh set an example that everybody should follow, and he looks happy" ("Honest Boy Returns Lost Wallet and Money," KUTV, 8 and 10 September 1998, 10:00 p.m.).<br><br>We may not all get a shiny new bicycle as a reward for our honesty, but a feeling of goodness will shine within us for doing what we know is honest and true. Ultimately, we will receive an eternal reward.<br><h2><b>II. We Recognize Your Potential</b></h2><br>We believe in you because we recognize your strength and capacity. As a boy working on a farm, I learned that all kinds of devices can give you power to do things you cannot accomplish with your own strength. In those days we had to move big boulders by hand. We would get a long pole and put the strong end of the pole under the rock we wanted to move. Then, resting the pole on a smaller rock close by the big rock, we would pull down on the small end of the pole, which would cause the big rock to move. The longer the pole, the more leverage and the easier it was to move the big rock.<br><br>We have progressed from poles to power machinery. Today you have computers with the Internet and e-mail to increase and expand your capacity. But you will need to gain certain skills to keep up with modern technology. For example, when I was in college we wrote papers by hand, but now they are expected to be typed, usually on a computer. Computers even have a spellchecker! With the development of power machinery, the rise in technology, and better health habits, the world is getting more competitive. A few years ago an ACT score in the twenties could secure a scholarship, but now a score in the thirties is required. Similarly, a 3.5 GPA used to be worth an academic scholarship, but a higher GPA is needed today. Records in sports are now higher; this pushes achievement levels higher in that area as well.<br><br>So to achieve your potential, you will not only have to work<i>hard,</i>but you will also have to work<i>smart</i>to employ all the leverage you can. As I visit our universities from time to time, I am impressed by our young people who are working early and late at menial jobs to help them stay in school. An education will give you great leverage, which is why you must get all of the education you can.<br><br>The greatest leverage for good, however, is on the spiritual level. This will come as you use your spiritual gifts to enhance your natural gifts and abilities. This spiritual leverage can be diminished or even destroyed if you get too close to the Devil's Throat. For example, I warn you against the dangers that lurk in the Internet, movies, and books which lead away from your destiny. Daily study of the scriptures is an excellent way to keep your spirituality safe from the Devil's Throat.<br><h2><b>III. People Are Noticing Your Integrity</b></h2><br>We believe in you because of your integrity. We not only know of your integrity, but people around the world are taking notice. A businesswoman based in Salt Lake City called a company in Virginia. After completing the business transaction, the owner asked her where she was from. On learning that it was Utah, he said, "What part of Utah?" I quote her account of what happened next:<br><br><i>"Salt Lake City," I responded.</i><br><br><i>"Salt Lake City? Well, you must be a Mormon," he stated matter-of-factly.</i><br><br><i>"Yes, I am," I said.</i><br><br><i>"I have two girls who work for me who are Mormons," he continued. "They're the best employees I've ever had. Those two girls are only seniors in high school, but they keep my store cleaner than any of my other employees, and they treat my customers great. They're really polite and pretty ... you know, the 'all-American' type."</i><br><br><i>He said, "Those two girls are amazing. Would you believe that they get up at 5:00 a.m. every morning and ..."</i><br><br><i>"Go to seminary!" I inserted.</i><br><br><i>"Well, I don't know what it's called," he continued. "But it's some type of religious training. Then they go to school all day, and come work for me until 8:00 p.m. I don't know how they do all of the things they do, but I'm sure impressed."</i><br><br><i>"Would you believe that Mormon youth all over the world are going to early-morning seminary, five days a week?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"Well, that's one thing I have to say for your church," he said. "You're sure raising your children right. They're the best."</i>[Annette Larsen Proulx, <a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1998/07/im-impressed?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"I'm Impressed,"</span></a><i>New Era,</i>July 1998, p. 49]<br><br>And you are the best. That is why we believe in you! As President Gordon B. Hinckley frequently says: "It all comes down to personal integrity." Integrity is the value we set on ourselves. It is the fulfillment of the duty we owe ourselves. Complete and constant integrity is a great law of human conduct. Self-respect and dignity as sons and daughters of God should both advance your gifts and talents and act as a restraining influence.<br><br>Honorable men and women will personally commit to certain self-imposed expectations. They need no outside check or control. They are honorable in their inner core. Integrity is the light that shines from a disciplined conscience. It is the strength of duty within us. Moses gave the following counsel: "If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth" (Numbers 30:2).<br><br>Last year I read the account of a young man by the name of Logan Johnson. He was delivering pizza in North Dallas, Texas, when he<br><br><i>spotted a car rolling into a pond. He ran to the water and plunged in. Johnson pulled open a rear door. As the car sank, he dragged the driver--the Rev. John Kershaw, 65, who had lost consciousness while driving--over the back seat and to the shore.</i><br><br><i>At that point, Logan Johnson's own life was floundering. He had dropped out of high school, had family troubles and had been put on antidepressants. But saving a life gave Johnson a new outlook on his own life. He returned to school, enrolled in the Marine Reserves and now plans to go to college.</i><br><br><i>"You can't explain how it feels to save someone's life," Johnson said. "I value my friends, family, school, everything, a lot more than I did."</i>[Lyric Wallwork Winik, "I Just Reacted--I Don't Know How,"<i>Parade Magazine,</i>2 June 1996, p. 6]<br><br>The article points out that many such rescuers say they felt a strong moral conviction to help. That is something that comes from within, that spark of divinity that begins with the light of Christ and develops day by day and deed by deed into qualities of character based on the absolutes in life. Some things should never be done; some lines should never be crossed; vows should never be broken; some words should never be spoken; some thoughts should never be entertained. Membership in the Church requires that we measure up to certain standards. It isn't easy. It demands much of us.<br><h2><b>IV. You Choose Morality</b></h2><br>We believe in you because you choose to be chaste. The Lord gave us our bodies and along with them our passions. He does not expect us to stifle our passions, but rather to bridle them (see Alma 38:12), which means to channel them so that they can be used for the purposes He intended. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland stated in the October 1998 general conference:<br><br><i>Human intimacy is reserved for a married couple because it is the ultimate symbol of total union....</i><br><br><i>... If you persist in pursuing physical satisfaction without the sanction of heaven, you run the terrible risk of such spiritual, psychic damage that you may undermine</i>both<i>your longing for physical intimacy</i>and<i>your ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later, truer love.</i>["Personal Purity,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, pp. 76–77; emphasis in original]<br><br>Again, let me reassure you, we do believe in you. If you make up your mind well in advance you can avoid the moral pitfalls that may occur when you are not expecting them.<br><br><i>Lisa, a high school sophomore, tells about the time the quarterback of the football team asked her to the homecoming dance.</i><br><br><i>"I couldn't believe my luck," she said. "One of the most high-profile guys in the school had asked me to the most prestigious dance of the year."</i><br><br><i>Her enthusiasm dampened, though, when after the dance her date started driving down a lonely road she realized led to Lover's Lane. Quarterback or no quarterback, she had decided long ago that "parking" was something she would not do.</i><br><br><i>To avoid embarrassment, she began talking about how this particular road reminded her of a friend's experience. The police had caught her friend and a date parking up there, and had taken them to the police station.</i><br><br><i>"Of course, anyone who is silly enough to park deserves what they get," she laughed. Without speaking, her date turned the car around, and a few minutes later they were sitting in her living room eating pie with her parents.</i>[JeaNette Goates Smith, <a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1993/06/dating-give-me-a-brake?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Dating: Give Me a Brake,"</span></a><i>New Era,</i>June 1993, p. 10]<br><br>It is so important to make decisions early about correct dating habits so that you can say, "I don't know who I'll marry yet, but I certainly know where" (Jody Hazelbaker, <a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1997/08/bride-in-the-mirror?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Bride in the Mirror,"</span></a><i>New Era,</i>August 1997, p. 49).<br><br>It is also important to keep our minds clean and pure. While Elder Dallin H. Oaks was serving as president of Brigham Young University, he gave some excellent counsel regarding what we take into our minds:<br><br><i>We are surrounded by the promotional literature of illicit sexual relations, on the printed page and on the screen. For your own good, avoid it. Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food. With a few fatal exceptions bad food will only make you sick but do no permanent harm. In contrast, a person who feasts upon filthy stories or pornographic or erotic pictures and literature records them in this marvelous retrieval system we call a brain. The brain won't vomit back filth. Once recorded, it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1974/02/tts-things-theyre-saying?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Things They're Saying,"</span></a><i>New Era,</i>February 1974, p. 18]<br><br>King Benjamin gave a powerful warning to the people of his day:<br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.</i>[Mosiah 4:30]<br><br>I was in Weiser, Idaho, for a regional conference recently. While there I learned that young people in that area are memorizing the proclamation on the family issued by the First Presidency.<br><h2><b>V. Accountability Is Fundamental</b></h2><br>Another important fundamental is accountability, as President Hinckley stated in his interview on<i>Larry King Live:</i>"Let me say that I still believe that right is right, and wrong is wrong. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. These aren't suggestions, these are commandments" (CNN transcript).<br><br>It then follows that we are accountable for what we do--first to ourselves, then to our parents, and, most important, to God. We all carry a trust. We must ask ourselves, "What is success?" Is it achievement? Is it fame? Is it position? Is it dominion? The prophet Micah defined it very simply: "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (Micah 6:8).<br><br>You may ask, "Is it worth the struggle and the challenge to live gospel principles?" So much around us is wrong and wicked that some of you might say: "It's too hard. Why try? We can't make it." Sister Sheri L. Dew, second counselor in the general Relief Society, told us in the recent general Relief Society meeting about encountering this attitude in a meeting<br><br><i>where the speaker seemed preoccupied with how</i>hard<i>it is to live the gospel. By the end of the meeting, I was</i>[weary].<i>He had made living the gospel seem like a sentence to life on the rock pile. It's not living the gospel that's hard. It's</i>life<i>that's hard.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/11/we-are-not-alone?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"We Are Not Alone,"</span></a><i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, p. 94; emphasis in original]<br><br>I am optimistic for you. Life presents great challenges and difficulties, but now is the most exciting time in the history of the world in which to live. There are greater opportunities to build the kingdom of God than ever before. There are more places to serve missions than ever before. You really can't visualize the great blessings that await you. They are wonderful and exciting. Each of us is endowed with unique gifts, talents, and attributes. You can make a difference. You must make a difference. You are, as the Savior said, the light of the world.<br><br>We all face furious winds of evil and tides of the sordid not unlike the situation faced by the Jaredites as they traveled to the promised land. They were tossed upon the waves of the sea and "many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind" (Ether 6:6). But they were protected because "when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish" (Ether 6:7). In our time there are vessels that protect against these terrible spiritual tempests, and they are our temples, homes, quorums, wards, and stakes.<br><h2><b>VI. You Are Children of Great Promise</b></h2><br>In closing I want to again emphasize that you are children of great promise. You have received the covenants of the Lord with His people. Be careful not to get too close to the Devil's Throat. He would like to devour you. You must use the leverage of both technology and of the Spirit of God to reach your potential. You must strive diligently to do this. We want to support you by believing in you rather than fearing for you. Though you may have ordinary ability and intelligence, by perseverance and hard work you can find happiness beyond your dreams and expectations. This will come about as you keep the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>I wish to invoke a blessing upon each of you. I pray that the Lord will watch over you and keep you safe. I pray that the Lord will strengthen you in heart and soul to go forward in faith and courage. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E. Faust was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 1 November 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Converts Without Baptism - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish to speak about a unique and inspiring chapter in Church history. It took place in recent years among the beautiful people of Africa. Too often we have misconceptions about Africa and its people. Africa is referred to as the Dark Continent, and the media usually portrays Africans as primitive, starving, or at war with each other. One African official observed that the darkest thing about Africa is America's ignorance of it (see James H. Robinson, in<i>African American Quotations,</i>ed. Richard Newman [Phoenix, Arizona: Oryx Press, 1998], p. 18). When I was in Africa several years ago, I was sent the following quote: "In Africa there are tribes that beat the ground with clubs while uttering spine-chilling cries. Anthropologists call this a primitive form of self-expression. In America we do the same thing--but we call it golf!"<br><br>There is much we can learn from our African brothers and sisters, who are among the great pioneers in this church. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "The days of pioneering in the Church are still with us; they did not end with covered wagons and handcarts" (in "Many Are Still Blazing Gospel Trails,"<i>Church News,</i>24 July 1993, p. 6). Pioneers are those individuals who help establish the Church all over the world.<br><br>The pioneers that I will focus on this morning had little help from the Church, because they were not members and the Church knew very little about them. I seek your faith and prayers that we might be edified by their example and by the assurance of God's love for all of his children.<br><br>In 1853, nine years after the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith, missionaries were sent to Africa for the first time, but they only proselyted among the white people of South Africa. It was not until 125 years later, following the revelation on the priesthood in 1978, that the gospel was preached to<i>all</i>people of Africa.<br><br>However, 30 years before the revelation, Church leaders became aware of other Africans who were interested in the Church. By the 1950s, many letters were sent to Church headquarters from the West African nations of Nigeria and Ghana requesting literature and membership in the Church. The letters were written by devout Christians who had gained a testimony from the Book of Mormon or other Church literature.<br><br>What began as a comparative trickle of requests in the early 1950s became a flood by the 1960s. More letters requesting literature were received from Nigeria and Ghana than from all the rest of the world combined (from Edwin Q. Cannon, Jr., interview with Gordon Irving, 10 January 1980, Salt Lake City, Church Historical Department). The Church responded by sending literature, but the demand for Church literature was so great that some Africans even established LDS bookstores. However, since there were no priesthood holders to preside and provide priesthood ordinances, those asking for baptism were told, "The time is not yet. You must wait."<br><br>As they waited, they shared their knowledge and testimony of the gospel with others and organized congregations. It was reported that in the 1960s there were more than 60 congregations in Nigeria and Ghana, with more than 16,000 participants--none of whom were baptized (from interview with LaMar Williams by E. Dale LeBaron in Salt Lake City on 12 February 1988).<sup>1</sup><br><br>This was a paradoxical situation for the Church. With an army of missionaries eager to go to the ends of the earth to teach and baptize, there were thousands in Africa pleading to join the Church whom we were not able to baptize. As far as is known, nothing like this had occurred in this or in any other dispensation.<br><br>In 1960 President David O. McKay assigned South Africa mission president Glen G. Fisher to be the first Church representative to visit some of these unbaptized converts. He met with several groups in Nigeria, one of which had more than 5,600 participants in many congregations. President Fisher told the First Presidency that he received a royal welcome; they had been preparing themselves and their congregations for baptism for years. Their continued plea was, "We want the true church" (in<i>Glen G. Fisher: A Man to Match the Mountains,</i>ed. E. Dale LeBaron [Edmonton: Fisher House, 1992], pp. 147–48). President Fisher was also impressed with their sincerity. Even though they were extremely poor, they never mentioned financial help.<br><br>The intensity of their pleadings continued to increase, as reflected in this letter to President David O. McKay from a pastor in Nigeria who had made previous requests for baptism. He wrote:<br><br><i>I have to say that my heart will not rest . . . until I achieve my objective to be a baptized member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, . . . and to be fully instructed in the gospel as restored</i>[through the]<i>Prophet, Joseph Smith . . . , in order to be able to preach the true gospel to my people and win for my Savior hearts that should otherwise perish in the darkness.</i>[Letter of 29 July 1961, on file in the Church Historian's Library; also in Williams interview]<br><br>Such letters received President McKay's attention and concern not only because of their fervent plea but also because of their letterhead, which read, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nigeria Branch." The prophet did not know that there were "branches" of the Church in Nigeria.<br><br>In 1961 President McKay assigned LaMar Williams, secretary to the Church Missionary Department, to go to Nigeria on a month-long fact-finding mission to determine if the people were sincere and willing to accept the Church without holding the priesthood (Williams interview, pp. 10–11). Although Brother Williams had been responding to the flood of letters from Africa, he was not prepared for what he found there. He was met at the airport in Lagos, Nigeria, by 10 pastors with whom he had been corresponding. He, too, was treated like royalty but was surprised to discover that not only did each pastor operate independently, they had not even been aware of each other (Williams interview, pp. 11–12).<br><br>The first official Church meeting in black Africa was held on October 22, 1961, in a small mud hut in Opobo District, Nigeria, where Brother Williams met with a pastor and 110 followers. No one came by car. Many, including eight mothers with small children, had begun their day before 4:00 a.m. and walked 25 miles or more to be there. After teaching them for two hours, Brother Williams prepared to end the meeting. He recorded:<br><br><i>It was hot as blazes. . . . My suit was wringing wet. . . . When I turned the meeting back to</i>[the pastor],<i>I heard a murmur all through the congregation . . . and</i>[the pastor]<i>said to me, "They don't want to go home. They have something to say."</i><br><br><i>Then for three hours . . . these people were standing up bearing testimony to the truthfulness of the Church and how they believed in the prophets. I could not believe what I was hearing.</i>[Williams interview, pp. 10–12]<br><br>One elderly gentleman said:<br><br><i>I keep hearing you say, "if we are sincere." Elder Williams, I want you to know that I am sincere. I am an old man . . . I am sick. But when I heard you were going to be here, I walked 16 miles this morning to see you and to hear what you have to say. I still have to walk 16 miles to get back home, and I am not well. I want you to know that I am sincere or I would not be here. I have not seen President McKay. I have not seen God. But I have seen you. And I will hold you personally accountable to tell President McKay that I am sincere.</i>[Letter on file]<br><br>Brother Williams reported to President McKay that he felt thousands were ready for baptism (Williams interview, pp. 25–27).<br><br>Three months later, President McKay called Brother and Sister Williams to preside over the first mission in black Africa, but the Nigerian government refused to issue the necessary visas. This was primarily due to media attacks against the Church because of its position in denying blacks the priesthood, and at this time civil rights was an explosive issue. After four years of intense effort, one day Brother Williams was at the embassy in Nigeria hoping to finally obtain the visas. While there he received a telegram from the First Presidency stating, "Discontinue negotiations in Nigeria and return home immediately." Shocked and confused, but obedient, he returned home (Williams interview, pp. 4, 22–24; also Williams journal, "Nigerian Mission," Church Historical Library, p. 64.4).<br><br>Upon his return to Salt Lake City in November 1965, President N. Eldon Tanner assured Brother Williams that the Church would yet go to Nigeria, and they would both live to see it (see Williams journal, p. 64.1). He further said, "We don't know why we called you back. We only know it was urgent. There is a reason, and we will know [what it is someday]" (Williams journal, p. 64.4; also in Williams interview, pp. 4, 22–24).<br><br>Within three weeks Africa's most devastating civil war, the Biafran War, exploded in Nigeria, with much of the fighting in the area where the unbaptized congregations of believers were located (see<i>Encyclopedia of Africa South of the Sahara,</i>John Middleton, editor in chief [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1997], 4:357). Two ambassadors were killed on the steps of the embassy where Brother Williams received the telegram instructing him to return home. Brother and Sister Williams were released from their mission call, and in June 1966 LaMar Williams turned over 15,000 names and addresses of unbaptized African converts to Elders Spencer W. Kimball and Gordon B. Hinckley, both of whom were on the Church Missionary Committee (Williams interview, pp. 7, 20–21, 35).<br><br>It is important to note that the Church made every effort to establish itself in West Africa but was prevented from doing so. However, the Lord has promised that his eternal blessings will come "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). The Lord's "own time" for black Africa came in June 1978. "His own way" was a revelation given to his prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, making all gospel blessings available to all worthy members. The Lord's "own will" regarding the priesthood restriction and the removal of it has been stated by prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>In 1949 the First Presidency stated that the priesthood restriction was "not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord" (statement of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 17 August 1949; copy on file in Church Archives). Twenty years later, Presidents Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner said:<br><br><i>From the beginning of this dispensation, Joseph Smith and all succeeding presidents of the Church have taught that</i>[blacks]<i>were not to receive the priesthood for reasons which we believe are known to God, but which He has not made fully known to man.</i>[Statement of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 15 December 1969; copy on file in Church Archives]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball--whose clarion call during his ministry was to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people--was particularly aware of many under priesthood restriction throughout the world, and he pleaded long and earnestly with the Lord in their behalf (see D&amp;amp;C Official Declaration--2). Also, in numerous temple meetings, President Kimball met with his counselors and the Twelve to discuss this issue. In such a meeting on June 1, 1978, President Kimball asked his Brethren to express their feelings regarding this matter. Elder David B. Haight recalled that as each one spoke, there was "an outpouring of the Spirit which bonded our souls together in perfect unity" (in Lucile C. Tate,<i>David B. Haight: The Life Story of a Disciple</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987], pp. 279–80). Then President Kimball suggested that they have prayer at the altar. President Gordon B. Hinckley recalled:<br><br><i>There was a hallowed and sanctified atmosphere in the room. For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren. . . .</i><br><br><i>Every man in that circle, by the power of the Holy Ghost, knew the same thing. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Not one of us . . . was ever quite the same after that. Nor has the Church been quite the same. . . .</i><br><br><i>Tremendous, eternal consequences for millions over the earth are flowing from that manifestation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This has opened great areas of the world to the teaching of the everlasting gospel. . . .</i><br><br><i>We have cause to rejoice . . . that we have seen this glorious day.</i>["Speaking Today: Priesthood Restoration,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1988, pp. 70–71]<br><br>One tender moment of rejoicing was shared by David M. Kennedy, who had served for years as President Kimball's special ambassador in helping the Church enter new countries. Previous to the revelation, as they would study a large map of the world, Brother Kennedy would place one hand over the continent of Africa, saying, "We can't go there unless they have the priesthood." On June 8, 1978, a subdued President Kimball returned from the temple prior to announcing to the world the revelation that had been received. He stopped at Brother Kennedy's office, opened the door, and, with deep emotion, said, "David, now you can take your hand off Africa" (David M. Kennedy, lecture to Religious Education faculty, BYU, 2 October 1992; see also Martin Berkeley Hickman,<i>David Matthew Kennedy: Banker, Statesman, Churchman</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987], pp. 343–44).<br><br>How important was this revelation? It has been said that "the greatest events of history are those which affect the largest numbers for the longest periods" ("The First Presidency Easter Message,"<i>Church News,</i>26 March 1994, p. 1). By this criteria, when we consider those affected by this revelation--which includes millions on the earth and billions on the other side of the veil--we can see why President Kimball said that it brought "one of the greatest changes and blessings that has ever been known" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 451). Floodgates were now open for the gospel to go to Africa and to African ancestors (see Bruce R. McConkie, "All Are Alike unto God," CES Symposium, BYU, 18 August 1978).<br><br>When this revelation was announced, my wife and I were presiding over the only mission on the continent of Africa. The announcement brought feelings and stirrings impossible to describe. As inspiring as it was, I felt a great concern because Africans do not traditionally keep written histories, and I felt their unique experiences needed to be preserved. The desire to help preserve that history was later realized. Since coming to BYU I have been blessed by the Lord and helped by others in obtaining oral histories from more than 600 African pioneers, from which I will now share some insights.<br><br>The unbaptized converts in Africa were guided and strengthened by the Lord according to their faith in him. The Lord used two types of disciples to help accomplish this.<br><br>First, the Lord guided many LDS expatriates from North America to Africa on professional assignments, many of whom provided much-needed support and encouragement for these pioneers. Elder Alexander B. Morrison of the First Quorum of the Seventy said in general conference:<br><br><i>In every corner of Africa, there are faithful expatriate members of the Church. . . .</i><br><br><i>I testify they are not there by chance. As part of God's great and grand design for growth, they have been placed on the frontiers of the Church by divine providence. . . . They are the right people at the right place and at the right time in history.</i>["The Dawning of a New Day in Africa,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 26]<br><br>Two expatriates who were especially praised and remembered by the African pioneers in West Africa were Professor Virginia Cutler (former BYU dean of the College of Family Living) and President Merrill J. Bateman. President Bateman worked in West Africa for 15 years, then, following the revelation on the priesthood, the First Presidency assigned him to escort Brother Ted Cannon, counselor in the Church International Mission, to prepare the people of Nigeria and Ghana for the arrival of the first missionaries.<br><br>Second, the Lord raised up Eliases to prepare people for the gospel so the infant church could grow quickly and withstand Satan's fury. John the Baptist was the Elias who prepared people at the Savior's time. In this dispensation the Lord raised up various Eliases. For example, Sidney Rigdon, a Campbellite preacher in Ohio, prepared many for the gospel, including future counselors in the First Presidency, apostles, and presiding bishops. To Sidney Rigdon the Lord said, "Thou was sent forth, even as John, to prepare the way before me . . . , and thou knewest it not" (D&amp;amp;C 35:4). In black Africa, where the revelation on the priesthood was, in effect, the restoration of the gospel for them, a loving Heavenly Father raised up many Eliases. Let me share some examples.<br><br>The first missionaries sent to Africa were Rendell and Rachel Mabey and Ted and Janath Cannon. They arrived in Nigeria just five months after the revelation. Their first baptism was an Elias named Anthony Obinna, who had waited and pleaded for membership for 13 years. In 1965 he had a dream that he did not understand but that impressed him deeply. He said:<br><br><i>One night I was sleeping and a tall man came to me . . . and took me to one of the most beautiful buildings and showed me all the rooms. At the end he showed himself in the crucified form. Then in 1970 I found</i>[a] Reader's Digest<i>article titled "The March of the Mormons," with a picture of the Salt Lake Temple. It was exactly the same building that I had seen in my dreams.</i>[Interview with Anthony Obinna in Mbaise, Nigeria, 4 June 1988]<br><br>Immediately Brother Obinna wrote to Church headquarters requesting literature and baptism. He received literature, organized a congregation, and continued writing letters requesting baptism. Finally, after years of pleading, he wrote directly to the Council of Twelve, saying, "Your long silence about the establishment of the Church in Nigeria is very embarrassing. . . . Did Christ not say, 'Go ye and teach all nations?'" (Obinna interview).<br><br>It is not often that the Brethren are chastised by a nonmember of the Church for not baptizing converts. However, when Brother Obinna learned that the revelation had been received, he wrote the following to President Kimball:<br><br><i>We are happy for the many hours in the upper room of the temple you spent supplicating the Lord to bring us into the fold. We thank our Heavenly Father for hearing your prayers and ours and by revelation</i>[confirming]<i>the long promised day . . . to receive every blessing of the gospel.</i>[Letter on file]<br><br>On the day Brother Obinna was baptized, he was ordained to the priesthood and set apart as the first black African branch president, and Sister Obinna became the first Relief Society president. Soon after his baptism Brother Obinna prophesied, "The seed of the gospel will grow into a giant tree. The Church in Nigeria will surprise the world in its growth" (letter on file). And so it has.<br><br>Growth has been a continuing and major challenge to the Church in Africa. Limiting baptisms, so membership did not outgrow leadership, was like trying to contain an explosion. The spiritual hunger of the people and the dedicated efforts of the Eliases brought such rapid growth that Presiding Bishop Victor L. Brown said to Elder Mabey, "I think you are on the frontier of one of the greatest historical events in Church history as far as growth is concerned" (in Rendell N. Mabey and Gordon T. Allred,<i>Brother to Brother</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984], p. 140).<br><br>For instance, Elder Mabey tells of traveling a great distance through a rain forest in Nigeria to find a particular congregation. They arrived on a Saturday just as people were leaving a little village church, attached to which was a sign that read, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." Elder Mabey reported:<br><br><i>The pastor was very happy and excited to see us and ran out and rang the assembly bell. All the people came back and we held a meeting. The first thing this pastor did after</i>[the meeting concluded],<i>was to stand up with tears in his eyes and thank the Lord for answering their prayers. He said, "You know, today we were assembled here on Saturday because we were breaking a twenty-four hour fast, asking the Lord to send us missionaries. . . . We've listened to you for an hour and we all believe what you tell us is true and we want to be baptized!"</i>[Rendell Mabey interview, p. 217]<br><br>In both Nigeria and Ghana the missionaries found hundreds who had testimonies of the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the restoration of the gospel. All they needed was baptism. And so they were baptized! In one 24-hour period, 149 converts were baptized (see Mabey and Allred,<i>Brother to Brother,</i>p. 143). Within one year there were more than 1,700 members in 35 branches in West Africa (see Mabey and Allred,<i>Brother to Brother,</i>p. vii).<br><br>After only nine and a half years of missionary work, Elder Neal A. Maxwell organized the Aba Nigeria Stake on May 15, 1988--the first stake in which all priesthood leaders were black--and he noted that this was "a historic day in the Church in this dispensation, and in any dispensation" (in "Nigerian Stake,"<i>Church News,</i>21 May 1988, p. 7).<br><br>As Elder Maxwell created this first black African stake, he said to those present:<br><br><i>I was present in the upper room of the temple that early June day in 1978 when all the General Authorities gathered to receive the revelation and decision from President Spencer W. Kimball. I wept with joy that day. The handkerchief I wiped my tears with I took home and told my wife not to wash it. I put it in my book of remembrance, still bearing the marks of my tears of joy.</i><br><br><i>On this Sunday, I have a second handkerchief that</i>[has]<i>wiped more tears of joy. I will take it home and place it in my book of remembrance next to the other handkerchief.</i>[In "Nigerian Stake," p. 7]<br><br>In Ghana the field was also already to harvest, due mainly to another Elias, Joseph William Billy Johnson, a preacher who obtained a Book of Mormon in 1964. He said:<br><br><i>As I read the Book of Mormon I became convinced that it was really the word of God, and sometimes while reading I would burst into tears. I felt the Spirit as I read. . . .</i><br><br><i>I have a strong testimony [of] the Book of Mormon. It is a very powerful book!</i>[Interview with Joseph William Billy Johnson by E. Dale LeBaron in Cape Coast, Ghana, 23 May 1988]<br><br>Brother Johnson also knew that the Lord called him to be an Elias. He said:<br><br><i>One early morning . . . I saw the heavens open and angels with trumpets singing songs of praise unto God. . . . In the course of this I heard my name mentioned thrice, "Johnson, Johnson, Johnson. If you will take up my work as I will command you, I will bless you and bless your land." Trembling and in tears I replied, "Lord, with thy help I will do whatsoever you will command me."</i><br><br><i>From that day onward, I was constrained by that Spirit to go from street to street . . . to deliver the message which we had read from the Book of Mormon. . . . I did exactly as the Lord commanded me . . . and immediately our persecutions started.</i>[Johnson interview; also a letter from Brother Johnson to the First Presidency, 9 September 1978, and a handwritten document on the history of the Church in Ghana. These are on file with the author. See also E. Dale LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike unto God"</i>(Orem, Utah: Granite Publishing, 1998), pp. 16–17]<br><br>Brother Johnson also reported that at a time of great trial early in his ministry, his deceased brother appeared to him in a dream and said:<br><br><i>"Don't worry. . . you have chosen the only true church on earth . . . and I am now investigating your church." I was surprised. I never knew that the Church extended to another world. It was my brother who brought that knowledge to me. He said that if I didn't believe him, he would sing a song from my church, and he sang "Come, Come, Ye Saints." That was the first time I had heard that hymn. He said, "Don't leave the church, my brother. . . . Please see that I am baptized."</i><br><br>Brother Johnson then noted:<br><br><i>It was my brother who enlightened me about baptism for the dead and brought it to my knowledge. . . . Most of my relatives appeared to me in dreams</i>[saying,]<i>"Reverend Johnson, do you know you have a work to do for us? Our great grandsons and daughters will be in your church soon. See that we are baptized." . . . I learned these doctrines before the missionaries arrived. Nothing they taught us seemed strange. They simply confirmed what we had heard. . . . Each time the Lord addressed us in dreams, He addressed us as Latter-day Saints, even though we had not yet become members.</i>[Johnson interview; see also LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike,"</i>pp. 19–20]<br><br>Brother Johnson felt very close to the prophets Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, who reportedly also appeared to him in visions and dreams to strengthen him. A son was born during these trying times, and he is probably the only young man in Ghana today named Brigham.<br><br>For 14 years Brother Johnson helped organize 10 congregations. To strengthen his people against trials and persecution, he focused on the early history of the Church. He said:<br><br><i>We felt the spirit of the pioneers. . . . We gained our strength from the pioneers. We were inspired by their works. . . . I would see tears falling from the eyes of my members, especially when we sang, "Come, Come, Ye Saints." That hymn is wonderful. It is my favorite hymn in the Church.</i>[Johnson interview; see also LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike,"</i>p. 19]<br><br>One night at midnight, after many lonely years of struggle, Brother Johnson heard a shortwave news broadcast from England in which he heard President Kimball's announcement that all worthy males could receive the priesthood. He burst into tears of joy, knowing that the Church would now come to Africa.<br><br>Following Brother Johnson's baptism he served as Ghana's first branch president, after which he served several missions. Twelve years after his baptism he was ordained a patriarch, when Elders Boyd K. Packer and James E. Faust created the first two stakes in Ghana. Last February President Hinckley announced the first temple in black Africa to be built in Accra, Ghana, where Brother Johnson first preached. Soon he and tens of thousands of others can receive temple ordinances and perform them for their kindred dead.<br><br>A wonderful sister who performed an Elias-like mission to her people in Ghana was Priscilla Sampson-Davis. She obtained a Book of Mormon in 1963, then studied, prepared, and waited for 15 years. Soon after her baptism she had a vision that she described as follows:<br><br><i>I wasn't asleep. I saw myself at a sacrament meeting and we were singing when I saw a personage in very bright apparel standing in front of the congregation. The Personage called me by name and requested that I come and stand by Him. . . . He then asked me why some were not singing with the others. I told him that they could not read English. . . . He asked me if I wouldn't like to help my sisters and brothers sing praises to our Heavenly Father. I said that I would do my best. Then the vision passed away.</i><br><br><i>Immediately I . . . started translating the hymn</i>Redeemer of Israel<i>into Fanti</i>[the major dialect in Ghana]. [From interview with Priscilla Sampson-Davis by E. Dale LeBaron in Cape Coast, Ghana, 19 May 1988; see also LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike,"</i>pp. 48–50]<br><br>Sister Sampson-Davis translated the hymns, the missionary pamphlets, and<i>Gospel Principles.</i>Then, under assignment, she translated the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price into Fanti. She said, "It was the Lord Himself who commissioned me to do the translation. . . . By translating these things, my brothers and sisters who can't understand English will be able to see and read the true gospel for themselves" (LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike,"</i>pp. 49–50).<br><br>Moses Mahlangu, yet another Elias, was a preacher from Soweto, South Africa. He found a copy of the Book of Mormon, but because the bottom of the title page was torn off, he did not know what church had published it.<br><br>As he read the book, he was filled with light and understanding. He said, "I had had desires to find God and to receive revelation, but I was never satisfied until I got the Book of Mormon." He told his fellow pastors:<br><br><i>We fight every day over what the Bible says about baptism. We fight about the name of the church. The Book of Mormon is very clear on these points. . . . People will have no need to fight if they read both the Bible and the Book of Mormon.</i>[In LeBaron,<i>"All Are Alike,"</i>p. 191]<br><br>Fluent in nine languages, Moses taught from the Book of Mormon and gathered many followers before he ever learned the name of the Church and made contact with it. Then, for more than 14 years he waited, preparing himself and others for baptism. During this time he frequently came to the mission office in Johannesburg to obtain copies of the Book of Mormon and other literature, and I was therefore privileged to know him.<br><br>Soon after the revelation was announced, I sought out Moses. As we embraced I asked him if he had heard about the revelation. He said, "Yes. Does this mean that I can now be baptized?"<br><br>I asked, "Moses, would you like to be baptized?"<br><br>His eyes welled up with tears as he said softly, "I have waited for 14 years."<br><br>I conducted a baptismal interview that I shall never forget. To every question I received the same answer: "I have been keeping that commandment for 14 years." I was deeply humbled in the presence of this great pioneer. His son, who as a boy accompanied Moses in his ministry, is now serving as Moses' bishop in the Soweto Ward, near Johannesburg.<br><br>Presidents Harold B. Lee and Gordon B. Hinckley have said that the strength of the Church is not in our numbers, our buildings, or the amount of tithes and offerings. Our strength is in the testimonies that burn in the hearts of the members (see Harold B. Lee, "Strengthen the Stakes of Zion," p. 6, and Gordon B. Hinckley, "The True Strength of the Church," p. 49; both in<i>Ensign,</i>July 1973).<br><br>It has been my privilege to hear hundreds of testimonies from African converts. I share but one. It was spoken by a nine-year-old boy in a fast and testimony meeting in Aba, Nigeria, two weeks after he was baptized. This was his message:<br><br><i>Good morning, brothers and sisters. I am happy to bear my testimony because I was baptized on conference day. Since I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, God has been guiding me both in the school and at home. Now that I am baptized, I promise to continue obeying God's commandments. I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ is true. I testify that the Prophet Ezra Taft Benson is true. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I say all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.</i>[Taped recording]<br><br>The significance of this unique chapter of Church history was summed up by Brother Jude Inmpey from Nigeria. At a social gathering with mission couples, the mission president called on him to share his feelings about the gospel coming to his people. He related a dream that he had not understood until that moment. He had dreamed that he was in a gathering where an organ was playing background music. It sounded terrible, and people were complaining. They discovered that the organist was playing only on the white keys. Brother Inmpey then observed, "For many, many years the Church has been playing only the white keys, but now we are playing on the white and the black keys, and the music is much, much sweeter" (in LeBaron,<i>All Are Alike unto God,</i>p. 123).<br><br>The sweetness of this music was experienced last February when President Hinckley became the first president of the Church to visit black Africa. A member of the Twelve observed that not only did the prophet have a great impact on the Saints in Africa, but the Saints in Africa also had a great impact on the prophet.<br><br>While in Africa, President Hinckley compared Peter's revelation that opened the door for the gospel to go to the Gentiles nearly 2,000 years ago to the revelation allowing the gospel to go to black Africa. He quoted Peter's statement to Cornelius: "God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him" (Acts 10:34–35). Then the prophet said:<br><br><i>That, my beloved brethren and sisters, describes you. I've had that testimony reconfirmed in my heart on this trip, as I have met with you and many others, that all are alike unto God. We are . . . all of a great family, a marvelous family, the family of the living Christ, worshiping Him together.</i>["Zimbabwe Pioneers Take Front Row Seats,"<i>Church News,</i>28 February 1998, p. 4]<br><br>And, referring to the revelation of June 1978, President Hinckley said, "I want to give testimony here that that was inspired, that that was a revelation from God. I was there. I was an eyewitness to it in the House of the Lord. . . . How grateful we are" ("Zimbabwe Pioneers," p. 4).<br><br>I also testify that this work is divine, and so are our spiritual roots. We are truly brothers and sisters through our spirit's birth and through our spiritual rebirth. May we always radiate pure love toward others--regardless of race, culture, or gender--as our Heavenly Father and the Savior do. Indeed, as the prophet Nephi (2 Nephi 26:33) and President Hinckley have testified: "All are alike unto God," to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>E.

<h1>t for Excellence - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved friends, what a delightful experience it is to look into your faces. You are here with great expectations concerning what I might say. That frightens me. You are here to get a lift from the drudgery of your studies. Whether you are in undergraduate or graduate work, the way is difficult. I know that. You made great effort to come here to BYU, and now you have discovered that it is not a piece of cake. It is hard. But the rewards are tremendous. You can grow here as you have never before grown in all of your lives. You can rise to the fullness of your potential. It is a season of tremendous opportunity. You are laying foundations for the future. You are worrying about an eternal companion, and some of you who are now married have discovered that it is like eternity every week to keep up with everything you have to do.<br><br>What am I going to talk about today? I want to urge you to stand a little taller, to rise a little higher, to be a little better. You have been spoken to along these lines before. If you did not want to hear it again, you did not have to come today. We will take a moment for any of you who would like to leave.<br><br>Well, bless your hearts, you are a wonderful assemblage. I am so proud of you. You are scholars in this the university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for all of you, but I know that a few of you could do much better than you are doing. I have titled my talk "The Quest for Excellence."<br><br>I first read these words 67 years ago in a college English class:<br><br><i>What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!</i>[William Shakespeare,<i>Hamlet,</i>act 2, scene 2]<br><br>I recognize that these words of Hamlet were spoken in irony. And yet there is so much of truth in them. They describe the great potential excellence of men and women. If Shakespeare had written nothing else, I think he would have been remembered for these few words of soliloquy. They go hand in hand with these words of David:<br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</i>[Psalms 8:3–5]<br><br>And the words of the Lord to Job when He spoke out of the whirlwind and declared:<br><br><i>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding....</i><br><br><i>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</i>[Job 38:4, 7]<br><br>These magnificent words declare the wonder of man. And when I speak of man, I of course speak also of woman. We are all children of God, and there is something of His divinity within each of us. We are more than a son or daughter of Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So who reside in such-and-such a place. We are more than a student at BYU. We are of the family of God, with such a tremendous potential for excellence. The distance between mediocrity and excellence can be ever so small. As we shall see again when the Winter Olympics come to Salt Lake City in 2002, that difference will be measured in tenths of seconds. The little extra effort we make becomes such a tremendous difference.<br><br>I heard one of my Brethren tell of a recent visit he made to the prison. There he noticed a young man, handsome in appearance and intelligent in his ways.<br><br>My brother said to the prison official, "What is that young man doing in here?"<br><br>The reply was that one evening he had taken his mother's car, had obtained some beer and drunk it, and then, not in control of himself, he drove the car down the sidewalk and killed two girls.<br><br>I do not know how long he will be in prison, but I do know that he will never get over his feelings concerning the act that put him there. On such small hinges turn the gates of our lives. Little mistakes that seem so unimportant in their beginnings determine the eternal courses we follow.<br><br>Had there not been that car and that beer, he would be in school today, a bright and happy young man moving forward on the way to a productive life. Now he sits in misery for nobody knows how long--musing, thinking, repenting of the terrible thing he has done that has blighted his life.<br><br>I want to invite you, my young friends, to walk a higher road of excellence. The other evening I picked up an old book and read Lytton Strachey's life of Florence Nightingale. I think books of that kind are not read very much these days. I had read it once before, long ago. But my rereading brought a new sense of admiration and respect for this great young woman of England who made a tremendous difference in her time.<br><br>She was born to the upper class to party and to dance, to go to the races, and to look pretty in society. But she would have none of it. Even her parents could not understand her. Her great overwhelming desire was to alleviate pain and suffering, to hasten healing, to make less dreadful the hospitals of the day. She never married. She devoted herself to nursing and became expert according to the training then available.<br><br>Britain became embroiled in the Crimean War. She had friends at the head of the government, and she relentlessly pursued and persuaded them until she was appointed head of the hospital in Scutari, where thousands of the victims of the war were brought.<br><br>The picture that greeted her there was one of absolute despair. An old warehouse served as a hospital. The sanitary conditions were terrible. The cooking facilities were terrible. Wounded men were crowded in great rooms reeking of foul odors and filled with the cries of the suffering.<br><br>This frail young woman, along with those she had recruited to go with her, set to work. They beat down the walls of bureaucracy. They beat on the heads of the bureaucrats. I quote from Mr. Strachey:<br><br><i>For to those who watched her at work among the sick, moving day and night from bed to bed, with that unflinching courage, with that indefatigable vigilance, it seemed as if the concentrated force of an undivided and unparalleled devotion could hardly suffice for that portion of her task alone. Wherever, in those vast wards, suffering was at its worst and the need for help was greatest, there, as if by magic, was Miss Nightingale.</i>[Lytton Strachey, "Florence Nightingale," in<i>Five Victorians</i>(London: Reprint Society, 1942), p. 310]<br><br>The beds that held the suffering men stretched over four miles, with barely space between each bed to walk. But somehow, within a period of six months,<br><br><i>the confusion and the pressure in the wards had come to an end; order reigned in them, and cleanliness; the supplies were bountiful and prompt; important sanitary works had been carried out. One simple comparison of figures was enough to reveal the extraordinary change: the rate of mortality among the cases treated had fallen from 42 percent to 22 per thousand.</i>[Strachey, "Florence Nightingale," p. 314]<br><br>She had brought to pass an absolute miracle. Lives by the thousands were saved. Suffering was mitigated. Cheer and warmth and light came into the lives of men who otherwise would have died in that dark and dreadful place.<br><br>The war ended. She might have gone back to London a heroine. The public press had sung her praise. Her name was familiar to everyone. But she returned incognito to escape the adulation she might have received.<br><br>She continued her work for another 50 years, changing hospitals--both military and civilian. She died at an advanced age, bedridden for a good while, but still improving the circumstances of those who suffered.<br><br>Perhaps no other woman in the history of the world, insofar as I know, has done so much to reduce human misery as this lady with the lamp who walked through the vast wards of Scutari in the middle of the 19th century, spreading cheer and comfort, faith and hope to those who writhed in pain. Her life was a life of excellence.<br><br>My wife likes to tell the story of a friend of hers who, when she was a little girl, was left an orphan. She scarcely knew her mother. As she grew, she wondered about her mother. What kind of a girl, what kind of a woman was she?<br><br>One day she came across her mother's old report card. The teacher had noted on that card, "This student is excellent in every way."<br><br>When she read that, her entire life changed. She recognized that her mother was a woman of excellence. Her whole attitude changed. She took on the patina of excellence herself and became a remarkable woman in her own right. She married a man who is recognized in all of these communities, and their children have distinguished themselves for their excellence.<br><br>Last Saturday evening Sister Hinckley and I attended a concert in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. It was provided by the Tabernacle Choir, the Utah Symphony, and the King's Singers.<br><br>Such excellence! The first time I heard the King's Singers was here at BYU some 10 or 15 years ago. I was entranced with their music. I have heard them a half a dozen times since. And on Saturday evening I was again simply enthralled.<br><br>They are six Englishmen who sing together all kinds of music from the old madrigals to modern pop. They come from different backgrounds, but every one is a consummate performer. As their voices lifted in a grand crescendo singing "Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!" there moved in imagination before the eyes of this old British missionary the long columns of British Tommies marching over dune and headland and the great, proud ships of Britain sailing across the seas of the world. Those boys, the King's Singers, sang with power and beauty and excellence. And they were backed by the orchestra and the Tabernacle Choir. And BYU's own Mack Wilberg did a masterful job in arranging much of the music.<br><br>What a magnificent thing is the Tabernacle Choir. I think it is the finest choir in the world. It is the choir of this Church, and it is a musical body of magnificence, of wondrous excellence.<br><br>That status has not been achieved without tremendous work extending over a period of a century and a half.<br><br>But their present quality is not enough. The world is moving forward, and they must go on and improve, and improve, and improve.<br><br>I listen to the magnificent music of the various bodies on this campus. It is wonderful. I see young men and young women smartly dressed, singing with consummate skill. It is uplifting. It is wonderful. How very good they are when they are good. And how proud and happy they feel because of the excellence with which they perform, including those who performed for us this morning.<br><br>I speak to you this morning not only about a little more effort, a little more self-discipline, a little more consecrated effort in the direction of excellence in your studies. I speak of it also in terms of your lives.<br><br>This is the great day of preparation for each of you. It is the time of beginning for something that will go on for as long as you live. I plead with you: Don't be a scrub! Rise to the high ground of excellence. You can do it. You may not be a genius. You may be lacking in some skills. But you can do better than you are now doing. You are students at BYU. Most of you are members of this great Church whose influence is now felt all over the world. You are people with a present and with a future. Don't muff the ball. Be excellent.<br><br>Those of you who are not married are here hoping to find a companion, among other things. I could wish for you nothing better than a good marriage, a happy marriage, a marriage fruitful in the sweet and satisfying things of life. Your marriage will not be excellent if it is marred with argument, if it is filled with disrespect one for another, if there is any lack of loyalty or devotion to one another. Cherish your spouse as the greatest possession of your life and treat him or her accordingly. Make it your constant goal to add to the happiness and comfort of your companion.<br><br>Never permit yourself to let down in your affection or your respect or your faith in one another. Be excellent in every way.<br><br>You will find your greatest example in the Son of God. I hope that each of you will make Him your friend while you are here and ever after. I hope you will strive to walk in His paths--extending mercy, blessing those who struggle, living with less selfishness, reaching out to others.<br><br>He is the greatest example of excellence in all the world. He condescended to come to earth under the most humble of circumstances. He grew up as the son of Joseph the carpenter. He struggled with the adversary on the Mount of Temptation. He came forth resplendent and beautiful and magnificent to teach the world. During His brief ministry He brought more of truth, more of hope, more of mercy, more of love than anyone else who has walked the earth. He died on Calvary's cross for each of us. He arose the third day, the first fruits of them that slept, bringing the promise of resurrection to all mankind and the hope of exaltation to all who would walk in obedience to His teachings. He was the great paragon of righteousness, the only perfect man ever to walk the earth. His was the wondrous example toward whom each of us might point our lives in our eternal quest for excellence.<br><br>God bless you, my dear young friends.<br><br>You know there is a more excellent way. The prophet Ether declared, "In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11).<br><br>You have the witness of that faith in him. You have the testimony of that faith. You have the example of that faith. As I said at the beginning, stand a little taller, rise a little higher, be a little better. Make the extra effort. You will be happier. You will know a new satisfaction, a new gladness in your heart.<br><br>Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>That is the great crowning example of excellence. May yours be a rich and wonderful life moving ever in that direction. We will not become perfect in a day or a month or a year. We will not accomplish it in a lifetime, but we can begin now, starting with our more obvious weaknesses and gradually converting them to strengths as we go forward with our lives.<br><br>All of us cannot be geniuses, but we can strive for excellence. This quest may be a long one. It may be fraught with much of repentance, and it will take much of effort. Do not sell yourselves short. You are sons and daughters of God, children with a divine potential. "Look to God and live" (Alma 37:47).<br><br>Make a little extra effort and kneel before Him in supplication. He will help you. He will bless you. He will comfort and sustain you.<br><br>The excellence of which you dream may not be attainable in its entirety. But there will be progress as you try. There will be growth. There will be improvement. And there will be much of added happiness.<br><br>If there has been failure in the past, if there has been sin, if there has been indolence, they may all be overcome.<br><br>Tremendous is your opportunity to reach beyond the hoped-for goal of wealth and worldly success--though that may have some modest importance--to build and strengthen others, to relieve suffering, to aid in making the world a better place, to pick up and carry the lantern of Florence Nightingale in walking through the pain-ridden wards of the world.<br><br>It was said of the Master that He "went about doing good" (see Acts 10:38). In that process He became the epitome of perfection.<br><br>I invoke the blessings of the Lord upon you, my dear friends, to reach for the stars. If you touch them, great shall be your reward. If you stumble and fall while reaching upward, you will be happy knowing you have made the effort.<br><br>May the Lord bless each of you as you walk your way with hope, with faith, with that charity which is "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47), I pray in His sacred name, even the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1> Intimate: The Atonement in the Heavens and in the Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Last spring when I received the assignment to give this talk, I was speaking with a colleague. "I have to give a BYU devotional talk next fall. That will probably ruin my summer," I explained in reference to having the task of preparation hanging over my head.<br><br>Not losing a beat, he quipped wryly in return, "It will probably ruin our fall!"<br><br>You see that I have some good friends--many of whom are here today. I am grateful for that.<br><br>As I speak today, I will heed the advice of my sophomore son, who said, "Dad, what the students want you to do is tell stories." While I was preparing this talk he peered at my computer screen and cautioned, "Quite a few big words there, Dad." I will try not to ruin your fall, and I will try to tell some stories and experiences that I hope will be faith promoting.<br><br>As you have noticed, the title for my address is "Vast and Intimate: The Atonement in the Heavens and in the Heart." I hope that does not seem presumptuous. I do not consider myself an authority on the doctrine or a spokesman for the Church. I have prepared and discarded several talks on other subjects before returning to this one. In my consternation over what to say, I asked this same son, who is a BYU student, to give me a blessing. That tender, shared experience with the Spirit led me back to the topic of the Atonement, which is a topic that has deep, personal meaning for me. I have felt its blessings in my own life and have observed them in the lives of others.<br><br>As I speak about the Atonement of Jesus Christ this morning, I will give a scriptural foundation for what I wish to say. Then I will share some personal experiences that have made these verses of scripture vivid and instructive for me. Finally, I will reflect on the majesty and magnitude of the Atonement. I hope that my deep conviction of the divinity of the Savior and my gratitude for his redemption runs through the whole of the presentation.<br><br>I take as a scriptural theme three verses from 3 Nephi 27 in the Book of Mormon. These verses are part of the Savior's own words to the Nephite disciples following his resurrection and appearance at the temple in Bountiful to about 2,500 faithful people who saw for themselves that this was the God of Israel and that his body bore the marks of the Crucifixion. In this great sermon Christ named his church and described his mission, his gospel, and the central place of atonement in the gospel plan. Verses 13–15 read:<br><br><i>Behold, I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you--that</i>I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.<br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that</i>I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me,<i>that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--</i><br><br><i>And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore,</i>according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me,<i>that they may be judged according to their works.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13-15; emphasis added]<br><br>Please keep this passage in mind as I now share a personal experience as a kind of metaphor for understanding our utter dependence upon the Savior in our trials and separations and for understanding his willingness to reach out and draw us to him through the power of the Atonement.<br><br>Some years ago, when I was much more fit and foolhardy, some friends and I decided to climb Gannett Peak, the highest mountain in Wyoming. Surrounded by the Wind River Range, this gorgeous, towering granite pinnacle rises nearly 14,000 feet, emerging at its summit from a permanent glacier that must be crossed to reach the mountaintop. After a long backpack trip along the trail, we camped and spent the night. Early the next morning we hiked the rest of the trail to the foot of the mountain, where we would begin our mountain assault, equipped with gaiters, crampons, ice axes, special climbing ropes, and carabiners--those oblong metal rings connected to a safety rope that snap to one's harness. Although we were merely novices, we were determined to get to the top. After a little practice with our equipment and some vigorous climbing, we found ourselves on the steep and treacherous slope of the glacier that guards the mountain summit.<br><br>For safety's sake we roped ourselves together in two-man teams to cross the glacier. The lead person in the team cautiously moved forward with the protection of the line tying him to the person situated behind him on a secure surface. I was roped to my wife's brother, Miller Gardner, whose nickname is Mo and who is 6'4" and weighs 230 pounds. He moved just ahead of me across the treacherous glacier. Gradually I fed out the rope that would conceivably stop any fall. When we reached a snow bridge that spanned a deep crevasse, to maximize the protection I sank the ice axe to its hilt into the glacier, looped the rope around the upper handle of the axe, and fed out the line a little at a time as Mo moved across the cornice.<br><br>Suddenly, without any warning, the snowy cornice gave way, dropping him through the surface and leaving him dangling from my safety rope beneath the collapsed snow bridge. Holding firmly on to the rope to stop it from playing out any further, I could see at once the terrified look on his face and the great abyss that extended hundreds of feet below him. I struggled to retrieve him from this dangerous and precarious position. Only my hold on the other end of the line kept him from plummeting to a certain death on the hard surface far below.<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like an interminable length of time, another member of our party reached our position and helped lift Mo back to safety. Afterward we sat together silently, exhausted, and soberly pondered what might have happened had we not roped up, had the rope not held, or had we not been able to draw Mo back to a place of safety. Life seemed extraordinarily precious to us after that moment of grave and threatening danger.<br><br>Now let me connect the scripture I read from 3 Nephi to the story and make a few observations. We read in the Bible and the Book of Mormon of a deep pit into which the wicked fall because of transgression. The weight of personal sins pulls the offender down over a precipice toward certain destruction unless that fall is broken by something or someone. That "someone" is the Lord Jesus Christ, who holds the safety line above us. The "something," I suggest, is the safety line of his gospel that ties us to him and stops our fall.<br><br>What makes the line hold each of us are the "carabiners" of principles and ordinances. (Remember those unbreakable metal connector rings?) They fasten the line securely to us. These connectors are faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endurance. Each of them secures the safety line from the Savior above to us below. We are suspended on that line. It arrests our fall into a disastrous spiritual chasm. If we hold on firmly, the line to him protects us from falling hopelessly into the deep abyss of death and disease, sin and sorrow, discouragement and doubt, failure and fear, and loss and loneliness. Mosiah assures us that "thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him" (Mosiah 29:20).<br><br>It would have done me no good to try to stop the plunge of my brother-in-law had I not stood immovably and securely on a firm place. His fall simply would have claimed both of us if my footing had given way. Likewise the Savior stands steadfastly on the high ground of purity and righteousness and is armed with the full power of the Father in order to draw all of his children unto him. Jesus is perfectly positioned to break our fall by the atoning force of his divine strength, his goodness, his ordination, and his loving concern for us. No one else can hold on to us. He alone can stop our fall and bring us back to his presence.<br><br>Not only that, but there had to be a prior arrangement, a plan, for Christ to be there for us to catch us precisely at the moment when the fall would have dashed us against the rocks below. As he said, "I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me" (3 Nephi 27:13).<br><br>Now I realize that my climbing analogy has limitations and even breaks down at some point. What is different about my puny hold on my brother-in-law and the Savior's mighty hold on us is that<i>all</i>of us are tethered to his line en masse: he bears the weight of the whole human family at once on that cord of caring. And we are<i>heavy</i>with our burdensome accumulation of sins and afflictions. The gravity of the law of justice and our own grief pull us downward. The grace of his mercy draws all men and women unto him. We are "lifted up" by his holy arm to the Father as our safety line holds firm because of our obedience to his saving principles and ordinances of the gospel. He will not loosen the knot. Only we can do that by our indifference to his ways.<br><br>He won't always prevent the pains and afflictions, but he has given us these assurances:<br><br>"I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions" (Mosiah 24:14).<br><br>"They should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ" (Alma 31:38).<br><br>"Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 36:3).<br><br>All of this is done through the power of his atoning sacrifice.<br><br>In my association with some young friends I am reminded of how we are supported by the Savior's atonement in trials and tribulation. I first met them about 1992 in a BYU married student stake where I served. I came to know them well and to learn much from their example. I speak of David and Sharilyn Evans and their children. Their experience gives tangible evidence of how the Savior reaches us in our adversities. I realize that their story of faith and courage and devotion is representative of others in our community who have also suffered--some of whom are gathered in this audience today. I recount the Evanses' story here with their permission.<br><br>I saw the Evans family again at the 1994 BYU Homecoming Spectacular here in the Marriott Center. As my wife and I were about to take our seats near the concourse, I heard my name called. Turning around, I saw these friends and their children: one child in a wheelchair pushed along by his mother and the other supported in his father's arms. Despite the infirmities they faced, these parents were happy and buoyant. They were enjoying the evening with their children.<br><br>As fine as the Homecoming performance was, I could not get the Evans family off my mind. Their cheerful faith and buoyant courage eclipsed even the brilliance on the stage before me. I simply could not stop thinking about and shedding tears over the little family behind me.<br><br>The young father--about the age of some of you here--had served with distinction on our student stake high council. More than once I had met both husband and wife in temple recommend interviews. There I learned that both of their children--then a beautiful four-year-old girl and a handsome two-year-old boy--have an incurable disease called spinal muscular atrophy that will progressively rob their muscles of strength and function.<br><br>It is a gloomy prognosis for these children and an incredible burden for their parents. One day the breath of life will ebb out of the children as muscles no longer respond to the brain signals to operate the heart and the lungs. There is little that medical science can do to stop this degeneration.<br><br>In the meantime, neither child can sit upright unaided by a bracing chair or supporting parent. Neither can walk. Neither can eat without food being lifted to their lips by a patient parent. Neither can turn over in bed without the benefit of a parent's kindly hand.<br><br>How can their parents remain so cheerful in the face of these burdens? How can they be so full of faith in Heavenly Father and his plan of happiness? How is it that this mother and father have grown ever better, not bitter, as they have faced two of life's cruel and unjust genetic mistakes? The answer lies in the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Sharilyn recently said to me, "I cannot begin to express the comfort and peace that have come to us through the Atonement of Jesus Christ."<br><br>They have not borne their burdens alone. The Lord has been there with them in their adversity and has reached them in their trials to fill them with hope, to lighten their load, and to soothe their aching hearts. As they have braced and supported their children, so has the Savior braced and supported them. The Savior has shown them a brighter day when their young will run and laugh and play. He has extended to them his personal promise that "he will swallow up death in victory; and . . . will wipe away tears from off all faces." And they will say, "We have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (Isaiah 25:8-9).<br><br>The scriptures help us understand how the Redeemer's power can reach us in our suffering, our sin, and our sorrow. The Book of Mormon prophesies that the Lord "will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:12). Twice in this single verse Alma emphasizes that the Lord needed to suffer the infirmities of his people<i>in the flesh</i>in order to have mercy and compassion for them. Whatever anguish his people would experience individually, he would bear collectively for all of them.<br><br>Both Isaiah and Abinadi prophesied that Christ would be "acquainted with grief"--<i>our</i>grief (Isaiah 53:3, Mosiah 14:3). According to the Latin cognate,<i>to be acquainted</i>means "to know personally, to know perfectly, to know firsthand." It was one thing for the Savior empathetically to<i>understand</i>our sins and sorrows; it was quite another actually to<i>experience</i>them, to take upon himself the guilt and pain, the homesickness and loneliness, the failure and disappointment, the hurt and anguish of every one of us as he did, causing him "to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18).<br><br>It was not enough for him to know about our infirmities; he had to experience them personally in order that he could reach us in every extremity. There is no place so remote, no condition so dark and despairing, no feeling so helpless, no hurt so deep that the Savior has not already been there and borne those burdens for us. Only in this way could he then<i>succor</i>us--which, as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has pointed out, literally means "to run to" ("Come unto Me,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1998, p. 22). It is comforting to me to think that when I am in most desperate need of help from the Savior, not only will he be there to help, but he will "run to me" to do so. What compassion! What humility! What overwhelming love and support for every one of us!<br><br>It is staggering for me to consider that not only does the Atonement have this poignant personal dimension for each of us, but it also has a planetary dimension for our world and probably for others as well. Thus it may be both interpersonal and interplanetary. Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote of the Atonement: "Its effects cover all men, the earth itself and all forms of life thereon, and reach[es] out into the endless expanses of eternity" (<i>MD,</i>p. 64).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote:<br><br><i>Since Jesus is the creator of other worlds whose inhabitants are also "begotten sons and daughters unto God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:24), it may be that the benefits of the Atonement will extend to all of the spirit children of our Father in Heaven, wherever situated.</i>[<i>"Not My Will, But Thine"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), p. 51]<br><br>The Atonement is intensely individual, reaching to every single soul, and it is universal, reaching to all creation. In both of these aspects, planetary and personal, the Atonement overcomes separation of every kind.<br><br>Recently I have read again some material by Professor Hugh Nibley about the need for and effects of the Atonement on the decaying world in which we live (see<i>Approaching Zion,</i>vol. 9 of<i>The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company; Provo: FARMS, 1989], chapter 18; and<i>Teachings of the Book of Mormon: Semester 2</i>[Provo: FARMS, 1993], 2:275–85). Brother Nibley uses a term from science to describe this decay. That term,<i>entropy,</i>comes from a Greek word that means "turning in" or, for our purposes here, "caving in." The dictionary defines it as the general trend of the universe toward death and disorder.<i>Entropy</i>is a word used to describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which observes that everything runs down, comes apart, or separates, and consequently even the earth itself must be put back together by the atoning power of Christ. It is to reverse this decay, as the tenth article of faith teaches, that "the earth will be<i>renewed</i>and receive its paradisiacal glory" (Articles of Faith 1:10; emphasis added).<br><br>Not only does the Atonement hold the power to overcome cosmic separation, but it also provides the way to resolve personal separations--separations from Heavenly Father, from one another, and from personal well being. Through his atonement Jesus experienced every separation that we might suffer: separation from peace of mind, separation from health, separation from our good name and reputation by being falsely accused, separation from another by being wronged or committing a wrong, separation through divorce and loneliness, and separation from joy and happiness. All of these losses were borne by him ahead of time in order that he could reach out to us under every adverse circumstance.<br><br>Nephi wrote, "He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life<i>that he may draw all men unto him"</i>(2 Nephi 26:24; emphasis added).<br><br>Suffering and separation will inevitably come, but restoration by the Redeemer will prevail. There will be no permanent losses. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "All your losses will be made up to you in the resurrection, provided you continue faithful. By the vision of the Almighty I have seen it" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 296).<br><br>To summarize this part of my remarks, as we think about the problems of separation and decay, we see that the Atonement had to be<i>infinite</i>in order to reach with unifying power to all the places, the people, and the problems of creation. But so did it have to be<i>intimate</i>to extend healing power to the individual lives of injured souls. Thus the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, came with both all-encompassing power and with caring and compassionate tenderness. President Gordon B. Hinckley captured this sweeping sense of scope and scale when he wrote these words about the Atonement from which the title to my remarks is taken:<br><br><i>I sense in a measure the meaning of His atonement. I cannot comprehend it all. It is so vast in its reach and yet so intimate in its effect that it defies comprehension. When all is said and done, when all of history is examined, when the deepest depths of the human mind have been explored, there is nothing so wonderful, so majestic, so tremendous as this act of grace.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>p. 28]<br><br>It is humbling and awe-inspiring for me to realize how the Savior's atonement reverses the degradation of the natural world and reconciles his children to him and to one another.<br><br>I am reminded of an experience I had several years ago while serving as bishop. I learned from my counselors at one point that an elderly sister had declined a calling in the ward. Sensing that something was amiss with this stalwart and faithful woman, I made an appointment to go to her home to speak with her. When I got there, she and her husband were both present.<br><br>After a little polite conversation I said that I understood that she had not felt comfortable in accepting a ward calling and asked what I could do to help. Both of them stared at the floor a long, long time before she answered. At last she spoke to explain that 50 years earlier, before they had been married, they had been intimate with one another and had been too ashamed to clear this up with the bishop before being married in the temple. For all of these years they had lived under the guilty burden of this transgression while paying generous tithes and offerings, serving faithfully in responsible Church callings, rearing a family in the faith, and sending children on missions.<br><br>Though they were faithful, they were not whole. They were kept from the peace and contentment that should have been theirs in golden years by clouds of self-doubt and the tarnished memory of unresolved transgression. Outwardly they seemed secure and serene. Inwardly they were carrying a kind of damage and hurt that intruded on their spiritual confidence. Together they had suffered this awful alienation from the Lord for a long time.<br><br>I don't know<i>why</i>their ordeal lasted a lifetime. I only know<i>when</i>it ended as the Lord lifted them from their lonely lamentations. As I tearfully listened to their story, I prayed earnestly to know what I might do to relieve them. When they finished speaking I felt impressed to say simply: "It is over. You have suffered long enough. I am sure the Lord has forgiven you. Repentance consists of forsaking a sin and confessing. You forsook that guilty act long, long ago. Tonight you also confessed. Now you are free. I feel certain that the Lord has forgotten your transgression and is eager to dispel your guilt with redeeming grace."<br><br>After kneeling in prayer together we three stood encircled in one another's arms as they sobbed out the last of their pent-up suffering and anguish.<br><br>"Oh, Bishop, is it really over?" they asked.<br><br>I assured them that it was.<br><br>The loving kindness and the grace of the Savior poured into their lives in sweet forgiving. He reached past the things that separated them from him and embraced them in sweet communion.<br><br>In one of our most beautiful Church hymns, Emma Lou Thayne depicts the answering of our innermost longing for peace and consolation that only can come from the Prince of Peace. She wrote:<br><br><i>Where can I turn for peace? Where is my solace</i><i><br>When other sources cease to make me whole?</i><i><br>When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,</i><i><br>I draw myself apart, Searching my soul?</i><br><br><i>Where, when my aching grows, Where, when I languish,<br>Where, in my need to know, where can I run?</i><i><br>Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?</i><i><br>Who, who can understand? He, only One.</i><br><br><i>He answers privately, Reaches my reaching</i><i><br>In my Gethsemane, Savior and Friend.</i><i><br>Gentle the peace he finds for my beseeching.</i><i><br>Constant he is and kind, Love without end.</i><br>["Where Can I Turn for Peace?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 129]<br><br>We are now in the season of celebration and gratitude. Thanksgiving is soon upon us and Christmas is not far behind. As we take stock of our gifts and blessings during the coming weeks, I hope we will think more carefully about the gift of God's Son and his redeeming sacrifice. What protective promise filled the little straw-covered grotto as the Lord of Lords and King of Kings was born in Judea to fulfill the hopes and dreams of all mankind! With him were born that night in Bethlehem hope and healing, light and life. By his coming a world darkened by sin and sorrow was brightened by his generous gifts of godliness.<br><br>I have often thought of the marvelous ironies of his coming. Although he came as a newborn babe, he had already existed from everlasting to everlasting. Though tiny Bethlehem was his birthplace, he had created the vast universe with all the planets and all creation. Born as a subject of King Herod, he had majestically ruled the heavens and the earth long before any earthly king took throne. Honored with gifts of the wise men, all the treasures of the earth had come into being as his handiwork. Shepherds worshiped in Judea the one soon to become the Good Shepherd. And, finally, helpless and small in Mary's arms, he would eventually rescue his Father's children with his mighty arm outstretched to save us all.<br><br>I bear witness of the Savior's atoning greatness and goodness and testify that he is the Son of God, our Redeemer. I bear witness that President Gordon B. Hinckley is his servant, our prophet. I do this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1> Thy God Shall Lead Thee by the Hand - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The basis for my remarks this morning comes from a scripture found in D&amp;amp;C 112:10: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." I think this means: Be open to letting the Lord help you. That is not to say that you should take a passive stance or be helpless or dependent. Rather it suggests that in this time of both pressure and uncertainty, the Lord can be there to guide you through your important decisions of life and to support you in times of trial.<br><br>Let us start by reflecting on what we know about our premortal life. We get a sense of how important it must have been to our Heavenly Father for us to learn to work through a process, to be faced with choices, and then have the ability to make our own decisions. During that time he presented a plan to all of us. Lucifer said he could insure that not one soul would be lost during this earthly phase of our lives. As a parent there have been times when I would have done anything to protect my children and have such a guarantee. That makes the Lord's decision in this situation all the more powerful and meaningful to me. He rejected the option of a guarantee that would have insured our return but that would also have taken away our ability to learn and grow and progress. What the Lord wanted us to experience on this earth apparently was so important that before our mortal existence even began, he was willing to lose one-third of his children who refused to acknowledge the wisdom of his great purpose--children that he loved and cared about just as your earthly parents love you. I believe he had and has the power to make all of us return to his presence. But although he was not willing to create a structure that would force our compliance, he promised to be at our side--coaching, comforting, and directing each step of the way. If we would just listen and respond, we could have his companionship on this journey to help us return safely home.<br><br>Because we don't have any memory of that premortal time and because Satan is constantly on the attack, we sometimes forget about our divinity--where we came from and what rewards await us if we will stay the course. We don't remember that we accepted these challenges willingly, knowing that, although difficult, there would be every opportunity for our success.<br><br>Ardeth Kapp tells the story of a sculptor who spent days chiseling and cutting away at a piece of marble. A young child who had been watching him through this process one day exclaimed, "I know who that is. It's Abraham Lincoln. How did you know he was in there?" (from "Oh Remember, Remember, Lest Ye Forget," 1997 CES Book of Mormon Symposium). Sometimes it takes a few hard knocks for us to break through our hard exteriors and remember who is inside and what it really means to be on earth at this time. Through the experiences our Father wanted us to have, we can learn that we are stronger than we thought or that what we assumed was important has moved on our priority list. We can develop into being less judgmental and more empathetic of those who also chose to come to earth so they could progress by dealing with life's challenges.<br><br>I'd like to tell you about a group of people who understood who they were and what was truly important to them. The year was about A.D. 1140 at the Weibertreu Castle in Germany. This was not an easy time to be living. Thick castle walls, deep moats, and heavy gates were built for a reason. The battles that took place at that time were probably not all that different than those we read about in the Book of Mormon, where men fought hand to hand and eye to eye with their attackers and the occupation of the victors was most often devastating. King Konrad III and his powerful army attacked this castle of Weibertreu in a powerful siege. He knew his trade well, and those within the walls were unable to defend themselves. As the castle inhabitants were on the verge of surrender, Konrad, in a moment of kindness, said the women could leave the crumbling fortress, taking with them all they could carry on their backs. The gates opened, and the women staggered out, struggling under the heavy loads they carried. Konrad and his men were caught off guard, shocked and surprised by what they saw, for on the back of each woman was one of the men. They knew where their treasures were, and they chose to take what was very most important, even at the risk of stirring the anger of the soldiers. Konrad, touched by this tender display of love and loyalty, remained true to his word and, although his troops leveled the buildings, not a life was lost that day.<br><br>Those must have been among the most harsh and brutal times to live, and yet the people of Weibertreu were able to reach beyond that to some degree and hang on to what was most dear to them. They understood the importance of their relationships and were able to summon the strength and courage from within to preserve that which was needed for their survival. Although there is little in the way of physical remains of the castle in modern times, the story of the "Castle of the Loyal Wives" lives on and is still an inspiring reminder to young and old alike more than 850 years later.<br><br>Understanding who we are and what is truly important in this life is a vital element in letting the Lord help us through this journey on earth. Being humble, in the way referred to by the scripture, means being willing to listen to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. There is so much noise in the world that sometimes this is not an easy task. As members of the Church we are blessed with so much that perhaps, on occasion, we don't notice the help and guidance being given to us or we don't think to acknowledge the source of our strength. When we do listen, the result can be very powerful.<br><br>Our family lived in Germany from 1983 to 1986. A member of our ward worked for the U.S. government and had responsibility for certain aspects of academic training for the American military personnel who were there. He asked me if I would teach a week-long course to soldiers in a nearby city. I had not been in any kind of full-time work situation since having children, and I was anxious both about my ability to teach the course and also about leaving my son and daughters. I finally agreed to teach when a woman in our ward, who had become a friend of our family, offered to tend.<br><br>I was to start my first class at 8:00 Monday morning. About 8:30 the Sunday night before, I received a call from the woman's husband telling me she had had a medical emergency and had been rushed to the hospital. Although her situation had stabilized and she was in no immediate danger, she obviously would not be able to watch my children the following day. We had no family nearby and, because we were so new to the country, I didn't know people in our neighborhood well enough to call and ask them to help. I hung up the phone and went back into the living room, where two elders from our area were just completing a discussion to a young male investigator. Our home offered the missionaries the privacy that was sometimes lacking in the living arrangements of those they were teaching, and we had invited them to come whenever they wished. As I told them of my plight, the investigator said that his girlfriend had just lost her job and might be willing to help us. Under normal circumstances I would not have considered losing a job as a sterling recommendation for watching my children, but at this time and in this situation it was enough. I immediately called the young woman, who was willing to come. The only area of concern was that she smoked, and she agreed to go outside for her breaks.<br><br>I want to pause in this part of the story for a moment and tell you about an experience earlier that same Sunday. A young sister in our ward was teaching a Relief Society lesson about the importance of family home evening. Suddenly, right in the middle of her lesson, she said that she felt inspired to ask each one of us individually to commit to having family home evening the next night. This was a little irritating to me because I had already made a conscious decision to skip it this week since I would be so busy and probably a little stressed as well. But as she questioned me directly, I felt there was nothing I could say but that I, too, would promise to spend this time with my family.<br><br>Monday evening I came home from work to find that all had gone well. I personally was exhausted as we finished dinner, and I began preparations for the next day of teaching. However, my promise of the day before to hold family home evening would not leave me alone. Finally I went to my file drawer and hastily selected one of the family home evening packets my sister, Carol, and I had prepared together before our family moved to Germany. I had made a simple drawing of a boy figure named Sammy who had a big mouth, which was cut out. I also had a picture of a garbage can with a hole cut in its lid. There were smaller pictures of things like fruit, vegetables, milk, cheese, bread, etc.--all healthy things--and beer, wine, cigarettes, cigars, drugs, etc., which were not good for the body. The children selected an item and then decided where to place it. Things that would keep Sammy healthy went in his mouth, and the unhealthy things were thrown in the trash. The entire lesson on the Word of Wisdom--including prayers, music, and treats--was completed in record time. I no longer felt guilty and was able to return my focus to the lessons for the next day.<br><br>When I returned home Tuesday, the baby-sitter announced that she had decided to quit smoking. Then she told of how our daughters had gone out to her in the yard that day as she was smoking. They wrapped their arms around her and told her they loved her and that they didn't want her to die. Then they brought her into the house and gave her a little lesson with Sammy.<br><br>Wednesday night our baby-sitter had the children's version of the Book of Mormon in her hands as I walked through the door. She said she and the children had finished reading it that day. Although it was quite interesting, she knew there must be more to the story and asked if I had any other reading materials I could share with her. I often wonder if people investigating the Church have any idea what they are getting into when they ask such a seemingly simple question. By the time my work assignment was finished on Friday, she had a stack of books and an appointment with the elders. A few months later she was baptized, and a year after that she was married in the temple. Not only is she now a member of the Church, but so are her children.<br><br>It all started with a young sister who followed the prompting to ask those in her Relief Society class to commit to having family home evening. The teacher moved out of our ward shortly after her lesson and likely never knew of the great impact her decision to follow a prompting of the Holy Ghost would make. I have shared with you only our story. Who knows how many other lives were touched because she was humble and allowed the Lord to lead her by the hand?<br><br>It is not always easy to follow the Lord's counsel and do what he asks of us. Even some of the greatest prophets the world has ever known experienced moments of hesitation, of self-doubt, and wondered if the Lord's requests were too difficult. When the Lord asked Enoch to preach the gospel among his people, Enoch replied, "I . . . am but a lad, and all the people hate me" (Moses 6:31). It was true. He was young, and the people really did not like him. But the Lord had chosen him and would be there at Enoch's side to lead and support him. Of course, we all know that because of Enoch's humility and willing heart, great miracles were accomplished with the people he taught.<br><br>Another prophet, Moses, felt totally overwhelmed by his calling to lead the children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt. "I am slow of speech," he said (Exodus 4:10). At that time Moses had been away from Egypt and, therefore, also away from the Egyptian and Hebrew languages for about 40 years. Anyone who has studied another language knows how difficult it would have been to regain fluency in a language not used for a lengthy period of time. Keep in mind that the task was not to have a casual conversation but to convince a pharaoh to do something he didn't want to do and to lead thousands on the greatest exodus the world has ever known. Can we understand his hesitation? Certainly. But he let go of his fear and forged ahead on a seemingly impossible journey, trusting that the Lord would be there with him.<br><br>Nephi was one who seemed never to question the commandments of the Lord. There are many examples of his steadfastness, but one of my favorites is recorded after Lehi's group had wandered for years after leaving Jerusalem, experiencing hardships and heartache and finally ending up in the land of Bountiful. The Lord spoke to Nephi, telling him to construct a ship to carry all those who were with him across the waters.<br><br>Let's think about the context in which Nephi received this commandment. Nephi was raised in and near Jerusalem, a city in the mountains not near any major bodies of water. He spent eight years wandering in the wilderness. It is very possible that he had never even been in a boat before, and even more likely that he had no previous knowledge of shipbuilding. Add to that the fact that this commandment came more than 2,000 years before Columbus sailed to America. These people didn't know of the earth's shape or what was beyond what they could see. Certainly obedience would require extreme faith and a willingness to follow closely the counsel of the Lord. It would seem normal to hesitate or to question such a request, even if for only a moment. And yet listen to Nephi's first response to the Lord, as found in 1 Nephi 17:9: "Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship?" In other words, how do I get started? He did not have to understand everything in order to be willing to obey. There must have been questions in his mind about where they were going, how it was all going to work out, and why he was the one asked to lead the way. But there never seemed to be any question in his mind that the Lord would be at his side, helping him to do whatever was needed.<br><br>Nephi is a great example, and he established a mark of excellence toward which we can aim. We may not have as much courage or the depth of faith that he exemplified, but fortunately we don't have to be like Nephi--or like anyone else, for that matter. We are only asked to start where we are and then to keep trying. Alma 32:27 gives us direction on this: "Exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you." We don't have to start out having it all together. The Lord only asks from us what we can give, but we are then expected to give that much. As we stretch and push ourselves, we grow--physically, emotionally, and, most important, spiritually. If we can just understand the importance of believing and then following, we will be blessed beyond our greatest imaginings.<br><br>Prophets of old are not the only ones to whom we can look to learn of believing and then doing. Ordinary people who act in extraordinary ways are all around us every day. One such example was Jose Mackintosh, the young elder and former BYU student who was murdered several weeks ago while he was serving in Russia. It is hard to imagine the heartbreak experienced by his family when they received word of his death. The attack was so senseless. There must have been some expectation that Jose would be protected as he was serving the Lord. Why did this young man, who gave to others so freely, have to die? I don't have the answer, and yet I know the Lord is aware of Jose and his family and is with them as they deal with this tragedy.<br><br>I had the opportunity to speak briefly with Jose's parents on the phone shortly after we at BYU learned of his death. What tremendous examples they are--humbly following the Lord and inviting his care and keeping into their lives. What strength of character and solid grounding in the gospel has been exhibited by them. Reports are that, when told of the death of their son, the most pressing considerations of Brother and Sister Mackintosh related to the well-being of Jose's companion, Elder Borden; to expressions of forgiveness for his murderer; and to love and concern for the people of Russia.<br><br>Sister Janelle Jarvis, wife of Jose's mission president, Donald K. Jarvis (who, by the way, was a BYU faculty member), wrote these memories of Elder Mackintosh:<br><br><i>He was really a remarkable young man. His favorite word in Russian was</i>smile!<i>He set a goal to smile at all public transport workers. Some would smile back, and others would ask, "Why are you smiling?"</i><br><br><i>And he would answer, "Because I am happy."</i><br><br><i>He is remembered for saving 40 missionaries from starvation at the end of a four-hour zone conference. He took a Snickers bar out of his pocket, opened it, looked at it, then said to the elder on his left, "Do you want it?"</i><br><br><i>"Of course," was the answer. He repeated the procedure with a second Snickers bar, then a third, and so on until he had fed every missionary there. . . . He believed in hard work and loved Brigham Young's words: "If you work hard you'll be happy. If you don't, you'll go to hell."</i>[E-mail submission to www.lds-gems.com, 12 November 1998]<br><br>Elder Mackintosh's story was widely publicized. On this campus, although rarely coming to the attention of many people, there are numerous others who are as choice and who are a positive influence in the lives of all those around them. This semester alone students have provided thousands of hours of service to other students, ranging from medical assistance to tutoring to reading textbooks onto audiotapes to planning and presenting campuswide activities. We know of the hours given in Church assignments in our student wards and stakes. And thousands more are given as we extend to programs and individuals within the community. As we give of our time and talents, we are literally serving as the Lord's emissary to others in their times of need.<br><br>We must take responsibility for who we are and what we've become. Darryl, a relative of mine, shared with me the analogy of the orange. If you squeeze an orange, he says, you will get orange juice. It doesn't matter who squeezes it, where or when this is done, or what kind of implement is used. If you squeeze an orange, what comes out is orange juice. The same holds true for each of us. When the pressure is on--regardless of when, where, why, or who is inducing the pressure--all that can come out is what genuinely is inside of us. If we have learned to trust in the Lord, care about others, and sincerely want to do what is right, all that will be evident. If we have not worked at learning those things, our mistrust, selfish desires, or angry feelings will ultimately rule the outcome.<br><br>The early pioneers understood the necessary combination of humbling themselves, listening intently to God's will, doing all they could to follow it, and then allowing their Heavenly Father to support them in facing almost unthinkable challenges. Because of their deep trust that they were players in a glorious cause, they were able to face hardships with hearts that were thankful to a Father who would invite them to be a part of his plan. In Susan Arrington Madsen's book<i>Christmas--A Joyful Heritage,</i>recollections of the earliest days in the Salt Lake Valley are shared by some of the Saints who were there.<br><br>One example given by Sister Madsen is of a particularly memorable Christmas recorded by Mary Jane Perkins Wilson:<br><br><i>It was here at "Hole in The Rock" that we spent our first Christmas holidays. We children had no place only on the wagon wheels to hang our stockings. Nevertheless old St. Nicholas visited us with parched corn and some cookies that were baked in the dutch ovens. However everybody was happy. We spent most of the day gathering sagebrush to build fires at night to dance by. It was not of course on waxed floors, nor wearing various colored pumps, but it was on the sand rocks and some were barefooted. Brother Charles E. Walton was the orchestra. Sometimes he played the violin and other times the cornet.</i>[In Susan Arrington Madsen,<i>Christmas--A Joyful Heritage</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984), p. 6]<br><br>It is refreshing to think of a time when people could experience great joy with only parched corn, a sagebrush fire, and an orchestra consisting of one man.<br><br>Another entry by Elizabeth Huffaker, reflecting back, said:<br><br><i>I remember our first Christmas in the Valley. We all worked as usual. The men gathered sagebrush, and some plowed; for though it had snowed, the ground was still soft, and the plows were used nearly the entire day. We celebrated the day on the Sabbath (Christmas was on Saturday), when all gathered around the flagpole in the center of the Fort, and there we held a meeting. And what a meeting it was. We sang praises to God, we all joined in the evening prayer, and the speaking that day has always been remembered. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Many who were there for that first Christmas in the Valley later remarked that in the sense of perfect peace and good will, they never had a happier Christmas in all their lives.</i>[Madsen,<i>Christmas,</i>p. 26]<br><br>Their Christmas spirit was really the peace, comfort, and sense of well-being they felt from a Heavenly Father who knew they had done their part, that they had given their all--literally--to the furthering of the kingdom on earth. He blessed them, not with material rewards, but with gifts of the Spirit.<br><br>The last example I'll share is this tender memory of 1862 written by Hannah Dalton:<br><br><i>All of us children hung up our stockings Christmas eve. We jumped up early in the morning to see what Santa had brought, but there was not a thing in them. Mother wept bitterly. She went to her box and got a little apple and cut it in little tiny pieces and that was our Christmas. But, I have never forgotten how I loved her dear hands as she was cutting that apple.</i>[Madsen,<i>Christmas,</i>p. 58]<br><br>How many dear hands have helped our lives be better, have reached out to us in our times of crisis, and have given us what we've needed? The Lord is often by our side by way of the service of others. Although they were obviously extremely difficult times, the Lord was there beside Hannah's mother to help her through her trials. And he was by Hannah, as well, touching her heart with feelings of love and gratitude--for a mother's hands and for the Christmas spirit. And he was with the Mackintoshes, so they could feel forgiveness toward others at a time when a son was lost. The Lord promised to be there to take us by the hand and answer our prayers.<br><br>I would like to share with you a very personal family story that happened almost 21 years ago. The day after Christmas in 1977, a little redheaded girl was born to our family. Although she came a few weeks early, she appeared to be healthy and happy, and we all loved her very much. When she was about two months old, she became quite ill and spent a few days at Primary Children's Hospital in the semi-intensive care unit. After some treatments and special medications, she improved enough for us to take her back home. But she never totally recovered. In fact, her condition worsened until we took her back to the hospital again a month and half later. This time she did not respond to the treatments, and a diagnosis of the problem was not readily evident. As her lungs began to fail, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where, on a respirator, she gradually moved to 100% oxygen.<br><br>We were told this was an essential treatment for her at the time, but high doses of oxygen for an infant could in the long run result in blindness. Also, lack of adequate oxygen to the brain could cause some long-term brain damage. Because of the numerous blood tests required, a shunt was put into her tiny arm to facilitate the process. Again we were warned of potential problems. In fact, the very day the shunt was inserted, a nine-month-old baby in the same unit had his arm amputated because of a severe infection associated with the shunt he had received.<br><br>At first the doctors were optimistic, stating that there were many possible reasons for her condition and, as soon as they could identify the cause, appropriate treatment could be administered. Test results gave no useful information, and nothing seemed to help this little life that was slipping away from us. On a Saturday evening the doctors told us Holly had stabilized, and they suggested we go home and get some rest. If there was a problem, they would call us immediately. The dreaded call came during the very early hours the following morning. We were told that both of Holly's lungs had collapsed and that doctors would try to keep her alive until we arrived so that we could be with her as she died. We threw on our clothes and jumped in the car. On the way to the hospital I thought to myself, "This is one of those times when people bargain with the Lord for something they dearly want." But, try as I might, I couldn't think of anything I could offer that was a worthy trade for the life of my little daughter. So instead I prayed with all the energy I had that the Lord would help me handle whatever was to come.<br><br>Forever etched on my mind will be the scene inside the intensive care unit when we arrived of doctors holding the limp little girl in their arms, hand-pumping the oxygen that was keeping her alive. We asked if we could give her a blessing before taking her off the oxygen. Literally as soon as the<i>amen</i>was said, a lobe in one of her lungs spontaneously inflated. It wasn't a lot, but it was enough. She had been given a little more time.<br><br>Unfortunately we still didn't know what was wrong with her. Our pediatrician, Stanley Child, was relentless as he began searching the medical journals until he read of a very rare condition that could be causing the problems. In order to make a definitive diagnosis, an angiogram was required--a very risky procedure for a child so young and so critically ill. There was a big chance that the angiogram could cause a stroke or, worse, death. Without a diagnosis, however, it was essentially guaranteed that she would die. After much discussion the cardiologist moved ahead with the procedure. The doctors did, in fact, discover the problem, and open-heart surgery was scheduled immediately. This was a dangerous operation under the best of circumstances, especially 21 years ago, and Holly was given very low odds of surviving.<br><br>Here is where I would like to make an important point. I tend to be an emotional person, and I can cry with little prompting. To face the probable death of my child would seem to be almost unbearable. And yet, as I sat in the waiting room of Primary Children's Hospital after the operation began, I felt calm and peaceful. In fact, I was the one who was offering reassuring words to the others who had come to be with us as we waited. At times I could feel the presence and strength and warmth of others behind me; but when I turned around, no one was there. Almost suddenly I understood. The Lord was answering my prayer to be able to handle whatever was to come. I was experiencing the gift of the Holy Ghost as a comforter.<br><br>In the operating room an incision was made from Holly's sternum around the left side of her chest to her backbone. The surgeon needed to reach into her tiny body with his adult male hands and reroute an artery that was only the size of a pencil lead. After a time we received word that all had gone well. The next challenge was to take Holly off the heart/lung machine so that her heart could begin beating on its own once again. With great relief for all involved, she successfully made that transition. After several weeks she was strong enough to be taken home. Her little body had been paralyzed, she had no voice because of trauma to her vocal chords, and she weighed less than what she had at birth. The next months were challenging, but little by little she regained full strength.<br><br>In less than one month, on December 26, Holly will be 21 years old. She loves to play the piano with two hands, she sings with a lovely soprano voice, she has 20/20 vision, and she is an honor student. In high school her heart and lungs were strong enough for her to run track. There are not many around who are more energetic, fun loving, or who seem to enjoy more from life.<br><br>I often reflect back to that time and to doctors who listened and were guided to know how to best help our child. I think of friends and family who gave more to us during that difficult time than I could have imagined possible. And I can never deny the hand of a loving Heavenly Father who heard my prayer and gave me the strength I needed to handle the situation, both while Holly was in the hospital and during the time that followed. Obviously, I have shared with you an experience that turned out exactly the way I wanted.<br><br>Many things happen in our lives that do not have the result we would have desired. For example, Saturday I watched our women's volleyball team play for the WAC championship. I agreed with the sportscasters, who continuously commented on the excitement of the game and the tremendous poise and talent displayed. In one of the closest battles of volleyball history, BYU ended up with second place in the championship--not what they hoped for. But they were first place in the way they handled themselves and represented our university. Regardless of what disappointments may come our way or how challenges ultimately turn out in this life, we can be supported through them and can use them as opportunities for growth.<br><br>In this last general conference, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Why are we such a happy people? It is because of our faith, the quiet assurance that abides in our hearts that our Father in Heaven, overseeing all, will look after His sons and daughters who walk before Him with love and appreciation and obedience.</i>["What Are People Asking About Us?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, p. 72]<br><br>This is a time in the history of the world when great and marvelous things are happening--and happening at a pace never before known to man. The last days are truly upon us. W. Jeffrey Marsh, in his August 1998<i>Ensign</i>article, cited Elder Joe. J. Christensen of the Presidency of the Seventy, who<br><br><i>pointed out that the quickest Adam and Eve could communicate or travel over long distances was by horse. Almost 6,000 years later, the fastest Joseph Smith could communicate or travel was by horse. No progress in travel in almost 6,000 years of history! But beginning with the Restoration, the Lord began to pour out his Spirit and unveil modern inventions that have enabled us to take the gospel to the ends of the earth.</i>[W. Jeffrey Marsh, "Training from the Old Testament: Moroni's Lessons for a Prophet,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1998, p. 15]<br><br>In that same article Brother Marsh quoted Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, saying in general conference in 1926:<br><br><i>I do not believe for one moment that these discoveries have come by chance, or that they have come because of superior intelligence possessed by men today over those who lived in ages that are past. They have come and are coming because the time is ripe, because the Lord has willed it, and because he has poured out his Spirit on all flesh.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1926, p. 117]<br><br>Just in the time since I graduated from high school, more information has been produced than existed in the previous 5,000 years--and that amount of information is estimated to double every five years. It is impossible for us to learn all of that, let alone determine its value and worth. But it is there, available to us. If we are humble and seek the Lord's guidance, he will help us to know how to access the tools we can use to do our part in furthering the kingdom. We are in a prime position to make a difference and to be guided in directions that will have the most positive influence. Let me quote President Hinckley from a California regional conference in 1995:<br><br><i>You can't stop the work of the Lord from going forward. You can stop yourself from enjoying its blessings, but you cannot stop the work of the Lord from going forward. This is His work, and regardless of what we do individually, He will find a way to accomplish His eternal purpose.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, from priesthood leadership meeting, Vacaville/Santa Rosa, California, Regional Conference, 20 May 1995, in "Messages of Inspiration from the Prophet,"<i>Church News,</i>30 September 1995, p. 2]<br><br>The work of the Lord will go on with or without us. Evil, no matter how cleverly disguised, will not win out in the end. There will be no more floods to cleanse the earth. The next greatest worldwide event will be the return of our Lord and Savior. My prayer is that the work of the Lord will go on<i>with</i>each of us, that we will humble ourselves so that we can understand his will and then move ahead, trusting that he will be at our side. I leave these thoughts with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet S. Scharman was a BYU assistant student life vice president and the dean of students when this devotional address was given on 1 December 1998.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.
