<h1>ing and Honoring Your Covenants - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Since it is the beginning of a new year, now is the perfect time for all of us to take the opportunity in the days ahead to reminisce over the past year. What would you judge to have been your accomplishments during those days, weeks, and months? What could you have done to achieve more if you feel you didn't meet a goal? It is now 2011, and 2010 is completed. Therefore, welcome back to a new year at Brigham Young University, where you will have more opportunities for success in reaching desired goals. Do not unduly dwell on regrets of the past; rather, use them as an impetus to better yourselves in the future.<br><br>It is time to move forward, and as you do, always acknowledge and be grateful for the many blessings afforded you by your parents, friends, faithful Church members worldwide, academic and ecclesiastical leaders, and, most important, your Savior, Jesus Christ, whose birthday we just recently honored with the Christmas season. We are all admonished in Helaman 5:12 to "remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; . . . which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." Acknowledge and remember Him in every aspect of your lives.<br><br>As my children were growing up, I saved their school papers and projects, letters, awards, and other items, thinking that someday they would want these memories for some future purpose. As I was going through the collection I had saved for my oldest son, I came upon a note that had been written by a 14-year-old boy to him when he was serving his mission. I will call the young man John. My son had kept the note with others he had received while in the mission field. I began to read it and found that the contents included some news of the day that John felt would be of great interest to my son, including sports scores and such.<br><br>At the conclusion of the short letter, John stated how excited he was to serve his mission in five years. Many years had passed since that message was written, mailed, and received. When I finished reading it, I had a sad feeling, because I knew what John had chosen to do with his life in the ensuing years since he had written the note. John had attended his church meetings in his youth. However, during his teenage years he used his agency to make choices that led him on paths that took him in different directions than he had once intended. He never went on that mission that he had once been so excited to experience, and serious problems have plagued his life. He is now an adult and not active in the Church, but he is close to his family. His parents find comfort in the principle of repentance and pray that someday John may seek such in his life.<br><br>I once heard a stake president, in speaking to a group of young adults such as you, state that whenever he interviewed young men or young women who were having some serious problems in their lives, he most often came to the same sad conclusion: they had forgotten the covenants they made at baptism. Had they not done so, they most likely could have avoided their present situations. John forgot the promises he made when he was eight years old. When John was baptized, he made a covenant with his Heavenly Father--as we all did when we were baptized. We promised "to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in" (Mosiah 18:9). It is the Lord's desire that each of us be awitness for and possess a sure and personal testimony of Him.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley referred to you as a chosen generation and stated it often. In a session of general conference he said:<br><br><i>Each time I have stood before such a group, there has come into my mind the great and prophetic statement made by Peter of old. Said he: "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light." (1 Pet. 2:9.)</i><br><br><i>I know of no other statement which more aptly describes you, nor which sets before you a higher ideal by which to shape and guide your lives.</i>["A Chosen Generation,"<i>Ensign</i>, May 1992, 69]<br><br>President Hinckley knew that you could be witnesses of your Savior in today's world. President Thomas S. Monson, our present-day prophet, has the same confidence in you. He believes you can measure up to the most difficult challenges. You are part of the Lord's plan that was presented in the premortal world. Shouts of joy were heard when you accepted this journey. I don't believe that you have come at this time and place by accident. It is a time when you, as servants of the Lord, are to strive to take the message of truth to all the peoples of the earth. You are to be witnesses of God in your beliefs and actions at this time and place.<br><br>The world is experiencing a great fight between righteousness and wickedness, and you are surrounded by this battle. Millions of people on the earth today live wholesome and good lives, but the adversary is striving to destroy moral and ethical values, and he is gaining supporters from the children of our Heavenly Father. He is having us abandon any use of the name of God in public meetings or places. He is attempting to destroy the family unit and striving to have parents relinquish their parental responsibilities. In far too many instances he is succeeding. The stigma that in the past was attached to dishonesty, immorality, lack of integrity, and impurity is disappearing.<br><br>The Savior said that conditions toward the end of this dispensation would resemble those that existed just before the Flood. In Matthew 24:37 we read, "But as the days of Noe [Noah] were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."<br><br>However, you have also come at a time when you are blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ and have the promise that it will never again be taken from the earth. It is a period known as the fulness of times. Prophets through the ages have written concerning this dispensation. It is indeed a wonderful though challenging time to be alive. You have a prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, to lead you. He is the Lord's mouthpiece at this specific time and place, and he will teach and guide you as you hear, listen, and obey his words. You are the beneficiaries of those who have gone before you. They have enabled you to enjoy the gospel in your lives, to sit in this audience, and to attend this wonderful university, where you may study in an environment of faith and truth.<br><br>To stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things, and in all places means that you love the Lord and will represent Him every hour of every day. He is your Exemplar, and thus your thoughts and actions should reflect Him in every place in which you stand and in everything you do. This, of course, is all encompassing in your life. It means you stand as witnesses of Him in the classroom, on the playing field, in the car, in your home, on a date--everywhere you are at any time and in all things.<br><br>At times it may take courage to speak as a witness of our Savior. The world of today is surely finding you a peculiar people, as stated previously in the scripture found in Peter. You are finding yourselves separated from the standards accepted by many people--even leaders and misleading models of today's society. This separation, as well as distinction, is only going to widen and become more prevalent as the teachings of our Savior continue to be discounted and even ridiculed by those who seek to stop the work of the Lord with the help of the adversary. There are going to be times when the rift between the truth and falsehood is going to be even wider than it is now.<br><br>You may fear to open your mouths as witnesses of the truth. I know that I too have felt this way. On such occasions, two scriptures always come to my mind. They are both found in the Doctrine and Covenants. The first one reads: "That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 1:23). This is often referred to as a missionary scripture. However, you are missionaries when you bear testimony of the mission of your Savior and are witnesses of Him. I know that at times you may feel you are indeed weak and simple and thus feel intimidated and nervous when you are surrounded by those you may deem more learned, brighter, and more well-known in circles of society who may or may not be seeking the truth. Remember that the Lord and the Holy Ghost will help you open your mouths so you may speak the words that are inyour heart.<br><br>The second scripture states: "For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God" (D&amp;amp;C 3:7). Have you found that you are fearful of giving offense to someone by speaking boldly of your belief in gospel principles? Are you worried that you will hurt someone's feelings or maybe even lose a friend by walking away from something you feel is unsavory or even evil? Do you fear being ridiculed and taunted for your beliefs? In times such as these you have to make eternal choices: whether you will serve man or God. When you stand as witnesses of your Savior, it should always be done with the spirit of the Holy Ghost guiding you. Being overbearing or filled with self-righteousness will not accomplish your intended meaning and will only turn others away.<br><br>You are here on a divine mission with wonderful promises and blessings available to you from your Heavenly Father. Remember the purposes for which you have come to earth. You have missions and miracles to perform for your Heavenly Father and prophecies to help fulfill. As you complete your education here, you will go out into the world hither and yon. You are the future leaders of the Church, of your communities, and, most important, of your future families. Let your influence be felt by those who know and love you by being true and faithful representatives of JesusChrist.<br><br>Yes, the young lad, John, did forget what he had promised his Heavenly Father when he was baptized many years ago, and thus he was drawn away from the teachings he had as a youth. He also forgot what Heavenly Father had promised him if he kept his covenants of serving the Lord and keeping His commandments. The Lord promised John that if he remained faithful, He would pour out His spirit more abundantly upon him (see Mosiah 18:10). As you take the sacrament each Sunday, you do it in remembrance of the Savior and the covenants you made at your baptism. You are recommitting to serve as His witness to the world. It is a time for you to remember your baptismal covenants and let them guide your lives each day so that you do not forget as Johndid.<br><br>"Enter to learn; go forth to serve" is often quoted on this campus to remind you of your purposes while at BYU and once you leave here. As part of my message to you today, I would just like to add to that admonition and ask you to "enter to learn; go forth to serve" as you stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ at all times, in all things, and in all places. I do have a testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ. Iknow that He loves us. I know that we have a prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who loves each one of us and will guide and lead us back to our Heavenly Father. It is my prayer that each of us will always remember and honor our baptismal covenants and always stand as witnesses of our Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Sharon G.

<h1>ggestions - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As is always the case at the beginning of a new year, I greet you with great pleasure, optimism, and gratitude for our current circumstances and what lies ahead in this winter semester and beyond. Thanks for being with us and for contributing to all that makes Brigham Young University the special and remarkable institution it is. I hope and expect you share my gratitude for these opportunities and also my positive feelings about what we may learn and experience in these first months of 2011.<br><br>Last October, during our annual Parents Weekend here on campus, I had the uplifting experience of meeting many parents and also students with whom I was not previously acquainted. I am always encouraged by the inspirational and touching accounts of what brings people to BYU and how they have been blessed and by our shared enthusiasm for this positively unique place.<br><br>One mother expressed gratitude that her student could be here while admitting that the adjustment for her daughter had been more difficult than she had anticipated. This thoughtful mother then asked me how our students might increase their chances and opportunities for satisfaction and success at BYU. She was not critical but was anxious to be as helpful as a mother could be in supporting her student in all of the adjustments required by coming to BYU.<br><br>The poet Henry David Thoreau once said with respect to achieving satisfaction and success, "If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours" (<i>Walden</i>[1854], 18, Conclusion). I believe this to be true--especially at BYU.<br><br>This morning I thought I might reflect on observations, personal experiences, and productive approaches we have observed in others that could be responsive to these questions and hopes concerning ways to find happy achievement while here. I have decided to focus on the BYU experience with the realization that most of the seven suggestions I advance also apply to life in general. At the outset, I confess no particular magic in the choice of the number seven, as there are many more topics that might be included if we were to stay here together all day. Likewise, my use of alliteration in naming these notions might be helpful in remembering them, but other phrases could be easily substituted.<br><br>Here are the seven I have chosen for today:<br><br>Self-Awareness<br>Self-Control<br>Service<br>Spirituality<br>Scriptures<br>Scholarship<br>Standards<br><br>None should be surprising and all might be self-evident. More can be said than I can express in our minutes together, but perhaps you will fill in the blanks where they are most needed for you. The order today is not important, but the propositions advanced are. All are significant and deserve our attention. While for purposes of this presentation I will discuss the seven suggestions separately, you will quickly notice that, in reality, they are closely related and integrated.<br><h2><b>Self-Awareness</b></h2><br>All of us need to have a clear awareness of who we are, what we represent, and how we affect and influence others. At BYU virtually all of us understand that we are literally spirit children of our Heavenly Father. This insight should and must color all decisions and choices we make in our lives, including and especially how we treat strangers and others in our families, classes, church groups, and neighborhoods. A favorite poem by the Scottish poet Robert Burns sums up much of importance in our need for self-awareness and the great risks and misunderstanding that can occur in our interactions with others.<br><br>Perhaps some of you can relate to Burns' circumstances that led to his poem "To a Louse." He was sitting in church and noticed a louse, a bug, crawl into the carefully styled hair and bonnet of a beautiful young lady seated immediately in front of him in the next pew. While I can understand the Scottish dialect, I can't really speak it, so I will paraphrase just part of the last stanza. The point he was making was that many in the congregation also apparently saw this bug light on the young woman. She, in turn, became aware of their attention and likely thought it was the result of her beauty, since she did not know of the small visitor crawling toward her head. This then is Burns' observation with my Provo translation:<br><br><i>Oh, would some Power the gift to give us<br>To see ourselves as others see us!<br>It would from many a blunder free us,<br>And foolish notion.</i><br>[See "To a Louse" (1786), stanza 8]<br><br>An important part of being self-aware is to understand how we influence for good or ill others around us by how we act, speak, and respond.<br><h2><b>Self-Control</b></h2><br>President David O. McKay, the prophet of my youth, spoke often about the importance of self-mastery, or self-control. Let me share just one example of what he said, because he was speaking to people just like us:<br><br><i>True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature or art, but in the development of character. True education awakens a desire to conserve health by keeping the body clean and undefiled. True education trains in self-denial and self-mastery. True education regulates the temper, subdues passion and makes obedience to social laws and moral order a guiding principle of life. It develops reason and inculcates faith in the living God as the eternal loving Father of all.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1928, 102]<br><br>While President McKay did not live during the time of the Internet, texting, tweeting, reality television, MP3 players, or social networking, the principles he taught are just as vital today as they were in the 20th century. Weall know the blessings of appropriate self-control and the heartache attached to addictions or indiscretions of every kind. Just like King Benjamin, we can't list all the ways we need to practice self-control, but King Benjamin's advice is also absolutely timely:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i><br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i>[Mosiah 4:29–30]<br><h2><b>Service</b></h2><br>One of things that has impressed me in my BYU years is how much significant service really goes on at and originates from BYU. This includes not only the thousands of students who give so freely of time and talent but also the tremendous examples of faculty, staff, and administrators in ways too numerous to mention individually. Many have learned that service to others is fundamental to our doctrine because of remarkable and meaningful service that has emanated from this university. While our aspiration that everyone who enters our buildings and classrooms would be involved in consequential service as part of the BYU experience has yet to be fully realized, we commend and thank those of you who contribute so much in such substantive ways. Our prophet and board chairman, President Thomas S. Monson, is a most worthy model ofreflexive service to others.<br><br>In Sister Heidi Swinton's introduction to her wonderful biography of President Monson, entitled<i>To the Rescue,</i>she describes him in comparison to the Savior Jesus Christ in terms of the service to others that he renders:<br><br><i>So it is with President Monson. He too goes to the weary and often forsaken, lays hands on their heads, and, in his singularly recognizable voice, provides inspired counsel. "I firmly believe," he has said many times, "that the sweetest experience in mortality is to know that our Heavenly Father has worked through us to accomplish an objective in the life of another person"--to help make someone whole.</i>[Introduction,<i>To the Rescue: The Biography of Thomas S. Monson</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2010), 4]<br><br>You are all very busy. So is President Monson. Thanks for your service and thanks to President Monson for his inspiring example to all of us about the fundamental responsibility we have to serve.<br><h2><b>Spirituality</b></h2><br>As I hope it is very clear to everyone in this academic community, we aspire to strengthen your testimonies and spirituality with every bit as much emphasis as we strive to have you experience the thrill of scholarly achievement in your chosen disciplines. It is not uncommon for us to hear that students and faculty at other universities consider themselves to be spiritual but not necessarily religious. At BYU we consider spirituality to be part of our religion and try to have the ministrations of the Holy Ghost in our studies and in our work as one of the first principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Indeed, we subscribe without reservation to the statement of the Lord found in the Doctrine and Covenants that we "seek learning, even by study and also by faith." We do this by teaching each other "words of wisdom" and gain this wisdom from the "best books" and other sources available to us (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>I hope we all remember that one of the fundamental and foundational charges to Karl G. Maeser by President Brigham Young was "not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: ABiography by His Son</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79). Succeeding prophets from the time of Brigham Young to the present with President Monson have emphasized the inclusiveness of this notion in all that we do at BYU. Just as you should not be satisfied with an education that omits essential elements of mastery in your chosen major or emphasis, you should not leave BYU without your testimony being strengthened and your gospel knowledge being greatly enhanced. Thus your religion classes are part of the BYU core, and your experiences in your ward and stake while here add to the preparation the prophets have foreseen as necessary to equip you properly to live the gospel and serve all Heavenly Father's children effectively and well.<br><h2><b>Scriptures</b></h2><br>One of the best ways to enhance your spirituality and gospel understanding is by regularly, frequently, and reverently feasting upon the scriptures. Obviously, this entails reading the scriptures intently and thoughtfully, but more is necessary. As the prophet Nephi explained, we should "liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23). It is one thing to read the scriptures because we have been asked or charged to do so. It is an entirely different matter to search them to find answers and understanding for our own problems, challenges, and possibilities. Moroni's general promise concerning how we may know the truth of the Book of Mormon also applies to specific questions or dilemmas. And it is with the pattern of "study and also by faith" previously referenced that answers are gained from the scriptures. All missionaries and serious gospel students remember this promise:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i>[Moroni 10:4–5]<br><br>You might be thinking, "I know this." Why would we be spending our precious time this morning reviewing something we know so well and have perhaps taught to others dozens of times? I will answer this question by sharing another account that you also likely know well. Recall the experience of Oliver Cowdery, who had been the scribe for most of the translation of the Book of Mormon and had had several revelatory experiences himself. He sought the opportunity to translate rather than just fulfill his sacred privilege as scribe to the Prophet Joseph. The Lord promised him the privilege, but the otherwise faithful Oliver didn't proceed as he should have, and the opportunity to translate was withdrawn. These are the words of the Lord to Oliver, and they can apply to us as well:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>Perhaps you now see why I have considered spirituality and scriptures adjacent to each other. It is because they are in reality inextricably connected. We will now move to the next suggestion, which is also tied directly to these two and to your success at BYU.<br><h2><b>Scholarship</b></h2><br>As you current students know better than anyone else, Brigham Young University is a very serious academic institution with an outstanding student body, a distinguished and able faculty, and a charge from our board to be the best that we can be. It would be fair to suggest that even though we take faith, testimony, dating and marriage, church activity, and spirituality very seriously, we do not use these as excuses to detract from our standards of excellence in scholarship for students and faculty alike. While we strongly encourage--as I have just done--your active involvement in service, religious observance, and finding an eternal companion, you must never forget that your primary reason for being at BYU is to make the most of the academic opportunities afforded you that will never again be possible in the same way they are now. How well you do in your studies will establish a record and experience you will carry with you and will in large part help determine the possibilities available to you in the future. If you live a balanced life that gives ample space for scholarly pursuits, then you will be successful at BYU and throughout life.<br><h2><b>Standards</b></h2><br>The concept of high standards is an aspect of everything we do at BYU. Of special note and significant importance is our Honor Code, to which everyone at BYU has subscribed and pledged to follow. Some components of the Honor Code may seem more important than others and certainly are. In the aggregate, it is a representation of not only what the university and its board expect of you but also a reflection of what you should expect of yourself. Some would wish to devote time and energy to quibbling about a detail here or an emphasis there. In reality, we should be focused on what our own honor and integrity mean to us. In the abstract, very few--if any--in our campus community would advocate for dishonesty, immodesty, disrespect for others, slovenly behaviors or appearances, or other disagreeable attitudes or actions.<br><br>Unfortunately, some occasionally feel compelled, or at least licensed, to push the proverbial envelope. Please stay away from the line of deviance. Please recommit to living and acting--even of thinking and feeling--as you have agreed to do in accepting an appointment as part of the BYU community. Your honor is important to us, and it must be to you as well.<br><br>As I conclude, let me congratulate so many of you who are living and vibrant examples of these seven suggestions for success at BYU I have mentioned. For those who are struggling with one or more of these ideas, let me encourage you to keep trying and to do your best. As you strive and work, your capacity will increase and your satisfaction will be enhanced with the joy of success in this remarkable adventure at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I am grateful to be here with you. I am grateful to know that the hand of heaven rests on this institution with the loving support and guidance of the Lord's living prophets. Isustain them, as you do, and bear testimony of the Father and the Son who make all blessings real and possible for each of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>ve Us This Day Our Daily Bread&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We older adults, including parents and Church leaders and professors and friends, often admonish you to plan for the future. We encourage you to pursue education and vocational training as preparation for life in the years ahead. We urge you to lay a foundation for marriage and family and to act on those plans. We caution you to think of possible consequences down the road when making decisions about what you do today (for example, what you put on the Internet). We counsel you to think about how you will measure success in your life and then to establish the patterns and practices that will lead to thatsuccess.<br><br>All of this expresses a wise and prudent course in life, and in what I say tonight, I do not minimize in any way the importance of thinking and planning ahead. Thoughtful planning and preparation are key to a rewarding future, but we do not live in the future--we live in the present. It is day by day that we work out our plans for the future; it is day by day that we achieve our goals. It is one day at a time that we raise and nurture our families. It is one day at a time that we overcome imperfections. We endure in faith to the end one day at a time. It is the accumulation of many days well lived that adds up to a full life and a saintly person. And so I would like to talk toyou about living well day by day.<br><h2><strong>Look to God for What Is Needed Each Day</strong></h2><br>In Luke it is recorded that one of His disciples asked Jesus, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples" (Luke 11:1). Jesus then gave a pattern for prayer that has become known as the Lord's Prayer. The same is recorded in Matthew as part of the Sermon on the Mount (see Matthew 6:9–13).<br><br>Included in the Lord's Prayer is the petition "Give us this day our daily bread" (Matthew 6:11) or "Give us day by day our daily bread" (Luke 11:3). I believe that we would all readily acknowledge that we have needs each day that we want our Heavenly Father's help in dealing with. For some, on some days, it is quite literally bread--that is, the food needed to sustain life that day. It could also be spiritual and physical strength to deal with one more day of chronic illness or a painfully slow rehabilitation. In other cases it may be less tangible needs, such as things related to one's obligations or activities in that day--teaching alesson or taking a test, for example.<br><br>Jesus is teaching us, His disciples, that we should look to God each day for the bread--the help and sustenance--we require in that particular day. This is consistent with the counsel to<br><br><i>pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</i>[2 Nephi 32:9]<br><br>The Lord's invitation to seek our daily bread at our Heavenly Father's hand speaks of a loving God, aware of even the small, daily needs of His children and anxious to assist them, one by one. He is saying that we can ask in faith of that Being "that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given" (James 1:5). That is, of course, tremendously reassuring, but there is something at work here that is more significant than just help in getting by day to day. As we seek and receive divine bread daily, our faith and trust in God and HisSon grow.<br><h2><strong>Looking to God Daily for Our Needs Nurtures Faith</strong></h2><br>You will remember the great exodus of the tribes of Israel from Egypt and the 40 years in the wilderness before entering their promised land. This massive host of well over a million people had to be fed. Certainly that number in one location could not long subsist on hunting game, and their seminomadic lifestyle at the time was not conducive to raising crops or livestock in any sufficient quantity. Jehovah solved the challenge by miraculously providing their daily bread from heaven--manna. This small edible substance which appeared on the ground each morning was something quite new and unknown. The name<i>manna,</i>in fact, was derived from words meaning "What is it?" Through Moses, the Lord instructed the people to gather enough each day for that day, except on the day before the Sabbath, when they were to gather enough for two days.<br><br>At the beginning, despite Moses's specific instructions, some tried to gather more than enough for one day and store the balance:<br><br><i>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</i><br><br><i>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank.</i>[Exodus 16:19–20]<br><br>As promised, however, when they gathered twice the normal daily quantity of manna on the sixth day, it did not spoil:<br><br><i>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</i><br><br><i>And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</i><br><br><i>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</i>[Exodus 16:24–26]<br><br>Again, however, some could not believe without seeing, and they went looking to gather manna on the Sabbath.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</i><br><br><i>See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</i>[Exodus 16:28–29]<br><br>It seems that even in ancient times, as today, there were some people who couldn't resist shopping on the Sabbath.<br><br>By providing a daily sustenance, one day at a time, Jehovah was trying to teach faith to a nation that over a period of some 400 years had lost much of the faith of their fathers. He was teaching them to trust Him, to "look unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:36). He was providing enough for one day at a time. Except for the sixth day, they could not store manna for use in any succeeding day or days. In essence, the children of Israel had to walk with Him today and trust that He would grant a sufficient amount of food for the next day<i>on</i>the next day, and so on. In that way He could never be too far from their minds and hearts.<br><br>We should note, by the way, that 40 years of manna was not meant to become a dole. Once the tribes of Israel were in a position to provide for themselves, they were required to do so. After they had crossed the Jordan River and were prepared to begin their conquest of Canaan, beginning at Jericho, the scripture records that<br><br><i>they did eat of the old corn of the land</i>[that is, the previous year's harvest]<i>on the morrow after the passover. ...</i><br><br><i>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</i>[Joshua 5:11–12]<br><br>Likewise, as we plead with God for our daily bread--for help in the moment that we cannot ourselves provide--we must still be active in doing and providing that which<i>is</i>within our power.<br><h2><strong>Trust in the Lord--Solutions May Come overTime</strong></h2><br>Some time before I was called as a General Authority, I faced a personal economic challenge that persisted for several years. It did not come about as a consequence of anyone's wrongdoing or ill will; it was just one of those things that sometimes come into our lives. It ebbed and flowed in seriousness and urgency, but it never went away completely. At times this challenge threatened the welfare of my family and me, and I thought we might be facing financial ruin. I prayed for some miraculous intervention to deliver us. Although I offered that prayer many times with great sincerity and earnest desire, the answer in the end was "No." Finally I learned to pray as the Savior did: "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). I sought the Lord's help with each tiny step along the way to a final resolution.<br><br>There were times when I had exhausted all my resources, when I had nowhere or no one to turn to at that moment, when there was simply no other human being I could call on to help meet the exigency before me. With no other recourse, more than once I fell down before my Heavenly Father begging in tears for His help. And He did help. Sometimes it was nothing more than a sense of peace, a feeling of assurance that things would work out. I might not see how or what the path would be, but He gave me to know that, directly or indirectly, He would open a way. Circumstances might change, a new and helpful idea might come to mind, some unanticipated income or other resource might appear at just the right time. Somehow there was a resolution.<br><br>Though I suffered then, as I look back now, I am grateful that there was not a quick solution to my problem. The fact that I was forced to turn to God for help almost daily over an extended period of years taught me truly how to pray and get answers to prayer and taught me in a very practical way to have faith in God. I came to know my Savior and my Heavenly Father in a way and to a degree that might not have happened otherwise or that might have taken me much longer to achieve. I learned that daily bread is a precious commodity. I learned that manna today can be as real as the physical manna of biblical history. I learned to trust in the Lord with all my heart. I learned to walk with Him day by day.<br><h2><strong>Work Through Large Problems in Small, Daily Bites</strong></h2><br>Asking God for our daily bread, rather than our weekly, monthly, or yearly bread, is also a way to focus us on the smaller, more manageable bits of a problem. To deal with something very big, we may need to work at it in small, daily bites. Sometimes all we can handle is one day (or even just part of one day) at a time. Letme give you a nonscriptural example.<br><br>A book I read recently, titled<i>Lone Survivor,</i>recounts the tragic story of a four-man team of U.S. Navy SEALs on a covert mission in a remote sector of Afghanistan five and one-half years ago. When they were inadvertently discovered by shepherds--two men and a boy--these specially trained Navy servicemen had a choice either to kill the three or let them go, knowing that if they let them live they would disclose the team's location and they would be attacked immediately by al Qaeda and Taliban forces. Nevertheless, they let the innocent shepherds go, and in the firefight that followed, only the author, Marcus Luttrell, survived against well over 100 attackers.<br><br>In his book, Luttrell recounts the extreme training and endurance required for one to qualify as a SEAL in the U.S. Navy. In Luttrell's training group, for example, of the 164 men who began, only 32 managed to complete the course. They endured weeks of near-constant physical exertion, in and out of cold ocean water, swimming, paddling and carrying inflatable boats, running in sand, doing hundreds of push-ups a day, carrying logs through obstacle courses, and so forth. They were in a near-perpetual state of exhaustion.<br><br>I was impressed by something a senior officer said to the group as they began the final and most demanding phase of their training. He said:<br><br><i>"First of all, I do not want you to give in to the pressure of the moment. Whenever you're hurting bad, just hang in there. Finish the day. Then, if you're still feeling bad, think about it long and hard before you decide to quit. Second, take it one day at a time. One</i>[phase]<i>at a time.</i><br><br><i>"Don't let your thoughts run away with you, don't start planning to bail out because you're worried about the future and how much you can take. Don't look ahead to the pain. Just get through the day, and there's a wonderful career ahead of you."</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Generally it is good to try to anticipate what is coming and prepare to deal with it. At times, however, this captain's counsel is wise: "Take it one day at a time. ... Don't look ahead to the pain. Just get through the day." To worry about what is or may be coming can be debilitating. Itcan paralyze us and make us quit.<br><br>In the 1950s my mother survived radical cancer surgery, but difficult as that was, the surgery was followed with dozens of painful radiation treatments in what would now be considered rather primitive medical conditions. She recalls that her mother taught her something during that time that has helped herever since:<br><br><i>I was so sick and weak, and I said to her one day, "Oh, Mother, I can't stand having 16 more of those treatments."</i><br><br><i>She said, "Can you go today?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes."</i><br><br><i>"Well, honey, that's all you have to do today."</i><br><br><i>It has helped me many times when I remember totake one day or one thing at a time.</i><br><br>The Spirit can guide us when to look ahead and when we should just deal with this one day, with this one moment. If we ask, the Lord will let us know through the Holy Ghost when it may be appropriate for us to apply in our lives the commandment He gave His ancient Apostles: "Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof" (3 Nephi 13:34; see also Matthew 6:34).<br><h2><strong>God's "Daily Bread" Is Needed in Reaching Our Potential</strong></h2><br>I have suggested that asking for and receiving daily bread at God's hand plays a vital part in learning to trust God and in enduring life's challenges. We also need a daily portion of divine bread to become what we must become. To repent, improve, and eventually reach "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13), as Paul expressed it, is a step-by-step process. Incorporating new and wholesome habits into our character or overcoming bad habits or addictions most often means an effort today followed by another tomorrow, and then another, perhaps for many days, even months and years, until victory is achieved. But we can do it because we can appeal to God for our daily bread, for the help we need eachday.<br><br>This is the season of New Year's resolutions, and I would like to quote to you the words of President N. Eldon Tanner, formerly a counselor in the First Presidency:<br><br><i>As we reflect on the value of resolving to do better, let us determine to discipline ourselves to carefully select the resolutions we make, to consider the purpose for making them, and finally, to make commitments for keeping them and not letting any obstacle stop us. Let us remind ourselves at the beginning of each day that we can keep a resolution just for that day. As we do this it gets easier and easier until it becomes a habit.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>A little over a year ago, Elder David A. Bednar spoke about consistency in simple daily practices such as family prayer, scripture study, and home evenings as being crucial in building successful families. Consistent effort in seemingly small, daily steps is a key principle in achieving any great work, including progress in the pathway of discipleship. As an object lesson, Elder Bednar compared daily acts to individual brushstrokes in a painting that together, over time, produce a work of art. Hesaid:<br><br><i>In my office is a beautiful painting of a wheat field. The painting is a vast collection of individual brushstrokes--none of which in isolation is very interesting or impressive. In fact, if you stand close to the canvas, all you can see is a mass of seemingly unrelated and unattractive streaks of yellow and gold and brown paint. However, as you gradually move away from the canvas, all of the individual brushstrokes combine together and produce a magnificent landscape of a wheat field. ...</i><br><br><i>... Just as the yellow and gold and brown strokes of paint complement each other and produce an impressive masterpiece, so our consistency in doing seemingly small things can lead to significant spiritual results. "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson, speaking of repentance, gave this counsel:<br><br><i>We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more</i>[Christlike],<i>that we do not become discouraged and lose hope. Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible. The scriptures record remarkable accounts of men whose lives changed dramatically, in an instant, as it were: Alma the Younger, Paul on the road to Damascus, Enos praying far into the night, King Lamoni. Such astonishing examples of the power to change even those steeped in sin give confidence that the Atonement can reach even those deepest in despair.</i><br><br><i>But we must be cautious as we discuss these remarkable examples. Though they are real and powerful, they are the exception more than the rule. For every Paul, for every Enos, and for every King Lamoni, there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance much more subtle, much more imperceptible. Day by day they move closer to the Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life. They live quiet lives of goodness, service, and commitment. ...</i><br><br><i>We must not lose hope. Hope is an anchor to the souls of men. Satan would have us cast away that anchor. In this way he can bring discouragement and surrender. But we must not lose hope. The Lord is pleased with every effort, even the tiny, daily ones in which we strive to be more like Him.</i><sup>4</sup><br><h2><strong>Seek the Lord's Help in Serving Others</strong></h2><br>Remember that we should not only be looking inward when we seek a daily measure of divine bread. If we are to become more like the Master, He who came "not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Mark 10:45), we will seek His help in being of service to our fellowman day by day.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson lives this principle better than anyone I know. There is ever present in his heart a prayer that God will reveal needs and means for him to assist those around him in any given day or moment of the day. One example from his time as a bishop illustrates the fact that sometimes even a little effort may, with the workings of the Spirit, yield remarkable fruit. I quote from Heidi Swinton's biography of President Monson,<i>To the Rescue:</i><br><br><i>One to whom</i>[President Monson]<i>reached out was Harold Gallacher. His wife and children were active in the Church, but not Harold. His daughter Sharon had asked Bishop Monson if he would "do something" to bring her father back into activity. As a bishop, he felt prompted one day to call on Harold. It was a hot summer's day when he knocked on Harold's screen door. The bishop could see Harold sitting in his chair, smoking a cigarette and reading the newspaper. "Who is it?" Harold asked sullenly, without looking up.</i><br><br><i>"Your bishop," Tom replied. "I've come to get acquainted and to urge your attendance with your family at our meetings."</i><br><br><i>"No, I'm too busy," came the disdainful response. He never looked up. Tom thanked him for listening and departed the doorstep. The family moved without Harold ever attending services.</i><br><br><i>Years later, a Brother Gallacher phoned the office of Elder Thomas S. Monson and asked to make an appointment to see him.</i><br><br><i>"Ask him if his name is Harold G. Gallacher," Elder Monson told his secretary, "and if he lived at 55 Vissing Place and had a daughter named Sharon." When the secretary did, Harold was startled that Elder Monson remembered such details. When the two met some time later, they embraced. Harold said, "I've come to apologize for not getting out of my chair and letting you in the door that summer day long years ago." Elder Monson asked him if he were active in the Church. With a wry smile, Harold replied: "I'm now second counselor in my ward bishopric. Your invitation to come out to church, and my negative response, so haunted me that I determined to do something about it."</i><sup>5</sup><br><h2><strong>Daily Choices Have Eternal Consequences</strong></h2><br>Thinking of our daily bread keeps us aware of the details of our lives, of the significance of the small things that occupy our days. Experience teaches that in a marriage, for example, a steady stream of simple kindnesses, help, and attention do much more to keep love alive and nurture the relationship than an occasional grand or expensive gesture. That is not to say, brethren--you who are married--that your wife wouldn't appreciate something new and really nice to wear or occasionally some other gift that expresses, with an exclamation point, how you feel about her (within the parameters, of course, of your miserable budget). It's just that a constant, daily expression of affection, in both words and actions, is far more meaningful in the long run.<br><br>Likewise, in daily choices we may prevent certain insidious influences from entering our lives and becoming part of what we are. In an informal discussion that Elder Neal A. Maxwell and I had some years ago with a priesthood leader in a stake conference setting, we observed that one can avoid most pornography and pornographic images just by making good choices. For the most part it is simply a matter of self-discipline not to go where pornography is likely to be found--physically or in cyberspace. We acknowledged, nevertheless, that because it is so tragically pervasive, pornography could assault a person minding his own business quite by surprise. "Yes," observed Elder Maxwell, "but he can immediately reject it. He does not have to invite it to come in and offer it a chair to sit down." So with other influences and habits--slovenly appearance, carelessness in conduct, abusive and profane language, unkind criticism, procrastination, and so on--our attention each day to avoiding the very beginnings of such things can protect us from awakening some future day to the realization that because of inattentiveness, some evil or weakness has taken root in our soul.<br><br>In reality, there aren't very many things in a day that are totally without significance. Even the mundane and repetitious can be tiny but significant building blocks that in time establish the discipline and character and order needed to realize our plans and dreams. Therefore, as you ask in prayer for your daily bread, consider thoughtfully your needs--both what you may lack and what you must protect against. As you retire to bed, think about the successes and failures of the day and what will make the next day a little better. And thank your Heavenly Father for the manna He has placed along your path that sustained you through the day. Your reflections will increase your faith in Him as you see His hand helping you to endure some things and to change others. You will be able to rejoice in one more day, one more step toward eternal life.<br><h2><strong>Jesus Christ Is the Bread of Life</strong></h2><br>Above all, remember that we have Him of whom manna was a type and symbol, the very Bread of Life, the Redeemer.<br><br><i>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. ...</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</i><br><br><i>I am that bread of life.</i><br><br><i>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</i><br><br><i>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</i><br><br><i>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</i>[John 6:35, 47–51]<br><br>I bear you my witness of the living reality of the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ, and of the infinite power and reach of His Atonement. Ultimately, it is His Atonement, His grace, that is our daily bread. We should seek Him daily, to do His will each day, to become one with Him as He is one with the Father (see John 17:20–23). I bless you that as you seek it from Him, your Heavenly Father will grant you your daily bread, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>D.

<h1>ou Open Your Heart to Heaven? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great honor for me to stand before you, my brothers and sisters. As I contemplated what subject I should discuss, rather than academic things, I chose as my theme today "How Do You Open Your Heart to Heaven?"<br><h2><b>"The Natural Man Is an Enemy to God"</b></h2><br>When I have traveled around the world, Ihave observed an increase in the number of people experiencing anxieties, fears, doubts, impatience, indifference, and confusion, even hatred--especially those with very dark feelings, self-pity, and pure anger. Many live with unsteadiness, depression, frustrations, and pessimism. Generally in the world we see situations of jealousy, slothfulness, disloyalty, rudeness, and even revenge toward each other. It has become common to see people who are boldly dishonest regarding their wrong actions.<br><br>My dear friends, when you step away from gospel principles, you will be greatly tempted to do many evil things of the world, and then you will develop great spiritual sickness.<br><br>When we have too much pride, become too critical, complain, speak with sarcasm, or are self-indulgent and impatient, then we become trapped in the pit of the adversary. These negative qualities develop when we are too "prideful" and live a self-centered life. Truly, "the natural man is an enemy to God."<sup>1</sup><br><h2><b>How to Avoid Contaminated, Contagious Spiritual Sickness</b></h2><br>How can we avoid these things? I ask you: How can we be more cheerful and enthusiastic? How can we be more polite, kind, and sincere and show genuine concern for other people and be patient, especially with family and friends? How can we increase our temperance and be more humble and submissive to the Lord? How can we have increased godly love and be more positive and bring more energy into our lives? How can we increase our self-mastery, self-discipline, and self-control? How can we better govern ourselves and be more honest and true to the teachings of Heavenly Father? How can we exercise our God-given moral agency in inspiring ways?<br><h2><b>"I Am the True Vine"</b></h2><br>There are ways to avoid spiritual sickness. Our Savior is the greatest source and the solution for any challenge we face. We can improve our sacred relationship with Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ daily.<br><br>Jesus said: "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Our Heavenly Father is the Farmer. The Savior is the Vine. We are the grapes. Every day we must cultivate spiritual nourishment from the Vine. The Lord said: "I am the vine, yeare the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit."<sup>3</sup><br><br>He then said, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."<sup>4</sup><br><br>The Lord personally testified, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"<sup>5</sup>and "I am the light which shineth in darkness."<sup>6</sup><br><h2><b>Ways We Can Develop Our Own Celestial Peace of Mind</b></h2><br>How do you obtain more humility and celestial nourishment from the Lord? The Savior gives you the key and His powerful promise:<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, my friends, I leave these sayings with you to ponder in your hearts, with thiscommandment which I give unto you, that ye shall call upon me while I am near--</i><br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Let me suggest three basic, simple principles you can follow daily to cultivate, increase, and deepen your spirituality:<br><br>1. Hold a personal morning devotional<br><br>2. Immerse yourself in the scriptures<br><br>3. Purify your life through the Savior's sanctifying and atoning power<br><br>Let me explain these principles to you.<br><h3><i><b>1. Hold a Personal Morning Devotional</b></i></h3><br>How would you like to have your personal morning devotional in your "Sacred Grove"? I am not talking about the sacred experiences Joseph Smith had in the Sacred Grove.<br><br>Our prophet, President Monson, shared his insight:<br><br><i>The boy prophet Joseph Smith sought heavenly help by entering a grove which then became sacred. Do we need similar strength? Does each need to seek his or her own "Sacred Grove"? A place where communication between God and man can go forth unimpeded, uninterrupted, and undisturbed is such a grove.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>One day Elder Marion D. Hanks, now an emeritus General Authority, shared with me an experience he had as a young General Authority. He asked President David O. McKay, "How would you suggest I maintain my spirituality?"<br><br>President McKay said he did five simple things every day:<br><br><i>I arise early.</i><br><br><i>I wash my body.</i><br><br><i>I put on my new linen.</i><br><br><i>I subdue my spirit before the Father.</i><br><br><i>I wait for the inspiration of the Father.</i><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I would like to invite you to wake up a little early--not super early, because it won't last, but reasonably early; maybe 20 or 25 minutes earlier than you do now. Wash your body; shave; put on washed, fresh underwear; comb your hair; and put on your clothes.<br><br>Then find a very peaceful, secluded place that can be your own Sacred Grove and go there. Now, I am not suggesting you go to your backyard among the trees and kneel in the snow.<br><br>Humbly, reverently, kneel before the Father. Call upon His holy name through His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Express your love for Him. Express gratitude from your heart to Heavenly Father. I will not dictate how long you should stay there. You decide.<br><br>In your morning devotional you can have your divine and holy fellowship with Heavenly Father in your own Sacred Grove every day. This helps you to cultivate your special relationship with Heavenly Father through His Son, Jesus Christ. What a glorious privilege that is for you and me.<br><br>If you will do this, my brothers and sisters, I promise you humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, that your life will be changed. You will feel close to your Heavenly Father--closer than ever before.<br><br>Some mornings you will feel overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. You will just want to cry. These overwhelming, strong feelings tell you that Heavenly Father loves you so much. You will personally feel the love of God as you have never felt it before. You will feel and know: "Iam a child of God! My Father loves me! He sent His Beloved Son to us! My Savior loves meso much."<br><br>When you hold a personal morning devotional every day, I promise you again that your life will be changed. Joseph Smith also promised us: "If you will obey the Gospel with honest hearts, I promise you in the name of the Lord, that the gifts as promised by our Saviour will follow you."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Again, as President Monson taught: "Does each need to seek his or her own 'Sacred Grove'? A place ... unimpeded, uninterrupted, and undisturbed."<sup>10</sup>Please call on Heavenly Father and talk to Him reverently. He wants you to remember Him and to call upon Him.<sup>11</sup><br><h3><i><b>2. Immerse Yourself in the Scriptures</b></i></h3><br>When you immerse yourself in the scriptures, you come to know the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Another time He said:<br><br><i>I am the bread which came down from heaven....</i><br><br><i>I am that bread of life....</i><br><br><i>... If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>After returning from your personal Sacred Grove, can you spend seven to eight minutes every morning reading the words of life?<br><br>Nephi taught:<br><br><i>I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation</i>of the love of God;<i>and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>In order to be acquainted with the voice of the Lord, read the Book of Mormon and other scriptures daily.<sup>15</sup>By reading the Book of Mormon "you may know the righteous from the wicked."<sup>16</sup>You can escape darkness.<sup>17</sup>The Book of Mormon prophets powerfully testify that Jesus is your Savior. By reading the Book of Mormon you will come to know that Jesus is your personal Savior. I suggest you read from the Book of Mormon seven to eight minutes every single morning before you leave for class.<br><br>I promise you in the name of Jesus Christ, when you read "the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon,"<sup>18</sup>daily, you will come to know He is your personal Savior.<sup>19</sup>You will not treat "lightly the things you [and I] have received."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Jesus came to this world<sup>21</sup>and died on Calvary.<sup>22</sup>Three days later He was resurrected<sup>23</sup>and appeared to a multitude of people. Even on the American continent He appeared to thousands of people.<sup>24</sup>Father in Heaven introduced Him. And the Savior testified Himself, "I am Jesus Christ."<sup>25</sup><br><br>I know in early spring of 1820, the resurrected Jesus Christ accompanied His Holy Father and appeared to Joseph Smith.<sup>26</sup>I know that Joseph saw Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<br><h3><i><b>3. Purify Your Life Through the Savior's Sanctifying and Atoning Power</b></i></h3><br>The third thing you ought to consider to become closer to Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is to sanctify and purify yourself and become clean before the Father and the Son.<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br><i>But no man is possessor of all things except he be purified and cleansed from all sin.</i><br><br><i>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>The word<i>atonement</i>is not from Latin or Greek. Its origin is English: "'At one' with a very special someone." It implies becoming bonded, cemented, and "at one" with a special Person--even Jesus Christ.<br><br>As long as you are worthy, pure, and clean, your conscience will be free from guilt from sin in the presence of the Father. Then the Savior's atoning power will affect each one of us.<br><br>However, when we are not worthy because of sin, we are uncomfortable and do not feel inner peace, and His glorious Atonement will have no effect on us.<br><br>The Lord allows us the principle of repentance.<br><br>Now I want to demonstrate something: President Samuelson, would you come and help me? (President Samuelson came up to the podium.)<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this is your president. But imagine that your personal Savior is standing in President Samuelson's place. You can feel His glorious, celestial glow. His infinite, atoning, and eternal love permeates from Him to your bosom. You feel His love and kindness. You feel His majestic, everlasting mercy and grace. You can feel it. You cry because of the incredible celestial love He has for you.<br><br>May we be worthy before the Lord. It is thus that we are able to have this perfect and sacred relationship: being one with the Savior. Let me shake hands with President Samuelson. This is a perfect relationship--with oneness. If I am not worthy, I will feel I ought to depart.<br><br>Oh, my brothers and sisters, may we stay in true oneness--at one--with the Lord Savior, Jesus Christ. Thank you, President Samuelson.<br><br>The Lord promised you and me, "I am able to make you holy, and your sins are forgiven you."<sup>28</sup>The Lord said, "He who has repented of his [or her] sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more."<sup>29</sup><br><br>Let me repeat that: "I, the Lord, remember them no more." When you are pure and clean before the Lord, I promise you that the Lord inspires you and envelops you. Again I testify to you that He blesses you with His powerful atoning power so that you and I can be perfectly one with Him. His atoning power will have an effect upon each one of us.<br><h2><b>He Will Send Us the Comforter</b></h2><br>The Lord promised that He would send us the Comforter.<sup>30</sup>As we cleanse and purify ourselves through His great, atoning power, this great Comforter blesses and heals us. When you become clean and pure, then the Holy Ghost is working on you.<br><br>Elder Parley P. Pratt once gave this description:<br><br>[The Holy Ghost]<i>quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates, and gives tone to the nerves.

<h1>ls of a Saint - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The operation on the infected leg of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives us a story about nobility and the comfort that comes from faith in a loving father. There is also another, less well-known lesson hidden in this story. The doctor attending Joseph at the end of the ordeal is sometimes portrayed as a humble country doctor with uncertain skills. But Elder Neal A. Maxwell pointed out that this was not the case, citing Dr. LeRoy S. Wirthlin, a Latter-day Saint doctor who researched the event:<br><br><i>The medical doctor in final attendance ... was Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of the Dartmouth Medical School. He brought two doctors and several medical students with him to attend to young Joseph. ... Dr. Nathan Smith was highly qualified, and he was using a very advanced technique. Thus "the only man in America who could save [Joseph's] leg was just five miles away."</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Elder Maxwell then went on to explain how Dr. Smith happened to be in the vicinity of Joseph Smith's home because his plans to leave the area were "delayed by a typhoid epidemic."<sup>2</sup><br><br>In addition to the academic and spiritual knowledge you are gaining at BYU, the skills you are developing are also very important--though, like Dr. Smith, you probably do not now understand how important they will be, nor to whom they will be valuable. When Dr. Smith's skills were needed, the Lord managed the circumstances to make them available to Joseph when and where they were critically needed.<br><br>Skill, even specialized skill, plays an important role in the Lord's plans. We are told that the Lord often answers our prayers through the ministrations of our family, friends, neighbors, and church leaders. In the case of Joseph's leg, it was a stranger who had the necessary skill to save his leg. As Saints we are taught to rely on God to watch over us and to supply our needs, but we also have the responsibility to prepare ourselves however possible against a time of need. That's why we follow the counsel of the prophets to strive to obtain all of the education we possibly can. Brigham Young described the scope of the skills and knowledge we might consider cultivating: "Every accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful attainment in mathematics, music, and in all science and art belong to the Saints."<sup>3</sup><br><br>We do not rely on the arm of flesh, but a steady, experienced arm in the time of need, guided by the Spirit of God, can make a difference: "To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>4</sup>This includes learning in useful skills.<br><br>Many of us have patriarchal blessings that advise us to cultivate our abilities in a particular area. I would like to share with you some of my own understandings about skills and how they might figure into our ability to perform our earthly missions.<br><br>We could begin by asking, "How pervasive are skills in our everyday actions?" Some skills are easy to spot: reading is a skill; driving is a skill; so are walking, speaking, and using a spoon to eat with. You younger students don't remember how hard that last skill was to master, but those who are parents know how strange this skill is to a new learner--something to reflect on as you clean up the mess the baby made after dinner.<br><br>Some skills are more subtle and difficult to spot, like making an accurate diagnosis on a car engine that won't start. Communicating an idea effectively is a skill; teaching is a skill; and controlling your emotions is a skill.<br><br>Some of these less noticeable skills have important applications at times when souls are being influenced for good or in tender moments when spirits are being healed. Giving comfort to a bereaved friend can be helped by knowledge born of experience. Knowing as a parent when to listen to a child and when to talk is a skill that we learn--sometimes from analyzing our own mistakes. Knowing how to be a true and loyal friend to someone who is hard on friends, but really needs them, is askill.<br><br>All of these skills are learned through diligent practice. We begin knowing very little about how to do them. Our first efforts are usually clumsy, and sometimes we make many mistakes before we get it right. Some tasks we wonder how we can ever do, like apologizing to an angry and confrontational person whom we have offended or giving a talk with aGeneral Authority in the room.<br><br>But not knowing how to do something that we have been commanded to do is not an option, so we begin where we are, and we join, as it were, Nephi on the streets of Jerusalem, wondering how to proceed, "not knowing beforehand the things which [we] should do."<sup>5</sup>The Spirit leads us along and sustains us, even as we act. Our thoughts blend with knowledge and wisdom from a heavenly source, and our hands are guided in a way that teaches us. We become skilled by acting. By having the faith to act using a beginner's skills, and by depending on the Lord to magnify our slight abilities, we move forward and we learn something that we didn't know before. This way of learning corresponds with the description given by Elder Boyd K. Packer, who counseled, "It is the moment when you have gone to the edge of the light and stepped into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just afootstep or two."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Our Father in Heaven constantly asks us to depend on Him to accomplish hard, even impossible things. As we act in faith over and over again, we find that not only has our ability to do things increased, but our faith, and therefore our ability to learn, has increased as well. This is indeed learning by study and byfaith.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Skilled performance is a very important manifestation of human knowledge. It is a kind of knowledge that improves with use. We begin learning as a novice and gain new capability every time we exercise a skill. What can we learn about skill by recalling how we learned the skills that we use every day? Let me suggest several things:<br><br>First, skill is learned through multiple attempts, over a period of time. Do you recall learning to ride a bike? Learning to swim? Learning to be a brilliant conversationalist on a first date? It took a few tries to get these things right.<br><br>Second, skill learning requires much practice. Not just any kind of practice will do: it must be practice in which the learner can find out how well they did after each attempt. Imagine trying to improve your golf swing on a foggy day. The ball disappears into the fog as soon as it is hit. Did it hook? Or slice? Without knowing where the ball went, it's hard to make an improvement.<br><br>Third, you can't learn a new skill just from being told, unless you already possess other very similar skills. A dancer who knows how to perform one step may be able to make minor adjustments to learn a slightly different step, but if the new step is very different, training through practice may be necessary. As a sidebar, consider also the following observation: The more experience a dancer has in learning new steps, the easier it is to learn new steps in general, but practice with feedback is still essential for the new steps.<br><br>Fourth, the learning of a new skill requires the integration of skills you already possess. For example, if you don't already know how to add, then that calculus class you are signed up for is going to be hard. Consider dropping.<br><br>Fifth, skilled performance consists of more than robotically repeated procedural actions. This is where the topic of skill begins to become more interesting.<br><br>A skill is performed slightly differently each time we perform it. This is because the circumstances surrounding the performance change. Skill is the type of human behavior that allows us to adapt our actions to changing circumstances. The next pitch in a baseball game usually depends on the previous pitch, among other things. The pitcher who throws the same pitch every time doesn't win games, as demonstrated in this last World Series.<br><br>Sixth, it is important to notice that the exercise of a skill is often the very thing that changes the circumstances.<br><br>Skill requires the exercise of judgment, decision making, agency, and problem solving. When we exercise our agency to act righteously, it changes the world around us, setting up new conditions that we then continue to respond to. I am reminded of the generous spirit of Mallory Holtman and Liz Wallace, softball players from Central Washington University, who carried their injured opponent, Sara Tucholsky, around the bases because she had just hit a home run and could not be helped by her teammates.<sup>8</sup>It is hard not to be affected by the honorable spirit of that act: in the middle of a skilled sports exhibition, these players exercised a skill of a different sort--a saintly skill in which they used judgment, decision making, agency, and problem solving to do something noble and good. If there is anything that the gospel teaches us, it is that we can change the conditions in our lives, our homes, our neighborhoods, and our nations, and by doing so we can change the world. The skills we possess, combined with our faith and guided by the power of the Spirit, are what make that possible.<br><br>We learn a little bit at a time. The phrase "line upon line, precept upon precept" applies to learning skilled performance as well as to conceptual knowledge. The development of skills is a time-consuming process that cannot be rushed. Do you remember what it was like to learn typing? First you learned to press specific keys without looking. Then you learned how to do frequent letter combinations. Next you were able to learn subroutines for common words, and finally you were able to type the words in sequence so fluently that you did not have to concentrate on the details of the action. The process of typing had become automatic, and some of you have learned to type at very high rates of speed. (Though not me: I still look at the keys.)<br><br>The learning process described here applies to any skill. We learn small actions to the point where we can do them more or less automatically, without thought, and then we learn how to combine smaller actions into increasingly interesting, useful, and competent combinations of action--action that fits the needs of the moment and that allows us tocarry out our desires.<br><br>But no matter how automatic the performance of skill subroutines becomes, skilled performance always follows the same pattern: it is a pattern of action followed by decision making. This is a critically important point: onethat I would like for you to remember.<br><br>Skill is more than just thinking about something: it involves doing, then judging how we did, and then deciding what to do next. It involves knowing when to start, when to stop, what to do, how much to do, and what not to do. It involves judging how well we are doing and how effective our actions are in practice. Skill is the constant interplay of agency and action.<br><br>With continued practice of a skill, things speed up, and decision points become less noticeable. This is part of a process of automatization that occurs naturally over time. Sometimes skills turn into habits, and we do things without paying sufficient attention. Have you ever gotten into an unfamiliar car and tried to put the key into the steering column, only to discover after three or four unsuccessful tries that the ignition is located on the dashboard?<br><br>Here is both the blessing and the cursing of skills. Whatever we have become accustomed to doing, we tend to do naturally and thoughtlessly. If the patterns of behavior we allow ourselves to form are positive, righteous, and uplifting, then our habitual actions will tend to safeguard us. If, on the other hand, we allow ourselves to form habitual patterns of behavior that are negative, self-destructive, or disobedient, or if we are inattentive to where our behavior is leading us, then our actions will take us in directions we will later regret. The important thing to remember is that we choose our actions. Our actions, even our habitual ones, are expressions of our desires.<br><br>Perhaps this helps us to understand better this teaching of Alma:<br><br><i>I know that</i>[God]<i>granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Our wills are often expressed in what we allow to become automatic behavior.<br><br>Perhaps it also allows us to understand Nephi's metaphor wherein he described how Satan leads the unwary "by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever."<sup>10</sup>Treated flax fiber is soft and comfortable to the touch. A light cord of flax might even feel comfortable around the neck, but strong ropes anciently were made of soft flaxen cords woven into strong cables that were hard or even impossible to break. Light habits that feel pleasant can seem harmless at first, but over time they become strong restraints on our actions. In the same way, a seemingly small habit that has become automatic can become a chain that captivates us.<br><br>I would add one more observation about skill to the list I was making earlier. It is that if you are attentive, you learn something new from performing the skill every time you perform it. Not only does performing a skill change the circumstances around you, but it also changes you as well.<br><br>This marvelous human capacity to choose to change is a tool for us to use to grow and to become. It therefore suggests that repentance is one of those essential skills that we must learn. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told to "say nothing but repentance unto this generation."<sup>11</sup><br><br>What are the skills of a Saint? Elder Neal A. Maxwell described how we acquire many saintly skills through the experiences of life:<br><br><i>Built ... into the seemingly ordinary experiences of life are opportunities for us to acquire such eternal attributes as love, mercy, meekness, patience, and submissiveness and to develop and sharpen such skills as how to communicate, motivate, delegate, and manage our time and talents and our thoughts in accordance with eternal priorities. These attributes and skills are portable; they are never obsolete and will be much needed in the next world.</i><br><br><i>How often have you and I really pondered just what it is, therefore, that will rise with us in the resurrection? Our intelligence will rise with us, meaning not simply our I.Q., but our capacity to receive and to apply truth. Our talents, attributes, and skills will rise with us, certainly also our capacity to learn, our degree of self-discipline, and our capacity to work. ...</i><br><br><i>... It is left to us ... to make the interplay of our time and talent bring about the development of the key eternal attributes and the everlasting skills.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_grounded-rooted-established-settled-ephesians-317-1-peter-510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>In his October 2009 conference address, Elder Richard G. Scott gave an intimate view into his own personal experience with the further development of the spiritual skill of obtaining and capturing knowledge through revelation. He explained that this ability is obtained through practice:<br><br><i>I am convinced that there is no simple formula or technique that would immediately allow you to master the ability to be guided by the voice of the Spirit. Our Father expects you to learn how to obtain that divine help by exercising faith in Him and His Holy Son, Jesus Christ. Were you to receive inspired guidance just for the asking, you would become weak and ever more dependent on Them. They know that essential personal growth will come as you struggle to learn how to be led by the Spirit.</i><br><br>Elder Scott then described how the ability toreceive revelation grows with practice:<br><br><i>What may appear initially to be a daunting task will be much easier to manage over time as you consistently strive to recognize and follow feelings prompted by the Spirit. Your confidence in the direction you receive from the Holy Ghost will also become stronger.</i><br><br>Elder Scott next showed that the process of learning from revelation possesses the basic structure of a skill--the repetitive cycle of action and decision making:<br><br><i>Spirituality yields two fruits. The first is inspiration to know what to do. The second is power, or the capacity to do it. These two capacities come together.</i><br><br>At this point, Elder Scott described his own experience in the further development of a skill that he has been learning throughout his life and continues to perfect. The experience began in response to the spiritual atmosphere set by ahumble teacher:<br><br><i>His sincerity, purity of intent, and love permitted a spiritual strength to envelop the room. I was deeply touched. Then I began to receive personal impressions as an extension of the principles taught by that humble instructor. They were personal and related to my assignments in the area. They came in answer to my prolonged, prayerful efforts to learn.</i><br><br><i>As each impression came, I carefully wrote it down. In the process, I was given precious truths that I greatly needed in order to be a more effective servant of the Lord. The details of the communication are sacred and, like a patriarchal blessing, were for my individual benefit. I was given specific directions, instructions, and conditioned promises that have beneficially altered the course of my life.</i><br><br>Elder Scott's learning continued during a second lesson in which the manner of another teacher played less of a role, illustrating that the skill was being taught by the Holy Ghost, not the teacher:<br><br><i>In that environment, strong impressions began to flow to me again. I wrote them down. The message included specific counsel on how to become more effective as an instrument in the hands of the Lord. I received such an outpouring of impressions that were so personal that I felt it was not appropriate to record them in the midst of a Sunday School class. I sought a more private location, where I continued to write the feelings that flooded into my mind and heart as faithfully as possible. After each powerful impression was recorded, I pondered the feelings I had received to determine if I had accurately expressed them in writing. As a result, I made a few minor changes to what had been written. Then I studied their meaning and application in my own life.</i><br><br><i>Subsequently I prayed, reviewing with the Lord what I thought I had been taught by the Spirit. When a feeling of peace came, I thanked Him for the guidance given. I was then impressed to ask, "Was there yet more to be given?" I received further impressions, and the process of writing down the impressions, pondering, and praying for confirmation was repeated. Again I was prompted to ask, "Is there more I should know?" And there was. When that last, most sacred experience was concluded, I had received some of the most precious, specific, personal direction one could hope to obtain in this life. Had I not responded to the first impressions and recorded them, I would not have received the last, most precious guidance.</i><br><br>Elder Scott ended his talk by saying, "Itestify that you can personally learn to master the principles of being guided by the Spirit."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/to-acquire-spiritual-guidance?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>13</sup></a><br><br>There are so many skills that we as members of Christ's church can desire. There is so much that we need to learn for ourselves, through the application of faith, about how to learn a skill and how to teach it to others. And there is so little time. But I testify that the Spirit sustains us in learning gradually, step-by-step, the skills that we need to fulfill our missions in life.<br><br>I pray that we will learn the wisdom in this teaching of President David O. McKay:<br><br><i>Gaining knowledge is one thing, and applying it</i>[is]<i>quite another. Wisdom is the right application of knowledge, and true education--the education for which the Church stands--is the application of knowledge to the development of a noble and Godlike character.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>I believe this describes how we come to develop the skills of a Saint.

<h1>of the Soul, Anchors of the Heart: Coming unto... - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, aloha! Don't worry. I know I am on the right campus. I am conscious, coherent, and oriented. I thought the sunshine in that aloha greeting would warm us up here in Utah and bring smiles to our faces. I am humbled by this opportunity to stand before you and share a message from my heart. May the Holy Ghost abide with us and speak peace to our hearts.<br><br>I remember being in third grade when my sister Jean took me and two of our younger siblings to watch a movie adaptation of Homer's epic featuring the hero Odysseus. Considering how poor we were, watching a movie was an extravagance that did not happen often. But I thought we got our money's worth, because it was a long movie. The voyage home to Ithaca for Odysseus and his men proved to be anything but easy and speedy. I was mesmerized by scenes such as Odysseus blinding the one-eyed cyclops, Polyphemus, son of Poseidon, which then enraged Poseidon; the tribe of gigantic cannibals, or Laestrygonians; and the lure of the enchanting music and voices of the sea sirens.<br><br>Now that I am much older, I look at it differently. Instead of focusing on the frame-by-frame cinematography, I am drawn to the story line and the lessons it holds. For instance, the trip to Ithaca was costly in terms of lives lost and years wasted. This was not because the voyage was not worth taking. It was their personal choices, in the face of pride and temptations, that dictated their course and the length of their voyage. In the end, more than the Trojan War, it was this journey that changed Odysseus. Hence, we refer to difficult and life-changing journeys as personal odysseys.<br><br>The Greek poet Konstantinos Kavafis likened the voyage to Ithaca to our personal odysseys. He spoke of the maturity and the wisdom that can attend such experience. To quote selected stanzas of his poem:<br><br><i>When you set out for Ithaka</i><br><i>ask that your way be long,</i><br><i>full of adventure, full of instruction.</i><br><i>The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,</i><br><i>angry Poseidon--do not fear them:</i><br><i>such as these you will never find</i><br><i>as long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rare</i><br><i>emotion touch</i>[es]<i>your spirit and your body.</i><br><i>The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,</i><br><i>angry Poseidon--you will not meet them</i><br><i>unless you carry them in your soul,</i><br><i>unless your soul raise</i>[s]<i>them up before you.</i><br>. . .<br><br><i>Have Ithaka always in your mind.</i><br><i>Your arrival there is what you are destined for.</i><br><i>But don't in the least hurry the journey.</i><br><i>Better it last for years,</i><br><i>so that when you reach the island you are old,</i><br><i>rich with all you have gained on the way,</i><br><i>not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth.</i><br><br><i>Ithaka gave you the splendid journey.</i><br><i>Without her you would not have set out.</i><br><i>She hasn't anything else to give you.</i><br><br><i>And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you.</i><br><i>So wise have you become, of such experience,</i><br><i>that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean.</i><sup>1</sup><br><h2><b>Journey of the Soul</b></h2><br>Life itself is a journey. Setting out for our personal Ithacas is embarking on a voyage of transformation. This is a journey that we know in our hearts to be right but is somehow beset by challenges. As students, are we determined not to give up on our academic journeys despite the difficulties? For those among us in the middle of our careers and currently navigating our way into our own Ithacas, how is this defining us as individuals and our relationships with our families and our God? How we respond reveals our character and inner strength. Either we can let the setbacks define us or we can choose to move forward. If we choose to, we can arrive at our destination a far different person--hopefully much better and wiser. Going through the journey itself is a reward. The lessons therein test our capacities and strengthen our souls until we measure up to the privilege of our positions as sons or daughters of God.<br><br>The scriptures are filled with records of travel whose messages apply to our personal journeys. In the Old Testament, several accounts are of epic proportions, one of which is the Exodus. Led by Moses, the flight of the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Canaan was not the fastest or the shortest route by the standards of our present GPS. The stopover in the wilderness took 40 long years.<sup>2</sup>Perhaps it was from here that we heard the original version of "Are we there yet?" The grumblings were incessant. The Israelites felt stuck in the wilderness.<br><br>What lessons can we take away from the Exodus? This 40-year sojourn in the wilderness was not a side trip but a pivotal event. Humility, faith, obedience, trust, and dedication--virtues necessary for a people to be true to their eternal promises--were forged in the wilderness, not in the comforts of Canaan. It was in Sinai, not in Canaan, that Moses received the Ten Commandments. It was in the desolation of the wilderness that God walked before His people, in a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.<sup>3</sup>Miracle after miracle attended the children of Israel. From the parting of the Red Sea to the borders of the land of Canaan and beyond, the hand of the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob had so tenderly cared for His people. Has the Lord treated us any differently now?<sup>4</sup><br><br>In these journeys, we bring with us our faith and our attitude. Contrast the murmurings of the Israelites with Nephi's "I will go; Iwill do"<sup>5</sup>attitude to the Lord's commands as recorded in the Book of Mormon. The combination of the right attitude and righteous choices allowed Nephi to be more receptive to the Spirit of the Lord. It not only made the voyage to the promised land possible, it defined Nephi as a man and as a prophet. Likewise, the journey of faith by the pioneers left behind footprints of extraordinary courage and resolve. What seemed insurmountable became possible because they hung on to their faith that their God would never forsake them. They girded up their loins and with every step took fresh courage until this desert was transformed into a sanctuary of faith.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Whether on land or on sea, in a group of thousands or of a few, life-changing journeys can truly become journeys of the soul if we desire to serve and be like Christ. Perhaps this explains why the missionary section in the Doctrine and Covenants opens up with the word<i>embark.</i><sup>7</sup>One of my favorite accounts of the journey of the soul is the first Christmas night, the prelude to the Atonement. In the New Testament, Luke gave the description of plain, unassuming people watching "their flock by night."<sup>8</sup>Upon learning of the Savior's birth, these shepherds "came with haste" until they "found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."<sup>9</sup>Notice that Luke used the words<i>haste</i>and<i>found.</i>These shepherds set for us the example of running to the Savior with a faith pure and simple, untainted by skepticism. Matthew, on the other hand, spoke of the three Magi searching for the Christ child. Their intent was deliberate and their question direct: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."<sup>10</sup><br><br>I could not find a better example of a personal journey of the soul than that of a repentant heart. The surrendering of our hearts to the Lord is not only transforming but also sanctifying. The eye may never witness nor can the mind measure the tremendous anguish, grief, and sorrow that attend the forsaking of one's sins. That is the Lord's purview alone. Such agony is matched only by the strength of one's faith to be healed and the hope for second chances. This journey of penitence can be completed only by the individual with the Savior. Only the combined love of the Father and the love of the Son, as tenderly carried out in the Atonement, has the power to make us whole again. Only such love can "heal without a scar."<sup>11</sup>During times when we feel we are least deserving of such love, President Gordon B. Hinckley assures us:<br><br><i>You are His child all the time, not just when you are good. You are His child when you are bad. You have within you . . . a portion of divinity that is real and tremendous and marvelous and wonderful.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Christ Himself affirmed this eternal truth:<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Imagine if this soul happens to be that of a loved one, or perhaps ours.<br><h2><b>Anchors of the Heart</b></h2><br>Many of us who know the pain of life's adversities--of sickness, death, divorce, failure, loss of a job, or a loved one's wrong choices--can testify that as we carefully look back, each challenge was met with blessings. Though difficult, the journey seemed short and the burden light. It was as if the weight was not borne by us alone but by many loved ones, by angels, even by the Savior Himself. The Savior has never left us alone, even when our faith was faltering through the journey. He has been with us every step of the way. He has increased our understanding and magnified our strengths that we may "know Him firsthand" (as my sister Jean says). Elder George Q. Cannon beautifully expressed this truth:<br><br><i>No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction,</i>[God]<i>will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character</i>[to do so].<i>He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come. We have found that God. We have made Him our friend, by obeying His Gospel; and He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Whether it is in the wilderness of Sinai, the plains crossed by latter-day pioneers, or in the seclusion of our own sacred groves, no journey of the soul can ever be completed unless our hearts are anchored by light and truth. An anchor is something that keeps us steady, secure, and stable. It is a source of support, an emblem of hope, "a sure foundation."<sup>15</sup>Such an anchor can only be found in Christ. As Nephi declared:<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, . . . that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Throughout the uncertainties of life, only Christ and His love are constant. There is no more perfect example of love than the Atonement itself. Its power and promises are the "hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast."<sup>17</sup>In the end it is the Atonement that unites our journeys, for we are all in need of its power to rescue, to heal, to soften hearts, and to be made whole again. Our baptismal and temple covenants, the priesthood and its ordinances, the sacrament, the scriptures--all point to this great sacrifice. These additional anchors steady us amidst the turmoil of life.<br><h2><b>My Own Journey of Conversion--Tended bythe Lord</b></h2><br>There is one more journey that my heart holds dear. It happens to be a story within a story: my family's journey of conversion. In the book of 1 Kings is an account of the faith of a widow in Zarephath, who in time of drought and famine gave up her family's remaining food for the prophet Elijah: "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse."<sup>18</sup><br><br>The gospel came in our lives at a time when we had been sufficiently humbled by trials. The most that we literally could offer at the altar was not even a morsel of bread, for we had none but our very faith. It was all that we had. Thus, I liken the widow of Zarephath to a widow in the Philippines, the widow of Tondo with seven children. She is my mother. Let me tell you our story.<br><br>There are six girls and a boy in our family--a mix that does not bode well in a society where women are not regarded as men's equals. I am the fifth child in that brood of seven. I was six when my father died of cancer. Our eldest had just turned 18, and the youngest was two years old. The memory is still vivid in my mind as though it happened just yesterday. My mother was by my father's bedside, exhausted and with her face drenched in tears. Each of the children was summoned by name to approach our father's side. With my mother holding my father's right hand, each of us, from the oldest to the youngest, placed our right hand on top of our parents' hands. There are seven children. There were seven right hands placed atop each other in a solemn act of promise. It was our father's dying wish that we look after each other. Then there was silence--a silence broken by my mother's wailing, then by her defeated sobs. My father had passed away.<br><br>Without a stable breadwinner and with seven children left to a mother without a job or a college degree, our finances were tenuous. We grew up in poverty--not just income poverty but also a scarcity of opportunities. We were too poor to get an education, but my mother persisted in her dream to have each of her children complete a college degree. She believed in the power of education to enlighten and transform lives, to equalize social standing, and to be the vehicle out of our dismal circumstances. She borrowed money even at high interest rates to keep us in school. I remember rejoicing in being able to take exams (yes, those were joyful, not dreadful, moments), because it meant that my mother was able to pay our tuition. Eventually, the only way for us to go beyond high school was to qualify for scholarships.<br><br>Four years after my father died, two young American men knocked on our door looking for my mother. They introduced themselves as missionaries. Behind them was a throng of Filipino children fighting for their attention and calling out, "Hi, Joe." Under the sweltering Philippine heat, these young men stood out in their white shirts, ties, and black briefcases; to us they looked like a toss-up between James Bond and CIA agents. I was about to say to them that my mother had told me to tell them that she was not home when my mother's friends and their children, who came with the missionaries, showed up. My mom overheard and motioned to me to let them in. I quietly asked myself, "What are we getting ourselves into?" Inviting these Americans in was social suicide, as my mom was known in our community for her staunch devotion to the dominant faith.<br><br>When my father was alive, he had always invited the missionaries. Not my mother. When my father died, we knew that any opportunity to hear these missionaries died with him. "What could they possibly offer that we still do not have?" was my mother's quick retort to any previous attempts at having our family taught. The year after my father died, martial law was declared in the Philippines. On top of that there was a national shortage of rice--the country's staple food. To stave off the shortage, rice was combined with corn and rationed to five kilos per family. Food and jobs were scarce. For us to survive, my mom marshaled every inch of strength she had. She talked a friend into allowing her to be paid a meager sum for helping to deliver rice. She would leave at 4:30 in the morning and would come home at 11:00 at night. At the end of the day she would pick up grain after grain of rice and corn that had spilled on the floor of the delivery truck. She would not stop until she had several handfuls for tomorrow's meals. Our life was already at its worst. How could listening to these Americans help? What could these missionaries offer that would make our lifebetter?<br><br>To our surprise, our mother listened to the missionaries. She even attended an area conference at the Araneta Coliseum presided by President Spencer W. Kimball. That was an act of boldness to go against the predominant religion. This was the 1970s. People's minds were strongly averse to changes. It must have exacted much willpower from my mother to stop drinking coffee and to stop smoking--just because two foreigners barely in their twenties said so--at a time when nicotine patches were unheard of. It must have taken real faith to part with a widow's mite for tithing.<br><br>It was only out of politeness for my mom and the missionaries that I listened. My elder sisters did not want any part of this. Despite our obvious annoyance with the missionaries, they continued to visit and responded to us with love and patience. My mother, my younger sister Ruth, and myself were the first to be baptized. My older sisters followed months later. My brother was baptized when he turned eight. It took years and a temple in the Philippines for our father to be baptized byproxy and for us to be finally sealed as afamily.<br><br>What did the missionaries offer? They offered us the opportunity of knowing that families can be together even beyond death--something my father had always hoped we could be. The missionaries taught us that we have a Heavenly Father who knows each of us by name and who loves us dearly--a concept so foreign to us, for the God that we knew lashed out with punishments and heard only memorized prayers. The missionaries taught us that our bodies are sacred. They taught us the value of preparedness--temporal and spiritual. The missionaries taught us about where we came from and where we are going. The missionaries offered a message so sweet that it was "most desirable above all things."<sup>19</sup>It filled us with joy--not just momentary bliss, but peace and radiance that continued to sustain us through difficult times.<br><br>The fruit of the gospel is remarkably sweet, and we paid a high price for it. Following our baptism, relatives and friends distanced themselves from us. They charged my mother with blasphemy and insanity. Some refused to extend any help despite our needs. The loss of that social safety net was economic suicide for a family already living on the edge of poverty. Even as young children we were not spared from many trials, and we had to grow far beyond our years. When I was attending a private school of another religious faith, a nun confronted me in front of my sixth-grade class for choosing to be baptized as a Latter-day Saint. I came home that day in tears. My sister and I were eventually disqualified from receiving the highest academic honors. We were denied the very measure of success that we had worked hard for. This was not the end. Many more challenges came.<br><br>How did we keep the faith? First, it was never because we were smarter or stronger, nor were our lives easier. With the help of the Holy Ghost, a conversion rooted within our hearts drove the change. What helped us was that we stayed on course. We did not give up atthe very first sign of adversity. We kept going even when the tempests in our lives were raging.<sup>20</sup>We kept paying tithing even when the choices came down to not having enough to eat. We kept coming to Church with the thought that if we continued to do so, eventually principles that were once unclear would make much more sense. We kept going with the understanding that people around us were not perfect but were putting forth the effort to bebetter.<br><br>Second, while it is true that our happiness now and forever depends on the degree of spiritual change in our personal lives, we still needed others' support. We were not always brave or fearless, nor could we clearly see even a step ahead into life. We had to rely on borrowed light until we mustered the strength to light our own lamps. We could not have made it this far without the love, understanding, encouragement, and kindness of members andfriends.<br><br>Has the Lord been mindful of our sacrifices? Yes! He is continually involved in our lives. There was no way that a mother widowed at age 41, without a job and a college degree, could have possibly raised seven children from two to 18 years of age without divine help. Heaven must have heard her many pleadings and interceded in so many ways that it amazes us even to this very day. Through the Lord's design and blessings, each of us was able to complete our studies: two doctors, a nurse, a lawyer, an accountant, a hotel and restaurant manager, and an IT support specialist. Thus was the promise of Elijah also fulfilled to the widow of Tondo:<br><br><i>And she went and did according to the saying ofElijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</i><br><br><i>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>One would not understand how tenderly, patiently, and lovingly the Lord tended our family if I were to skip the sad parts. This is a story of struggles; but, most important, it is a story of faith, hope, and hard work. This is a legacy of faith that we want to leave to our children and their children's children. The best help heaven extended to us was giving us missionaries who were motivated, who were willing to work long and hard until our hearts were ready to listen and to be touched by the Spirit. These were missionaries who were able to recognize hearts as though the Lord Himself was there. I cannot thank these missionaries without thanking those who lent them to the Lord: their mothers and fathers. To parents of missionaries and their families, thank you for lending your sons and daughters to the Lord. Thank you for your sacrifices. You remind me of Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel, who stated in faith:<br><br><i>For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</i><br><br><i>Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.</i><sup>22</sup><br><h2><b>"Whither Goest Thou?"</b></h2><br>Our life's ultimate journey is to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."<sup>23</sup>This is the heart of the gospel. The Savior invites us to go on a journey with Him and asks us repeatedly to "come . . . and follow [Him]."<sup>24</sup>As we do so, there will be challenges, but none that cannot be addressed by the Savior's love. Eventually it will be His tender mercies that will save us many times over. For the sorrows that may not be readily seen on the outside, the Lord sees clearly in our hearts, and He offers love. He "sees us in terms of [eternities]."<sup>25</sup><br><br>Wherever our personal odysseys may take us, however long or short the transformation of our souls may be, there is a truth I would like to testify of "with all the energy of heart"<sup>26</sup>: God lives. He loves us and loves to bless us. No matter how perilous the journey, Christ is in control. If we allow Him to navigate our lives, "[He] shall fight for [us], and [we] shall hold [our] peace."<sup>27</sup><br><br>As we set our personal sails, let us move forward with this thought from the book of Ether: "The wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land."<sup>28</sup>May the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the love of your eternal companion, and your family and friends lift you up and attend your journey of the soul. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Len B.

<h1>Thee, the Only True God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In preparing my remarks for today, I could not help remembering a recent experience of mine.<br><br>Some months ago, I enjoyed the privilege of presiding at a stake conference alongside Elder Donald J. Keyes, one of our noble Area Seventies. During the course of the Saturday evening session--often one of the highlights of a stake conference--we were required to adjust our program at short notice because of the inclusion of some additional speakers. In view of the fact that a duet, sung by a young couple, was to be moved in the program to follow Elder Keyes's remarks and precede mine, I accordingly quietly whispered the proposed change in the program to him.<br><br>After doing so, it was quickly apparent that he had not fully grasped what I had just said, which required me to repeat my message a second time. Unfortunately, this time, and to my dismay, his lack of understanding was now amplified by a look of incredulity and utter disbelief. Realizing now that I had somehow failed in my attempt to clearly convey the change in our program, I repeated my message in a manner that could not be mistaken: I said, and this time more clearly and slowly than I had done previously, but with some added emphasis, "Don, the duet will be sung between you and me!"<br><br>This time my message hit the mark, for now his incredulity and disbelief were replaced by a nervous giggle and a hint of terror.<br><br>I then reviewed carefully in my mind what I had just said and at last realized my terrible error: When I had said, "The duet will be sung between us," he had taken my words literally. In other words, he had understood that the duet would be sung by the two of us!<br><br>I am pleased to reassure all of you here today that neither I, nor President Samuelson, have any intention of singing any duet, anywhere, at anytime, to anyone!<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, it is truly a rare privilege to be in your presence today. As I speak, our children and their families are viewing this broadcast in our home, back in South Africa, where it is just after eight o' clock in the evening. Just think about the power of modern technology! One day, when I am released from this calling, Diane and I expect to sit alongside our children in our home in Featherbrooke, South Africa, and continue to enjoy the blessings of these great gatherings via satellite broadcast.<br><br>I am pleased to convey the love and greetings of the First Presidency to you. Alongside your parents and loved ones, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as stewards of the keys of the kingdom of God, have a deep interest in you and an abiding faith in your progress and development.<br><br>When one considers the glorious work of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, nothing surpasses in importance and power the restoration of a true knowledge and understanding of God the Eternal Father and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. In the world in which we now live, faith in a real and living God is in steep decline. The very existence and mission of Jesus Christ is being diluted by so-called believers--some who now ascribe to a belief that Jesus Christ was a great moral teacher at best and a good man with some flaws at the very least. In contrast, the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands fast as a beacon of undiluted testimony in the living reality of God, our Eternal Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. We believe the holy scriptures as they have fallen from the lips of holy prophets, and we also believe in continued revelation as it comes to us through authorized and inspired latter-day prophets and apostles. We are not "tossed to and fro ... with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait todeceive."<sup>1</sup><br><br>In this regard, the singular importance of the First Vision and the Prophet Joseph Smith's firsthand witness of the Father and the Son are wonderfully echoed in the Savior's Intercessory Prayer, as recorded in chapter 17 of the Gospel of John. In this prayer of prayers, which the Son of God offered on the eve of His Atonement, the Lord declared, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<sup>2</sup><br><br>In our discussion this morning we will consider two principles that are fundamental to our faith. The first is a correct<i>understanding</i>of God. The second applies to our<i>relationship</i>with God.<br><h2><b>The Nature of God</b></h2><br><h3><i><b>A. Background</b></i></h3><br>In regard to the actual existence and correct understanding of God, I will simply note here that it is hard to imagine any concept or idea that has been more misunderstood, distorted, or abused during the past 2,000 years. To many, God is mystical and distant; to others, He is nothing more than a manifestation of nature around us; to still others, He is a spirit who reigns in terrible power and judgment; and to afew, God is the invention of a childlike, unimproved mind. The diversity of beliefs is truly bewildering and baffling.<br><br>I will provide here only one example among the countless of how differently God is viewed even among those within Christianity itself. Aristides, the second-century Christian apologist, declared:<br><br><i>God is not born, nor made. ... He is immortal, perfect, and incomprehensible. ... He has no name, for everything that has a name is related to created things. He has no form, nor any bodily members</i>[or limbs]. ...<i>He is neither male nor female.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I shall not comment specifically on Aristides' description of God. But I cannot forego the moment to simply say that Aristides' statement is much falsehood speckled with some truth. Even when acknowledging the fact that he lived during the second century when the early Church was already in apostasy, one has to say that his statement does not conform to the Old Testament nor the Gospels and the apostolic epistles that were reasonably well in circulation among the early Christians during Aristides'day.<sup>4</sup><br><h3><i><b>B. The First Vision and Revealed Knowledge of the Nature of God</b></i></h3><br>It is important to realize that the restoration of the true knowledge of God, and therefore of our Heavenly Father and His Son,<i>preceded</i>the restoration of any laws, ordinances, or principles that had to be once again restored in connection with this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.<br><br>There is something wondrous about the faith and the purity of the boy Joseph Smith in the spring of 1820 as he entered the grove of trees with a prayer in his heart. He enquired as to which of all the religious parties and sects were right so that he could know which one to join<sup>5</sup>because of his deep concern for the welfare of his immortal soul.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Beyond Joseph Smith's brief but deeply spiritual account, the earnest reader is drawn into this event in a very personal manner. We sense something of the glorious appearance of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. We hear the Father call Joseph by name while turning to His Beloved Son. We hear the Son, as our Savior and Redeemer and Advocate with the Father, address Joseph. Throughout the account we sense the reality, nearness, and approachableness of our Heavenly Father and His Son, and we are renewed in our testimony that God is real and mighty to save.<br><br>After the First Vision, other manifestations followed that caused the Book of Mormon to come forth and the necessary priesthood authority, covenants, and ordinances to be restored. In short, all of the power and knowledge necessary for gaining eternal life was once again restored to mankind--but only after the true nature of the Father and the Son had been revealed.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph was later to testify with unusual authority, "It is the first principle of the Gospel to know [with] a certainty the Character of God, and to know that we [can] converse with him as one man converses with another."<sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>Our Relationship with God</b></h2><br><h3><i><b>A. Background</b></i></h3><br>In regard to our relationship with God, which is the second fundamental principle that we will consider here today, I refer to one false doctrine, the doctrine of predestination, that should be sufficient for our purposes. This doctrine was expanded upon by the fifth-century Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo and has governed mainstream Christianity for many centuries. According to predestination, the destiny of any soul is predetermined by God,<i>before</i>any act, good or evil, has been committed by any man or woman.<sup>8</sup><br><br>I will only say here that there is a terrible logic to a belief in a God who prejudges us, even when His judgment is always perfect. There is also the depressing arithmetic of a teaching that holds that nothing we do, or ever will do in the future, will influence God's grace or deflect His justice: we are thereby left with our final fate fixed, because of God's prejudgment of us. Any thoughtful believer will readily discern the self-defeating potential of this incorrect doctrine of predestination, as well as the hopelessness it could produce in individuals. It is therefore not surprising that much of mankind over the ages have approached God with great fear and trepidation.<br><br>In this regard I refer to the well-known example of Martin Luther, the great reformer. When he was a young man, before he had embarked on the ministry as a monk and some years before his work as a reformer, he had two experiences that greatly affected him. The first of these events occurred in 1503, when a dagger pierced his leg, rupturing an artery, which could have caused him an untimely death. The second event occurred two years later, in 1505. He was caught in a heavy thunderstorm that was so violent that he felt sure he was not going to survive. It was this latter event, in fact, which caused Luther to promise that he would become a monk if his life were spared. However, the most telling part in both of these life-threatening events was that Luther, when in fear of his life, did not once call upon the Lord for help. Instead, and from the Latter-day Saint point of view, quite surprisingly, he called upon two venerated saints for help. In the first instance, when his leg was injured, he implored Mary, the mortal mother of the Savior, to help him. In the second event, during the terrifying thunderstorm, he turned his calls for help to Saint Anne, who is believed to have been the mother of this same Mary. In later years Luther regretted his behavior for not calling upon the Lord during these situations.<sup>9</sup><br><br>One possible reason for a good man like Martin Luther not to have turned to His Heavenly Father is found in what he said at one time: "If I could believe that God was not angry at me, I would stand on my head for joy."<sup>10</sup>We should also remember that Martin Luther was not unique in these views; in fact, they were typical in a society in which man feared God and stood in terror of Christ as ourjudge.<sup>11</sup><br><h3><i><b>B. The Restoration Provides the Correct Understanding of Our Relationship with God</b></i></h3><br>Let's now consider our understanding of our relationship with God as Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I begin with this inspired comment by the Prophet Joseph: "If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Through glorious principles once again restored, we are taught that the Fatherhood of God, our Father, predates mortality. He is literally our Heavenly Father--in other words, the Father of our spirits. The Savior Jesus Christ is, therefore, in the literal sense of the word, our Elder Brother, as the firstborn spirit child of God the Father.<sup>13</sup><br><br>This vital understanding entirely changes the nature of our relationship with God. The Savior's recurring expressions during His mortal ministry now more fully resonate with us. Just think for a moment about the following expressions:<br><br>"Our Father which art in heaven..."<sup>14</sup><br><br>"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."<sup>15</sup><br><br>"I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God."<sup>16</sup><br><br>We are reminded of the prophetic declaration by modern-day prophets and apostles in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," which declares:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><br><br><i>In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Because of the Restoration and because of a true and fuller understanding of mankind's origin and destiny, we know that we are<i>not</i>predestined to anything. Each one of us is in fact<i>foreordained</i>unto salvation and exaltation. The undergirding principle of foreordination is quite simple: every soul who has been born into this world has already earned certain privileges on account of their faithfulness in the first estate. These privileges include an<i>unconditional</i>right to receive an immortal and resurrected body one day, and, second, a<i>conditional</i>blessing, which is dependent on our faith and obedience to God, of enjoying everlasting felicity and eternal life in the presence of the Father and the Son.<br><br>Now I should like to turn for a few minutes to the third member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Holy Ghost has many vital roles. However, I would like to refer to one that was so well expressed, many years ago, by Elder Orson Pratt of the Twelve:<br><br><i>Water Baptism is only a preparatory cleansing of the believing penitent ... ; whereas, the Baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost cleanses more thoroughly, by renewing the inner man, and by purifying the affections, desires, and thoughts which have long been habituated in the impure ways of sin. Without the aid of the Holy Ghost, a person . . . would have but very little power to change his mind ... and to walk in newness of life. Though his sins may have been cleansed away, yet so great is the force of habit, that he would, without being renewed by the Holy Ghost, be easily overcome, and contaminated again by sin. Hence, it is infinitely important that the affections and desires should be, in a measure, changed and renewed, so as to cause him to hate that which he before loved, and to love that which he before hated: to thus renew the mind of man is the work of the Holy Ghost.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>It is not surprising that the Prophet Joseph Smith counseled:<br><br><i>Tell the people to be humble and faithful and sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach [you what] to do and where to go.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Now, as we have gathered here this day, it is my feeling that on many of you, if not all, the Spirit and the power of the Lord has rested in some way. All of us are sometimes unaware of the goodness of the Lord and His remarkable influence in our lives. Far too often, too many worthy and humble Saints have wondered about their personal condition or worthiness before the Lord. The Book of Mormon records that the Lamanites who had been converted by Ammon had offered a sacrifice of a broken heart and contrite spirit and, because of their faith, had been "baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not."<sup>20</sup><br><br>I believe this to be applicable to many of the Saints in our day. I also believe it to be true of many in this gathering here today.<br><br>On the eve of the Savior's Atonement and Great Sacrifice, He promised His Apostles that He would send them "the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Christ, we are told, will fight our battles,<sup>22</sup>and the Holy Ghost, "which whispereth through and pierceth all things,"<sup>23</sup>will guide us.<br><br>In conclusion, I turn to this sweetest of our Lord's invitations:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Now, my beloved brothers and sisters, Icannot forego the sacred responsibility and privilege of declaring my testimony of the reality of our glorious Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ, as the resurrected and glorified Son of our Heavenly Father, is our Savior and Redeemer. He is our Advocate. He is not an absentee Master.<br><br>Ours is the privilege not to wonder at these things.<br><br>I leave you with my assurance and testimony of this divine work and my earnest prayer that our Heavenly Father will pour out upon you His richest blessings, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Christoffel Golden Jr. was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 8 February 2011.</em><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>l Thoughts in the Classroom - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is a wonderful delight to be here with you. In fact, on the way over we saw a bunch of tents and students camped out at the ticket center. One of my colleagues, Craig Merrill, said, "Wow, Jimmy, how's it feel to have all those students camped out to see the devotional?" I said, "Craig, they're here to see a Jimmer, but not this Jimmer." Seriously, I am deeply humbled to have been asked to address the BYU community today as the devotional speaker. Since being asked, I have prayed each day that the Lord would inspire me to give a talk that would be spiritually uplifting for those who listen. I pray I do not fail in this regard.<br><br>I was asked to give this address on Tuesday, January 4. You may ask, "How does Brother Brau remember the exact date he was called by Vice President Worthen to give a talk?" If you look on the screen at this headline banner of the<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>you will see that it reads, "The New Science of Conquering Fear." The paper is dated January 4, and it happened to be the first thing I saw after accepting the offer to give the devotional. Who says Heavenly Father doesn't have a sense of humor?<br><br>One of the most powerful and favorite quotes of the BYU community was given to President Karl G. Maeser by President Brigham Young in the early days of Brigham Young Academy. You have heard it often from this pulpit. Here it is again: "I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).<br><br>It is this charge that separates BYU from other excellent universities. For example, if your desire is to obtain an undergraduate degree in finance, you could attend the university an hour north of here and learn all about discounted cash flows, capital budgeting, and optimal capital structures. In fact, the finance that you learned there would be very similar to the finance you would learn from my department here at BYU. However, we seek to explicitly teach with the Spirit here, which sets us apart. This idea was reinforced to me in a recent seminar by Professor Dennis Wright, one of the deans of religious education and a good friend of mine, when he taught that "spiritual development at BYU is not a by-product, but it is a central focus." Think about that. Spiritual development here at BYU is not a by-product.<br><br>Recognizing that you, as students, have come to BYU for more than academic rigor, I have made it a point to share a spiritual thought in each section I teach every day I am in the classroom. It is my meager effort to attempt to teach not even finance without the Spirit of God. I strategically wait for the two- or three-minute spiritual thought to coincide with what I estimate to be the maximum doze-off time of the class. You know this time, for all of you have probably experienced it in at least one lecture. I teach in the large lecture halls of the Tanner Building. The seats are fluffy and soft. Most of the students can stay awake at least through the opening prayer. Over the next 75 minutes, however, you can see the doze monster quietly conquering a student here and a student there. About the time I see the third student in class starting to doze--it's usually about halfway through the class--I wake everyone up with a spiritual thought.<br><br>Here is some feedback from an anonymous student: "I really like the spiritual thought. That is what makes BYU better than other schools. Besides that, it breaks up your class and helps me rejuvenate for the second half of your lecture."<br><br>This note was received without identification in my suggestion box. I bring this box to class and let students know they can leave anonymous suggestions for class improvement or other notes for me. The notes I will share in this talk are from this box through the years.<br><br>Today I would like to share some of my classroom spiritual thoughts with you. Each semester the thought I share on the first day of class pertains to the fourth aim of a BYU education, specifically lifelong learning. We discuss how education is of eternal importance.<br><br>The slide that you see on the screen compares students to learners. I received this slide from my good friend Professor Doug Prawitt at a brown-bag teaching improvement seminar sponsored by the business school about 10 years ago. I have used it on the first day of class ever since. The slide is based on an academic study titled "Attitudes and Behaviors of Participants: Traditional Students Versus Learners."<br><br>On the left you'll see a list that describes many students who "play the game" of school. You know the type. They were able to make it through high school with good grades and little effort. They knew the bare minimum they would have to study to earn an A. They would cram the night before the test, earn the A, and then forget the material within a week. Unfortunately, many students carry this same strategy to BYU. As freshman, they perfect the cramming technique, earn As, and mistakenly feel they are being educated. The fourth aim of BYU, however, would suggest we all become learners instead of students.<br><br>Now note the right column. Notice how scholars with these types of attributes are well on their way to becoming lifelong learners. I then share the scriptural basis for becoming a lifelong learner and not "gaming" the college system to my class. Consider the next slide, "The glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36), and the next, "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18).<br><br>Next, I share a slide featuring a devotional quote from President James E. Faust when he addressed the BYU community in 1997. I thank my colleague and good friend Professor Stan Fawcett for pointing me to this quote several years ago.<br><br><i>For many students in higher education, going to a university is a game, a self-defeating game. To them it is a process of cramming like the seagulls in pioneer times when the crops were threatened by crickets. The gulls came and devoured, then they would fly off to disgorge and return to devour again. Learning is more than cramming for tests. Education is more than bulimia at exam time.</i>[James E. Faust, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_learning-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning for Eternity</a>," BYU devotional address, 18 November 1997]<i></i><br><br>I ask you, have you ever heard a General Authority speak about throwing up? Can you sense the magnitude of his counsel to BYU students?<br><br>As a last slide on this topic, I share a quote from the Church's<i>Friend</i>magazine. Consider this 2007 quote from Elder David A. Bednar, which Icame across while reading the<i>Friend</i>with mychildren:<br><br><i>I have spent most of my life involved in education. When I was younger, I thought education meant going to school, taking tests, and getting good grades. But as I grew older, I began to learn the difference between doing well in school and becoming educated. A person can do well on tests and still not be educated. True education is learning how to learn. Once I discovered that lesson, learning became fun.</i>["The Glory ofGod Is Intelligence,"<i>Friend,</i>October 2007, 6]<br><br>Elder Bednar's quote can be used as a litmus test. Ask yourself right now: Am I enjoying the rigors of my studies? Is learning fun for me? If the university has become drudgery for you, I urge you to pray to your Heavenly Father on bended knee for Him to put the love of learning in your heart.<br><br>My challenge to you is that if you are still gaming the system to earn the highest grade with the least amount of effort, if you are cramming like the seagulls and then regurgitating that information on your exams only to soon forget it, change your game plan! Become a scholar, a true learner, not a mere student. In a short period of time, there will be no more exams for you to game; you will hold a university degree. The exam that you will face every day will be called life. Our goal at BYU is for all of you to become true learners so that you may have success in that test of life.<br><br>Here is some feedback from a student about wanting to learn:<br><br><i>I just wanted to thank you for everything you do for us as your students. I really appreciate that you care about us, and because of that I actually want to learn this information. I just want to thank you because I stopped caring about school and my grades a long time ago, and you made me care again. Thanks again for your time and effort.</i><br><br>And consider this quote from the same 1997 devotional of Elder Faust:<br><br><i>Each of you, on a personal level, has the same challenge that exists for the university. You need to know the purpose for your being. Each of you needs to ask yourself, Why am I here on earth? Why am I at this university rather than at any other university, one that will teach only secular learning? Am I here to enjoy a scintillating social life? Is it to support the athletic program? Is it to find a companion? The answer is, You are here to learn for eternity. . . .</i><br><br><i>President Lorenzo Snow taught</i>:<i>"The whole idea of Mormonism is improvement; mentally, physically, morally and spiritually. No half-way education suffices for the Latter-day Saint."</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_learning-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning for Eternity</a>," BYU devotional address, 18 November 1997]<br><br>Let me say that again. No halfway education suffices for the Latter-day Saint.<i></i><br><br>The thought I share on the second day of class is on the importance of honoring the Sabbath day. I explain how I have an unshakable testimony of honoring the Sabbath, specifically as a student. I take a couple minutes to share my experience as I went through graduate school. I testify of how I was blessed for never studying or doing homework on Sunday. I challenge my students to arrange their schedules so they can complete their home studies Friday and Saturday so they can leave Sunday for the Lord. I ask them to never violate the Lord's day for my class. Some students probably think I took it a little too far when I was in graduate school. I relate how I would set my alarm for 11:59 p.m. on Saturday night and when the alarm went off, I would stop studying. I would then set my alarm for 12:01 a.m. Monday morning to begin studying again. Maybe it's my training from the military academy at West Point, but I have always felt it is important to have precision and exactness in following the Lord's commands.<br><br>I am not the only one to take honoring the Sabbath day this far. I recall a story from the<i>Ensign</i>that struck me when I read it, and it has never left me. Two farmers were haying their fields. They were both in a hurry because they had to harvest the hay before the weather turned on them. It was late at night, and each farmer could see the lights from the other farmer's tractor across the fields. One of the farmers was the bishop of the ward, the other a ward member. The ward member kept checking his watch, wondering if the bishop would stop haying at midnight when the Sabbath day began. As the time grew short, the bishop continued to hay. At exactly midnight, the ward member turned off his tractor and finished for the night to honor the Sabbath. As he looked across the fields he saw that his bishop powered down his tractor right afterwards. The next day at sacrament meeting, the ward member said that he was glad the bishop had his watch as well so he knew he had ended his work on time to honor the Sabbath day. The bishop replied to his ward member that he did not have a watch with him the night before, but he knew he wouldn't need one. He told the ward member that he knew all he had to do was watch the ward member's tractor across the fields, and when his lights went out, it would be exactly midnight. These farmers believed in precisely following the Lord's command.<br><br>Here is some feedback from an anonymous student put into the suggestion box after I shared the spiritual thought on honoring the Sabbath day:<br><br><i>Thank you for your spiritual thought today. As a freshman, I decided not to do homework on Sunday. I very much agree with everything you said. As a student, I have found it very nice to have a day off from homework. However, it has taken some planning to get my homework done during the week. This year I was called as the Relief Society president in my ward. I cannot tell you how nice it has been to already be used to not doing homework on Sunday. My Sundays are very full between all the meetings I am involved with. Having already set those habits has made my service easier because Idon't feel like I am losing study time on Sunday. Ibelieve that it is important for the students here to have the idea of no homework on Sundays</i>[given to]<i>them.</i><br><br>One of my favorite spiritual thoughts relies on the time in the Book of Mormon when Amulon was persecuting Alma and his followers. Recall the account in Mosiah 24:12–15:<br><br><i>And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</i><br><br><i>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i><br><br>Please note<i>how</i>the burdens became light. Iliken it to weightlifting. Did the Lord promise that the amount of weight the people had to push would be lessened? Instead of bench- pressing 225 pounds, would they be required to press only 135 pounds? Let's look at the passage in Alma again. First, the promise was made from the Lord that the burdens would be eased. Second, the Lord fulfilled His promise, and the burdens were in fact made light. Third, we learn the key to the lightness of the burdens: the Lord did not decrease the persecution or opposition that was upon his people; He made His people stronger. Going back to the weightlifting analogy, often the Lord does not take weight off of our barbell. He makes us stronger so that we can lift the same amount of weight--only now it feels light.<br><br>I try to stress to my students that oftentimes this is how the Lord works. As we become spiritually stronger, He allows more pressures and oppositions to beset us. Because we rely on Him for strength, we grow even stronger, and we can handle the increased challenges.<br><br>Consider this student feedback after sharing this spiritual thought:<br><br><i>Thanks for your spiritual thought today. I needed it more than you will ever know. Ever since my mission I have been faced with some very hard trials and have almost given up many times--most recently last Saturday before school started. I was about to drop out because of my trials, but because of my parents and now you, I will stay and somehow continue to face my trials with the help of the Lord. Thank you.</i><br><br>Here's another:<br><br><i>Hey! I just wanted to say thanks for your spiritual thought. I work two jobs on campus to afford to go to school. One starts at 5 a.m. every morning, and I often don't get to bed (after homework and other commitments) until around 10 p.m. This morning I felt really down because I just wished I had more time to sleep and do homework. I just wanted to quit one of my jobs even though Iwouldn't be able to really afford it. Your spiritual thought was kinda like "It's good to be busy" and "You can do it," and I really needed to hear that.</i><br><br>On at least one occasion, I gave a spiritual thought with one message in mind, and the Spirit conveyed a totally different message to a student who was listening. Here is one such example from an anonymous student:<br><br><i>Thank you so much for your spiritual thoughts. A few weeks ago you shared a scripture that really changed my life, no exaggeration. I had been on a bit of a downward spiral, and to tell you the truth, during the first month of class it kind of irritated me that we would have "spiritual thought time" in a finance class, when the thought would have nothing to do with what we were talking about. The scripture you shared was in</i>[Doctrine and Covenants]<i>where the Lord tells Joseph that he is chosen, but because of transgression he will fall if he isn't careful. He tells Joseph to repent and that he is still chosen and called again to the work, but if he does not repent, he will lose his gift and his chosen status (see D&amp;amp;C 3:4–11). That scripture hit me hard and started a chain reaction of introspection with my wife into our lives, so that now I feel like I'm back on a spiritual high akin to that on my mission.</i><br><br><i>This week I found out that my dad has been</i>[struggling with personal issues that would in the end cause him to leave my mother]. ... [Y]<i>esterday I was able to talk to him and share everything that has happened to me over the last month (starting with your scripture) to help me find my testimony again and get myself back on track. Ifelt the Spirit so strong, and I know he did,too.</i><br><br><i>I'm telling you this story because it is very likely that your scripture not only saved me, but it could save my family and my parents' temple marriage. If my dad could</i>[move beyond his struggles]<i>to making the right decision, it would be nothing short of a miracle--all because of how you have let the Lord work through you. Don't ever stop the spiritual thoughts, no matter what anyone else says! Thank you!</i><br><br>A couple weeks later, I received this follow-up from this unknown student in the suggestion box:<br><br><i>I just wanted you to know that over the past two weeks my dad got his act together. My parents are going to stay together! His testimony is starting to return, and he is committed now to working hard on it and his marriage. Thank you! I truly believe this is all because of your spiritual thoughts.</i><br><br>To be totally honest, I cannot remember the specific thought I shared that day, but the Spirit was able to work through this absentminded professor to do the Lord's work.<br><br>Of all the spiritual thoughts I have shared, perhaps I remember this one most often: My wife and I have a friend who lost her husband to suicide. It was a tragedy. We attended the funeral. Shortly after, I felt inspired by the Spirit to share in my classroom a thought on suicide and how it is never the answer. I testified that the answer lies in the mercy and comfort of the Savior. It is fair to say I was shocked when I found this anonymous note in the suggestion box:<br><br><i>Thanks for your sharing last Tuesday. I was thinking about suicide the night before. I've been wondering why I am taking this class. I think this is the reason.</i><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I do not know how many times I have thanked the Lord for inspiring me to share that specific spiritual thought that day.<br><br>To summarize, you'll have to remember that I am a convert of the LDS Church. I joined the Church while I was a cadet at West Point in my third year. As such, I had a military obligation and could not serve a mission. Unlike most of my peers here at BYU, I did not have the opportunity to offer challenges after each of the six discussions on their missions. I am sure my students and home teaching families wish I had gotten the "challenge bug" out of my system on a mission, but Michelle and I have to wait some more years until we get to serve our missions. So here are my challenges for you and me to consider. If you are going to take any notes from this devotional, I would ask that these following challenges be the notes you write down.<br><br>First, to the faculty: Whether you teach religion, physics, humanities, music, business, or anything in between, do not let one day in the classroom pass without explicitly sharing the Spirit with your students. Begin each class with a prayer. Make your classroom a true Zion. Make it different than any other university class in the world because of the Spirit. Look at your course evaluations. Along with focusing on your instructor rating and your course rating, consider the question that asks students if your class was spiritually strengthening. Make it a goal to earn high marks for this question. Remember, your students can go to many universities and they will find outstanding instructors and outstanding courses in the exact field you teach. What will set your class apart from these other courses is the Spirit you bring into the classroom. In just a couple minutes in each class period, you can change lives.<br><br>Consider this anonymous feedback from a student: "Thank you for all of your lessons. Life-changing! I am getting ready to serve a mission, and I can't count the number of times when I needed some answer and heard an answer in one of your spiritual thoughts. Thank you."<br><br>Next, to the student body: Here are your challenges. First, adhere to the fourth aim of a BYU education and become a true learner, ascholar. If you are gaming the education system, stop! Remember Elder Faust's words --do not be cramming seagulls. Learn how to learn, and learn how to love learning as Elder Bednar counseled.<br><br>Second, arrange your schedule so you do not have to study or do homework on Sunday. Honor the Lord's day and He will bless you. Remember the farmers in the field; they turned off their tractors at exactly midnight.<br><br>Third, if you feel like life is getting overwhelming, feast upon the scriptures. The Lord will strengthen you. Pray and fast with real intent. Listen for answers through the still, small voice. The Lord has promised us that He will make our burdens light by making us stronger. Seek that strength from the Lord, for with it we can do all things (see Philippians 4:13). Remember the account from Mosiah; the burdens became light because the Lord made His people stronger. Hewill make you stronger.<br><br>Fourth, dedicate yourself right now that you will always be on the Lord's side. "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). Use your time at BYU to absolutely solidify your testimony of this great latter-day work. "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>So why does Brother Brau share spiritual thoughts in class when those two or three minutes could be spent doing something else? In the end, I hope I can be a tool in the Master's hand to point my students to Him. In the words of an unknown student, "You helped me today with the light of 'a testimony of the Atonement.' I needed and have been seeking this with my wife. We are going to do it and strengthen ourselves in Him. Thank you for pointing me to Him."<br><br>Now I will close with my testimony. I was not raised in the LDS Church, but like Nephi of old, I was raised by goodly parents. My mother and father honored God and taught my three brothers and me to do the same. My mother, now a widow, still sets the example for me by attending Catholic mass seven days a week. In my 42 years of life, my mom has always been a constant source of spiritual strength for me.<br><br>While I was at West Point as an undergraduate, I came across the Book of Mormon. I read it as a skeptic, in an attempt to prove it wrong. Halfway through that sacred text, I came across Alma 32 and the experiment. Recall that Alma compares the Book of Mormon to a seed and explains that if a person performs the experiment of reading and praying over the Book of Mormon, he or she can find out through the witness of the Holy Spirit if it is true.<br><br>I took the experiment, my heart was softened, and the Spirit bore testimony to me that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. With this knowledge, it was confirmed to me that the Bible is also the word of God, for the Book of Mormon testifies of it. Joseph Smith was an actual prophet, for he translated the work. The Lord's Church has been restored on earth in these latter days. And most important, the Book of Mormon clearly testifies that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.<br><br>It has been over 20 years since I felt the still, small voice testify to me that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. I have felt that testimony many times between then and now. Along with the testimony of the Spirit, the fruits of the Church drive my testimony. I have seen firsthand for two decades the fruits of this great Church. As the scripture says, "By their fruits ye shall know them" (Matthew 7:20). Through the Primary, Young Women, and Young Men programs, I have personally watched the teachings of the Church influence my own four children, who are here on the front row. I have seen them grow in the gospel and develop their own testimonies. All four of my children are better people than their father, which I fully attribute to the teachings of the Savior Jesus Christ and the teachings of His restored Church. Another fruit is that of eternal families. My father, while not a Latter-day Saint, taught me my entire life that families are forever. He always looked forward to being with his father in the afterlife, a father who was taken from him by death when he was only four months old.<br><br>The truth of eternal families that my father taught me is a wonderful fruit of the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. In holy temples, families are sealed for eternity. Here on the stand with me is my beautiful wife, my eternal companion, my best friend, Michelle. Ithank Heavenly Father every day that He has allowed us to be sealed together and that we will be together for eternity with our children. What a wonderful fruit of the gospel.<br><br>As we leave the Marriott Center, I want each of you to know that, based upon the witness of the Holy Spirit and the fruits of the Lord's restored gospel, this finance professor knows that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ, and it is in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, that I close, amen.<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i><br><br><i>James C.

<h1>the Greatest Generation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always an overwhelming feeling as I stand and look at this beautiful and handsome group of young adults. It is even more unsettling to realize there are tens of thousands of you gathered in congregations throughout the world.<br><h2><b>You Are the Future of the Church</b></h2><br>As the years rapidly speed by, you will look back on this time as one of the most exciting periods of your life. I have great trust and confidence in the young adults of the Church. One of the most pronounced revelations I ever received came as I was preparing to preside over the Europe Central Area.<br><br>During a sleepless night I had an impression that the young adults were the future of the Church in Europe and I needed to focus on them. It turned out to be one of the most rewarding periods of my long ministry. Some very satisfying results have occurred during the last few years as we have listened to your ideas and concerns.<br><br>Together we have learned how to help you bring friends in large numbers to worship with you. I have seen the fervent spiritual power of the young adults of the Church. I know your capacity. I have seen how you strengthen each other and bring friends to a knowledge of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>You are young, and I am old. There are many years which separate you and me. When I was your age, I used a slide rule to make calculations in my accounting class. I'll give you a demonstration of how this works. I speak at the rate of 140 words per minute when I'm giving a talk. If I move the slide rule over to the number of words I'm speaking, I notice how long the talk will be. For me this is much faster than a modern calculating device. But in order to keep up with your modern bright minds, for almost all calculations I have had to stay abreast of the modern tools of this day.<br><br>In order to keep pace with you, I have been required to make many changes to be close to the latest technology. I have learned how to use a comptometer, a 1401 punch card and a 360 disk storage computer, a laptop, a PalmPilot, a Blackberry, an iPod, an iPhone, and now I have an iPad. Add to those Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and YouTube. Think of what it is like for an 88-year-old man to try to keep up with you!<br><br>What a trial it is for my generation to try to live with and watch what you are developing. But we have one advantage over you. We have been through all of the changes. We have gained experience through knowledge of some of the basic fundamentals which are still of great value as a foundation on which to build. You can only read about them. I want to talk to you about some of these basic fundamentals which must never be discarded or tossed aside.<br><h2><b>Make Yours the Greatest Generation</b></h2><br>A few years ago a well-known author described some of the men and women of my day as "the greatest generation." The author, Tom Brokaw, explained:<br><br><i>These men and women came of age in the Great Depression, when economic despair hovered over the land like a plague. They had watched their parents lose their businesses, their farms, their jobs, their hopes. They had learned to accept a future that played out one day at a time. Then, just as there was a glimmer of economic recovery, war exploded across Europe and Asia. . . . This generation was summoned to the parade ground and told to train for war. They left their ranches . . . , their jobs on the main street . . . , they gave up their place on the assembly lines . . . and in the ranks of Wall Street, they quit school or went from cap and gown directly into uniform. . . .</i><br><br><i>They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting, often hand to hand, in the most primitive conditions possible. . . . They were in the air every day, in skies filled with terror, and they went to sea on hostile waters far removed from the shores of their homeland. . . .</i><br><br><i>When the war was over, the men and women who had been involved . . . joined in joyous and short-lived celebrations, then immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They were mature beyond their years, tempered by what they had been through, disciplined by their . . . training and sacrifices. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another . . . generation. . . . They stayed true to their values of personal responsibility, duty, honor, and faith.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>When I was your age, I was looking forward to the same things you desire today. We were anticipating romance, education, professions, and marriage. Instead, we were called to serve and sent to the four corners of the earth to engage in a terrible war to protect our basic rights to enjoy the liberty to think, act, assemble, and govern safeguarded by the rule of law. Our service was not just for ourselves--it was to be our contribution for the generations that would follow after us. We went forward willingly. It took great courage.<br><br>Although I do not claim the title just for myself, I am one of the remaining survivors of "the greatest generation." As I look to the future--and as I look at your future--I pray that you will step forward and assume your responsibilities to preserve the noble heritage of our past. I pray that in a future day you will be known as "the greatest generation."<br><br>Your war will be very different. I am fully aware that your challenges will be much greater than ours. We knew who our enemy was on the battlefield. They were shooting at us! The enemy today is much more sinister. He does not always confront us in battle head-on. Instead, he hides in almost every device known to man. His plan is to plant an evil idea here and an evil thought there, to lead us away from the virtues taught us by our glorious history. With his clever plan he has devised ways to weaken our Christian faith.<br><br>Tonight I would like to talk to you about the weakening foundation of Christian faith throughout the world.<br><h2><b>Strengthen Faith in the Savior</b></h2><br>You have a role in helping our Father in Heaven's children return to their Christian foundations by developing faith in the Savior and His ways.<br><br><i>Pope Benedict XVI lamented</i>[over]<i>the weakening of</i>[the]<i>churches in Europe, Australia and the</i>[United States. He said:]<i>"There's no longer evidence for a need of God, even less of Christ. . . . The so-called traditional churches look like they are dying."</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>We have moved away from traditional worship. More people say they are spiritual rather than religious--if a teaching fits their lifestyle, they will accept it, and it will become part of their faith. If it does not, they will develop their own man-made faith. Faith and spirituality are now viewed as consumer products. Materialism has taken over and replaced God. Our voices must be heard in opposition to these dangerous trends which are designed to destroy the faith of mankind.<br><br>The Book of Mormon has warned us over and over again of replacing our trust in God with those things that do not last. Describing a time that many of the Nephites were drifting from their faith, the Book of Mormon states:<br><br><i>They grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to [the prophets'] words, to walk uprightly before God.</i>[Alma 45:24]<br><br>My young friends, as you see the weakening of Christian faith in society, your own faith must become even more firm and more sure. Helaman declared:<br><br><i>Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon ifmen build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>Nephi reminded us:<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins</i>. . .<br><br>[and]<i>that life which is in Christ. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . For the right way is to believe in Christ.</i>[2Nephi 25:26–28]<br><br>Do we have a foundation to support such aclaim?<br><h2><b>The Symbols of Christ's Sacrifice Have Endured Through All Ages</b></h2><br>The best recorded fact in all history is the account of the mission of our Lord and Savior to the earth. His mission was prophesied from the beginning of man's time on earth.<br><br>Let's just use one example. In Moses, chapter 5, we read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I the Lord had commanded him. And Eve, also, his wife, did labor with him. . . .</i><br><br><i>And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.</i><br><br><i>And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:1, 4–8]<br><br>Thus, sacrifices were instituted on the earth as a gospel ordinance, to be practiced and performed by the authority of the priesthood, typifying the coming sacrifice of the Son of Man, who would give His life for the sins of the world.<br><br>The form of the ordinance was always arranged to make specific the points of the Lord's sacrifice when He would come in the meridian of time. The offering of the Passover, for instance, was arranged so that a male lamb of the first year, without spot and blemish, was chosen as an offering. The blood was spilled, and care was taken that no bones would be broken--all symbolic of the manner of the Savior's death.<br><br>It is amazing to me that the offering of sacrifice continued through all ages from Adam even until the time of the Savior. Even though mankind went through many periods of apostasy, the hope that the Lord would atone for the sins of mankind through His Only Begotten Son and the hope that His atoning blood would make immortality possible stayed clearly in their minds.<br><br>The offering of sacrifices generally ended as a practice when the Savior came to earth. The sacrament was instituted to remind His followers that He had been to earth and had performed His earthly ministry. We read in Luke 22:12–20:<br><br><i>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</i><br><br><i>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</i><br><br>Once again I am amazed that this reminder, even through the dark periods of apostasy, was practiced in many forms and in many ways throughout generations until the time of the Restoration of the gospel, when the priesthood power was again on the earth to perform the sacred, saving ordinance.<br><br>Through all periods of recorded history we find the constant reminder of the mission of our Savior. He came to earth as one who had a dual citizenship--one of God and one of man. He could then perform His great ennobling sacrifice for all of us through His Atonement. Could there be any stronger proof that He is Jesus the Christ, the Savior of the world, than just following the doctrines over all periods of times? He has given us His gospel to guide and direct us during our earthly sojourn.<br><h2><b>Show the World the Truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>President David O. McKay said:<br><br><i>The responsibility of showing to the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ will solve its problems rests upon the men who make the claim. . . . I believe ... that every</i>world problem may be solved by obedience to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. . . .<br><br><i>The solution of the great world problems is here in the Church of Jesus Christ. Ample provision is made not only for the needs of individuals, but also for the nation and groups of nations. . . . I grant that we may seem to be arrogating to ourselves superior wisdom, but we are not. It is simply the application of God's plan to the world problems. You who hold the priesthood have greater responsibility today, now that you live in this creative moment in the world's history, than ever the Church has had before. I repeat it. If we make the claim to hold the truth, it is obligatory upon every Latter-day Saint so to live, that when the people of the world come, in answer to the call, to test the fruit of the tree, they will find it wholesome and good.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>The great message we carry to the world is that the gospel of our Lord and Savior has again been restored to the earth. His Church is again on the earth with the power and glory of the holy priesthood.<br><br>To those so ordained is given the power to act for Him as His agents to bring the doctrines, ordinances, principles, and powers to bind on earth as it will be done in the heavens. This is the Savior's Church. He directs the affairs of His Church through His chosen prophets. His prophets in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus as our Savior and Redeemer. This day and age is the dispensation of the fulness of times, which has been spoken of by the prophets from the beginning of time. It is the time of fulfillment of all that has been recorded to come forth, as has been spoken of by the Lord's prophets and has been recorded in the holy scriptures. It is not a new church but a restored church to the world in this day and age.<br><br>You are the generation the Lord has saved for this day. You came out of the waters of baptism with a covenant and a promise to the Lord to represent Him in helping people throw off their worldly ways and return to the blessings promised us if we would follow Him and live His gospel. You can help your Heavenly Father's children return to their Christian faith and develop a faith in Him and return to His ways.<br><h2><b>What You Can Do</b></h2><br>You may ask, "What can I do?" Some months ago our stake president, speaking in sacrament meeting, suggested four things that we could do to bring others back to us:<br><br><i>First</i>is daily prayer. I like this statement in the Bible Dictionary:<br><br><i>As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:7–11). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work, and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>To those within the sound of my voice who are struggling with challenges and difficulties large and small, prayer is the provider of spiritual strength. . . . Prayer is the means by which we approach our Father in Heaven, who loves us. Speak to Him in prayer and then listen for the answer. Miracles are wrought through prayer. . . .</i><br><br><i>Remember to pray fervently.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Have your daily prayers, and help others return to their Christian faith by encouraging them to get on their knees and pray to God.<br><br><i>Second,</i>daily scripture study. Could there be any stronger witness of Jesus Christ than the testimonies we find in the Book of Mormon? Of the 239 chapters, 233 mention the Savior. Isn't that amazing?<br><br>Be certain you have daily scripture study. Then help others return to their Christian faith by encouraging them to also study the scriptures daily.<br><br><i>Third,</i>temple worthiness. Some of you have been to the temple; others have not. It is well to understand what is required to obtain a temple recommend. We understand clearly the process by which we go to a judge in Israel and confirm to him our worthiness to hold a current temple recommend and then live by the standards required in holding that recommend.<br><br>Live in such a way that your righteous example will demonstrate how to live to be worthy of qualifying for temple blessings.<br><br><i>Fourth,</i>daily acts of service. Remember the words of King Benjamin: "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). The Lord literally answers our prayers through the service we give to others.<br><br>Be an example of Christlike service, and help others return to their Christian faith by encouraging them to get out and serve their fellowmen.<br><h2><b>"Onward, Christian Soldiers"</b></h2><br>When I was your age I had an experience that helped me understand the importance of service. Ten years ago the experience was told in the video<i>Special Witnesses of Christ.</i>I want toshare it with you again tonight:<br><br><i>There was an experience in my life which has often reminded me of the joy resulting from asking the question "What would the Savior do in this situation?"</i><br><br><i>I was among the first wave of Marines to go ashore in Japan following the signing of the peace treaty following World War II. As we entered the devastated city of Nagasaki, it was one of the saddest experiences of my life. A large part of the city had been totally destroyed. Some of the dead had not yet been buried. As occupation troops, we set up headquarters and went to work.</i><br><br><i>The situation was very bleak, and a few of us wanted to give more. We went to our division chaplain and requested permission to help rebuild the Christian churches. Because of government restrictions during the war, these churches had almost ceased to function. Their few buildings were badly damaged. A group of us volunteered to repair and replaster these chapels during our off-duty time so that they would be available for the holding of Christian services again.</i><br><br><i>We had no command of the language. All we could accomplish was the physical labor of repairing the buildings. We found the ministers who had been unable to serve during the war years and encouraged them to return to their pulpits. We had a tremendous experience with these people as they again experienced the freedom to practice their Christian beliefs.</i><br><br><i>An event occurred as we were leaving Nagasaki to return home that I will always remember. As we were boarding the train that would take us to our ships to return home, we were teased by a lot of the other Marines. They had their girlfriends with them saying good-bye to them. They laughed at us and indicated that we had missed the fun of being in Japan. We had just wasted our time laboring and plastering walls.</i><br><br><i>Just as they were at the height of their teasing, up over a little rise near the train station came about 200 of these great Japanese Christians from the churches we had repaired, singing "Onward, Christian Soldiers." They came down and showered us with gifts. Then they all lined up along the railroad track. And as the train started down the tracks, we reached out and just touched their fingers as we left. We couldn't speak; our emotions were too strong. But we were grateful that we could help in some small way in reestablishing Christianity in a nation after the war.</i><sup>6</sup><br><h2><b>Rise to a New Sense of Commitment</b></h2><br>I know that God lives. I know that we are all His children and that He loves us. I know that He sent His Son to the world to be the atoning sacrifice for all mankind, and those who embrace His gospel and follow Him will enjoy eternal life, the greatest of all gifts of God. I know that He directed the Restoration of the gospel again here on the earth through the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know that the only lasting joy and happiness we will ever find during our mortal experience will come by following the Savior, obeying His law, and keeping His commandments.<br><br>Tonight, my young friends, I challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment. I challenge you to become "the greatest generation" by assisting our Father in Heaven's children to return to their Christian faith and to the strong religious foundation that is so necessary to enjoy peace of mind and real happiness in this period of mortal probation.<br><br>May God bless you with the courage, the boldness, the enthusiasm, and the desire to again restore faith in the gospel of our Lord and Savior. He lives. This is my witness to you in His holy name. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>Love Were Our Only Motive? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. It is great to be here today. As that choir was singing, it reminded me that my wife and I met with our seats assigned in a choir just like that a few years back, and we've been sitting next to each other ever since.<br><br>This place is really like a second home to me. I spent a good part of my adult life at BYU. When people ask me how long I've been here--which they do at times--I say I came with Karl G. Maeser. So this is where we met, and this is where our children received their education. It's where I came to understand that learning can go on forever. I love the students here. I love the staff. I love the faculty. I love games like the one we had with Wyoming on Saturday. I like championships. I love BYU.<br><br>When I'm walking across campus, I like to say hello to as many people as I can. I especially like it if they say hello back. I guess it's my retro way of doing social networking. I once looked at a student approaching me on the sidewalk. She was on her cell phone--which oftentimes we are--but she still gave me a cell-phone wave. Quite often those I pass on the sidewalk are using headphones. But sometimes I even get a headphone nod. And this morning I got a headphone smile.<br><br>Once I was sitting outside a conference room in the library working on my laptop. A student approached me and asked a little awkwardly, "So, what are you doing?"<br><br>I explained that I was waiting for a meeting, but then I closed my laptop, stood up, and said, "You know, students never do that to me. They never just come up and start a conversation. Why did you do that?"<br><br>He responded, "Well, I thought I might learn something."<br><br>We had a memorable conversation. He had just returned from a mission, and he shared some of his favorite experiences with me.<br><br>Meeting new people can enrich our lives in miraculous ways. My wife and I recently visited Bucaramanga, Colombia, on a Church assignment. Bucaramanga is a city of 1.2 million very friendly people. In fact, they pride themselves on being the friendliest city on the planet. When we arrived, many were there to greet us. They made us feel like we were the most important people they had ever met. We had never been to this city before. We had never seen the people who were greeting us. And yet we felt their love.<br><br>Love is one of the most powerful positive forces in existence. It is one of the strongest statements in all of scripture, and it occurs twice in Moroni: "If ye have not charity, ye are nothing" (Moroni 7:46; also see verse 44). No matter how competent we might be, how bright, how talented, how athletic, how attractive, how hardworking--if we are not acting out of love, we are nothing. Those people in Bucaramanga were not thinking of themselves. They were not trying to prove anything to anyone. They were simply reaching out to us in love. And that student who approached me in the library literally made my day. His willingness to step outside himself for a minute liftedme.<br><br>While teaching a missionary preparation course, I asked students to keep track of key indicators, as they would be doing in the mission field. One of the key indicators was to talk to people. Just saying "hi" to someone was not enough. They needed to have a real conversation with each new person they met. Iexplained that on their missions, all day every day, they would be meeting people for the first time and they needed to practice this skill prior to their mission if they wanted to enter the field prepared. This assignment did not count toward their grade, but students invested themselves in it with real energy and commitment. Each week they would text or e-mail me their results for the week.<br><br>One week a student reported having conversations with 72 people he had never met before. That's impressive. I asked him in class, "How did you do that in one week? How did you visit with so many?"<br><br>He responded, "Oh, I was standing in lines a lot this past week, and so I would just ask the person next to me to hold my place in the line, and then I would move through the line and introduce myself and talk to as many people as I could."<br><br>I recommend you try this, by the way, because this is what he told me in the end. He said, "You know, Brother Osguthorpe, the surprising thing is that I really think I made some friends I will have the rest of my life."<br><br>Think of that for a minute. All he did was just meet people.<br><br>There is real power in simply reaching out to others and becoming acquainted. I once asked a student on the sidewalk how things were going. He said, "Hey, BYU's all right, but I just don't know anybody yet. It's pretty lonely at times."<br><br>My hope is not only that BYU will be known for its high rankings in academics and sports but that it will, like Bucaramanga, Colombia, be known as the friendliest place on the planet.<br><br>Being friendly is a great thing, because it's the only way we can move from acquaintance to lasting friendship. Several weeks into the semester in my missionary preparation course, I received an e-mail from a student who up to that point had never come to class. I assumed that he had dropped the course. The e-mail simply said, "I haven't been coming to class. Idon't know if there's any way I can still complete the course. Could I come and talk with you?"<br><br>I set up an appointment to see him. He came tomy office accompanied by his resident assistant. The resident assistant explained, "I overheard him last night saying that he had never attended his missionary prep class, so I suggested that he e-mail you and come and talk."<br><br>I told the student that he had missed a number of assignments and that he would need to complete each one or he would fail the course. I explained that if he could complete all the past assignments, come to every class for the remainder of the semester, turn in all future assignments on time, and successfully complete the final, he would be able to receive a passing grade. The next day he sent me a detailed plan for meeting all the conditions we had laid out. He never missed another class period, handed in every assignment, did well on the final exam, and passed the course. The resident assistant helped him along the way. He even attended the first class with him to make sure he had a good experience on that first day.<br><br>I asked the resident assistant what had motivated him to help this student. He explained, "Well, I made a commitment during my mission that when I returned to BYU, I would help freshmen prepare for their missions." In other words, for the resident assistant, the needs of a freshman took precedence over his own needs. He cared enough for this freshman student that he helped him write the e-mail message, came with him to visit with me, and kept in touch with him until the freshman had completed thecourse.<br><br>I saw that freshman on the sidewalk the following semester. He was with some friends, but he ran up to me and told me that he was about to submit his application to serve a mission. He thanked me for permitting him to complete the course and said, "I don't know what would have happened if you had not helped me."<br><br>I said, "I didn't really do anything. It was that resident assistant who made the difference in your life."<br><br>I keep asking myself, "What if our only motive were love? What if everything we did, we did out of love?" There are all kinds of motives out there. And many of them are not pretty. We might be motivated by revenge or envy or greed. Selfish motives are abundant. As students, we might be motivated only by grades or by our desire to get into graduate school or to begin a career. These are not necessarily evil motives, but they're not enough. We might get straight As. We might get into the best graduate school. Or we might land the best job offer imaginable. But, again, as Moroni taught: "If [we] have not charity, [we] are nothing."<br><br>We can even do good things with less than laudable motives. Quoting his father, Mormon, Moroni wrote that if we give "a gift, [and] doeth it grudgingly; . . . it is counted . . . the same as if [we] had retained the gift; wherefore [we are] counted evil before God" (Moroni 7:8; see also verse 9). Motives matter. They matter a lot. In the end,<i>why</i>we do things is probably more important than<i>what</i>we do. Evil acts are always motivated by evil motives. But acts that might appear to be good on the surface may not be fueled by pure motives. And one of the purest motives of all is love.<br><br>So is it possible to do everything we do out of love? Is it possible to study because we love the Lord and His children? Is it possible to be motivated by love when we take a test, read a chapter in a textbook, complete an assignment, or answer a question in class? Is it possible to love someone who has wronged us? Can love be our only motive?<br><br>We know what it feels like to have compassion, as did the good Samaritan (see Luke 10:31–33). But we might also know what it feels like to ignore someone in need, as did the priest and the Levite as they passed by the wounded man, worrying more about themselves than about the one in need. Motives matter.<br><br>It's important to remember that we should not try to judge another's motives. But we can judge our own motives. We need to look inside and take stock. Are we doing what we do out of love? Or has some other motive taken over?<br><br>We can easily relate to the story of the prodigal son. We have likely all made decisions that led us away from what is good and right. Then, like the prodigal son, we have "come to ourselves," woken up, and repented (see Luke 15:17). But we might also be able to relate to the brother of the prodigal son, who resented his brother for all the positive attention he was getting from their father. The father's only motive was love for both of his sons. He freely forgave the one and eagerly entreated the other to come in and celebrate the return of a family member.<br><br>We need to have a special kind of love to rejoice more in the success of others than in our own successes. When Alma met Ammon and his brothers following their mission to the Lamanites, Alma rejoiced in his own success, but he rejoiced even more in the success of his brethren: "Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my joy" (Alma 29:16).<br><br>When others' needs start to matter more than our own, and when others' successes are more exciting to us than our own, we are beginning to experience the kind of love that our Father in Heaven and our Savior have for us. It is a love without dimension. It has no boundaries, no limitations. It is pure. It is infinite. It is eternal. Oh, how I want to have more of this kind of love for others.<br><br>My wife's brother Steve became less active in the Church at the age of 15. He married outside the Church and for many years asked that home teachers not visit him. This is how Steve tells his own story:<br><br><i>I was assigned a home teacher. When he called me, I said something like, "I don't want to be contacted, and my wife is not interested." He asked if he could at least make contact once in a while and made sure I understood he was there for us if a need arose.</i><br><br><i>For 22 years, every month, I faithfully received a postcard from that home teacher with a kind thought or just a "hello, hope things are going well for you." I had never met him for the first 18 years, yet every month he made his home teaching contact the only way he could.</i><br><br><i>That contact became very important to me when we found out my wife had brain cancer in 1996. We never had children, and so I was the primary caregiver for her during her 23-month illness. I was helped by 12 wonderful women who were friends, neighbors, or co-workers.</i><br><br><i>One day the ward Relief Society president came by our home to offer help. My wife was asleep at the time, and I didn't want to wake her, so that visit never happened. But that contact by the Relief Society president was more important to me, I think, as it softened my heart. My wife of 31 years passed away 10 days later.</i><br><br>Following his wife's death, Steve needed help in planning the funeral. Who do you think he turned to for that help? To his home teacher of 22 years--the one who had faithfully written all of those cards! How easy would it have been for that home teacher not to complete his calling? Some of us have a difficult time home teaching people who do welcome us. But he stayed with it.<br><br>Five years later, Steve remarried. His second wife was a faithful member of the Church. His pathway back to full activity in the Church began. Last year Steve was ordained apriest, and then he received the Melchizedek Priesthood--all after 50 years of inactivity in the Church.<br><br>When we care for someone, we want to do something for them. Steve's home teacher cared enough to do something--to write literally hundreds of cards to the one he'd been assigned to visit. The Relief Society president cared enough to visit at exactly the right moment for Steve. I'm convinced that there are people all around us who need that kind of caring, that kind of love. All we need to do is open our eyes and our ears and our hearts so that we can know what we need to do for others.<br><br>We've likely all noticed how our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, shows his love to others. Following a program in the Conference Center, in which 7,000 youth performed on stage or in the aisles, a 12-year-old deacon sang as part of the finale. Following his song, President Monson motioned to the young man to come to him. The young man made his way off the stage to the front row in the audience where President Monson was sitting. They greeted each other while everyone in the Conference Center waited in silence. Then the young man went back up on stage and got swarmed by all the other youth in the cast. Everyone wanted to shake the hand of someone who had just shaken the hand of the prophet.<br><br>At the end of the evening, President Monson stayed to greet as many young people as he possibly could. We watched as a prophet of God expressed his love to the youth of the Church. At one point he went on stage and shook the hands of all in a row of young people in wheelchairs. These were youth with multiple disabilities. Some could not acknowledge President Monson's handshake with speech, but I am quite certain that each could feel his love.<br><br>While serving as an Area Seventy, I once accompanied Elder Russell M. Nelson to a stake conference in which a new stake president was being called. As is the usual practice, we briefly interviewed approximately 30 Church leaders in the stake. Elder Nelson asked the stake clerk to attach a picture of each leader to the leader's one-page bio. After we had issued the call to the new stake president and his counselors, we had about 45 minutes before the priesthood leadership meeting was to begin. Elder Nelson and I were in the stake president's office preparing for the next meeting. I was reviewing the message I was planning to deliver, but I noticed that Elder Nelson was going over the one-page bio sheets of each Church leader we had just interviewed.<br><br>I wondered why he was reviewing the information so carefully. Then, when Elder Nelson stood to speak during the priesthood leadership meeting, I understood. As he taught, he called upon Church leaders by name. He would say, "Brother Johnson, Brother Anderson, would you stand and tell us about how this happens at your ward?" These men were those we had interviewed for only a few minutes each, and he was calling them by name. He had never met these leaders before interviewing them, but he knew their names. While I was preparing my message for the meeting, he was memorizing their names--looking at their pictures and their bios--so he could call upon them by name in the meeting. He would likely never see most of the leaders again in his ministry, but he took the time to learn their names.<br><br>When I have shared this experience with others, they often say, "Yes, Elder Nelson has a remarkable memory for names." But where has that skill come from? He cares enough about others to learn their names. Most of us could memorize 30 names in 45 minutes. But many of us may not think to do so. I know that on this campus we have faculty--even those with very large classes--who make a serious effort to learn students' names. It is a simple thing, but it can change the whole learning-teaching equation. When love underlies our actions as learners and teachers--as human beings--everything gets better.<br><br>The Savior's earthly ministry was a time of teaching, a time of miracles. He established His Church on the earth. He called the Twelve to become leaders in the Church. He taught everyone who would listen. He healed the sick and raised the dead. And why did He do all these things? He had only one motive--love. His message to us is that we need to be good and do good, but we need to do it for the right reason. This is precisely why the two greatest commandments are the greatest: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind" and "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:37–39). The motive means everything.<br><br>We are all on our way to somewhere. We areall making our way forward in life. We may be looking forward to marriage, or, if we're married, we may be looking forward to having our first child. We might be looking forward to graduate school or to entering the workforce. We are always on our way to somewhere. My first mission was in Tahiti. I love the way Tahitians greet each other. The literal meaning of their greeting word--<i>ia ora na--</i>means "life to you" or "that you might live." We are either giving life or taking life from each other as we move forward on our way.<br><br>Harsh words take life away from the one who receives them and even from the one who utters them. But words spoken in love give life. The student who approached me in the library gave me life. This happened again yesterday. Someone asked me if I was speaking at the devotional; that action gave me life, gave me a little boost, just by saying hello. The resident assistant gave life to the freshman and actually to me as well. The home teacher and Relief Society president gave life to my brother-in-law, Steve. President Monson gave life to every young person he greeted in the Conference Center that evening. And Elder Nelson gave life to those Church leaders he called by name. What if all the words we spoke were motivated by love?<br><br>The Savior's life on earth was short, but He was always reaching out in love every step of the way. He helped so many while He was on His way to help someone else. He noticed what others needed, reached out to them, and helped them--sometimes in simple ways and other times in miraculous ways. Every miracle He performed, every word He spoke, He did out of love.<br><br>He loved those He taught. He cared for their spiritual well-being, but He also cared for their temporal needs. When they were hungry, He fed them with five loaves. When their souls hungered, He inspired them with the truths of His gospel.<br><br>He cared for those who lost their way. He cared enough to find them and bring them home. He never forgot one of His own.<br><br>He loved the young. He loved the rich. He loved the poor. He loved the sick. He loved the sinner. He loved all of God's children. When He saw them suffering, He healed them. When He saw them sorrowing, He lifted them up. When He saw them in pain, He comforted them.<br><br>His life on the earth was an example of what it means to do good. But it was also a singular example of what it means to do good for the right reason. Every act of the Savior on earth was done out of love. Even in the great premortal council His offer to the Father was motivated by love for others, while the adversary's was motivated by selfishness. The Savior's mission was to give us life by allowing us to choose to love the Lord and follow Him. (See Moses 4:1–3.) The adversary's goal was to take away our agency and thereby make it impossible for us to love, because it is impossible to love unless we<i>choose</i>to love. Love must come from within. It cannot be forced upon us. So for purposes of his own selfish aims, the adversary would have made it impossible for us to keep the first two commandments. He would have made us into nothing.<br><br>Christ had a clear mission in mortality. Hecame to earth to save each of us. He knew how His life on earth would end and how His act of love for us would change everything. Each of us has a clear mission as well, but, like the Savior, we need to remain open to the needs of others we pass along the way. Our calendars can never be so packed that wedon't have room to show love to those around us.<br><br>We are studying the New Testament this year in Sunday School. This book of scripture is a story of love--the love of the Father for the Son and the love They have for each of us. We cannot fully comprehend this love. But we can feel it. We cannot fully emulate it. But we can "pray . . . with all the energy of heart" that we might be filled with it (Moroni 7:48). It is a love that transcends all of our mortal experience. It is a love that lifts and builds and strengthens, that calms and comforts us. The only way for us to increase our capacity to love in this way is to feel the love our Father in Heaven and His Son have for us. The more we feel Their love for us, the more we will increase our capacity to share that love with others.<br><br>The Savior never stopped teaching us this lesson of love. Even among His final words were words of love. Even when He was on the cross and ready to complete His mission, He reached out in love to those who were literally taking His life: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). Even when He was suffering more pain than any of us can imagine, He still had love for those around Him, including the very people who were nailing His body to the cross.<br><br>The Savior is our example in everything--not only in<i>what</i>we should do but<i>why</i>we should do it. His life on earth was a life of invitation to us--to raise our sights a little higher, to forget our own problems and reach out to others. I know that we are all loved by God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. Their love is infinite and eternal. I know that They live. I bear witness of that. I know that They are mindful of our needs. They have called prophets in this dispensation to help us learn what we need to learn to return to Their presence. They have given us the scriptures to guide us. They have given all this because They love us. My prayer is that we will feel that love every minute of every day and that we will share that love with everyone in our path. I bear that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Russell T.

<h1>g and Recognizing the Holy Ghost - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful and humbled by this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak to you today. I still remember with fondness the day in 1971 when my friend and I loaded up his Volkswagen Bug and left Concord, California, for Provo, Utah, to begin our studies at Brigham Young University. Ever since we came around the Point of the Mountain and first saw the large block Y on the mountainside, I have had an abiding love of BYU. Brigham Young University is such a unique institution. I have a research lab in the Widtsoe Building and occasionally need to check on experiments over the weekend. One Sunday I brought my young son, Caleb, with me. We ended up parking pretty far away, because so many students were parked on campus for their Sunday meetings. I explained to Caleb that, on Sunday, many of the rooms on campus are used for church. This little seven-year-old boy made the following astute observation: "So, BYU is a school, it's where you work, and it's a church." Yes, BYU is all of those things.<br><br>I pray that the Spirit of the Holy Ghost will be with me and with you during our time together. I want to talk about receiving and recognizing the Holy Ghost. I will draw on my background in endocrinology to provide analogies that illustrate many of the points I want to make. If you suffer from "biology anxiety," let me assure you that I will make the analogies as simple as possible so as not to create undue stress. I also want to start with the disclaimer that when it comes to receiving and recognizing the Spirit, I still have many things to learn myself.<br><br>Endocrinology is the study of hormones. Hormones are chemical mediators that are delivered to the blood by endocrine glands. These hormones are then carried by the blood to distant cells, where they exert their effects. For example, growth hormone is secreted into the blood by the pituitary gland, a tiny gland at the base of your brain, and travels to distant sites, where it helps bring about growth during our developing years. Even though blood flows to virtually every cell in the body, not every cell is able to respond to a particular hormone. Only cells that have a receptor specific for the hormone will respond. A receptor is a protein on the surface of the cell that can bind to the hormone much like a key fits into alock. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a cascade of events is activated that leads to the hormone action in the target cell. However, even though the blood may be filled with a certain hormone, many cells will be unaffected by that hormone because they do not have the right receptor. The hormone passes right by these cells without exerting any effect. In a like manner, do the promptings of the Holy Ghost ever pass us by without being received?<br><br>Following baptism we were confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and were given the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Melchizedek Priesthood holder who pronounced our confirmation used these well-known words: "Receive the Holy Ghost." This exhortation makes it clear that we must do the receiving if we want to benefit from the ministration of the Holy Ghost. Much like a hormone cannot influence a cell without the appropriate receptor, the Holy Ghost cannot guide us, comfort us, and testify to us if we don't develop our own "spiritual receptors."<br><br>I love the story of young Samuel in the Old Testament that depicts the early stages of his acquiring spiritual receptors. You may recall that Hannah was unable to have children and made a vow that if Heavenly Father would bless her with a son, she would give him to the Lord all the days of his life. Hannah did have a son, and true to her promise she delivered him to Eli, the high priest, at the tabernacle in Shiloh. One night as this young prophet-to-be lay down to sleep, he heard a voice call his name. Thinking that it was Eli who had called him, Samuel ran to Eli's room to ask what he wanted. Eli replied that he hadn't called Samuel and told him to go back to bed. The author of the Book of Samuel explained, "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him" (1Samuel 3:7).<br><br>A second time Samuel heard a voice call his name, a second time he ran to Eli, and a second time he was told to go back to bed. When Samuel came to Eli a third time, Eli finally caught on that it was the Lord who was calling and told Samuel to go back to his room and when he heard the voice again to say, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth" (1 Samuel 3:9). How many times have we missed a prompting from the Spirit because our spiritual receptors were still developing? Like Samuel, we too require experience and sometimes mentoring to develop our abilities to receive the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Our understanding of endocrinology was slowed for many years because we didn't have a way to measure blood levels of these chemical messengers. The problem is that the concentration of hormones in the blood is very low. It wasn't until 1977 that Rosalyn Yalow received the Nobel Prize for her discovery of a method to assay hormones in the blood. If the concentration of hormones in the blood is so low, how is it that target cells can respond at all? The answer is that their receptors have what we call "high affinity" for the hormones that they bind. High-affinity binding means that there are strong intermolecular forces that readily bring the hormone and receptor together. What about spiritual receptors? Do they need high affinity?<br><br>While the Holy Ghost can sometimes communicate in strong, unmistakable language, more often He communicates through quiet promptings. It was Elijah the prophet who found this out while on a mountaintop:<br><br><i>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:</i><br><br><i>And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</i>[1 Kings 19:11–12]<br><br>Yes, because the Holy Ghost whispers instead of shouting, our spiritual receptors must also have high affinity. Elder David A. Bednar gave some important counsel about how we can keep ourselves ready and worthy to receive the Holy Ghost. He said:<br><br><i>The Spirit of the Lord can be our guide and will bless us with direction, instruction, and spiritual protection during our mortal journey. We invite the Holy Ghost into our lives through meaningful personal and family prayer, feasting upon the words of Christ, diligent and exacting obedience, faithfulness and honoring of covenants, and through virtue, humility, and service. And we steadfastly should avoid things that are immodest, coarse, crude, sinful, or evil that cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost.</i>["That We May Always Have His Spirit to Be with Us,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2006, 31]<br><br>By doing the good things mentioned by Elder Bednar and by avoiding the bad, we can ensure that our spiritual receptors have high affinity. In some circumstances we may need our spiritual receptors to have even higher affinity. At those times we can increase our ability to receive the Spirit by fasting, seeking a blessing, attending the temple, or finding a private place where we can pour out our heart to Heavenly Father.<br><br>Sometimes, even when we are righteous and eligible to be guided by the Holy Ghost, we may miss His promptings and leave them unrecognized. This may happen, in part, because of the quiet nature of the promptings. It might also be because we lack experience in recognizing the whisperings. Or perhaps we lack confidence in our ability to be guided by the Spirit. We may wonder, Did that prompting come from the Holy Ghost--or did we make it up? How can we better recognize the Spirit in our life?<br><br>I am now going to stretch this analogy about hormone receptors about as far as possible. As I already mentioned, only certain parts of the body will respond to a given hormone depending on which cells have the appropriate hormone receptor. What parts of our body have spiritual receptors? I want to mention two in particular: the brain--or mind--and the heart.<br><br>In the early days of the Church, Oliver Cowdery was personally tutored by the Lord about recognizing the Spirit. We find those revelations in sections 6, 8, and 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>In section 6 we learn that Oliver had already received a divine manifestation of the truth of Joseph's testimony about the plates but was seeking further assurance from the Lord. In verses 22 and 23, the Lord gave His answer:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i><br><br>This answer helped Oliver and helps us to understand that sometimes the Spirit is received in our mind in the form of peaceful thoughts. This idea was reiterated in section 8 when the Lord granted Oliver's request to help with the translating of the plates. In verse 2 the Lord said:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br>Not only does the Spirit speak to us in our mind in the form of thoughts, He also speaks to us in our heart in the form of feelings. If we seek to better recognize the promptings of the Spirit, we should pay more attention to our thoughts and feelings. But usually it is not our random thoughts and feelings that are important. Oliver learned another important lesson when he tried to translate the plates but failed. In section 9, verses 7–9, the Lord told him:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings.</i><br><br>It is usually when we are working on our part to understand a principle, to receive an answer to a prayer, to make a decision, or to choose a course of action, and so forth, that those thoughts come to our mind or feelings come to our heart from the Spirit.<br><br>One of my earliest recollections of a personal experience with recognizing the Spirit came when I was a missionary in Korea. I had the responsibility to present a lesson about something to the missionaries at an upcoming zone conference. I felt strongly the desire to teach something that would motivate, uplift, and help the missionaries in our zone. I remember the weight I felt on my shoulders as I pondered, prayed, and prepared for that lesson. It wasn't a pleasant weight. It was a heavy weight that burdened me as I struggled to find the right idea for the lesson. Then one day I had a burst of inspiration. Thoughts came into my mind and almost instantly I knew what to teach. I knew it was right because the heavy burden that had weighed me down was lifted. Instead, I felt exhilarated. I guess you could say I felt peace. I remember thinking, "This must be what it feels like to be prompted by the Holy Ghost."<br><br>In subsequent personal experiences with the Spirit I have noticed something. The peace that comes from the Spirit is often more recognizable when it comes in juxtaposition to a period of struggle and uncertainty. Perhaps the work and struggle on our part to study and ponder before receiving an answer is necessary because it makes the difference between our feelings of uncertainty and the feelings of peace offered by the Spirit distinct enough to be recognizable.<br><br>Another personal example of this happens in my calling as a high councilor. I am assigned most months to speak in a sacrament meeting. The stake president assigns a topic, usually an address from general conference, and we are expected to seek the guidance of the Spirit in preparing our talks. I have noticed as I read the conference address, ponder its significance, and consider the ward members to whom I will be speaking that the Spirit is always there to guide my preparation. Recently we were assigned to use Elder Donald L. Hallstrom's talk from April conference, "Turn to the Lord." One Saturday I was out for a morning run and noticed a large stand of daffodils in full bloom. I noticed how most of the flower heads were facing the same direction and suddenly remembered (and I believe this was a prompting from the Holy Ghost) about a principle of plant physiology that I had learned years ago called heliotropism. Heliotropism is the phenomenon whereby some plants and flowers turn toward the sun-- S-U-N. As the sun moves across the sky, the plants gradually turn so that they are always facing it. I was able to use analogies of heliotropism in my talk to speak about "turning toward the Son--S-O-N."<br><br>I give one last personal example of how the whisperings of the Spirit can come in the form of thoughts. Report card day for our oldest son, Ben, was never that great for him or for me. Though he was clearly smart and talented, his grades in math and science were never that good. This was difficult for me to understand because I had always loved math and science and had done well in those areas. It would be safe to say that more than once the Spirit was driven from our home because of contention over grades. One day when Ben was high-school age, I was pondering this issue of his grades and our contention when a thought came to me as clear as if it had been a voice: "You should be encouraging Ben in his strengths and worrying less about his weaknesses." As I mentioned, Ben is extremely talented and creative. We decided to encourage him to take a photography class that he was interested in, art classes, and other classes that would allow him to show his strengths. He did well in those classes, and his grades got better. Interestingly, his grades in math and science also got better. Ben eventually made his way to BYU and graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree in animation. He currently works at Pixar Animation Studio in Emeryville, California.<br><br>At other times, I have been able to recognize the Spirit in the form of scriptural phrases brought to my remembrance. Jesus taught His Apostles:<br><br><i>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i>[John 14:26]<br><br>One time when I was a bishop, I was struggling with knowing whom to recommend to the stake president as a new elders quorum president. I had narrowed the list to two very capable brethren. As I sat in the temple pondering this issue, the words of Doctrine and Covenants 121:41 came to my mind:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.</i><br><br>I immediately knew which brother to recommend, because one was the epitome of the virtues mentioned in that verse.<br><br>Another time years ago I was feeling some personal despair after my wife, Kathy, was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 44. You can imagine the uncertainty I felt as I considered the possibility of losing Kathy and what that would mean for me and for our seven children, who ranged in age from 21 to two years. I remember one day in sacrament meeting when I was thinking about this, the words "lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days" (D&amp;amp;C 24:8) came to my mind. I didn't even remember chapter and verse, but I knew Heavenly Father was sending me the comfort I needed by reminding me of a scripture passage. I later found the scripture in Doctrine and Covenants, section 24. I am so grateful for that comfort and that Kathy survived.<br><br>These two experiences illustrate the importance of regular scripture reading and study in opening up avenues for the Holy Ghost to commune with us in ways that we can recognize. Elder Robert D. Hales elaborated on this notion when he said:<br><br><i>What a glorious blessing! For when we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures; for His words are spoken through His prophets. He will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.</i>["Holy Scriptures: The Power of God unto Our Salvation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 26]<br><br>Sometimes spiritual promptings are given to us even when we are not seeking them. According to Elder Dallin H. Oaks, these promptings are given to<i>impel</i>us to some action that we are not even considering. He wrote, "This type of revelation is less common than other types, but its rarity makes it all the more significant" (<i>The Lord's Way</i>[Salt Lake City, Deseret Book Company, 1991], 30).<br><br>Kathy is a graduate from BYU's College of Nursing and is a registered nurse. Years ago our daughter Sarah was a little under the weather and had a bit of a fever. There was really nothing to cause more than usual concern. But as Kathy walked past our bookshelf and saw her nursing books, she had a distinct thought, "I ought to read up on what to do if someone has a fever seizure." Thankfully, she responded to the prompting and pulled out the book and reviewed the proper care for fever seizures. Not too long after Kathy finished the review, Sarah's fever spiked and she started having seizures. Kathy was able to render the appropriate care until we could get Sarah to the hospital. Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>151]<br><br>Now back to hormone receptors. Sometimes hormone receptors do not function properly, and disease results. Type 2 diabetes is a good example of this sort of problem. In this disorder the receptor for the hormone, insulin, fails to carry out its normal function. Without this normal effect of insulin, blood glucose concentrations get very high and cause problems. This is known as a hormone receptor insensitivity disease. In a similar way, if our spiritual receptors fail to function properly, spiritual disease can result. Remember the description in the Book of Mormon of Laman and Lemuel who were "past feeling" and "could not feel" the word of the Lord? (1 Nephi 17:45)<br><br>How can we lose the ability to receive the Spirit in our lives? Look at Laman and Lemuel. We learn from Nephi's account that they were prideful (see 1 Nephi 2:11) and unbelieving (see 1 Nephi 2:13). They were unwilling to follow the commands of the Lord (see 1 Nephi 3:5). They physically and verbally abused their younger brothers (see 1 Nephi 3:28). They were rebellious (see 1 Nephi 7:6). They also murmured a lot. As a result, "they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them" (1 Nephi 2:12). In essence, they had a spiritual receptor insensitivity disease.<br><br>People with Type 2 diabetes can benefit from several treatments that improve the function of insulin receptors. For example, exercise and diet help. There are also some medications that make insulin receptors work better.<br><br>What treatment is available for those with spiritual receptor insensitivity? Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught that a dose of repentance could help. He said:<br><br><i>I invite you to ponder individually in a humble and prayerful manner and ask yourself: "Do I have the Spirit in my life? Am I happy? Am I doing anything in my life that is offensive to the Spirit and preventing the Holy Ghost from being my constant companion?" Have the courage to repent, if needed, and again enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</i>["The Unspeakable Gift,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2003, 28]<br><br>As we repent and partake of the sacrament each week, we not only renew our baptismal covenants to be obedient and always remember the Savior, but Heavenly Father also renews His promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. How can we ever pass up this opportunity to weekly attend sacrament meeting and weekly receive this great promise?<br><br>Brothers and sisters, Heavenly Father did not send us to this earth without also sending the Holy Ghost to guide and protect us. One of the most important skills we must learn in this life is to receive and recognize the quiet whisperings of the Spirit. It is so crucial that our spiritual receptors have high affinity. We ensure this high affinity by being obedient, humble, and Christlike and by avoiding situations and practices that dull our senses. In order to better recognize the Spirit, we should pay more attention to our thoughts and feelings and make sure that we read the scriptures regularly. We should also attend our sacrament meetings and regularly partake of the sacrament. If we find ourselves "past feeling" because our spiritual receptors are insensitive, we need to repent and rely on the power of Christ's Atonement to restore us to a condition in which we can again receive those promptings. I am amazed at how quickly the Spirit returns when I sincerely repent. May God bless us to continually improve our ability to receive and recognize the Holy Ghost, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>James P.

<h1> Every Nation, Kindred, Tongue, and People&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When Mary Magdalene and "the other Mary" arrived at the empty tomb, they were greeted by an angel of the Lord who told them to "go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead."<sup>1</sup>Matthew, in chapter 28, goes on to state, "They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did<i>run</i>to bring his disciples word."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Within a short period of time, we presume (remember, they were running), the message had been delivered, and the 11 disciples were again reunited with their Lord and Master. It was then that the Savior of the world gave His first postresurrection commandment to his disciples. He told them:<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever Ihave commanded you.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>He didn't tell them to visit with their neighbors or to try to tract out their communities; rather, he told them to go and "teach<i>all</i>nations." I wonder if those 11 disciples or the other followers of Christ at the time stopped and asked either verbally or at least in their own minds and hearts, "So, how are we going to do this? We have these little fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee, and we don't mind walking a distance or maybe riding a donkey or a camel to a neighboring village, but, really, we're supposed to 'teach<i>all</i>nations'?"<br><br>Now let's fast-forward about 1,800 years. Tomorrow, April 6, marks a special anniversary for Latter-day Saints, as it was on that day that the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered with a small group in a farmhouse in western New York and organized the Church of Jesus Christ. Imagine how those six charter Church members must have felt when Joseph told them, "And, by the way, we're going to take this gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world." If they stopped to consider what he was saying, can you imagine how overwhelming and perhaps even unrealistic that charge must have felt to them and perhaps even to Joseph himself?<br><br>The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that "the voice of warning shall be unto<i>all</i>people"--not just to the followers of Joseph Smith, not just to the small gathering of Saints assembled at that special conference in 1831 where this particular revelation was given, but to "<i>all people.</i>"<sup>4</sup><br><br>In the first and second verses at the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants--verses that have become meaningful for me and my colleagues at BYU Broadcasting--the Lord stated:<br><br><i>Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i><br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>In our world today it is easy for us, with our instantaneous access to modern technology, to comprehend at least some of the ways the admonition of the Savior to His disciples or to the early Saints through the Prophet Joseph can now be--and is beginning to be--fulfilled.<br><br>In earlier times word traveled person-to-person or through written epistles. If someone needed a message to arrive quickly, they could run, or perhaps they could ride a horse or employ some other form of transportation that by today's standards would seem slow and primitive. If a message needed to reach a large group, they could speak from a hillside, or they could erect towers or cause that copies of the message be painstakingly handwritten and distributed. Think of King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon and the tower he built and stood upon so his people could hear his voice.<br><br>Obviously, such methods of communication pale by comparison to what we are able to do today. In fact, the marvels of what we're able to do today are so instantaneous and commonplace that some of us may miss the miracles most of us hold in our hands.<br><br>Those gathered in this assembly today have almost certainly seen the new BYU Broadcasting Building just east of the Marriott Center. It is the home of the radio and television channels and the broadcast-related Web sites operated by the university. For those who may be watching this address on television or the Internet, either in the United States or elsewhere in the world, this new building is the home of the channel you are watching right now: BYUtv. This morning's devotional isbeing transmitted instantaneously to over 180 countries of the world via BYUtv.<br><br>Likewise, as was explained by Elder Neil L. Andersen, this past weekend's general conference was simultaneously translated into 93 languages and instantaneously transmitted to the four corners of the earth via television, radio, and satellite transmission and on the Internet via lds.org, byutv.org, the Mormon Channel, and a host of other digital platforms. As described in a recent<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>article, 29 of the 93 languages were actually translated from other countries as interpreters received the live audio transmitted from Salt Lake City as the conference was taking place. From far-flung foreign lands they translated the talks and then instantly sent their translations back over the Internet to Salt Lake City, where the audio was married to the video and then, again, instantly beamed out to the countries of the world where that particular language was needed. All this took place during a live broadcast--all in a matter of seconds.<sup>6</sup>The technology behind so much of what we are so used to is indeed remarkable and miraculous.<br><br>In 1947, when the technology of television reached less than one-half of 1 percent of the homes in the United States, President George Albert Smith said:<br><br><i>Before us is the magic of television and a host of other remarkable discoveries.</i><br><br><i>We ought to regard these inventions as blessings from the Lord. They greatly enlarge our abilities. They can indeed become blessings if we utilize them in righteousness for the dissemination of truth and the furtherance of the work of the Lord among men.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>And in 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>King Benjamin "caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them." (Mosiah 2:7.)</i><br><br><i>Our Father in heaven has now provided</i><i>us</i><i>mighty towers--radio and television towers with possibilities beyond comprehension--to help fulfill the words of the Lord that "the sound must go forth from this place into all the world"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:64].<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/10/when-the-world-will-be-converted?lang=eng"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br><i></i>"I am confident," President Kimball said, "that the only way we can reach most of these millions of our Father's children is through the spoken word over the airwaves."<sup>9</sup><br><br>I believe what prophets, seers, and revelators since the dawn of the Restoration have said: that the Lord has inspired good men and women throughout the ages--inventors, scientists, philosophers, and explorers--in ways that would lead to the furtherance of His work.<br><br>Allow me to share with you just a few moments in the timeline of technology and the Church of Jesus Christ and this university. I start with the employment of the movable type printing press, which allowed the Bible and then the Book of Mormon to be printed in mass as a testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ and the Restoration of the gospel.<br><br>It was in October 1861 that the first transcontinental telegraph message was transmitted in the United States, having been sent by none other than the namesake of this university, Brigham Young. It was just two days later that the Pony Express system was deemed obsolete and ceased to operate. Indeed, the new technology of the telegraph had changed the world for those living at that time.<br><br>In 1897 the earliest audio recording was made of a president of the Church when Wilford Woodruff's voice and testimony were recorded on a wax cylinder.<br><br>On May 6, 1922, President Heber J. Grant delivered the first Church message broadcast on the first radio station in Utah, KZN--which we now all enjoy as KSL. It was that same year, 1922, that the first radio station owned by the Church was established. It was an experimental radio station operated by none other than the physics department here at Brigham Young University. Two years later, in October 1924, general conference was broadcast for the first time on radio. And in July 1929, the Tabernacle Choir's weekly<i>Music and the Spoken Word</i>broadcasts began, which continue today in what is now the longest continuously running broadcast program in the history of radio. I would also note that in each of these instances our prophets were on the cutting edge of using emerging technologies to take the gospel to "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."<sup>10</sup><br><br>There certainly are many other mileposts on this timeline, but in the interest of our time this morning, I will fast-forward to a time when I was just a little younger than most of you. I remember fondly being a young Aaronic Priesthood holder in the mid-1970s and sitting with my father in our chapel in Virginia listening to the priesthood sessions of general conference, which were piped in via a telephone line that someone had dialed in to Salt Lake City and hooked up to the loud speakers in thechapel.<br><br>It may seem a little out of sequence here, but I would be remiss and later questioned by my colleagues if I did not mention in this timeline of technology in the Church and the university the earliest days of KBYU-FM, which last year celebrated its 50th anniversary; KBYU-TV, which went on the air in 1965; BYUtv in 2000; and BYUtv International, which went on the air in 2007 in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.<br><br>We could go on and talk of the first satellite broadcasts of the Church or of how the Church has embraced the Internet, including the Church's YouTube channel and Facebook pages for the various programs and departments of the Church and the university.<br><br>It has been intentional, of course, that I've spent the first half of my talk extolling the virtues of the technologies before us as miracles and blessings from a loving Heavenly Father. But, as we all know from scripture mastery, there "must needs be . . . an opposition in all things,"<sup>11</sup>and we have likewise been warned by prophets, seers, and revelators that the adversary is embracing these exact same technologies to fulfill his purposes.<br><br>Elder Russell M. Nelson, in his last conference address, spoke of this truth when he said:<br><br><i>The forces of evil will ever be in opposition to the forces of good. Satan constantly strives to influence us to follow his ways and make us miserable, even as he is</i>[see 2 Nephi 2:27].<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/face-the-future-with-faith?lang=eng"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>In the same general conference, President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>The moral compass of the masses has gradually shifted to an "almost anything goes" position. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and it's growing ever wider.</i><br><br><i>Many movies and television shows portray behavior which is in direct opposition to the laws of God. Do not subject yourself to the innuendo and outright filth which are so often found there.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/priesthood-power?lang=eng"><sup>13</sup></a><br><br>Similar warnings and cautions have been given in past conferences and in other materials from the Brethren, such as the<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>booklet. We've been cautioned regarding the Internet, movies, music, video games, online chat and social media sites, and the many other forms of media available to us today.<br><br>I suspect that many, or perhaps even most of you, know of someone who once carried with them a wonderful spirit, but because of letting their guard down and being influenced by the side of the media that is not "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,"<sup>14</sup>they lost the light they once carried with them. Some who have been overtaken by the darker side of these technological marvels have withdrawn from their families and loved ones, let their careers or schoolwork suffer, and turned from those things that once made them truly happy.<br><br>And so for the next few minutes I'd like to share with you just a few of the things we might do to keep us from falling into the adversary's technological trap. I will focus on three main strategies that mirror the strategies we are using to expand the reach of BYU Broadcasting to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people:<br><br>1. Decide today, right now, who you would like to be and whether your actions and the decisions you are making today are leading you<i>toward</i>your goal or<i>away from</i>it. I refer to this step with the question "What's your tagline?"<br><br>2. Conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or, in other words, ask yourself, "What's on my playlist?"<br><br>3. Become anxiously and actively engaged in using technologies for good. Ask yourself, "What's my role in all of this?"<br><br>First, what's your tagline? I encourage you to decide today who you would like to be and whether your decisions and actions are leading you toward or away from your goal. This, of course, is true not just for decisions you make regarding your media consumption--but, for the moment, let's consider it in that light.<br><br>In the broadcast industry, media and television networks often use taglines, usually for branding or marketing purposes, but occasionally as corporate mission statements. Most use taglines because they define how the networks want us, the viewers, to think of them. I suspect most of you could tell me, without even thinking, the tagline for ESPN: "The Worldwide Leader in Sports." TBS uses "Very Funny," and in the 1990s NBC rolled out "Must-See TV." BYUtv's tagline is "See the Good in the World." We use this tagline as the guiding principle for our programming decisions.<br><br>So, I ask you, what is your tagline? What would you like it to be? As you are considering this, you might also ask yourself, "What would my friends, family members, and associates say is my tagline? Would they agree that the television programs I watch, the music I listen to, the Internet sites I visit, and the conversations in which I engage reflect the tagline for which I wish to be known?"<br><br>I'm particularly fond of the tagline the youth of the Church are aligning themselves with this year as they've adopted the thirteenth article of faith as their Mutual theme. BYU Broadcasting likewise is trying to model its programming after this theme:<br><br><i>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Second, conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or ask yourself, using the terminology of today's generation, "What's on my playlist?"<br><br>As you decide on a tagline, you then need toassess whether the decisions you are making around media are compatible with your tagline. In other words, is your tagline credible when weighed against your playlist? When referring to your playlists, I'm not just talking about your iPods or MP3 players, although they would certainly be included. Your playlist would include all of the daily decisions youmake.<br><br>President Cecil O. Samuelson, in his opening devotional of winter semester this year, shared a quote from President David O. McKay regarding self-mastery and personal character, and then he said:<br><br><i>While President McKay did not live during the time of the Internet, texting, tweeting, reality television, MP3 players, or social networking, the principles he taught are just as vital today as they were in the twentieth century. Weall know the blessings of appropriate self-control and the heartache attached to addictions or indiscretions of every kind. Just like King Benjamin, we can't list all the ways we need to practice self-control, but King Benjamin's advice is also absolutely timely.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/cecil-o-samuelson_seven-suggestions/"><sup>16</sup></a><br><br>And then President Samuelson quoted the closing verses of one of my favorite chapters in the Book of Mormon--as it is, in my opinion, the perfect blueprint for how we should live our lives:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i><br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i><sup>17</sup><i></i><br><br>Several years ago I was visiting with a friend--Dale Andersen--from Mesa, Arizona. At the time Dale was serving as a stake president in Mesa, and he shared a personal experience with me that, with his permission, I'd like to share with you this morning. He said:<br><br><i>I was preparing for our stake conference and having a bit of a stupor of thought on what I should share with the members of my stake. On the Friday night prior to conference I had a most peculiar dream--one of those dreams that was as real as any experience I have ever had while awake.</i><br><br><i>I dreamed I was at a family reunion with my entire family--my wife, my children, and my grandchildren. We were all gathered in the backyard of our home and enjoying a wonderful spring afternoon together.</i><br><br><i>And then I saw a most amazing and beautiful sight. It was a flock of blackbirds--but not an ordinary flock of blackbirds. This was one of those flocks that must have had tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of birds, all flying gracefully in perfect unison.</i><br><br><i>The birds would dart one direction, and then, as if cued by their leader, they'd immediately dart the other direction. Not a bird missed a beat. I stood there with my family--eyes transfixed. It was beautiful and captivating.</i><br><br>President Andersen continued:<br><br><i>As we watched this spectacle, the birds came closer and closer to us. It was all very exciting to see. And as we watched, we noticed the birds were pairing off two by two, and it appeared as though they were landing in the yards of all of the homes in my neighborhood. I thought this was rather peculiar. And then, as they got closer to my own backyard, the scene began to come into focus, and I realized in an instant that these were not blackbirds after all. These were dark, evil spirits!</i><br><br><i>Immediately I panicked and yelled to my family to run into the house and to lock the doors and windows. I was frantically trying to make sure all the members of my family were accounted for and safe--my sweetheart, my children, and their children. We ran through the house slamming the windows and shutting the doors and locking them tight. I gathered everyone together in our family room, where we would be safe, but then, as I turned around, there they were. I found myself standing between these two terribly evil beings and my precious family.</i><br><br>President Andersen said:<br><br><i>A window had been left ajar in the basement, and they had found their way into our home.</i><br><br>You know and I know that the adversary and his evil spirits are descending upon our families and trying to find their way into our homes, our apartments, and our dorms. At first they appear to be beautiful, enticing, and captivating--even to the point that, if we are not careful, our families will stand right in their path gazing upon them as though we were extending an open invitation to them to enter our homes.<br><br>So again I would ask that you consider the question "What's on my playlist?"<br><br>Third, become actively engaged in using technologies for good. In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior taught:<br><br><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>At BYU Broadcasting and with most every other media organization in the world, we know that television and media in general are no longer "push technologies" for a passive viewing experience. Today's audiences want to be engaged. They want to participate in the conversation.<br><br>To illustrate this point, I would like to conduct a little object lesson. Those of you here today with a portable digital device, will you please hold it up? Cell phones, iPhones, iPads, laptops--any portable device that connects you to others. Of course, most of those in attendance would fall into this category. If such a request had been made when Iwas a student atBYU, not a single hand would have gone up.<br><br>Students as young as elementary and junior high school age, but more frequently high school and college-age students, including many of our students here at BYU, are very much engaged in the worldwide online community.<br><br>You are building your own Web sites, iPhone and iPad apps, and other digital and social media applications. You are shooting, editing, and uploading videos to your own Web sites and other public sites like YouTube. As we heard two weeks ago from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who joined us at BYU for a special technology forum, over 500 million people, including most of you, now have a Facebook account.<br><br>Speaking at graduation exercises at BYU–Hawaii, Elder M. Russell Ballard encouraged BYU students to not just see the good but to do the good. He told them to "join the conversation by participating on the Internet."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng"><sup>19</sup></a><br><br><i>How different the world is today. . . . If you read newspapers, the chances are you read them on the Internet. Ours is the world of cyberspace, cell phones that capture video, video and music downloads, social networks, text messaging and blogs, handhelds and podcasts. . . .</i><br><br><i>There are conversations going on about the Church constantly. Those conversations will continue whether or not we choose to participate in them. But we cannot stand on the sidelines while others, including our critics, attempt to define what the Church teaches.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng"><sup>20</sup></a><br><br>And in the Sunday morning session of the April 2011 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf told us:<br><br><i>With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal, sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before. . . . Perhaps the Lord's encouragement to "open [your] mouths"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2]<i>might today include "use your hands" to blog and text-message the gospel to all the world! ...</i><br><br><i>. . . With the blessings of modern technology, we can express gratitude and joy about God's great plan for His children in a way that can be heard not only around our workplace but around the world.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus?lang=eng"><sup>21</sup></a><br><br>Brothers and sisters, you are the light of the world and the future mileposts in the timeline of technology. May we recognize a loving Heavenly Father's hand in the miracles of the technologies around us and remember that He gave them to us to bless us and our families and to advance His purposes. May we hold strong to the taglines and playlists that we wish to be known for, and may we be actively engaged in the cause of truth as we seek not only to see the good but to be the good and to do the good. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Derek A.

<h1>Well - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Before I share a message with you, I'd like to share the strongest impression I've had just sitting here. It is a realization of how pleased our Father in Heaven and the Savior are for the lives of each of you who are present--for the students who graduate, the staff, and the professors who teach. This miracle of a university is well-led and producing strong leadership in a world that needs it urgently and desperately. No one with any degree of spiritual sensitivity can stand at this place in the presence of such a concentration of devoted and righteous graduates, parents, loved ones, faculty, and staff and not feel overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation. I am deeply moved in contemplation of what can occur in the ensuing years from what you graduates have learned at this unique university. You have the potential for making deep and abiding contributions throughout the world. You have the will to form eternal families, to orient and raise righteous children, to strengthen a host of professions, to give caring service, and to be a force for good in a world that desperately needs it.<br><br>With profound feelings of thankfulness I warmly greet each one of you whom we honor at this commencement service. Each has met the lofty standards of personal worthiness and academic achievement to qualify to be at this singular university. You have kept those standards of righteousness. Through many long, arduous days and nights of devoted study, exacting testing, and other rigorous qualifying effort, you have well earned the degree that will be conferred upon you today. You not only have attained an outstanding secular education, but you have done it while meeting the highest standards of integrity and spirituality. That's not true of what will happen on many other campuses throughout the world. You will celebrate in honorable and honest ways. There will be some celebrations in other places where vitally important commandments of God are violated, but not here, because you are worthy and righteous. I am truly humbled to be in your presence.<br><br>Ido not know if I will ever have another opportunity to speak to you again in a like setting. My intent is to share some lessons learned in the crucible of my own life's experience to help you build securely on the foundation you have laid here at Brigham Young University. That will require mentioning some of the innermost feelings of my heart. I know that the largest portion of the gathering today consists of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I ask those of you with different religious backgrounds to translate these comments into concepts comfortable to you.<br><br>Would you consider that I am in a private setting with you as an individual or married couple? Forgive me if I speak quite plainly from my heart.<br><br>This world is in serious trouble. The fundamental values of this nation are being undermined. There is a continual crumbling of principle, virtue, integrity, and religious values--the foundation stones of civilization and definitive ingredients of peace and happiness. Iwill share with you as simply and as clearly as I am able a pattern for success and happiness in life despite these conditions.<br><br>God has given you the capacity to exercise faith so that you may find peace, joy, and purpose in life. However, to employ its power, that faith must be rooted in something secure. There is no more solid foundation than faith in the love Heavenly Father has for you, faith in His plan of happiness, and faith in the willingness and power of Jesus Christ to fulfill all of His promises.<br><br>Some of the principles upon which faith is based include:<br><ul><br>	<li>Trust in God and in His desire to provide help when needed, no matter how challenging the circumstance</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Obedience to His commandments and a life that demonstrates that He can trust you</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Sensitivity to the quiet promptings of the Spirit and courageous implementation of the resulting impressions</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Patience and understanding when God lets you struggle to grow and answers come a piece at a time over an extended period</li><br></ul><br>It will be helpful to you to understand and use the power of the interaction of faith and character. God uses your faith to mold your character. Character is woven patiently from threads of doctrine, principle, and obedience. Character is the manifestation of what you are becoming. Your character will be the yardstick that God will use to determine how well you have used your mortal life. Strong moral character results from consistent correct choices in the trials and testing of life. Such choices are made with trust in things that are believed and, when acted upon, will be confirmed as true.<br><br>As you walk to the boundary of your understanding into the twilight of uncertainty, exercising faith, you will be led to find solutions to the challenges of life you would not obtain otherwise. With even the strongest faith, God will not always reward you immediately according to your desires. Rather, He will respond with what in His eternal plan is best for you a piece at a time. Your continuing exercise of faith will forge strength of character available to you in times of critical need. Such character is not developed in moments of great challenge or temptation. That is when it is used.<br><br>The bedrock of character is integrity. Worthy character will strengthen your capacity to recognize the direction of the Spirit and be obedient to it. Strong character is more important than what you own, what you have learned, or what goals you have accomplished. Your consistent exercise of faith builds strong character. In turn, fortified character expands your ability to exercise faith, thereby enhancing your capacity and confidence in conquering the trials of life. This strengthening cycle continues, for the more your character is fortified, the more capable you are to exercise the power of faith.<br><br>Wherever you live, whatever your occupation or focus in life, you will be drawn into the battle for the souls of men and women. Be valiant in that struggle. It is waged on the basis of character. Satan and his troops have defined their character by resolute opposition to the will of our Father and consistent violation of His commandments. Your character is being solidified by consistent correct choices. Such character has permitted you to benefit from the privilege of a BYU education. Throughout life you will be rewarded from the efforts you have expended here. So many want to have the opportunity that has been yours, but they will not enjoy it. Show your gratitude by serving well in life.<br><br>Neither Satan nor any other power can weaken or destroy your growing character. Only you could do that through disobedience. That is why Satan is so intently focused on tempting you to make decisions that will undermine your character. Satan is an accomplished master at making devastating choices appear attractive, even reasonable. So be careful. At this critical time of life you will be faced with many choices. The decisions you will make will profoundly affect life now and for eternity. Make them wisely and prayerfully.<br><br>There are two patterns for making decisions in life: (1)<i>decisions based upon circumstance</i>and (2)<i>decisions based upon eternal truth.</i>Satan encourages choices to be made according to the circumstances. That is: What are others doing? What seems to be socially or politically acceptable? What will bring the quickest, most satisfying response? That pattern gives Lucifer the broadest opportunity to tempt an individual to make decisions that will be harmful and destructive, even though they may appear most appealing when a decision is made. With this approach there is no underlying set of values or standards to consistently guide decisions. Each one is made for what appears to be the most attractive choice at the moment. One who chooses this path cannot expect the help of the Lord but is left to his or her own strength and that of others who want to help. Sadly, most of God's children make decisions that way. That is why the world is in such turmoil.<br><br>The pattern of the Lord is for His children to make decisions based upon eternal truth. This requires that your life continue to be centered in the commandments of God. Thus decisions are made in accordance with unchanging truths aided by prayer and the guidance of the Holy Ghost. You have learned how well that works here at BYU. In addition to your own strength and capacity you will enjoy divine inspiration and power when needed. Your actions will be predictable and bless the lives of all in the circle of your influence. You will have a meaningful life of purpose, peace, and happiness.<br><br>There is no guarantee that life will be easy for anyone. We grow and learn more rapidly by facing and overcoming challenges. You are here to prove yourself, to develop, and to overcome. There will be constant challenges that cause you to think, to make proper judgments, and to act righteously. You will grow from them. However, there are some challenges you never need to encounter. They are those associated with serious transgression. As you continue to avoid such tragedy, your life will be simpler and happier. You will see others around you who don't make that choice, who do things that are wrong and evil and bring sadness. Thank your Father in Heaven that your pattern of life is different and that you have been helped to make choices guided by the Holy Ghost. That prompting will keep you on the right path.<br><br>Each of you has chosen to make decisions based upon eternal truth or you would not be here today. Please never allow yourself to make an exception to that pattern of life to gain a temporary, appealing advantage or to participate in an experience you know to be unworthy. I have seen so many young couples and individuals fumble the ball of life because they look to the wrong sources for how to live. They become distracted from true principles by being tempted to compromise just a little bit to gain influence, position, or acceptability. They justify those deviations, rationalizing that later a greater good could be accomplished. In the long run that pattern of life will take you where you definitely do not want to be.<br><br>How can you keep your resolve to live worthily? How can you be sure that determination in your heart will not be eroded by the pressures around you? If you are blessed to be married, rejoice in that companionship and with your children. Let there be absolutely no secrets kept from each other. That will provide powerful insurance for continuing righteousness and happiness. Decide issues together. Keep the gospel light burning brightly in your home through scripture study, prayer, and the other things you know how to do. Honor and live temple covenants as you receive them. Drink deeply from the fountain of the revealed word of God. Hold fast to His word. Keep the Sabbath day holy. In short, continue to do what you know you should do. Wherever you go, stay tightly connected to the Church and consistently serve in it. While single, keep these same objectives as they apply.<br><br>As an exceptional son or daughter of God, you are sorely needed. There is an urgent need for more men and women like you who will stand for principles against the growing pressures to compromise those very principles. Men and women are needed who will act nobly and courageously for what the Lord has defined as right--not for what is politically correct or socially acceptable. We need individuals who have the spiritual, righteous influence that will motivate others to live honorably. We need statesmen with integrity, businessmen who are honest and morally clean, attorneys who defend justice and the legal system, and government officials who preserve principle because it is right. Above all, we need mothers and fathers who will preserve the sanctity and safety of the home and the integrity of the family in which faith in God and obedience to His commandments are taught as the foundation of a productive life.<br><br>You who are gathered here can be an essential part of that shining light, that righteous influence to increase the moral fiber of this nation and its homes. Many of your friends live their life for the moment. They do not understand the need for principles, eternal laws, and truth. They have been brought up in an environment in which decisions are made on the basis of today's circumstances or tomorrow's opportunities for gain. Show them a better life--a better way. There are some things that are wrong because God decreed they are wrong. Truth is not determined by what men think, no matter how influential they may be. Truth was determined by an Almighty God before the creation of this earth. Truth will exist unchanged forever.<br><br>Oh, there can be transitory euphoria from power, influence, or material wealth, but true, lasting happiness, the kind that is felt in the early hours of the morning when you are truly honest with yourself, is won only by obedience to the teachings of God. You must have honesty, integrity, chastity, virtue, and a willingness to forego something attractive--even apparently desirable for the moment--for a greater good in the future. I speak of the willingness when circumstance demands we lay everything on the altar to follow true principles.<br><br>I would like to suggest to you ten specific things that have been selected to help you be successful in the plan the Lord would have you follow beyond your graduation.<br><br><b>First, establish a set of principles by which you will guide every aspect of your life--</b>in your home, in your Church service, in your profession, in the community. Many people try to compartmentalize their lives and have a standard for Church and another standard for what they do in business and in other aspects of their life. I very strongly counsel you not to do that. There really is only one set of standards that make sense. Those are the teachings of Jesus Christ, which signal to us the importance of faith, service, obedience, and integrity.<br><br><b>Second, don't make exceptions to your standards.</b>Never compromise them. One of the ways the Lord protects us is to give us guidance in life. One of the ways Satan tries to destroy us is to subtly lead us away from what we know is centrally important in our life. I lived in Washington, D.C., for much of my life, and I recall on occasion men coming to that city who had been elected as representatives of the government and who were members of the Church. Some of them used the teachings of the Savior throughout their careers and became great servants. Others early in their careers began to reason, "If we were better friends with others and were better understood, we would receive positions that would put us in a place where we could serve better." They began to make small exceptions to the standards by which they knew they should guide their lives. Few even remember them. They lost because they made exceptions to standards. Don't make that mistake.<br><br>Be loyal to the teachings that you have received here and have received from your parents. They are the things of greatest worth. I know that in your mind now there is high priority on the formal education you received here. If you integrate that with what you know about the teachings of the Lord and the examples of those worthy people who are role models to you, you will have a solid foundation and you will be productive and do things that are worthwhile for others.<br><br><b>Third, be loyal.</b>Be loyal to this campus, to what it has taught you. Be loyal to your parents, your loved ones. And, above all, be loyal to Jesus Christ, the Savior. Success comes when your actions are consistent with the teachings of the Lord. When you seek work, find something that challenges you, that raises you to higher levels of performance. It may be harder, but you will grow, develop better, and produce more worthwhile good. You really have no idea yet who you are and what you can accomplish in life. The fact that you have been able to come to this campus is evidence that you have great potential far beyond what you can imagine today.<br><br><b>Fourth, live so that the Lord can guide you to where He wants you to serve.</b>Some will return to your native areas where you were born and where you grew up. This is a seedbed of leadership that we need for the Church to build the kingdom. Let the Lord guide you to where He wants you to be. He can do that if you live His commandments worthily and strive in every way to be obedient to His teachings.<br><br><b>Fifth, serve others.</b>Sharing what you know with others will bring you happiness and bless their lives.<br><br><b>Sixth, smile.</b>I don't need to teach you that. Just being on this campus teaches the importance of knowing how to smile and enjoy life. I don't mean by that that you need to be cracking jokes every day. But a good joke now and then is an escape valve. It is not all that bad. You will soon learn that everybody has problems and nobody wants to hear about yours. Put those things aside and smile. Have a good sense of humor as the prophets do. I wish I could tell you some of the things that we talk about. Not flippant things, not things that are inappropriate--just a good sense of humor. Today we are a little more serious than usual, but I will tell you a secret of how to wake up in the morning with a smile on your face no matter how you feel. Now I'll have to whisper, because this is a secret. If you want to wake up in the morning guaranteed to have a smile on your face, go to bed with a coat hanger in your mouth. Remember, a good sense of humor helps you greatly.<br><br><b>Seventh, don't complain.</b>Life isn't always fair. That's a fact. But it's always charged with marvelous opportunities if you know how to find them. I remember once when I was working as hard as I knew how. I happened to be working for a man who took all of the ideas and suggestions and work that I did and passed them on to his superior as though they were his own suggestions. For a while I was really upset about that. As I pondered it, athought came to me, and I decided from then on I would write reports to him of everything that I was doing or trying to do, and I sent a copy to his boss. He didn't like that, but it worked beautifully.<br><br><b>Eighth, always have a Church assignment.</b>Idon't mean by that that you should ask for a particular calling, but wherever you go in the world, wherever the Lord takes you, always offer your service to the presiding authority. Leave it to that authority to decide where and how. Be connected with the things of God and the ways to serve Him.<br><br>The last two are the most important.<br><br><b>Ninth, go to the temple.</b>Carry a current temple recommend. There may be a few in the graduating class who will want to wait to go to the temple when they go with their companion to be sealed. But virtually every other one in this graduating class should obtain and keep a temple recommend. It will keep you spiritually in tune, will allow you to remember the most important things of life, and will encourage you to give great service to others.<br><br><b>Tenth, use the Savior Jesus Christ as your example for life.</b>Use His teachings as your handbook for life. Never make exceptions to them.<br><br>Will you prayerfully consider what we have discussed together? There are many willing to be led by your righteous example. Because you have been enlightened, you owe it to those who follow the best example you are capable of giving. Not only will they be blessed, but your life will be enriched as well. Come to know of the great influence for good that flows from individual acts born of conscience and principle rooted in truth. Resolve that each moment of your life will be reflected in your determination to humbly be an example of righteousness, integrity, and conviction. With such a life you will succeed in the purpose for which you came to earth.<br><br>I began this message indicating that I have validated in my personal life the truth of the principles shared. There have been times when my choice to stand for principle against strong forces implied that there would be significant personal loss by taking that action. But that did not deter me. I was determined to do what was right. The anticipated loss, however, never came. Somehow, doing what was right in time opened far greater and more meaningful opportunities. I testify that you will never go wrong when you trust in the Lord and in His promises, no matter how severe the challenge.<br><br>May I share an experience with you? I served with Admiral Rickover, a very demanding individual. When I was called to be a mission president, he tried to dissuade me from going. When I said it was a prophet of God who had called me, he said, "If that's the way Mormons are, I'm not going to have any of them working in my program." I knew there were many families in Idaho depending on work in that program, and I was concerned about it.<br><br>As I prayed, a song came to my mind: "Do what is right; let the consequence follow" ("Do What Is Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 237). I did that. I couldn't see how some of the challenges we faced would be worked out the way I hoped they would be with the individual who would come to replace me, but "do what is right; let the consequence follow." It all worked out very well.<br><br>When Admiral Rickover knew I was going to leave on a mission, he had said he never wanted to see me again and never wanted to talk to me again. On the final day of my working with him, I asked for an appointment. The secretary gasped, expecting that there was going to be an explosion.<br><br>I went in, and he said, "Scott, sit down. What do you have? I've tried every way I can to change your decisions. What is it that you've got?"<br><br>I handed him a copy of the Book of Mormon and said, "Admiral, I believe in God. And I believe that when we do the best we can, He will help us."<br><br>Then Admiral Rickover said something that I didn't ever expect to hear. He said, "When you finish your mission, I want you to come back and work with me."<br><br>"Do what is right; let the consequence follow."<br><br>May the Lord strengthen your resolve, yourexercise of faith, and your use of growing character so that you may be the instrument of good He wants you to be. I testify that He lives. As you worthily seek His help, He will guide you in your life. I testify of that with every capacity that I possess. Jesus Christ lives. He guides His work on earth. As apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have experiences that are very sacred that allow us to bear our testimony of His name and of His power. I do that with deep conviction. Jesus Christ loves you. He will guide you in your life. In times of great challenge, when you are perplexed about which turn to take, kneel down and ask your Father in Heaven to bless you, and let your faith in the Savior and His Atonement be the rock and foundation of a successful life, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Richard G.

<h1>the Y - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. And, I have to say, you are an awesome sight! My oldest daughter, Mackenzie, is graduating today, so Iam especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy our family experiences through having children attend BYU.<br><br>Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:<br><br><i>I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually.</i>["Your Gifts Bless Generations," insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]<br><br>I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I hope you feel that as well.<br><br>Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed manytests--some academic and some in otheraspects of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.<br><br>It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when<br><br><i>Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. "It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, 'What have I done?' and, 'What do I do now?'" he recalls. "I found myself on my knees within minutes."</i><br><br><i>Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD '78). Edwards set achair directly in front of Mendenhall's chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.</i><br><br>"[LaVell Edward's]<i>first words were 'You have a tough job.' Then there was a pause and silence," says Mendenhall. "It wasn't very comforting to hear that. But then</i>[LaVell]<i>just said, 'But it's a great job.' I didn't know what he meant by either atthe time."</i><br><br><i>Mendenhall has come to consider</i>[Coach]<i>Edwards a mentor and an advocate. "It's nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what it's like to be a head coach here." The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be.</i>[Peter B. Gardner, "The Bronco Way,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>winter 2007, 22–23]<br><br>Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, contact your colleges and offer to mentor students. For those who will be farther away, stay close to students when they are home for vacations or to work between semesters. Just an arm on a shoulder, some encouragement and advice, and showing that someone cares about their success is a terrific way to take BYU with you. Be mentors.<br><br>I have a BYU ring that I always wear. I was on vacation in Southern California last fall, and it was amazing how many people saw it and told me they were BYU alums or supporters. It was a small thing--only visible if someone saw my hand--yet it generated a lot of discussion and inquiry everywhere I went. That one small ring had a huge effect on connecting people to BYU and to each other. You can have just as much impact and be significant in connecting people for good--just like my ring was to those people I encountered while on vacation--if you "wear the Y" wherever you are.<br><br>Wear the Y<br><br>in your countenance<br><br>in your speech and communication<br><br>in your example<br><br>in your choices<br><br>in your attitude<br><br>You will find that "wearing BYU" will allow you to share the gospel and stay connected for good to the university.<br><br>Here are three more ideas to consider: contribute, connect, and serve.<br><br>First, contribute annually with your monetary resources. One thing I have learned in my service to the BYU Alumni Association is that every gift to BYU--large or small--is important to the university.<br><br>Erlynn Lansing, a grateful alum who graduated in 1974, said this:<br><br><i>Our experience [at BYU] and our associations at the university have helped us as parents, in our Church callings, and in [my husband's] professional duties. . . . The only way we can adequately thank the Lord and all those who have helped us is to give back so that others may have wonderful experiences like we've had.</i>[Erlynn Ensign Lansing, "Funding Futures,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>summer 2010, 58]<br><br>Robbie Ross Tisch, a strategic planning and organizational effectiveness consultant, shared these thoughts on giving:<br><br><i>Being generous takes people out of narrow, fearfulplaces of scarcity and returns them to the spaciousness of connection and concern about others, into "we-ness" rather than "me-ness."</i>[http://www.managementassistance.org/ht/a/GetDocumentAction/i/11015]<br><br>Because of donations, thousand of students receive an outstanding education. Show your appreciation by supporting the financial needs of BYU. Your monetary resources are vital to the work of the university.<br><br>Next, stay connected to BYU by attending BYU-related events, allowing you to enjoy the fruits of what BYU students and alumni have to offer in the way of excellence in sports, performance, and intellectual knowledge. And update your records so we can keep you informed about BYU. Let us know where you are, because we want you to be "connected for good" to the university and to alumni everywhere you go.<br><br>And, finally, serve and volunteer.<br><br>Linda Palmer, executive director of the Alumni Association, said:<br><br><i>Service is a core part of being a BYU graduate. It's our charge. We enter to learn; we must go forth to serve. Bettering the world is part of the commitment we make in coming here.</i>[Linda Palmer, "Enter to Serve,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>fall 2010, 49]<br><br>BYU is here to help us all serve the world better. Look for opportunities in your life to be the one who makes the difference in the life of another. Bring light and goodness wherever you are through your service.<br><br>Mentoring, wearing the Y, contributing, connecting, and serving--these will keep the Spirit of the Y alive in you.<br><br>I conclude with thoughts adapted from a poster hanging in the Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center. Designed by Chris Giovarelli, a past BYUSA president and BYU Student Alumni Association president, the poster is called "TheAnatomy of the Active Alum."<br><br>Here is what you can strive to have:<br><ul><br>	<li>A mind that is sharp and dedicated to lifelong learning and service.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Muscles that are always ready to be flexed for the benefit of others around you.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Knees that are used for prayer, helping you to remain close to the gospel throughout your life.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Legs that walk the walk expected of those who graduate from BYU.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Eyes that focus on the mission of the university to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>A heart filled with the Spirit of the Y and apassion for all things BYU.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Hands willing to give time, talent, and resources to the university, to the community, and to those around them.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Feet solidly planted, enabling you to quickly become an asset to your community, wherever you may land.</li><br></ul><br>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>You have gained a rich heritage from your experiences as a student and member of the BYU community. You can bless others with this heritage wherever you are. Be a light to those who can be lifted, taught, and encouraged. Be proud of what BYU is, for it is much more than you might have seen in your time here. It is a wonderful combination of many colleges, teams, performing groups, clubs, academic associations, and religious affiliations that all combine to meet the needs of the world we live in. That world is begging for bright, wholesome, dedicated graduates to take all the goodness BYU has produced in you to serve the world with your talents and abilities.<br><br>May you maintain a meaningful connection to the people, relationships, feelings, experiences, and memories created at BYU. May your Christlike influence be felt wherever you may be found throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Chris Feinauer was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 21 April 2011.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>#039;s Aims Your Aims? - to April 2011 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Once again it is my great privilege and honor to welcome each of you to these exercises today. I continue to bask in your achievements and am grateful to express my congratulations and commendations to you graduates, your families, and all who have contributed to your noteworthy successes. The faculty is both impressed and relieved that you have achieved the tremendous mileposts reflected in the program of the day.<br><br>This class of graduates is rather typical of those of recent years in terms of your numbers, majors, ages, and other demographic characteristics. There is more than a fifty-year difference in the ages of our oldest and youngest graduates. As is usually the case, all fifty states can claim graduates in the class, as is also true with three U.S. territories and seventy-two other countries. Between this commencement and our August event, we will have in excess of 8,000 newly credentialed BYU graduates in this calendar year, and we are immensely proud of all of you who have done so very well.<br><br>In previous commencement exercises I have mentioned many of the external challenges and opportunities you will face as you complete your BYU experience. The economy may not be as worrisome for some of you, but it is still not robust, and much uncertainty awaits us. In fulfillment of prophecy we are surrounded by wars and rumors of wars--some in countries native to members of the class--and horrible natural disasters such as have been experienced in Japan and other parts of the world. Again, these places are home to some of you and of great concern and worry to us all.<br><br>Likewise, on other occasions I have commented on the marital status and trends of the class and our hopes and aspirations for you in this regard. Perhaps after our most recent general conference you will likely conclude that all that needs to be said has already been said! Still, we recognize that today is not one of exclusive, individual celebrations but largely family events that we heartily endorse. Continue to give high priority and attention to your spouses, children, and extended families with the understanding that they will be most important to you when nothing else is.<br><br>In recent months we have given special and significant attention to the BYU mission statement and Aims of a BYU Education. If you are not familiar with them or want to refresh your understanding, please look for them on our BYU web page. These documents were carefully crafted under the inspiration and approval of the board of trustees many years ago, but they still stand the test of time and are as accurate as they have ever been. One of the reasons for the current increased attention to them is that the university's accrediting agency has required that we submit to them our core themes, learning objectives, and other information with more detail than ever before.<br><br>Under the inspired leadership of Professor Jim Gordon we have concluded that the mission statement and Aims of a BYU Education provide wonderfully clear and accurate statements of what BYU really is, what we really value, and what we really aspire and work to achieve. None of this should surprise anyone in attendance today, but it is a source of both great comfort and significant enlightenment to those of us with leadership responsibilities at BYU.<br><br>We speak of our aims, which I will explicate in a moment, as if they were separate and distinct. Actually, while framed in plural language, they reflect the central prophetic theme that has been our guide and inspiration since our founding 136 years ago when Brigham Young said to Karl G. Maeser that BYU "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).<br><br>Let me mention them in their individuality, as you will then better understand their inseparability. While some institutions may focus almost exclusively on one of these important values, BYU does not and cannot for reasons we hope are obvious to all of us here and increasingly understood by Church members, friends, and observers all around the world. While we tend to refer to them in a particular order, we recognized that each would be diminished in its value and in the prophetic aspirations of our leaders should any one of them be asked to stand alone.<br><br>First in our chronology is that a BYU education always should be<i>spiritually strengthening.</i><br><br>Second, a BYU education must be<i>intellectually enlarging.</i><br><br>Third, a BYU education is designed to be<i>character building.</i><br><br>All three of these aims lead to a pattern of<i>lifelong learning and service.</i><br><br>While we speak of them as BYU aims, we hope in the process of your experiences here that they have become your own personal aims as well. It would be my request and plea, if you will accept them as such, that you might consider how these aims will help focus and direct the rest of your lives. Please ask yourselves the following questions regularly and intently:<br><br><b>First,</b>what am I doing to make sure my life, my activities, and my priorities are spiritually strengthening? Am I living my life in such a way that I can reliably seek the direction of the Holy Spirit and know that I am receiving it? Am I avoiding choices or temptations that would detract from the companionship of the Holy Ghost?<br><br><b>Second,</b>what do I do to continue to develop in an intellectually enlarging way? We believe that one important skill and associated attitude acquired by almost all BYU graduates is the understanding of learning how to learn. More than ever you will be your own teacher and will create your own tests and quizzes. Some of what you have learned at BYU will be timeless, but other specifics, facts, or approaches in your major discipline will change over time, and you must be able to keep up. Think about how you will continue to acquire new ways to learn and master what you must and want to accomplish.<br><br><b>Third,</b>as your lives become even more demanding and complicated, your integrity and honor will come under ever-increasing attacks. Thus you must continue to build and strengthen your character upon the already firm foundation of honesty, dependability, and reliability that you initially brought to BYU and have enhanced while here. Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed this important truth: "It is easier to be a character than to have character!" ("The Disciple-Scholar," in Henry B. Eyring, ed.,<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995], 21).<br><br>We believe with great confidence and conviction that you are optimally prepared for long lives of continued learning and substantial service in all that you do. We are proud of you and your accomplishments. We are grateful for your contributions both now and in the future and are inspired with the optimism that you will make meaningful differences in the lives of others as well as with the circumstances and causes in which you are involved. The tithe payers of the Church and the others who have shared their treasure so that you might experience all that BYU offers deserve the confidence they have in the rightness and value of their investments. Thank you for the part you have played.<br><br>Brigham Young University is a very special institution created, sustained, and led by the Lord's prophets. Of this I testify as I leave my blessing and commendations with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 21 April 2011.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>asion, Longsuffering, Meekness, and Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The ebb and flow of university life creates constant opportunities for reflection. At graduation ceremonies we enjoy the chance to meet the family and friends of our recent graduates. These are some of my favorite moments as we recall their foundational undergraduate experiences, such as how they made an important decision, where couples first met, orpoignant memories that shaped them.<br><br>Several years ago my wife, Michelle, and I had a formative experience, you could say, as undergraduate interns on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. We met! It occurred in an environment that was vibrant and new to us. The two major political parties were locked in the national conversation that we call a presidential election. It was an intense experience to see Republicans and Democrats politicking around the country, angling for votes, while the nation's capital felt like the epicenter of the action.<br><br>Seeing politics up close and in person was sometimes strange and surprising. In addition to hearing from a wide variety of viewpoints, we were able to see the complex mix of policies, parties, and people. We gained new experience watching the media as it conveyed the same news that we were also witnessing firsthand. One Saturday I spent four long hours in the rain with thousands of volunteers just waiting for a motorcade to pass so we could wave a sign showing support for a few brief seconds. Another student had the chance to jump on a trampoline with a well-known candidate at his fund-raiser. We attended galas and hearings and debates and discussions. We saw glimpses of political stagecraft from behind the scenes. All of this was part of what felt like a national civic theatrical production with the ultimate goal of persuading voters to choose a candidate.<br><h2><b>Persuade and Be Persuaded</b></h2><br>Life involves persuasion. Each day we are persuaded, and frequently we persuade others. We encounter decisions that force our resolve and judgment. For example, students must respond to a flurry of constant questions: What will I make of my life? What should I study? How will I make a living? How will I make a difference in the world? They may also try to persuade parents to send a little money, professors to reconsider a grade, or someone to consider going on a date with them. But each of us is surrounded by and involved with numerous other discussions and debates--for material wants and needs as seen in marketing and consumer society, for the common good through policy and politics, and for the deeper matters of the soul involving faith and conviction.<br><br>Persuasion is the art of shaping beliefs and decisions and is an essential part of our lives as consumers, citizens, and Latter-day Saints. Persuasion is also a driving force of academic life. You could say that one role of a university is to house the thousands and even millions of ongoing dialogues among learners about the known and the unknown world. Brigham Young University aims to develop "students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1996], 3). It is in that regard I'd like to explore the notion of persuasion.<br><h2><b>Persuasion and the Gospel</b></h2><br>We recognize that the greatest power on our planet--the power to act in the name of God, or the priesthood--can be "handled only upon the principles of righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36). This concept is part of what President Dieter F. Uchtdorf recently referred to as the "owner's manual" of the priesthood ("Your Potential, Your Privilege,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2011, 59) and what President Heber J. Grant noted to be one of his most oft-quoted verses from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42; see Heber J. Grant,<i>CR,</i>October 1923, 159]<br><br>Why are these principles of power and influence included together? What does it say about persuasion, long-suffering, meekness, and love, among other virtues, that makes them essential? And how can they be applied in the myriad of social interactions we have as lifelong learners and disciples?<br><br>Early in the Book of Mormon, Lehi had a dream in which his family was commanded to obtain critical records on plates of brass. The only problem was that these records were located somewhere other than where his family was, and it meant doing something that several of his sons weren't planning on nor were enthused about doing--namely, going back.<br><br>Lacking agreement, after "consult[ing] one with another" (1 Nephi 3:10), the sons made the decision on who would face Laban by casting lots. Laman was chosen to head back to Jerusalem. He subsequently failed to get the plates and returned to tell his brothers the bad news.<br><br>At this point the brothers were finished, but Nephi wasn't willing to give up just yet. He gave them a charge:<br><br><i>As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.</i>[1 Nephi 3:15]<br><br>His directive was followed by a series of reasons including the need to be faithful, the context of Jerusalem's wickedness and its imminent destruction, and the key role of the records for linguistic and spiritual continuity. His plea worked.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments ofGod.</i>[1Nephi 3:21]<br><br>In this case Nephi persuaded his brothers to do what they should have already understood was the right thing to do--to go and try again to get the plates. But just like us, they needed to be engaged in a conversation, to be reminded and persuaded. It is interesting to note that for some reason the brothers didn't have a hard time returning once more to Jerusalem to persuade Ishmael and his daughters to join them in the wilderness.<br><br>Later on we see how their attitude changed when they lost their commitment to their father's vision and escalated to violence against their little brother. At that point their choices were mitigated by an angel; but Nephi's efforts throughout illustrate the process of persuasion and show how dialogue played an important part in Nephi's relationship to his family and his commitment to truth.<br><h2><b>Learning and Persuasion</b></h2><br>Today we might associate persuasion with something different from Nephi's familial entreaties. Jay Conger, a professor of business at Claremont McKenna, addressed common misunderstandings about persuasion:<br><br><i>Persuasion is widely perceived as a skill reserved for selling products and closing deals. It is also commonly seen as just another form of manipulation--devious and to be avoided. Certainly, persuasion can be used in selling and deal-clinching situations, and it can be misused to manipulate people. But exercised constructively and to its full potential, persuasion supersedes sales and is quite the opposite of deception.</i>Effective persuasion becomes a negotiating and learning process through which a persuader leads colleagues to a problem's shared solution.<i>Persuasion does indeed involve moving people to a position they don't currently hold, but not by begging or cajoling. Instead, it involves careful preparation, the proper framing of arguments, the presentation of vivid supporting evidence, and the effort to find the correct emotional match with your audience.</i>[Jay A. Conger, "The Necessary Art of Persuasion,"<i>Harvard Business Review,</i>May–June 1998, 86; emphasis added]<br><br>Indeed, we know that persuasion is a theme that cuts across many different academic and professional fields. In an even larger sense, persuasion is at the core of the learning process because it changes the way we perceive and understand reality, influencing our attitudes and creating our vision of the world.<br><br>Learning involves active engagement in introducing, evaluating, and deciding what ideas have merit and what do not. As a proud graduate of this institution, I feel that one of my formative learning experiences occurred in honors courses where Dean Hal Miller took us into a world of new "conversations" where we could engage in a discussion with some of the greatest minds and on important topics in the world of ideas. We wrestled with Plato, plumbed the Bhagavad Gita, pondered St. Augustine, and wrote alongside Montaigne. Our job as students was to read, question, and determine what was persuasive and what was not. More often than not we missed the point; yet Dr. Miller carefully and patiently explained and answered questions as we stumbled along the path of learning.<br><br>As Latter-day Saints, our spiritual foundation influences all aspects of our learning, professions, and family life. Also, experiencing give-and-take and intellectual back-and-forth helps us to increase our understanding and ideally make better decisions, as Hugh Nibley explained in a talk given to Pi Sigma Alpha, the political science honor society:<br><br><i>A discussion with God is not a case of agreeing or disagreeing with Him--who is in a position to do that?--but of understanding Him. What Abraham and Ezra and Enoch asked was, "Why?" Socrates showed that teaching is a dialogue, a discussion. As long as the learner is in the dark he</i>should<i>protest and argue and question, for that is the best way to bring problems into focus, while the teacher patiently and cheerfully explains, delighted that his pupil has enough interest and understanding to raise questions--the more passionate, the more promising. There is a place for discussion and participation in the government of the kingdom.</i>["Beyond Politics,"<i>Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless,</i>2nd ed. (Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 2004), 306; emphasis in original]<br><br>But persuasion is merely a tool, and instruments can be used for differing moral purposes (see Moroni 7:17). Thus it seems essential that section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants places persuasion in close quarters with at least three qualities previously introduced: namely, meekness, long-suffering, and love. These virtues can modify and direct our persuasive efforts, especially as we interact in a world filled with conflict, strife, and disagreement. Let's consider each virtue separately as we try to understand how they relate to our efforts in persuasion.<br><h2><b>Long-Suffering</b></h2><br>Defined,<i>long-suffering</i>means "an enduring disposition" or "having endured mental or physical discomfort for a protracted period of time patiently or without complaint." It might seem a stretch to our modern world, but if we hope to persuade others, we must listen to their concerns and create a space for others to engage in conversation, just as Nephi did with his siblings.<br><br>Orson Scott Card, an LDS author and frequent columnist, recently observed the following:<br><br><i>Even within our country, some Latter-day Saints will strongly disagree with others about the actions of our government. Because I have written extensively on political matters, I have received many letters from Saints who disagree with me, asking, "How can you hold that opinion and still be a faithful Latter-day Saint?" (Of course, some of the letters are not so politely worded.)</i><br><br><i>I get such letters about equally from the left andthe right, and about almost every topic I've covered. . . .</i><br><br><i>But the point of freedom is that we should</i>not<i>assume that people who disagree with us are unworthy of full membership in our community, or that their voices should not be heard.</i><br><br><i>On the contrary, it is essential that all voices be heard in order to reach wise decisions that take into account the needs and judgments of all people.</i>[In the Village, "No Nation Is Devoid of Error," MormonTimes.com, 2 July 2009; emphasis in original]<br><br>Students are especially adept at and enjoy new opportunities in social media, in which an incredibly wide range of viewpoints, ideas, and arguments resides. On occasion I have watched with horror as my Facebook page became the staging ground for battles of opposing views mirroring many newspaper discussion boards, sports websites, blogs, and anywhere else that open (and especially anonymous) interaction is allowed. My students tell me that it's appropriate to delete or censor my online "friends," but I secretly hope that their inner angels will help these commenters regain a sense of decorum, if not a measure of kindness.<br><br>Henry David Thoreau wrote, "Thaw with his gentle persuasion is more powerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other but breaks in pieces" (<i>Walden</i>[1854], 17, Spring). And yet it seems that some of my "friends" would rather be Nordic superheroes than forces of nature. That's because the language and tone of many comments online preclude a conversation. Discussions can become less about respecting or enduring other views and more about making our point heard.<br><br>These discussion enders may be insensitive responses, but as part of communities--especially learning communities--they become deal breakers that replace dialogue with an awkward silence at best and "sharpness" at worst, usually without the "increase of love" we are advised to employ afterward (D&amp;amp;C 121:43). More important, they demonstrate a lack of long-suffering in our demeanor because we don't want to have to listen to something that doesn't fit our thinking. We recognize that not all ideas are equal or even correct--that is why we need to learn. But being long-suffering increases our chances of gaining understanding, and it keeps us connected to those in the discussion.<br><br>Clearly this is a very small part of being long-suffering, as many with greater trials can attest. But this important virtue may give us resolve to find ways to stay connected, to be patient, and to try and better understand others.<br><h2><b>Meekness</b></h2><br>Meekness is another virtue recommended to us, and, like the others, it is a subject matter unto itself. We know that personal growth occurs best when we submit to God's will, but as President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "Either we can choose to be humble or we can be compelled to be humble" ("Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 6). One way that we can immediately experience our limitations is through cross-cultural interactions on our smaller, more globalized world.<br><br>Cultural differences are rarely more apparent than when we experience another place firsthand. Last year our family traveled across Europe, and while contending with different food, language, and environments--mostly in large, urban cities--our eight-year-old son Jack concluded, "In Turkey they don't seem to understand our personal space or our family bubble." In fact, he and his younger brother were regularly pinched, patted, observed, and remarked upon, and he wasn't really prepared for all of that attention. Buses were crowded, unlike the one he's used to riding. City streets were filled with a myriad of smells, sights, and sounds that were unfamiliar and even frightening at times. Many things seemed so very different to us--from electric plugs to the experience of worshipping with sixty members of the Church in a city of 13 million people.<br><br>In these instances we can withdraw, retreat, or even become outright defensive. We can also fail to see what is happening before us. But when we approach these new cultural adventures with meekness and humility, we can begin to understand our limitations in new ways. In a letter to Edward Partridge and the Church, Joseph Smith wrote from Liberty Jail:<br><br><i>We ought always to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves, and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between them and their God.</i>[<i>HC</i>3:303–4]<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, nearly thirty years ago, addressed this topic here at Brigham Young University, noting:<br><br><i>In the ecology of the eternal attributes these cardinal characteristics are inextricably bound up together. Among them, meekness is often the initiator, the facilitator, and the consolidator.</i><br><br>He further explains the link to persuasion this way:<br><br><i>Since God desired to have us become like Himself, He first had to make us free, to learn, to choose, and to experience; hence our humility and teachability are premiere determinants of our progress and our happiness. Agency is essential to perfectibility, and meekness is essential to the wise use of agency--and to our recovery when we have misused our agency. . . .</i><br><br><i>In contrast, we see in ourselves, brothers and sisters, the unnecessary multiplication of words--not only a lack of clarity, but vanity. Our verbosity is often a cover for insincerity or uncertainty. Meekness, the subtraction of self, reduces the multiplication of words.</i><br><br><i>Without meekness, the conversational point we insist on making often takes the form of</i>I,<i>that spearlike, vertical pronoun. Meekness, however, is more than self-restraint; it is the presentation of self in a posture of</i>kindness<i>and</i>gentleness.<i>It reflects certitude, strength, serenity; it reflects a healthy self-esteem and a genuine self-control.</i>["Meekly Drenched in Destiny," BYU fireside address, 5September 1982; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>Finally, an über-virtue that guides our persuasion efforts is real love. This may well be the hardest part of a gospel approach, because it is so easy for us to become enamored with our own ideas, accomplishments, and interests. It's also quite difficult to love at close range when our family, friends, or colleagues don't appreciate our efforts. And it's even harder still when we face down our real or perceived enemies.<br><br>For over five years I attended a number of United Nations conferences in New York, Nairobi, Geneva, and elsewhere in which I was involved in lengthy negotiations with countries and groups that had opposing views on a number of policy issues. This competition of ideas--common to the sports arena, courtroom, and marketplace, or among the electorate--often led to zero-sum outcomes through long negotiation. Try as we might to break through and find common ground, discussions were difficult, and both sides were regularly frustrated. Some of these differences were structural, but I was struck by the degree to which our opposing sides displayed personal animosity and even open hostility.<br><br>We occasionally had hard-won victories at the expense of the other side. The lack of empathy was readily apparent, and in some ways understandable. Since then I have often thought about these experiences and what was to be learned.<br><br>Recently, someone who has been involved in these very issues was interviewed. In talking about how to address these types of intractable conflicts, she said that as a result of thinking about them over a long period of time, she recognized the need for and advocated a type of sportsmanship that seems to me to be an essential part of a Christian approach in such areas:<br><br><i>The need to approach others with enthusiasm for difference is absolutely critical to any change. You know . . . I'm the toughest of fighters. And you know I love a good fight. And I love to win. But I think what I have learned is that you have got to approach differences with this notion that there is good in the other. And that if we can't figure out how to do that and if there isn't the crack in the middle where there are some people on both sides who absolutely refuse to see the other as evil, this is going to continue.</i>["Listening Beyond Life and Choice," radio interview with Frances Kissling,<i>Being,</i>20 January 2011; Krista Tippett, host; http://being.publicradio.org/programs/2011/listening-beyond/transcript.shtml]<br><br>How do we meekly, patiently, and lovingly engage with others, especially when the stakes are the highest? For me this gospel ideal of love warrants our serious consideration. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf observed:<br><br><i>We must realize that all of God's children wear the same jersey. Our team is the brotherhood of man. This mortal life is our playing field. Our goal is to learn to love God and to extend that same love toward our fellowman. We are here to live according to His law and establish the kingdom of God. We are here to build, uplift, treat fairly, and encourage all of Heavenly Father's children.</i>["Pride and the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2010, 56]<br><br>There will always be times when we must take a stand for what is right. But I believe that we can try to do so in a loving and genuine manner, avoiding ad hominem and mean-spirited attacks. I recognize that possessing love unfeigned is extremely challenging, but Ihave seen examples throughout my life from my parents, wife, colleagues, and students that give me hope.<br><h2><b>Changing Minds and Hearts</b></h2><br>Recently, the filmmaker Sidney Lumet passed away. He was known for a remarkable film titled<i>12 Angry Men,</i>which portrays the compelling transformation of wide-ranging attitudes in a short period of time. In the film a young man of low social status has been accused of murdering his father. As the title suggests, twelve jurors are chosen to deliberate his fate, and they bring with them lifetimes of experience, pain, and perspective.<br><br>The entire 1957 film version takes place in one room and occurs in real time. Initially it appears to be an open-and-shut trial. But one lone juror--Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda-- quietly voices his dissenting opinion. He does so through the first part of the film by listening quietly, thoughtfully assessing each juror's view, and asking probing questions.<br><br>As the film progresses, it becomes clear that he is beginning to persuade other jurors, one by one, but the way in which he does it still surprises me. Through continued engagement with the other men--including the one last holdout juror--and a great deal of silence and discussion, Juror #8 eventually persuades all eleven to the "not guilty" conclusion.<br><br>Ultimately, it may be more important howwe are persuaded rather than how we persuade. For, while changing our mind is important in learning, the opening of our hearts is critical to our salvation. The scriptures teach that we may know truth and that we may be persuaded "to do good" and to "believe in Christ" through the power of the Spirit (Moroni 7:16; see Ether 4:11–12). Opening our hearts can lead to the greatest blessings.<br><br>In the hymn "That Easter Morn," we sing that Christ overcame "pain," He overcame "death," and He can help us overcome "fear" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 198). Perhaps it is fear that limits much of our ability to listen, learn, persuade--and be persuaded--by others and by the Holy Spirit of God.<br><br>I am grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ that gives us a restart in our frequent frailties and pray that we may be better able to enjoy the full range of discourse and discussion as Christians in the broader world around us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cory W.

<h1>adition - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm grateful for this invitation to speak at devotional today. Devotionals have always been a part of Brigham Young University campus life. They were first instituted by Karl G. Maeser and early on were offered on a daily basis. By the 1920s, devotionals were held three times a week. Although the number of devotionals per week has changed over the history of the university, their importance to the campus community has remained constant. Karl G. Maesar's term as president ended in the 1880s, so we know it has been at least that long that these devotionals have been a traditional part of our campus.<br><br>Some years ago I was in a meeting with former academic vice president John Tanner. We were discussing some matters when the devotional became part of the conversation. Vice President Tanner mentioned the importance of the BYU devotional as one of the few experiences on campus we do as a community--what a rich tradition and one that brings us together in body and spirit.<br><br>Traditions have the ability to bind us generationally. Most often we associate traditions with holidays and celebrations. But they can simply be the handing down of statements, beliefs, legends, customs, and information that moves from generation to generation. This can happen by word of mouth or by practice. Defining the word<i>tradition</i>varies by academic disciplines. I'm simply going to define it here broadly for discussion purposes. For my purpose it will encompass the idea of continued accepted norms, patterns, or customs.<br><br>My wife, Gwen, and I recently returned from New Zealand. She spent her teenage years growing up in Wellington. We accompanied other members of her family who were returning back home to New Zealand for the first time in over thirty years. Near the end of our trip, we were making our way from the Bay of Plenty area toward Auckland. En route we planned on attending church in the City of Tauranga. There was no particular reason for selecting this place other than it was halfway between our two destinations. While we were attending the Tauranga Ward, we met a Brother Tata, who invited us to follow him after church to a neighborhood within the city. We followed him to the gates of a Maori marae. A marae is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Maori culture. It doesn't have to be a building; it can be an open space. To the Maori, the marae is a place just as important to them as their homes.<br><br>Brother Tata invited us through the gates and into a courtyard. After a brief moment there, we walked over to the building, took off our shoes, and were invited in. We partook of a ceremony, much of which was spoken in Maori. He then explained to us that, as a young missionary and future apostle, Matthew Cowley began his mission at the location of this marae. He told us that David O. McKay had come to this marae when the New Zealand Temple was dedicated and had brought other General Authorities with him. Brother Tata explained that his ancestors had joined the Church in the 1880s and that he was a fifth-generation member of the Church. His grandchildren were seventh generation members of the Church.<br><br>I have a fascination with family history, and so I asked his distant cousin Brother Koryu, who was with him, if he knew of those ancestors who had joined the Church. He said, "I know them and can name them all." Impressed, I asked, "You can name seven generations of ancestors?" He said, "I can name twenty-seven generations of ancestors. Can't you?" Astonished, I responded, "You can name twenty-seven generations of ancestors?" He said, "Yes, I shared it with you in the ceremony, all the way back to when my ancestors came to New Zealand." After some more questions, I later learned that Maoris have a rich oral tradition in which they share their genealogy as part of ceremony and ritual.<br><br>And what a great and beneficial tradition! The cultural value of knowing their ancestors links directly with the gospel and the admonition of Malachi, "And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers."<sup>1</sup><br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott shared in a general conference, "Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished and followed to preserve your culture and heritage."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/05/removing-barriers-to-happiness.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a><br><br>One of my favorite plays and movies is<i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>It opens with the main character, Tevye, introducing the audience to his village, Anatevka, and to his way of life. He does this by singing a rousing song called "Tradition." Just before Tevye is about to go into song, he provides a background on life in his village. He says:<br><br><i>Because of our traditions, we've kept our balance for many, many years. Here in Anatevka we have traditions for everything--how to eat, how to sleep, how to wear clothes. For instance, we always keep our heads covered and always wear a little prayer shawl. This shows our constant devotion to God. You may ask, how did this tradition start? I'll tell you--I don't know! But it's a tradition.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Some traditions are beneficial. Some bind us to past generations and provide nostalgic notions for us. Some others are just plain whimsical or fun.<br><br>The Ohio State University has a tradition called the Mirror Lake Jump-in. Every year in late November, Buckeye fans gather at a large pond called Mirror Lake, just before the annual Michigan-Ohio State football game. The purpose of this activity is to jump in the frozen water to awaken the spirit of legendary Coach Woody Hayes so that the Ohio State Buckeyes can beat the Michigan Wolverines. This past year as the jump-time temperatures hovered in the mid-thirties, 6,000 Buckeye faithful gathered for the annual ritual. It is a popular event where you get that rare occasion of plunging into icy waters so your team can beat a rival. One student commented that the water was five times colder than you can imagine. Another student said it's not that bad once you get past the needles and your entire body going numb. Physicians might suggest that this reaction represents the early stages of hypothermia. My favorite part of this tradition is the advisories sent by the Ohio State University office of student life to inform participants of the value of having a "designated dry person" available to stand by to hold on to your valuables.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Some traditions are fun and whimsical and in unique ways work to unite people. Some, however, take us down unproductive paths and can even contribute to justifying sin. The Lamanites provide us with an example of generations of poor choices made because they followed the "traditions of their fathers." Because of their traditions the Lamanites long remained in a state of ignorance. They knew little of Christ and of His teachings. They developed a hatred of their brethren because of misconceptions handed from generation to generation. There were efforts to reclaim the Lamanites, and missionary work was carried out by the Nephites. These missionaries not only had to teach the Lamanites correct principles, they also had to convince them of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers--note again--the incorrectness of their traditions. King Benjamin punctuated this when he said:<br><br><i>We should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Cultural geographers study how traditional ways of life intersect modern society and how adaptations may be made. A simple example of this change is illustrated when suburban cities encroach or encompass traditional farms or small villages. Traditional modes of rural society are changed as agrarian life transitions to accommodate urban norms and new ways of life.<br><br>These adjustments and transitions also occur when individuals move into a new place or culture. We may find we have to make a change from our established way of doing things. This has happened to many of you who have served foreign missions, gone on a study abroad, or simply moved across the country to come and live in a new place--like Utah. A new place can cause us to reorient our thinking and to change our established way of doing things.<br><br>After I completed my doctoral studies in Ohio, we moved our family to the West Texas city of San Angelo. Neither my wife nor I had ever lived in Texas. This was a new place and a new adventure. It was mid-August when we pulled our moving van up in front of our new home. It had been vacant for a short time and the interior of the home was a mess. The lawn sprinklers had been turned off for some time, and it doesn't take long for a lawn to die in the West Texas afternoon sun. With help from members of our new ward, we were able to get into our home, and then I turned my attention to our lawn. It was toward the end of the day and dusk was setting in as I surveyed our new yard. I glanced over the shrubs and trees and then cast my eyes toward the pitiful looking lawn. As I looked down I saw something strange: there was this weed stretching across my lawn. I grabbed hold and started to pull it up, and it kept going. I pulled hard, and as it came up it was about four-feet long. As I pulled it up, another appeared, and I pulled that one up. I was building a tidy little pile of these weeds. I soon discovered they were all over the place. I pulled up two more, and my next-door neighbor, who was a retired Air Force officer with a slight Texas accent, said, "Son, why y'all pullin' up your grass?"<br><br>Now, have you ever had those moments when simply no answer will suffice for something you're doing? This was one of those moments. I stood there looking at these long strands and thinking, "Soooo, this is<i>grass</i>!" My previous conceptions of grass changed. My lifetime experience told me that grass consisted of straight green blades shooting up from the ground. My neighbor then told me about St.Augustine grass. By the time he got done, Irealized I had to change everything I thought I knew about lawns and lawn care and, for that matter, grass. I wouldn't be sodding my yard here, I would have to lay in plugs of this grass, and they would grow together. Watering would be different. Mowing was different. Care would be different. Excited with my new discovery, I ran inside. I called my wife and said, "Hey, check this out--this is grass! We were in a new place and we now had a new mode of doing things."<br><br>Well, next year BYU will be in a new place. Next year we enter a new phase at BYU as we take the national stage as an independent football team and move to a new conference for other sports. A major network is promising national coverage for football, and we will be competing in a conference that is home to other religious-based universities and colleges.<br><br>For many of us we have spent a lifetime cheering our teams and our athletes. At the same time, the notion of booing, jeering, heckling, or even yelling at our opponents and referees entered into the national psyche of being a fan. It may have even felt like it was justified behavior, because this behavior has been popularized in movies and reinforced in nationally televised sporting events.<br><br>In some college towns, fan behavior has become unruly. Myles Brand, former president of the NCAA, stated in a column:<br><br><i>There is something very wrong taking place in sports, including college sports. It isn't universal. It doesn't happen all the time. But it happens often enough to suggest that we--the fans--are losing our way. . . .</i><br><br><i>For a culture that holds dear the concepts of fair play, civility, honest effort--in short, sportsmanship--intercollegiate athletics at times sure has a strange way of showing its commitment to such values.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>My academic area deals with mass communications: journalism, public relations, and advertising. In its most basic form, mass communications is primarily concerned with the differential impact of messages transmitted by various mass media. One of the pioneering researchers in our field is George Gallup. He began as a campus newspaper editor at the University of Iowa in the 1920s, and after receiving his PhD he ventured into advertising research. He became a pioneer in survey sampling techniques, and his research methods became the foundation for the Gallup Poll.<sup>7</sup><br><br>One aspect of mass communication research is the study of public opinion, public perception, and media messages. Over the years basic research in the mass communications field has found a relationship between group behavior in the public sphere and public perception of that group. A recent Church press release on religious values found on LDS.org states, "Our public interaction reveals much about who we are as a people, what values we uphold, and what kind of society we want to live in."<sup>8</sup><br><br>I came across a sportsmanship statement from a school district in New Jersey. This statement advocated a new standard for their schools. It was one that suggested they should welcome opposing teams with banners and posters, applaud the opposing team at introductions, and not boo or heckle opposing teams or referees. This is truly an example of relearning fan participation at sporting events.<br><br>In a small way, I experienced this spirit of sportsmanship while attending a BYU basketball game. My son and I were attending a game in the Marriott Center in 2009. The crowd was sparse with Christmas less than a week away. The opponent was Eastern Washington University. Nothing our opponent shot went in. Every shot was off the backboard, around the rim, or in and out. Every once in a while I glanced at the scoreboard. I saw 9–0, then 21–0; in fact, our BYU basketball team went ahead 33–0. I was beginning to find myself conflicted. I was thrilled we were winning, and yet my heart sank for these poor athletes from Eastern Washington. I began privately pleading for them to make a shot. They were about 800 miles from home, it was just before Christmas, they were in an opposing arena, and the ball wouldn't drop through the hoop for them. Then suddenly they scored, and the Marriott Center erupted in spontaneous applause. I was never happier to be a Cougar as the fans began cheering Eastern Washington on. We didn't stop cheering our team, but we were also cheering for our struggling opponent.<br><br>Unfortunately, all too often, I have the opposite experience when attending sporting events or athletic competitions. Willard Hirschi, talking in a May 2000 devotional, said:<br><br><i>Do BYU fans lose something as a result of poor sportsmanship? Yes! As we embrace the behavior of the secular world, we lose our distinctiveness regarding the sacred. More important, we individually lose the companionship of the Holy Spirit.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/willard-m-hirschi_gold-fever-athletic-fervor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a><br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott said,<br><br><i>You may ask how can one determine when a tradition is in conflict with the teachings of the Lord and should be abandoned? That is not easily done. I have found how difficult it is as I work to overcome some of my own incorrect traditions. Yet recognizing the need to do it is a major step towards success. Customs and traditions become an inherent part of us. They are not easy to evaluate objectively. Carefully study the scriptures and counsel of the prophets to understand how the Lord wants you to live. Then evaluate each part of your life and make any adjustments needed.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/05/removing-barriers-to-happiness.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a><br><br>There is a new trend occurring in some colleges in America. There are football fans vying for the title of "friendliest fans." Booing is discouraged by some schools, visiting guests are invited to tailgating parties, and opposing fans are welcomed by the home team fans.<br><br>A 2008 book titled<i>Huskerville</i>chronicles the behavior of the football fan atmosphere at the University of Nebraska, which has a long-standing tradition of fan friendliness. Theauthor begins with the following:<br><br><i>I remember . . .</i>[when]<i>Florida State . . .</i>[got]<i>a chance to come up and play Nebraska and get on the map, and when they upset the Huskers early on, the people in the stadium gave them a standing ovation when they left the field. . . . As</i>[Florida State Head Coach]<i>Bobby Bowden jogged off the field, he saw something he'd never seen before: thousands of fans standing on their feet, clapping and saluting the victorious opponent.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>The book goes on to tell of a school who respects the efforts of opposing teams. One fan states it this way: "Being a Husker Fan, as [wel see, is about being a Nebraskan."<sup>12</sup>It says something about who they are. Huskervillers, as they like to call themselves, say it's based on a spirit of neighborliness.<br><br>In a 1998 regional conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley shared the following:<br><br><i>The Lord expects us to be Latter-day Saints. That isn't just an appendage phrase on the end of the name of the Church. It signifies something of tremendous importance. He expects us to show love of God by the way we conduct our lives. He expects us as those who have taken upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ to walk in His way, to do unto others as we would have them do unto us, to go the second mile. He expects us as His children to reach out to those around us, not only to members of the Church but to others. As sure and as certain as the sunrise in the morning, we Latter-day Saints and members of this great Church of the Lord should reach out in a spirit of neighborliness and helpfulness.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/04/excerpts-from-recent-addresses-of-president-gordon-b-hinckley.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>13</sup></a><br><br>In the spirit of neighborliness as cited in the aforementioned book, and in light of neighborliness as mentioned by President Hinckley, and as we understand the mission of this great institution, and as our athletic teams enter into a new place, shouldn't our fans be the friendliest anywhere? Wouldn't it be nice to have a new tradition in which opponents come into our stadiums, arenas, and centers and are welcomed with signs and placards? Wouldn't it be nice to respectfully applaud victorious opponents for their efforts as they walk off the field or the court? Wouldn't it be nice and wouldn't it help fulfill our campus mission if opponents and the national media proclaimed BYU as both the toughest and friendliest place to play a game. Now,<i>there</i>is a tradition worth celebrating.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, in a previous devotional talk, referenced the same<i>Fiddler onthe Roof</i>moment I did when he said:<br><br><i>When we come to BYU we come to take our position on the roof, with violin in hand, and we declare to the rest of the world, "Tradition."</i> Our <i>tradition. </i>BYU<i>tradition. And that doesn't just mean ringing the victory bell after a ball game or lighting the Y at Homecoming, as fun and rewarding as those lesser traditions are. Indeed, lighting the Y doesn't mean one thing, doesn't justify the electricity it takes to do it, if the meaning behind that mountaintop symbol, "the spirit of the Y," is not manifest in each of our lives.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_god-expects-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a><br><br>Now, I have provided an illustration of changing an old traditional way of fan participation at sporting events, and in essence I have suggested a new tradition. Elder Scott counseled that we all should take inventory of the traditions in our lives that would lead us away from feeling the Spirit and make the necessary adjustments to bring our lives in accord with the way our Savior, Jesus Christ, would have us live.<br><br>When I was young my parents were faced with changing the long-standing religious traditions of their families. My parents moved from rural Ohio to the city of Flint, Michigan, a new place. My father found a mechanic in the dealership where he worked who wasn't rude and didn't smoke, drink, or swear. He found him to be friendly and helpful, and he wondered why. This man told my father it was because of his church.<br><br>My life was forever changed by the gospel of Jesus Christ when my parents invited two young men to our home. I remember the day they drove up in their American Motors Rambler and walked up to our house. They sat on the couch and pulled out a large flannel board and proceeded to teach us the gospel. My brother and I sat on the floor and watched as the missionaries placed cutouts of people and other figures on the flannel board. We would watch these flannel-board cutout characters slowly curl down, and we snickered and laughed as they fell to the floor. My father had to nudge us with his foot to keep us quiet. I had no idea that that moment was the beginning of a change that would forever affect our beliefs, our way of life, and our previously held notions and traditions. Life changed for us. We began attending church a couple of days a week. New terminology entered into our life.<br><br>I went to something called Primary and attended classes called CTR, Targeteers, and Blazers. There were things called sacrament gems and two-and-a-half-minute talks. We went to progressive dinners, bazaars, and ice cream socials. There were road shows and gold and green balls. Some of these traditions of the Church have changed over time, but the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ remains a constant. My family had to rethink our priorities, rethink who we were, and change the way we did things. We made covenants with the Lord as we realigned our lives with this newfound gospel. My life was forever changed and set on a different trajectory, one other than where it could have headed.<br><br>As Elder Holland and Elder Scott suggest, let us all, both personally and collectively, look at our traditions and the established way we do things and make sure they are in line with how the Lord would have us live and, if necessary, establish new traditions. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ed Adams was associate dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communications at BYU when this devotional address was given on 10 May 2011.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>y Mind, O Man, Must Stretch&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am truly  grateful for this recognition. And thanks to all of you for your presence here today, especially to  my family to whom I owe so much. I'm glad my brother Jim could play the organ today. He and I were  roommates in Helaman Halls in 1968. With great talents, he is a brother I have always looked up to.  Also, itis fun to be able to address you here in the deJong Concert Hall. I remember ushering here  as a freshman in 1964. My wife, Jeannie, and I have many good memories of dates and events here in  this building. I'm so glad that she and I have been able to share such an abundant life  together.<br><br>Concerning this award, let me note that we are currently celebrating several 50th  jubilee anniversaries: of BYU Studies, of the BYU Honors Program, and of the Harold B. Lee Library.  This year is also the King James Version's 400th anniversary (its eighth jubilee) and Mormon's  1,600th birthday (his 32nd jubilee)--all of these representing huge parts of my life. So, I count it  as a special privilege to be added as the 50th recipient to the list of this award's previous  designees, who include many of my teachers, mentors, role models, and senior colleagues. In addition  to our family trees, we also have our intellectual genealogies, made up of people who have forged  the roots and filled out the branches of our minds, interests, ideals, and testimonies. How  fortunate we are for such influences in our lives.<br><br>What a challenge it has been to prepare  this talk! As this talk has developed and changed, it has also changed me. At times like this, words  simply fail. Preparing this talk has made me more grateful than ever for BYU. This university is a  beacon on a hill that cannot be hid. Its influence will go forth to bring to pass much goodness and  righteousness.<br><br>As I puzzled over what to say, I felt directed to reread the BYU Mission  Statement.<sup>1</sup>I have read this statement many times over the years, though probably not  often enough. I now see it as something like a patriarchal blessing for the university. As I looked  at it and at my 31 years on the faculty, I felt like the boy in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story of  the old man of the mountain<sup>2</sup>as it dawned on me how closely my experiences and desires  have come to track the contours of this mission statement. While that statement is not holy  scripture, I hope it's okay for a true-blue Cougar to bear testimony that the BYU Mission Statement  is good and true. Ibelieve it was inspired. It was drafted in 1981, in short order, at a quiet  mountain retreat, by the recently installed BYU president Jeffery R. Holland.<sup>3</sup>It was  tweaked only a little and then approved without hesitation by the Board of Trustees, led by  President Spencer W. Kimball. As an overriding take-home message for you from my remarks today, it  would be: "Follow this mission statement." You can find it on the BYU website. Take any line in it,  and it will bless your intellectual life with perspective and purpose.<br><br>My title, "Thy  Mind, O Man, Must Stretch," comes from the poignant letter dictated by Joseph Smith from the dungeon  of Liberty Jail (that so-called temple-prison that was more often prison than temple). The Prophet  revealed these words almost five months into his miserable and legally unjustifiable detention  there. After counseling the Church to avoid pride and trifling conversations, the Prophet burst  beyond the walls of his surroundings with these expansive words:<br><br><i>The things of God  are of deep import, and time and experience and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only  find them out. Thy mind, O Man</i>[and we may add O Woman as well],<i>if thou wilt lead a soul  unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost Heavens, and search into and contemplate the  lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand upon the broad considerations of eternal  expanse; he must commune with God. How much more dignified</i><i>and noble are the thoughts of God,  than the vain imaginations of the human heart, none but fools will trifle with the souls of  men.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Altogether, these expansive words reward deep reflection. Here  is a most compelling mandate for a broad BYU education and a lifetime of learning. Joseph's  prophetic words impel, to the<i>n</i>th degree, all who are not just scholars who happen to be  Mormons, but Mormons who happen to be scholars.<br><br>Being a part of Mormon scholarship at BYU  has been a perpetually rewarding, mind-expanding experience for me. There is nothing closed-minded  about being a true Latter-day Saint. With the Holy Ghost, you will never get a "disk full" warning.  Every year there have been new and amazing discoveries.<br><br>You might wonder: So, how does  this happen? How does one's mind expand to see or discover new things? In this acceptance speech  today, I thought it would be appropriate to try to explain how this has worked for me personally,  and, as I know, for many others as well. Actually, saying how any discovery happens is a pretty tall  order, because most discoveries are not planned or orchestrated. They often come as flashes of  inspiration or, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, "as . . . moved upon by the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C  68:3). But whenever they happen, especially when they involve seeing some new extension or  application of gospel truth, the moment is unmistakable, bringing an abiding sense of joy and  satisfaction.<br><br>Consider these lines from a<i>Peanuts</i>comic strip. Charlie Brown, Lucy,  and Linus are lying on a hillside looking up at the clouds. Lucy asks, "What do you think you see,  Linus?"<br><br>Linus says, "Well, those clouds up there look to me like the map of the British  Honduras on the Caribbean. That cloud up there looks a little like the profile of Thomas Eakins, the  famous painter and sculptor. And that group of clouds over there gives me the impression of the  stoning of Stephen. I can see the Apostle Paul standing there to one side."<br><br>Lucy says,  "That's very good," and asks Charlie Brown, "What do<i>you</i>see?"<br><br>He answers, "Well, I  was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie, but I changed my mind!"<br><br>What might help us to  see like Linus? The first thing is to be looking, purposefully and constructively, for something of  value. The mind expands by recognition, or re-cognizing. Seeing in one thing something that is  faintly reminiscent of something else that is higher, deeper, or of greater substance is the  beginning of knowing and not just observing. Connecting and seeing recurring patterns, such as those  with which the gospel is replete, is the beginning of discernment and the development of potentially  meaningful relationships.<br><br>For example, one day as my wife and I were visiting Chartres  Cathedral, we listened to a guide explain a stained-glass window that had 12 scenes depicting the  parable of the Good Samaritan on the bottom and 12 scenes telling the story of Adam and Eve on the  top.<sup>5</sup>This pairing, which struck me at first as very odd, turned out to spawn meaningful  connections at every point, not with just a single act of kindness but with the broad pattern of the  eternal plan of salvation. In this context the man who goes down from Jerusalem, a holy place, and  falls among robbers, represents the Fall of Adam and Eve and of all mankind, as we all have come  down from our heavenly home and have fallen among the forces of evil. The Good Samaritan, who saves  the injured man, represents the Savior, who comes, has compassion, and alone is able to save all who  have been left half dead, having suffered the first but not yet the second death. He anoints with  oil, washes wounds with his wine, binds us, and promises to return a second time. But the initial  burst of connective insight is just the beginning of the discovery process. Extensive reading,  pondering, and lots of work soon yielded further insights and even found that this understanding of  the gospel of Jesus Christ was evidenced in this long-lost line of allegorical Christian  interpretation stretching back at least as far as the second century  A.D.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Indeed, most discoveries require lots of hard work. As a tax lawyer in  Los Angeles, Irepeatedly saw the value of the Mormon commitment to hard work. In one case, I  represented movie star Burt Reynolds. A tax issue over whether he was a California or a Florida  resident had arisen, and his case hung in the balance. People had been over the documents many  times. A couple days before our hearing in Sacramento, I decided to double-check everything. I even  went back over Burt's appointment books to see if any detail might have been missed. And there it  was: every year Burt was always in Florida on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Well, I walked into  the hearing humming "I'll Be Home for Christmas." The legal issue of residency, after all, is all  about where home is. I introduced this new fact into the record, and the state asked for a recess.  When they returned, they dropped the case. The point of this little story is simply that I was glad  to have gone the extra mile.<br><br>Indeed, most academic discoveries come after poring over  materials again and again. The mind expands by hard work over sustained stretches. Thus, the first  paragraph of the BYU Mission Statement emphasizes that a BYU education demands "a period of  intensive learning" with a high "commitment to excellence." Our BYU way of doing things  enthusiastically embraces work. There are no shortcuts to good scholarship. Brilliant ideas remain  mere figments until they are verbalized, embodied in images, and brought to life. In Joseph Smith's  words, this takes "time and experience and careful and ponderous . . . thoughts."<sup>7</sup>We  learn best by strenuous effort. I remember vividly my student days at BYU, at Oxford, and at Duke,  because those experiences were so intense; they indelibly seared words and ideas upon my mind. Think  of how much you have learned in accelerated courses, in the compressed MTC experience, during  intense travel abroad, or by competing under pressure-packed circumstances. A Mormon motto is "We do  hard things." Do not shy away from hard work, from long course assignments, or from demanding  challenges, for work precedes the aha moment.<br><br>But hard work alone is also not enough. It  is possible to exert endless energy spinning one's wheels. To expand our understanding, we must  formulate more precise, potentially answerable questions and then keep searching, believing that an  answer is out there somewhere, giving the scriptures credence, suspending judgment, giving God the  benefit of the doubt, praying every day for His guidance, trusting that He knows the answer, that it  can somehow make sense, and not presuming that the answer must necessarily come out your way. What  we are looking for is frequently going to be found outside of the box. Sometimes the answer is "none  of the above" or "all of the above."<br><br>Under its second bullet point, the BYU Mission  Statement speaks of "the pursuit" of truth. It doesn't speak of "inventing" or "voting on" truth,  but rather of "pursuing" truth. We expand our knowledge by looking for things, pursuing things that  exist beyond our current understanding. How can one logically pursue something that one assumes does  not exist? As former BYU academic vice president Robert K. Thomas said, "Skeptics--by  definition--cannot affirm anything, even their own skepticism."<sup>8</sup>Thus, discoveries that  have given me the greatest satisfaction have begun by assuming the correctness of a text, the  truthfulness of a proposition, or the wisdom of an instruction given by one in  authority.<br><br>In a recent e-mail, Terry Warner, one of my philosophy mentors and the creator  of the<i>Education in Zion</i>exhibit here on campus, spoke of what he sees as the astonishing  momentum that has been developed in Mormon studies by many first-rate scholars here at BYU. He  said:<br><br><i>I have wondered whether the first dislodged stone, in what is becoming  almost an avalanche of scholarship, was not Nibley's gutsy determination to see what could be made  of the available historical evidence by assuming (at least the possibility of) the truth of LDS  claims, rather than by assuming their falsehood. . . . It was Leibniz who insisted that one cannot  adequately understand the meaning of a proposition without assuming its  truth.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Of course, the scientific method rightly propounds a  hypothesis and then tries to invalidate it; but still the hypothesis is not considered false  <i>before</i>it has been found to have failed. There is something wrong--as much in academic halls  as in courtrooms--about assuming something or someone to be guilty until proven  innocent.<br><br>As an example, when I began teaching a course on ancient laws in the Book of  Mormon, I ran across the case of Seantum, the man who secretly stabbed his brother seated on the  judgment seat and was detected by Nephi's prophecy in Helaman 8–9. Since there were no witnesses,  how could Seantum be executed under the law of Moses, which required two or three witnesses in order  to convict? Rather than sadly conceding that there must be an embarrassing blunder here, I continued  studying more about ancient Hebrew law, only to learn quite unexpectedly at a Jewish law conference  that an ancient exception to the two-witness rule, which was traced in rabbinic law as far back as  Joshua 7, allowed that the two-witness rule could be satisfied if the culprit confessed voluntarily  outside of court or if God's hand was involved in the detection of the offender and if corroborating  physical evidence (such as blood on the skirts of his cloak) was found. As it turns out, the Book of  Mormon goes out of its way to report these very points. The case against Seantum is not an  embarrassment but remarkably sound.<sup>10</sup><br><br>When we come up against things that seem  out of sorts or nonsensical, our critical instincts lure us into thinking that there must be  something wrong. But a special joy attaches to the discovery of a new insight that began with the  thought that something was wrong but turned out to be right. It's the joy of finally seeing an odd  little puzzle piece snap into place in the bigger picture. It's the joy that comes from the great  gospel principle of reversal: that by small things come great purposes; that the Lord's ways are not  always the world's ways (see Isaiah 55:8); that the poor are rich; and that those who lose their  lives for Christ's sake will be the ones who will ultimately find eternal joy (see Matthew  10:39).<br><br>So, I go on high alert when I notice interesting anomalies, which are often clues  of something going on below the surface. Truth will be found in odd places, as high and low and  broad as the eternal expanse, as Joseph said. Moses' mind was certainly stretched by the amazing  things he saw in unexpected places, which things he had never supposed (see Moses 1:10). No one was  more surprised by what Joseph Smith was told in his First Vision than was he himself. It was not at  all what he was expecting.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Recently, reading on a plane to Portland, Oregon,  I noticed something unexpected in the hardly ever mentioned parable of the two sons in Matthew 21.  After Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the chief priests approached Him in the temple and  demanded: "By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?" (Matthew  21:23). Jesus answered by telling a story about a certain man who had two sons. When asked to go  down and work in the vineyard, the first son initially refused, but then he went, while the other  initially said yes but then does not go, or so it seems (see Matthew 21:28–30). This parable may be  useful in parenting, and it can be read at that level; but remember, that's not what Jesus was asked  about. With the question of authority in mind, as I read this parable in the Greek, something jumped  off the page at me. Think about it: When did a certain father have two sons, One who went and the  other who did not? When did the First (the Firstborn) say, "<i>Ou thelo</i>," which in Greek means  "I will it not," or "I'd rather not," or "it is not my<i>will</i>." As the Greek continues, that  Son reconciled Himself (not repented Himself) and went. In contrast, the "other" (the  <i>heteros</i>) son simply said, "<i>Ego</i>," meaning "I." But I<i>what</i>? Readers must fill in  this blank. In this verse, the word<i>go</i>in the King James Version is italicized, because it  has only been implied there. One might as well supply other words: "I . . . will have it my way," or  "I . . . will get the glory." In any event, this egotistic son did not go. As Latter-day Saints, we  can easily but unexpectedly see at this deeper level how this unassuming little parable answers the  all-important questions about Jesus' authority. He received it from the Father in the Council in  Heaven when He was commissioned to go down and do, not His will, but the will of the  Father.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Believing that God has revealed and yet will reveal many great and  important things commits us to approach some things differently from the rest of the world, and for  me that's okay. There will always be worldly things that will make it difficult to be a Latter-day  Saint by making some Mormon beliefs objectionable, frustrating, or awkward. And we won't always have  all the answers to these difficulties, certainly not the moment they first arise. But this too  invites further stretching and expansion. Our ongoing task as Latter-day Saints is to locate  defensible answers that are also consistent with our scriptures, doctrines, and assumptions and to  understand how opposing views often depend principally upon other fundamentally different  assumptions.<br><br>For example, the Mormon point of view sees work differently from the world,  because we know that God Himself has a work, and it is His glory; and we affirm, by our actions,  that faith without works is dead (see Moses 1:39; James 2:26).<br><br>We also see ethics quite  differently because, for us, humans are not disconnected creatures with whom we selectively enter  into social contracts, but all are related to us, as members of our premortal family.<a href="http://lds.org/family/proclamation?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>13</sup></a> That expansive factor transforms the foundations of ethics and the meaning of  ethnicity.<br><br>We see moral agency differently. As President Hinckley taught, false freedom is  freedom to do what one likes; true freedom is freedom to do what one  ought.<sup>14</sup><br><br>We see history differently. The reality of the Apostasy shows that the  fittest don't always survive.<br><br>We see power differently, because we take seriously the  scriptural curse placed on anyone who misuses power for glory or gain, and we know that the greatest  must be the servants of all (D&amp;amp;C 121:36–39; Matt. 23:11). Because of this, we do not share the  common animus against hierarchy and authority.<br><br>We see issues of gender equality  differently. The secular world would collapse equality into sameness. But equality does not mean  identity.<sup>15</sup>Four plus four and two plus six are different, but both are equal to  eight.<br><br>At BYU we have the constant opportunity to bring many Mormon insights to bear on  scholarly topics and just as much to bring scholarly perspectives to bear on topics of importance to  Latter-day Saints. If we think there isn't a Mormon point of view on any subject, it may well be  that we haven't yet looked high or deep or wide enough.<br><br>With stretching the mind comes an  openness to embrace more. The BYU Mission Statement speaks of the pursuit of<i>all</i>truth. Our  desire is for further light and understanding, to circumscribe all truth. To me, Mormonism thrives  because it welcomes the idea that the world is fundamentally pluralistic by nature. Over and over,  the Mormon worldview relishes multiplicity. Words found traditionally only in the singular are  boldly spoken of as plurals in Mormon doctrine: we speak of priesthoods, intelligences, noble and  great ones, two creations, worlds without number, continuing revelations, scriptures, covenants,  degrees of glory, eternal lives, saviors on Mt. Zion, and even gods. Joseph Smith spoke of there  being many kingdoms and that "unto every kingdom is given [its own] law," and "all truth is  independent in that sphere in which God has placed it" (D&amp;amp;C 88:38, 93:30). To me, such  statements of cosmological relativities unleash and transfigure the concepts of natural law and  eternal truths.<sup>16</sup><br><br>It took a century for the world to even begin to catch up  with this expansive notion revealed by Joseph Smith. For example, I am fascinated by the  implications of Gödel's 1931 incompleteness theorem, which demonstrates that a system can be either  complete or consistent, but not both.<sup>17</sup>Thus, systematic theologies or rational  philosophies may well be internally consistent, but they do so at the expense of completeness. Sets  and abstractions may be helpful, but they are simply extractions of selected elements of otherwise  messy realities. Mormon thought, in contrast, privileges fullness, abundance, completeness, and all  that the Father has, even if that means that Mormon life becomes joyously overloaded or torn by  competing pressures that pull, stretch, and expand us in many ways. This may produce episodes of  cognitive dissonance, social quandaries, mystery, and uncertainty, but if forced to choose, Mormon  thought will always prefer openness over closedness, boldly inviting further growth, progression,  and--fortunately for us in academia--further questions.<br><br>This dynamic view has certainly  influenced my legal thinking. Over the years I have taught classes about corporations, partnerships,  and other organizations that are all managed by various kinds of officers, trustees, and  administrators. The law holds these people to standards called fiduciary duties. Despite thousands  of cases, the law hasn't addressed the question of what makes one fiduciary duty high and another  low. But in our complex world, one size does not fit all. Thinking more expansively, Professor Brett  Scharffs and I have identified a set of factors that reveal whether a fiduciary duty is high,  medium, or low and what degree of duty is required of fiduciaries in all kinds of  settings.<sup>18</sup>Thinking this way may seem obvious enough to you as a Latter-day Saint, since  you already believe that there will be varying degrees of treatment and glory for every person  according to their individual deeds and circumstances. But recent events in the corporate world show  how much in need we are of a more robust legal approach to the duties owed by people in positions of  greatest trust.<br><br>Concerning duties, let me mention one other part of this subject that has  occupied much of my thought in the last decade.<sup>19</sup>Because we know that there must be an  opposition in all things, LDS thought often harmonizes traditional paradoxes. The world has fought  wars over whether we are saved by faith or by works. We peacefully say, "Both." People argue over  whether we come to know by study or by faith. We confidently say, "Both." "Each of us must  accommodate the mixture of reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but  <i>requires</i>it," President Boyd K. Packer has said.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_say-unto-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a>In the same way, Mormon thought  brings together both rights and duties. Rights and duties go hand in glove with each other, for with  all rights come duties. I think this is because with all rights come powers and privileges, and with  powers and privileges come duties. As Latter-day Saints, again, we intuitively sense this, for we  know that all who have been warned have the duty to warn their neighbors (D&amp;amp;C 88:81), that with  greater knowledge comes greater stewardship and accountability, and that "Because I have been given  much, I too must give."<sup>21</sup><br><br>But this is decidedly not the way people usually  think about rights. The world usually thinks that, because I have a right, someone else has a duty,  namely to protect or fulfill my right. While that is true enough, at the same time, if I claim a  right, power, or privilege, I also acquire a duty as its necessary flip  side.<sup>22</sup><br><br>I have no doubt that the 20th century will go down in history as the  century of rights: voting rights, workers' rights, civil rights, human rights, privacy rights,  disability rights, and many more. With these rights in place, I can only hope that the 21st century  will someday go down in history as the century of duties: civic duties, human duties, fiduciary  duties, religious duties, environmental duties, and duties to future generations. I yearn for the  day when we will have a Bill of Duties to go with our Bill of Rights. As world resources become  scarcer, and as all nations, tongues, and peoples become more vulnerably interdependent, the idea of  individual rights will necessarily change. How many rights can the world support without all people  assuming commensurate duties? The point is not to take rights away but to recognize the duties that  are inherent in those very privileges.<br><br>Speaking of privileges, we in the academic world  are certainly among the most privileged. We enjoy the extraordinary blessings of time to read,  think, write, listen, and talk about things we love. With those blessings, one would have thought,  would also come a great awareness of our responsibilities. As Joseph said, "None but fools will  trifle with the souls of [others]."<sup>23</sup>Yet, as Stanford President Donald Kennedy wrote in  1997, "The responsibility of the professoriate is a difficult subject about which surprisingly  little has been said,"<sup>24</sup>and that serious defect still remains inexcusably  unaddressed.<br><br>I am pleased that we at BYU Studies have adopted a code of academic  duties.<sup>25</sup>This multidisciplinary LDS quarterly journal is open to all authors and  readers. Its code draws on scriptural mandates, hoping to encourage among LDS scholars such things  as unity ("if ye are not one ye are not mine" [D&amp;amp;C 38:27]); charity (for if we have not charity,  we are nothing [see 1 Corinthians 13:2]); edification (the goal is to be spiritually and  intellectually upbuilding); and honesty and integrity (for accuracy and reliability are the essence  of scholarship). And, by the way, it's all right, like Charlie Brown, to see a ducky and a horsie,  if that's what you honestly see.<br><br>As President Monson has often said, duty basically means  charitably putting other people ahead of one's own self-interests.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/do-your-duty-that-is-best?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>26</sup></a>Our minds stretch  the farthest when they are pure and actively concerned about the welfare of others. Unselfishness is  what allows the mind to stretch without snapping. Thus, for good reason, the BYU Mission Statement  again stretches us to know as much as possible, not only about our own culture but also about the  cultures of others. It is rightly said that he who knows only one culture knows no  culture.<br><br>I like the way George Handley, an associate editor of BYU Studies, sees this. He  writes, "My discovery [has been] that listening carefully to other voices and other cultures doesn't  have to involve sacrificing our values," but rather helps me to understand better my own  "Mormonness."<sup>27</sup><br><br>As Brigham Young charged the elders going out into the world,  he said: "Whether a truth be found with professed infidels, . . . or the Church of Rome, . . . it is  the [duty] of the Elders of this Church . . . to gather up all the truths in the world pertaining to  life and salvation, to the Gospel we preach, to mechanism of every kind, to the sciences, and to  philosophy, wherever it may be found . . . and bring it to Zion."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Indeed, it  was from a Catholic Jesuit that I first learned about chiasmus<sup>29</sup>and from a Jewish  barrister that I learned about the ancient legal difference between thieves and  robbers.<sup>30</sup>And, by the way, both of those scholars were genuinely glad to see in the Book  of Mormon these things that they had found in Hebraic settings.<br><br>As Latter-day Saints we  certainly understand the benefits of learning from others and reaching out to collaborate with  others. Our experiences in councils and presidencies instill in us a sociality that easily carries  over into our way of doing scholarship. Identify a project, assemble the right team, and see what  you can accomplish. Team victories magnify the thrill. Among the best memories of my academic life  are many team efforts, such as Macmillan's<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>with Dan Ludlow's team  of eight hundred contributors.<sup>31</sup>I am now thrilled to be working on the legal team of the  vital Joseph Smith Papers Project.<sup>32</sup>We now know that Joseph was distracted by over 200  lawsuits in his lifetime, and their documentary records are astonishingly more complex than any one  person can sort out. Two or three lawsuits are usually enough to overwhelm most men, but Joseph  succeeded by working collaboratively and expansively with numerous associates, including the Holy  Ghost as his regular companion.<br><br>Well, our time is nearly gone, and we've only scratched  the surface of the BYU Mission Statement. I intend no disregard of any word in it. Equally important  to me are its dozens of other vital elements, upon which we could equally expand: assisting  individuals in realizing their full human potential; staging a variety of extracurricular  experiences; preparing people to meet personal and family challenges; competing with the best in  each field; making scholarly resources available to the Church when asked; loving God  devoutly;<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/posts/never-good-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>33</sup></a>following the living prophets, and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to  all--in other words, no child of God left behind. If nothing else, I hope my comments today have  opened up some intriguing possibilities for you to think about.<br><br>In the end the BYU Mission  Statement calls on us to "have a strong effect on the course of higher education" and to "be an  influence in a world we wish to improve." In this, our uniqueness can be an asset. As mediators  between competing views, we can offer alternative solutions. And we need not be reluctant. We have  all been electrified this season by Jimmer Fredette's incredible, dramatic long shots. The sign I  liked the best was "Jimmer's in range when he steps off the bus." Mormon thought is also capable of  hitting a stunning array of intellectual long shots, doing things that traditional Western thinkers  have said cannot be done. Everywhere you turn, Joseph's words hit the mark. He was in range every  time he opened his mouth.<br><br>In a book now at press with Oxford, Stephen Webb, a non-LDS  professor of religion, writes of Mormonism: "No other religious movement lies so close to  traditional Christianity. . . . Mormon theology is Christology unbound. . . . Of all the branches of  Christianity, Mormonism is the most imaginative, and if nothing else, its intellectual audacity  should make it the most exciting conversational partner for traditional Christians for the  twenty-first century."<sup>34</sup><br><br>I know that we can accomplish the goals of the BYU  Mission Statement. Like many other Latter-day Saints, I have spoken to various academic groups, with  their respect and genuine interest. After one paper I gave to a meeting of the Jewish Law  Association in Boston,<sup>35</sup>an older rabbi congratulated me and said, "Very, very good, but  why does a<i>goyyim</i>[a Gentile] have to show us these things in our own Torah!" After a paper I  presented on ritual theory and temple themes in the Sermon on the Mount,<sup>36</sup>of all the  comments I received, I was most gratified by this one: "I have been attending these conferences for  30 years. You, for the first time, brought the Spirit into the room." Latter-day Saints can indeed  be an influence in a world we wish to improve.<br><br>So, let us rejoice! Shall we not, each in  our own way, go on in so great a cause? The point is to come to think more as God thinks and to see  His children and this creation more as He does. The more we become like that, the more the stone  face on the mountain of the Lord, that stone that some builders have refused, can become the head of  the corner and that image can be received in our countenances.<br><br>We need not be ashamed of  the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was truly a prophet. The scriptures are true and  in them we find our way. The expansiveness of the truth invites us to venture forward, as high and  as deep and as broad as our minds may go. Thy mind, O man, must stretch. Indeed, it can and will  stretch, if you will lead a soul (including your own) unto salvation and will commune with God, that  our joy may be full and abundant, in time and all eternity. For your thoughtful attention and  goodness, I thank you very, very much.<br><br><i>John W. Welch was a professor of law at J.  Reuben Clark Law School when he presented the 2010 Karl G.

That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning  in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of  human potential is pursued.<br><br>All instruction, programs, and services atBYU, including a wide  variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced  development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of  meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home  and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.<br><br>To succeed in  this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained  by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God. In that  environment these four major educational goals should prevail:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br> 	<li>All  students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is  inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can  be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and  a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Because the  gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university  education. The arts, letters, and sciences provide the core of such an education, which will help  students think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural  tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual  integrity.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>In addition to a strong general education, students should also  receive instruction in the special fields of their choice. The university cannot provide programs in  all possible areas of professional or vocational work, but in those it does provide the preparation  must be excellent. Students who graduate from BYU should be capable of competing with the best in  their fields.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty  and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and  will be encouraged.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>In meeting these objectives BYU's faculty, staff,  students, and administrators should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide. In an era of  limited enrollments, BYU can continue to expand its influence both by encouraging programs that are  central to the Church's purposes and by making its resources available to the Church when called  upon to do so.<br><br>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a  strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's  influence in a world we wish to improve.<br><br><i>--Approved by the BYU Board of  TrusteesNovember 4, 1981</i><br><h2><b>Appendix B</b></h2><br>BYU Studies Author Guidelines: Article  Submissions<br><br><i>BYU Studies</i>strives to explore scholarly perspectives on LDS topics.  Contributions from all fields of learning are invited.<i>BYU Studies</i>strives to publish  articles that openly reflect a Latter-day Saint point of view and are obviously relevant to subjects  of general interest to Latter-day Saints, while conforming to high scholarly standards.<i>BYU  Studies</i>seeks articles that document or analyze, in a scholarly manner, topics related to LDS  history, culture, society, art, language, literature, science, thought, or experience.

All who venture to write for<i>BYU Studies</i>should morally confront certain  responsibilities that may be said to comprise a sort of academic code of professional conduct. Some  important components of such a code would embrace at least the following  precepts.<br><br><b>Unity.</b>The Lord has clearly stated: "If ye are not one ye are not mine"  (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). In a shifting world that necessarily and fortunately features diversity,  individuality, heterodoxy, and change, the goal of unity with God and our fellow beings must be  continually cultivated and nourished. The goal of unity does not imply that all scholarly methods or  personal views must be the same.<br><br><b>Harmony.</b><i>BYU Studies</i>is committed to  seeking truth "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). It proceeds on the premise that faith  and reason, revelation and scholarly learning, obedience and creativity are compatible. Traditional  dichotomies such as mind and body, God and man, spirit and matter, time and eternity, are not viewed  in the gospel of Jesus Christ as competing opposites. The objective is to embrace both: ancient and  modern, word and deed, intellectual and spiritual, research and teaching, reason and revelation, the  "ought" and the "is," community and individuality, male and female, nature and custom, induction and  deduction, analysis and synthesis, rights and duties, subjectivity and objectivity, theory and  practice, even mortality and godhood. We can grow beyond issues over which is greater, the spirit or  the intellect. As Elder Boyd K. Packer has stated, "Each of us must accommodate the mixture of  reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but<i>requires</i> it."<br><br><b>Honesty.</b>As a primary trait of character, "we believe in being honest"  (Articles of Faith 1:13). Accuracy and reliability are of the essence of scholarship. All scholars  worth their salt have wrestled long with the questions of what can and cannot, what should and  should not, what must or must not be said. They acknowledge and evaluate data both for and against  their ideas and theories. They eschew all forms of plagiarism and generously recognize their  indebtedness to other scholars. They guard on all sides against the covert influences of unstated  assumptions, bias, and esoteric terminology. They avoid material omissions, for often what is not  said can be as misleading as what is said.<br><br><b>Thoroughness.</b>"If there is anything  virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things" (Articles of Faith  1:13).<i>BYU Studies</i>welcomes contributions from all disciplines,  addressing<br><br><i>all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for  you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth;  things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are  at home, things which are abroad,...</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when  I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C  88:78–80]<br><br><b>Humility.</b>Pride has been identified as the pervading sin of our  day. As scholars we have more than our share of exposure to this problem. Arrogance, disdain,  overconfidence, dogmatism, and many other manifestations of intellectual and spiritual pride may  well be the main occupational hazards of academia. But the perspectives of scholarship and the  gospel can also provide the antidote. First is the acknowledgement that all people are at different  stages in the eternal journey toward the glory of God, which is intelligence. Second is the humble  awareness that scholarship is not an end in itself. Research cannot create faith; it can only set  the stage for greater light and knowledge.<br><br><b>Charity.</b>In order for communication to  occur, there must be charity, for no statement exists (including this one) that cannot be  misconstrued. If fellowship and goodwill do not exist, especially in an academic setting, we will  not communicate with one another. Paul's confession comes to mind: "Though I have the gift of  prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge . . . and have not charity, I am nothing"  (1 Corinthians 13:2). Charity is also necessary to avoid offending even the weakest of the Saints.  Jesus said:<br><br><i>It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through  whom they come!</i><br><br><i>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his  neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</i>[Luke  17:1–2]

<h1>the Lord&#039;s Hand in All Things - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,<br><br><i>On the 19th of June, ... I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The group travelled about 870 miles--500 of it on foot. I'm not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I don't believe I've ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.<br><br>This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.<br><br>The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:<br><br><i>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lord's hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.<br><br>We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries--our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease--we sometimes forget to confess the Lord's hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,<br><br><i>I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimball's statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Let's take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.<br><br>From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the printing press, but other than a few innovations such as these, people living in 1805 really didn't live all that differently from those who lived thousands of years before them.<br><br>During Joseph Smith's time, there were no cell phones and, in fact, no phones at all. During his lifetime modern matches would be invented, as would the typewriter, the sewing machine, the telegraph, and, later in his life, the bicycle.<sup>4</sup>Travel was mainly done on foot, horse, carriage, or boat. Music was played by live bands. There were no electronic computers, but Charles Babbage did invent a mechanical calculator during this time frame. Medicine was still very primitive. The stethoscope was invented a few years after Joseph's birth, and vaccines wouldn't become available for another forty years or so.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Now skip forward a few years. My grandfather Archibald Egbert was born in West Jordan, Utah, in 1889--about forty-five years after the death of the Prophet Joseph. There were still no cell phones, but Alexander Graham Bell had invented the standard telephone just thirteen years prior to my grandfather's birth. Music was still mainly played by live bands, but the phonograph had been invented and was gaining popularity. There were no computers, but about the time of my grandfather's birth, Herman Hollerith created the "tabulating machine," which read punched cards to process data. This machine was used in the 1890 census and was a huge success. The lightbulb had just been invented, and X-rays had recently been discovered. The first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine hit the road just four years prior to my grandfather's birth. Humans wouldn't set foot on the North Pole until twenty years later.<br><br>Now move forward to my father's birth. My father was born forty-seven years after Archibald was born. There were still no cell phones, but rather than having to crank the telephone box, telephones were now enclosed in their own case, with a rotary dial and headset connected to the main body of the phone.<sup>6</sup>Music was played on a radio or on 78 rpm records. Mechanical calculators had been invented that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The world's first electronic digital computer, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, was developed shortly after my father was born.<sup>7</sup>Penicillin had been developed, as well as vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever.<sup>8</sup>Automobiles were now commonplace, and airplane travel was gaining in popularity. The Ford Model A went into production a few years prior to my father's birth, and eventually four million Model As were produced. The ballpoint pen had been invented, but cake mixes wouldn't become available for several more years.<br><br>By the time I was born--and contrary to my kids' belief, it wasn't that long ago--there were still no cell phones, but touch-tone telephones had been developed; you no longer had to use the rotary dial and listen to the click-click-click-click. Music was played on records or eight-track tapes. Transistors had replaced vacuum tubes, the integrated circuit had been developed, and computers were getting a lot of attention. The IBM 360 was introduced about this time. It weighed 2,000 pounds, cost $4 million in 2011 dollars, and could store about 2,500 bytes of data. The notion of a personal computer was still science fiction. Automobile technology had advanced some, airplane travel was commonplace, and we were about to experience the first man setting foot on the moon. Pacemakers had been invented, the structure of DNA had been discovered, and vaccines for typhus, influenza, and polio had been developed. We were also introduced to McDonalds, the Barbie doll, and the hula hoop.<br><br>My oldest son was born in 1984. Cell phones had finally been invented. However, nobody had them. It was hard to fit them in your pocket, there were no cute covers for them, and the selection of available ring tones was abysmal. Music was played on cassette tapes or on newly invented CDs. The IBM PC had just been developed. The low-end version contained sixteen Kbytes of RAM, and storage was provided via 180-Kbyte floppy disks. At this point computers started taking over our normal lives, being used in automobiles, dishwashers, hotel room door locks, and most other electronic devices. Artificial hearts had been developed and used, and vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, and pneumonia had been developed.<sup>9</sup><br><br>My oldest son had his first son just a couple of months ago. By that time smartphones were taking over the world, and our phones had become our calendars, navigation devices, e-mail readers, calculators, web browsers, texting mechanisms, and Angry Birds devices. Music was played on iPods, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, and any other device that you could put the letter<i>i</i>in front of, and they were all around us. The human genome had been mapped. Arthroscopic, laparoscopic, and robotic surgeries had dramatically improved the manner in which surgical procedures were performed, and 3D ultrasound, CT, and MRI devices allowed doctors to get a good view of the interior of the body prior to surgery. Automobiles were everywhere, and computers were ubiquitous, with about one billion personal computers in use as of the first part of 2011.<sup>10</sup>Today you can buy a laptop computer that contains thirty-two Gbytes of RAM, comes with a quadcore i7 processor, and has a 750-Gbyte hard drive, and you can buy a two-Tbyte external drive for about $100. I apologize for the computerese here, but this is exciting stuff! Let me give some comparisons to try to help elucidate this idea.<br><br>From the time my son was born until now, aperiod of about twenty-seven years, personal computer processing ability has improved dramatically. Memory has increased by a factor of about two million. The thirty-two Gbytes of main memory in today's laptop can store approximately 8,000 songs. In contrast, the IBM PC of 1984 couldn't store 1,000 songs or even 100 songs or even one song. In fact, it couldn't have stored even one-tenth of the song. With the IBM PC's sixteen Kbytes, you could have stored only one second of one song. Hopefully that gives some perspective of how far we have advanced.<br><br>External storage capacities have increased even more dramatically. The two-Tbyte external drive I mentioned can store about ten million times as much data as the original floppy disks of the IBM PC. Thus, to get the storage capacity of one of today's external hard drives, you would have needed to buy ten million floppy disks in 1984. This two-Tbyte drive can hold about 120,000 songs. If you were to fill that hard drive with those songs and listened to songs day and night, every second of every day, even while you were sleeping, you would hear each song once in a year. I've noticed that some students are apparently attempting this, as their earphones seem to be just another appendage to their body. The amazing thing about this rapid increase in technology is that these trends are continuing.<br><br>So why do I bring this up? Why the megas, gigas, and teras? To me this is a wonderful manifestation of the Lord's hand in the progression of His children. Do not all of these things testify that God loves us and wants the best for us? Do we recognize the Lord's hand in all things?<br><br>Johannes Gutenberg invented the first printing press with movable type in the year 1436.<sup>11</sup>Prior to this, scribes painstakingly copied by hand the books or manuscripts they wanted printed. From Gutenberg's time until 1830, when the Book of Mormon was printed, some improvements were made to the press, but the form and function of the printing press used by Egbert B. Grandin was not much more sophisticated than Gutenberg's. Today, all of the text for the Book of Mormon is stored electronically, and copies can be produced instantaneously. It was recently announced that the 150 millionth copy of the Book of Mormon had been printed, and portions of it are currently available in 107 languages.<sup>12</sup><br><br>This advance in technology has made it possible for many more of our Father's children to hear the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. In fact, fulfilling the Savior's injunction "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature"<sup>13</sup>would be nigh unto impossible without modern technology.<br><br>Let me give another example. Through the Urim and Thummim, the Lord showed Abraham some incredible visions:<br><br><i>And I, Abraham, had the Urim and Thummim....</i><br><br><i>And I saw the stars, that they were very great....</i><br><br>[And]<i>I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, ... and he told me of the works which his hands had made....</i><br><br><i>... And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and Isaw those things which his hands had made, whichwere many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof.</i><sup>14</sup><i></i><br><br>We don't know all of what Abraham was shown, but it is clear that the Lord provided a wonderful glimpse of His innumerable creations.<br><br>But has He not given us a similar glimpse? In 1995 NASA controllers decided to point the Hubble Space Telescope at a section of space they thought was fairly empty. Astronomers had studied space for many years and knew where the most visible galaxies and stars were located. They wondered what they would find looking at a part of space where they really hadn't seen much in the past. They took a ten-day exposure during December 1995. If you were to place a coin about seventy-four feet away from you, that is the area of space that was photographed by the Hubble. The astronomers were amazed at what they saw. The portion of space they photographed contained some 1,500 galaxies.<sup>15</sup>This was astonishing to them. This little section of space that had appeared empty was literally jam-packed withgalaxies.<br><br>Wondering if this was just a fluke, they decided to reposition the Hubble and take a photograph of another spot in space that appeared empty. The Hubble had some upgrades performed on it, and the camera that captured the images was improved. They pointed the Hubble at the desired location and took an eleven-day exposure of this new area. NASA officials liken the amount of space photographed by the Hubble in this instance to be what you would see if you had an eighty-foot-long soda straw that you looked down. I'm not sure where you would find an eighty-foot-long soda straw, or how you would hold it up, but you get the picture. The image they obtained was even more stunning than the previous one. In this image, around 10,000 galaxies can be seen, of all shapes, sizes, and ages. They estimate that the furthest galaxies that can be seen are several billion light years away from us, give or take a few kilometers.<sup>16</sup>If you assume that this section of space is representative of all of space and extend these numbers to the entire sphere of space surrounding us, then multiply the total number of galaxies by the estimated 500 billion stars per galaxy,<sup>17</sup>the numbers are absolutely mind-boggling. There truly are "worlds without number."<sup>18</sup><br><br>So we have Abraham being shown incredible things via the Urim and Thummim. And we have ourselves being shown incredible things via the Hubble Space Telescope. In which of these is the hand of the Lord most plainly manifest? I would suggest that it is in both of them. Alma reminds us:<br><br><i>All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Alma is a great example of learning to confess the Lord's hand in all things, although in his case it took a rather dramatic experience for him to learn that lesson. After seeing an angel and being called to repentance, Alma was overcome. Finally, after three days of suffering, his repentance was accepted by the Lord, and he regained consciousness. At that point he gave some interesting insights into this notion of confessing the Lord's hand in ourlives.<br><br><i>Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, ... then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess ... that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance ofhis all-searching eye.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Thus, we will all eventually confess the Lord's hand in our lives. We can do it either now (the preferred method) or at the last day, when the consequences will be more significant.<br><br>Let me share a personal experience I had in which the Lord's hand was clearly manifest. Several years ago I took a trip with my family to Mesa, Arizona. We enjoyed renewing acquaintances, getting caught up on everyone's lives, and spending time in the swimming pool, a necessity on a summer day in Mesa. Mytwo-and-a-half-year-old nephew Ryan was afraid of the water, so his mom spent one morning in the pool with him trying to get him to overcome his fear. During the time he wasn't learning to swim with his mother, my two-and-a-half-year-old son was teaching him how to maneuver himself over the locked fence that protected the swimming pool. After spending some fun time in the pool, we retired to the house to eat andrelax.<br><br>I was enjoying reading a book in the living room. After reading for some time, I took a short break and just sat in the reclining chair enjoying my time away from work. While I was relaxing I had the distinct impression that I should go look in the swimming pool. I thought to myself, "That is strange; no one is currently swimming in the pool." But fortunately, I followed the prompting and got up out of my chair. I looked out the kitchen window and noticed that there were waves in the pool. The thought again came to me that it was strange for there to be waves in the pool, since no one was swimming. I went outside to check things out more closely, and as I went out the door, I could see a small body floating in the pool. I ran to the side of the pool and saw Ryan, a couple feet from the edge of the pool, floating lifeless in the water. I immediately grabbed him, pulled him out of the water, and began administering CPR. Interestingly, about two weeks prior to our trip, I had just completed a Red Cross CPR refresher course offered at my work.<br><br>After a few breaths into Ryan's lungs, he spit up a significant amount of water and started breathing again. I yelled to some of the kids playing nearby to call 911. They ran in the house and frantically told my wife to call 911. Within a matter of minutes the paramedics had arrived and started Ryan on oxygen and an IV. Shortly thereafter, a helicopter landed in the street next to the house and whisked Ryan off to the hospital. As a family we knelt in prayer and asked for the Lord's blessings to be with Ryan. We didn't know at that time what would happen to him. However, after we ended the prayer, a sweet, peaceful spirit settled in upon us. I knew at that time that he would be fine. To all of us present that day, there was no question but what the Lord was with us.<br><br>Where was the Lord's hand more plainly manifest in this event? Was it the fact that modern medicine had advanced to the point that the doctors and paramedics could treat Ryan such that he would fully recover? Was it the fact that we could fly a large metal object through the air, maneuvering around trees and powerlines, land it in the street, then fly it to the hospital? Or was it the still small voice of the Spirit that made the rest of these miracles possible? I personally see the hand of the Lord in all of these things and have thanked Him numerous times for His loving kindness and mercy in this event.<br><br>Often times when things go wrong in people's lives, they ask, "Why me, God?" I have found myself asking that question relative to this situation. "Why me? Why was I blessed with this wonderful experience? Why did the Lord see fit in His infinite wisdom to touch my life with this sweet outpouring of His spirit?" I don't know all of the answers, butas Ihave contemplated the happenings of that day, a couple of things have come to mymind.<br><br>First, I was available. The other people in the house at that time were preoccupied with making meals, cleaning, etc., and were caught up in doing the chores of this life. The things they were doing were good things, but they were concentrating so much on their work that they were less available to the Spirit.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer stated it this way:<br><br><i>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Second, I firmly believe that the Lord, for whatever reason, just wanted to share with me one of His tender mercies. I have looked back on this experience many times in my life as a reminder that He truly is there, that He truly does care for me, and that He is genuinely interested in me. This experience has been a foundational spiritual experience that has helped me weather many of the storms of life I have faced since that day. I don't know all of the answers to "Why me?" but whatever the reasons may be, I am eternally grateful to know that a loving Father in Heaven is there to help us--personally and individually--when we need that help.<br><br>The miracles of modern medicine hit home again a couple of weeks ago when I took my seven-year-old son to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. I was amazed that with three small inch-long incisions, the doctors were able to insert and manipulate their instruments to successfully remove his infected appendix. After the surgery, it was obvious that my son was fine when we got him home from the hospital and he marched around the house singing, "Appendectomy, are you doing it?!" And, in the traditional Egbert competitive spirit, one of my other sons greeted him with "Ha ha, I have more appendices than you do!" Our lives are truly blessed to have the technology the Lord has given us.<br><br>I have found that recognizing the Lord's hand applies to all aspects of our life--even to our schooling. When I was a freshman at BYU, my roommate and I registered for several classes together. I was majoring in computer science, and he was majoring in electrical engineering, so our courses of study overlapped significantly. In each of the classes we took together, we made a game of comparing our exam scores after each exam to see who scored higher. As it turned out, in every case Ireceived a slightly higher score than him. For some reason this annoyed him. If he scored a 90, I scored a 93. If he scored an 80, I scored an 82. I thought it was hilarious, but he didn't seem to get as big a kick out of it as I did.<br><br>Finally, we had a Book of Mormon exam that I absolutely bombed. I went into the exam unprepared for what was on the exam and came away from the test with a score in the 60s. My roommate scored an 88, if I remember correctly. As you can imagine, I was quite hesitant to share my score with him, but when I did, I pretty much got the reaction I expected. He started whooping and hollering, and he spent the next two days letting everyone he came in contact with know that he destroyed me on the exam. I ate my humble pie and let him gloat over it. What other choice did I have? Two days later we attended our Book of Mormon class again. After the song and prayer, the teacher got up and addressed the class. He said that he had thought about the exam he gave and had determined that it really wasn't a fair exam, so he was going to completely drop it. I maintained my sense of humility and decorum, at least until class was over and I could then take my turn gloating. I couldn't understand why my roommate couldn't find joy with me in my success. How selfish of him. Now, to be totally honest, I'm not sure exactly where the Lord's hand was in all of this, but I have sure enjoyed reminiscing about this experience many times since that day.<br><br>The idea of confessing the Lord's hand in all things was poignantly taught to me several years ago by my father. It was one of those teaching moments that he took, and my guess is that he probably has no idea of the effect this small experience had on me. But the lesson he taught me has stayed with me throughout mylife.<br><br>Each year when I was growing up, my family would go backpacking in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming. On this particular trip, my father, my younger brother, and I had enjoyed a beautiful day fishing at one of the alpine lakes, and we decided to climb over a ridge and down into another lake a couple of miles away. There had been a significant amount of snow the past winter, and we were there a little earlier in the year than normal, so there was still a fair amount of snow in the higher elevations. After making the climb to the ridge, we looked down and admired the turquoise lake in the valley below us. The problem was that there was a steep 400-foot snowslide between us and the lake. We weren't all that concerned about sliding into the freezing, ice-fed water, however, since there was a fifty-foot-wide boulder field between the snowslide and the lake. It was made up of automobile-sized boulders that would certainly stop us before we could make it to the water. This was not a lot of consolation, however. Traveling at the speed we would be traveling down the snowslide, we didn't particularly want to meet the boulder field.<br><br>We decided that we would traverse our way across the snowslide rather than attempting to slide down it. My father told my younger brother to walk right above him, so that if he accidentally slipped, my father could stop him. Then we started on our way. About three steps into our traverse, my brother lost his footing, knocked my father's feet out from under him, and the two of them started careening down the snowslide. As they went they threw all of the equipment they were holding, so that they could use their hands to help steer and slow them down. I watched from the top of the snowslide with much anticipation as they got closer and closer to the boulder field. After doing a somersault over one boulder higher up in the snowslide, my father was able to gain control, stop himself, and stop my brother just before they hit the main boulder field.<br><br>We all took a sigh of relief that they had made it down safely, but now came my dilemma. I was at the top of the snowslide, they were at the bottom, and their equipment was scattered all down the slide. I figured I would just keep traversing the snow back and forth, descending gradually, and pick up their equipment on my way down. About three steps into this plan, my feet slipped out from under me and I was on my way down the slide. My trip down the first half of the slide consisted of sticking a hand or foot out every so often to try to grab the fishing rods, backpacks, fishing equipment, etc., that they had strewn along the snowslide. I was actually able to grab all of the gear, which was quite miraculous in and of itself. Then, the second half of the slide, my thoughts turned to panic. I could see my father and brother standing as a bumper pad between me and the boulders. I dug in my boots as best I could to try to slow down. My hands were useless due to the fact that they were full of all of our gear. Eventually I got myself slowed to a reasonable speed, and my father grabbed me and stopped me just before Igot to the boulder field.<br><br>After making sure that everyone was okay, we took inventory of our situation. To my surprise I was able to hold on to all of the gear that I had gathered along my way down the snowslide. Then I looked at the only casualty of the day; I had broken my own fishing rod. My immediate thoughts were something along the lines of "Oh great. I nearly sacrifice my life to gather up all of their gear, and MY fishing rod is the one that gets broken!" I don't remember exactly what I said, but I vocalized my anger and frustration to my dad. His response--and this was the lesson--was, "Oh, that's okay. You needed a new fishing rod anyway."<br><br>My next thought was, "What? You don't understand! I broke my fishing rod. This is awful! Now how am I going to enjoy the rest ofthe trip?" I didn't vocalize this thought, thankfully. Instead, I paused and thought about the reaction my father just had. His message to me was, "Look, you can either be angry or else you can enjoy the rest of the trip. We are all safe, and that is what is important. Breaking a fishing rod is really not a big deal. You can use half a rod the remainder of the trip, or you can use mine and I'll use half a rod. It's just not that important."<br><br>As I have had disappointing experiences throughout my life, my father's reaction to this situation always comes back to me. Rather than reacting in an angry, negative way, just take the situation for what it is and move on. Do Irecognize the Lord's hand in this experience? Absolutely. As disappointing as it first was when I discovered I had broken my fishing rod, the Lord had protected us and had taught me a valuable lesson that has brought me strength throughout my life. I am indeed grateful to my father and to the Lord for this experience.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph showed a great example of confessing the Lord's hand in all things and in continually relying on the Lord. About seven and a half years after receiving the revelation I alluded to at the beginning of my talk, Joseph and several of the Brethren were held as prisoners in Liberty Jail. The Prophet had been faithful throughout his life and had done everything the Lord asked him to do. When he had received commandments, he had obeyed, regardless of the cost. He had seen some of his closest friends betray him and turn against him. And yet he had remained faithful. Still, it had been his lot to live for several months in the most terrible of conditions, suffering hunger, thirst, cold, and other privations. Finally, when the suffering was almost too much to bear, Joseph pleaded with the Lord forunderstanding.<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>I sense in Joseph's pleadings not anger but a sincere question that he is asking of his loving Father.<br><br>The response that the Lord gives him shows that love:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br><i>Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Joseph never faltered and was an incredible example of confessing the Lord's hand in all things.<br><br>Why has the Lord given to us the technology and the conveniences He has? What is the purpose of modern technology? Why the automobiles, the airplanes, the computers, the cell phones, even the texting, Twitter, and Facebook? President Packer stated:<br><br><i>When the servants of the Lord determine to do as He commands, we move ahead. As we proceed, we are joined at the crossroads by those who have been prepared to help us.</i><br><br><i>They come with skills and abilities precisely suited to our needs. And, we find provisions; information, inventions, help of various kinds, setalong the way waiting for us to take them up.</i><br><br><i>It is as though someone knew we would be traveling that way. We see the invisible hand of theAlmighty providing for us.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>So, in response to the question "Why the advances in technology?" there really can be only one answer. "For behold, this is my work and my glory," the Lord said to Moses--not "This is a part of my work and my glory" or "This is one facet of my work and my glory" but "This<i>is</i>my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>26</sup>All He does, all of His efforts are directed to this end. Thus, the reason the Lord has provided us technology is so that we can help Him bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children.<br><br>As wonderful as modern technology is, it still pales in comparison to God's power and ability. We get to view the wonders of the universe; He gets to create them. Even with His infinite power, He "take[th] upon him the form of man"<sup>27</sup>and "suffer[eth] both body and spirit"<sup>28</sup>for each of us, individually. Even though He created "worlds without number,"<sup>29</sup>He suffered the will of the Father and took upon Him the sins of each of us.<br><br>I thank the Lord for the marvelous creations and inventions around us. We truly live in a blessed day. May each of us recognize the Lord's hand in all we do, and may we use the knowledge, technology, and modern miracles as a mechanism to build the kingdom of God, that, as the Prophet Joseph pleaded, "The kingdom of heaven may come,"<sup>30</sup>is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Parris K.

<h1>ven Feel Like Home When We Get There? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. Thank you, choir, for that beautiful interpretation of "My Little Welsh Home." Thank you, Professor Hall. Professor Rosalind Hall is one of my oldest friends. She is a great British export and an almost impossible act to follow.<br><br>As you've gathered, I am not from around these parts. I was born in the United Kingdom, specifically in South Wales. That makes me a Welshman. The words<i>Welsh</i>and<i>Wales</i>are exonyms of Anglo-Saxon origin. An exonym is a name given to one nation by another. In other words, it's not what a nation or people call themselves. These particular exonyms--<i>Welsh</i>and<i>Wales--</i>mean, respectively, "stranger or foreigner" and "land of the stranger or foreigner." For many years after the Germanic invasions of Britain, the Welsh continued to refer to themselves as<i></i>Brythoniaid or Britons.<i></i>Nevertheless, they also eventually adopted the Anglo-Saxon words<i>Welsh</i>and<i>Wales.</i>I can only assume they did this quite naturally as they acquired the English language and in ignorance of the original meanings of these labels. No one in his right mind and inhabiting his own land would knowingly use a word that meant foreigner as a gentilic to refer to himself.<br><br>But despite this lapse, for well over 1,000 years now, the Welsh have referred to themselves and to their land, in their own language, as<i>Cymro</i>and<i>Cymru</i>.<i>Cymro</i>translates as "fellow countryman," and<i>Cymru</i>as "land of my fellow countrymen" or "land of my people." In this regard, it is probably worth noting that our national anthem is entitled "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau," which is usually rendered into English as "Land of My Fathers," but which translates more accurately as "Ancient Land of My Fathers." All of this confirms to me that the Welsh feel inseparably connected to their country, to their people, and to their forefathers. In other words, the concept of home, in both its narrow and broad senses, holds a central place in the Welsh psyche. For this reason I want to share with you this morning two personal stories to do with home.<br><h2><b>Story One</b></h2><br>My family and I arrived in the United States on 24 July 2000. It was Pioneer Day. Since then, my wife has claimed that we too are pioneers. And just as the original pioneers had to adapt to their new surroundings, we too were faced with a period of adjustment, which, I confess, is not over yet. Was it Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw who said that Britain and the United States are two nations divided by a common language? The most authoritative sources appear to claim it was Shaw. Either way, I have discovered that the observation contains more than a grain of truth. Here are some of the cultural and linguistic differences that separate our two countries:<br><h3><b><i>Cars</i></b></h3><br><ul><br>	<li>We Brits store our suitcases in the boot, not the trunk.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our engine rests under a bonnet, not under a hood. Both words--<i>bonnet</i>and<i>hood--</i>refer to items of head wear. For the British the car is feminine (we often refer to it as "she"), so<i>bonnet</i>fits rather well. The word<i>hood</i>seems to me to be indeterminate, and I'm therefore not quite sure what, if anything, it responds to.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our cars do not have fenders but bumpers.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our exhaust pipes are fitted not with mufflers but with silencers.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We are protected from the elements by a windscreen, not a windshield.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>If we want to turn, we signal or indicate: left indicator or blinker to turn left or right indicator or blinker to turn right. Indicators are always orange, never red. Red is reserved for brake lights and rear night-lights, which do not blink.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We put petrol, not gas, in our tanks, and we fill up at a petrol or service station.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We drive on the road, never on the pavement. Our pavement is your sidewalk. This confusing difference inevitably caused problems for me here in Provo when I took my driving test. It was hard for me to bring myself to drive my car on something called a pavement.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our best roads are motorways, not freeways.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>If we are in a hurry, we often overtake the car in front, and, if we are feeling especially daring and inclined to flout the law, we may undertake. The connection between<i>undertake</i>and<i>undertaker</i>should give you some idea of what the British think about passing another car on the inside.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>If you park illegally in Britain, you will not be booted, but you may well be clamped.</li><br></ul><br>Similar differences exist in many other lexical domains. For instance:<br><h3><b><i>Food</i></b></h3><br>We say jam, not jelly; jelly, not Jell-O; main course, not entrée; crisps, not chips; and chips, not french fries.<br><h3><b><i>Shopping</i></b></h3><br>Generally speaking, the word<i>store</i>is used only in the combination<i>department store</i>. If we need a generic word, we tend to use the word<i>shop</i>. We take our prescriptions to the chemist's, not to the pharmacy or drugstore. I'll leave it to you to guess what runs through my mind when I hear the word<i>drugstore</i>.<br><h3><b><i>Weights and Measures</i></b></h3><br>If you say to me that someone weighs 147 pounds, it doesn't register. I have to convert the pounds into stones and pounds in order for them to mean something. Having done so, I know exactly what 10 stones 7 pounds represent. In Britain a billion is a million millions. Similarly, our imperial gallon is larger than your gallon. I mention this just to let you know that not everything is bigger in America.<br><h3><b><i>Verb Morphology</i></b></h3><br>What applies to vocabulary applies equally to verb morphology. For example, in Britain wesay:<br><ul><br>	<li>I dived into the pool, not I dove.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>I sneaked into the house, not I snuck.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>I pleaded my case, not I plead my case.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>I've got better, not I've gotten better.</li><br></ul><br><h3><b><i>Pronunciation</i></b></h3><br>If you are still awake, you will have noticed that pronunciation is also often very different. I don't suppose I will ever feel comfortable pronouncing<i>tomato</i>,<i>laboratory</i>,<i>Isaiah,</i>or<i>herb</i>in the American way. I'm not even sure I would know how.<br><h3><b><i>Other Aspects of Language</i></b></h3><br>Well, you will be relieved to hear that I'll provide no examples of bad language. Let me just say that what is a swear word or taboo word here may be perfectly acceptable in Britain, and vice versa. Such differences obviously provide plenty of scope for embarrassment.<br><br>The same type of mismatch between form and content may also be found in more neutral language. I have already referred to how the meanings of<i>pavement</i>and<i>jelly</i>differ in our two countries. These are by no means isolated cases. For example, when I table a proposal, I put it on the table for discussion. This, I gather, is precisely the opposite of what "tabling a proposal" means in American English.<br><h3><b><i>Protocol/Laws</i></b></h3><br><ul><br>	<li>To my amazement I discovered that there is a curfew for the under-eighteens here in Provo. My family's personal experience confirms that this curfew is indeed enforced.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>You are allowed to turn right on a red light! I strongly advise against trying the equivalent if you ever drive in the UK.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We stop<i>at</i><b></b>the traffic light, not 20 or 30 yards before we reach it. This is a difference that continues to plague me as I drive in Provo. By the way, the colours displayed by our traffic lights are red, amber, and green.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We drive on the left, have our steering wheel on the right, and look right before crossing the road. It's a completely different mind-set, and I would therefore not blame any of you for not wanting to get into a car with me.</li><br></ul><br>You are probably asking yourselves by now where all this is leading. Well, there is a point I want to make. Because we see so many American programmes on British television, it is tempting for us to think that we know America. This was my mistake. I wasn't prepared for the culture shock when I moved here. It has been more than ten years, and I am still not finding it easy to make the changes that need to be made. By analogy, we attend church regularly. We talk frequently about heaven, about our Father and Elder Brother. Many of us, perhaps, think we know what heaven is like. But can we be sure that heaven will be a familiar place when we get there? Or will we experience the kind of culture shock I experienced when I came to the United States?<br><br>When I joined the Church, I was offered a new identity. In addition to being a subject of the United Kingdom, I was given the chance to become a subject of Christ the King. As we learn in 4 Nephi 1:17, in Christ's kingdom there are no "-ites": no Americanites, no Britishites, no Germanites--just simple followers of Christ. Moreover, His kingdom has its own laws, customs, institutions, and even language, and if we are going to be happy and feel accepted there, we need to adapt. In fact, we need to be considerably more amenable to change than I have been since arriving in the States. Otherwise, we will be like square pegs in round holes. To our mother tongue we need to add our Father's tongue. We also need to shed a few things, perhaps many things. As the Apostle Paul taught, the old man dies in the waters of baptism, and a new man is brought forth (see Romans 6:4; Ephesians 4:24). In other words, we must become a new person, we must be reborn in some profound way that involves not just taking upon us a new name (that of Christ) but also doing our best to think and act like Him. I cannot export my current ways of thinking and behaving to the celestial kingdom any more than I, as a Brit, can successfully import British ways of thinking and behaving to the United States. Some things just do not travel well.<br><br>Unfortunately, adaptation and change are not easy. And they are not easy, in the context to which I refer, because our national and individual identities are inextricably intertwined. They also are not easy for another reason: they require a degree of surrender or relegation. Some people who emigrate may be delighted to surrender or relegate their former identity because they feel they are getting a better one; others may view this as an act of disloyalty or treachery. At the very least, they may feel they are being false to their background. I fall into this latter category. As I've said, I do not foresee the day when I will feel comfortable pronouncing<i>tomato</i>,<i>Isaiah,</i>and<i>herb</i>in the American way. However, when it comes to the gospel, things are rather different.<br><br>First, there is the good news that we are all trading up. The identities, both individual and national, that we seek to acquire as subjects of Christ are far better than the ones we surrender, however wonderful we may think these to be. Remember what Paul wrote in this regard: "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19).<br><br>Given that the original meaning of the word<i>Welsh</i>is "stranger/foreigner," it should not surprise you to learn that the phrase "strangers and foreigners" in this scripture has particular significance for me. It is as if Paul were saying, "Now therefore ye are no more Welsh." That's a sobering thought. In any event, the apostle's choice of language is very deliberate. We all know what an immense privilege it was in his day to enjoy Roman citizenship. Paul himself benefited from his status as a Roman on several occasions. And how proud Romans were to be Roman! Consequently, I have no doubt that the opposition established between "strangers and foreigners" and "fellowcitizens" would have struck Paul's contemporaries with peculiar force. They would all have recognized that, in Paul's mind, being part of God's kingdom affords incomparable freedoms and protections, as well as a true sense of belonging. Even Roman citizens were strangers and foreigners when it came to the kingdom of God, and they too traded up when they accepted the Savior as their king. They became what the Welsh would call, in their own language,<i>Cymry,</i>or "fellow countrymen"--fellow countrymen, that is, with the Saints.<br><br>Second, we can feel confident that when we begin to assume our new identities, we are in no sense engaged in an act of betrayal. In fact, we merely embark upon a process of recovery. We begin to recover a sense of who we were when we stood in the presence of our Father, shouted for joy at the prospect of coming to Earth, and surely promised to do all we could to remain loyal and faithful to our background and heritage.<br><br>When we meet the Saviour again, we won't want to experience the culture shock that I had when I moved to America. Elder Maxwell once referred to the chasm that exists between Christ and us. He did not exaggerate. Nevertheless, as far as is possible, we want to come to think, speak, and behave like the Saviour. We want to feel that we belong in His society, where individual and national identities are also inextricably intertwined. So here are a few things that can help us narrow the gap between our Elder Brother and ourselves:<br><br>1. The Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants teaches that "out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<b></b>We know what those small things are. We just need to make them part of our lives so that when the time comes to pass through the veil, we will be similar to heavenly beings.<br><br>2. In connection with this, Moroni gives very specific counsel. He writes:<br><br><i>Charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that</i>when he shall appear we shall be like him. [Moroni 7:47–48; emphasis added]<br><br>3. True patriots are willing to give everything for their country, even their lives. Although we will not likely be called upon to sacrifice everything for the gospel, we must at least be willing to do so. The merchant in Matthew, chapter 13, sold everything he had in order to purchase a pearl of great price (see Matthew 13:45–46); the sons of Mosiah refused the kingdom of their father in order to have complete freedom to preach the gospel (see Mosiah 29:3); and King Lamoni's father promised to give away all his sins to know God, to be raised from the dead, and to be saved at the last day (see Alma 22:18). Lamoni's father requested a great deal in exchange for his sins, but certainly no more than is on offer to us all.<br><br>4. Acquisition of a celestial identity will require a conscious and determined effort on our part--an effort that must continue until we develop a new set of reflexes, a new mind-set. It may seem difficult, but it really is just a matter of choice. Nephi probably said it best:<br><br><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that</i>ye are free to act<i>for yourselves--</i>to choose<i>the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 10:23; emphasis added]<br><br>5. Finally, in 3 Nephi 19:28 we read these words of the Saviour:<br><br><i>Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their</i>faith,<i>and I pray for them,</i><b></b>and also for them who shall believe on their words. [Emphasis added]<br><br>If we do all we can to be obedient, if we truly accept the Atonement--which, after all, is the most magnificent offer of reconciliation ever made--the day will come when the Saviour will petition the Father on our behalf. And I am confident that there is absolutely nothing that the Father will refuse His Only Begotten.<br><h2><b>Story Two</b></h2><br>I grew up in a Welsh village where everybody knew everybody. When I was approaching fifteen, I joined the Church. The nearest chapel was located in Merthyr Tydfil, about twelve miles from my home. When I reached the age of eighteen, I prepared to leave Wales in order to study in London. I remember vividly my last Sunday in Wales. At the end of our meetings that day, a Welsh tenor named Dave Harman suddenly stood up and began to sing to me. I accept that anywhere else such an occurrence would probably seem very odd indeed. In those days it wasn't quite so odd in Wales. In fact, the tenor was soon joined by the rest of the congregation. The song they sang was "We'll Keep a Welcome in the Hillside."<br><br>Before I read the words of this song, there is something I need to explain. Although the lyrics are in English, they include one very significant Welsh word:<i>hiraeth</i>. The word is significant because it has no exact equivalent in English. This is why it appears in an otherwise English text. It means something like "longing/yearning for home" and refers to feelings much deeper and more poignant than those conveyed by the English word<i>homesickness</i>. Anyway, these are the words of the song:<br><br><i>Far away a voice is calling,</i><br><i>Bells of memory chime</i><br><i>Come home again, come home again,</i><br><i>They call through the oceans of time.</i><br><i></i><br><i>We'll keep a welcome in the hillside.</i><br><i>We'll keep a welcome in the Vales.</i><br><i>This land you knew will still be singing</i><br><i>When you come home again to Wales.</i><br><i></i><br><i>This land of song will keep a welcome</i><br><i>And with a love that never fails.</i><br><i>We'll kiss away each hour of hiraeth</i><br><i>When you come home again to Wales.</i><br><br>The recollection of this event is etched in my memory, not because of what I saw or heard but because of what it made me feel. Hiraeth is the stirring or voice that calls all Welshmen who venture abroad back home to Wales. Nowhere have I experienced this feeling more acutely than when, as a student, I frequently found myself in one of the great railway stations of London during the rush hour. Literally thousands of people would pass hurriedly by, seemingly with a sense of purpose, and I didn't know one of them. The setting was a far cry from the Welsh village of Glynneath, where everybody knew everybody and life proceeded at a much gentler pace. In my busier moments I don't often think of Wales. But in the still of the night, memories come flooding back, and with them hiraeth, that yearning to find yourself once again in your own land and among your own people, to be with those who think and behave just like you, to feel completely at ease in their company because of your shared heritage.<br><br>I like to think that as each of us prepared to leave our premortal estate for our adventure on earth, a tenor came forward and, quickly joined by a heavenly choir, began to sing words similar to these:<br><br><i>Far away a voice is calling,</i><br><i>Bells of memory chime</i><br><i>Come home again, come home again,</i><br><i>They call through the oceans of time.</i><br><i></i><br><i>We'll keep a welcome in the hillside.</i><br><i>We'll keep a welcome in the Vales.</i><br><i>This land you knew will still be singing</i><br><i>When you come home again to Wales.</i><br><i></i><br><i>This land of song will keep a welcome</i><br><i>And with a love that never fails.</i><br><i>We'll kiss away each hour of hiraeth</i><br><i>When you come home again to Wales.</i><br><br>I hope that, in our quieter moments, we sense or hear a voice from beyond the veil that calls us home. I hope we occasionally experience hiraeth, that yearning to return to our heavenly home, that place where there are no "strangers or foreigners" and where there is indeed a "love that never fails." The voice we need to listen for is, of course, the voice of the Spirit. As we listen, memories will come flooding back, and we will want to turn homeward. Each time we heed the Spirit's voice, we move one step closer to home. Remember that it is what we feel more than what we see or hear that remains etched in our memories. This is why it is vital to have the Spirit in our lives. Imentioned a moment ago that English has no exact equivalent of hiraeth. Nevertheless, the Saints really ought to have one, for we believe that we have a home like no other, and we ought to yearn to return to it someday. Think of that as the choir sings "We'll Keep a Welcome in the Hillside" following my remarks.<br><br>To conclude, it is my hope that we will listen for the voice that tells us that we have a home elsewhere and that we will allow that voice to guide our steps back to Him who gave us life. If we do this we will not feel awkward or out of place when we get there. Heaven will not seem like a foreign land. Rather, we will recognize its language as our own and its protocols as those we have embraced throughout our lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lynn Williams was associate chair of the<br>Department of Spanish and Portuguese at BYU when this devotional address was given on 31 May 2011.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>n Essential Principle of the Gospel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A couple of years ago I was invited to be a keynote speaker at an international conference in London. This was a nice professional honor and a great opportunity to represent my lab and the university before an international audience. I was excited for the trip and made the typical preparations: I made my travel arrangements, prepared my talk, provided materials to people publicizing the keynote address, and even found directions on the London Underground so that I could attend Church and see interesting sites in London that I'd not seen before. The day came, my bags were packed, and I was on my way to London.<br><br>That is when I discovered that my passport was expired. My passport was expired!<br><br>The conference had been advertising my keynote talk on their website for months. When attendees registered at the conference, they received a program that included my picture and biographical sketch. But I wouldn't be there because my passport was expired. What I thought was going to be a nice honor instead became one of the most embarrassing events of my life. I had done a lot of things to prepare for the trip, but I had neglected one essential thing. And because I had missed that one essential thing, none of the other things mattered. The fact that I had counted out and packed just the right number of pairs of socks for the trip didn't matter because I'd forgotten something essential.<br><br>It is easy in life to become busy with all kinds of things, even things that are important, but we have to be careful not to neglect those things that are essential; otherwise, none of the other things will really matter. I'd like to talk about one of the most essential things in our lives: the first principle of the gospel--"faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" (Articles of Faith 1:4).<br><br>Some of you may be rolling your eyes and thinking, "Faith? That's such a basic concept. I've had that down since I was six years old." Faith may be a simple concept in some ways, but every time I study it, I discover that there is still a lot that I don't understand. So I will confess that although I could choose any topic for today's devotional, I chose something that Idon't fully understand.<br><br>What I do know about faith I have learned from both study and life. I'd like to illustrate some of the concepts of faith using personal experiences about how I became an engineer. Ihope that these illustrations will help us understand the concepts and will also be relevant to those of you who are in similar situations at this time in your life.<br><br>I grew up in the wonderful community of Portage, Utah. I've heard some people refer to Portage as being "remote." I don't necessarily agree with that, but let me explain. The most recent census lists the population of Portage as 245. Portage is in Box Elder County, which is larger than the state of Connecticut but only has a population of 50,000, most of which is centered in Tremonton and Brigham City. So it's safe to say that there is plenty of room to roam. And that's exactly what my friends and I did growing up--roam in the mountains: hiking, backpacking, and camping. Often I would be with friends, but sometimes I would go alone to ponder, pray, and just enjoy God's creations. I remember times being miles away from any other person and stepping somewhere and realizing that I might have been the only person in the history of the planet to have ever stepped on that spot. It gave me a thrill to think that I had been somewhere where no one had ever been before. That same thrill is one thing I find appealing about being an engineer. In engineering--particularly engineering research and development--I get to do things that have never been done before, such as extend the boundaries of knowledge, create new technologies that will make a difference in the world, and, in a way, step where no one else has ever been before.<br><br>But there is a challenge with this: doing things that have never been done before requires that you step into the unknown. You can't just follow someone else or repeat what you have done before. Still, even though you don't have a perfect knowledge of the solution to the problems you are working on, there are things that provide substance of the outcomes hoped for. For example, mathematical models of physical phenomena help us to predict how something will perform before it is built. These models provide evidence of things not yet seen. We can build and test prototypes to evaluate how parts of a future system will work. Plus, our past experiences provide trust that if we conform to certain physical laws, everything will work out as expected.<br><br>You can probably see the parallels between engineering research and faith. Paul taught that "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). Although we may not have a perfect knowledge of all spiritual things, there are things that give us hope. For example, like mathematical models used by engineers, promises given in the scriptures help us predict the blessings that result from living certain commandments (see D&amp;amp;C 1:37; 82:10; 130:20–21). We can test spiritual prototypes by following the Savior's counsel in John 7:17 and living a doctrine and finding through our own experience if it is true. We can also reflect on the past influence of God's hand in our lives and find trust that He will continue to be there for us in the future.<br><br>But the first principle of the gospel is not just faith; it is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I would like to talk about five different things related to faith in Jesus Christ. These are paraphrased from<i>Preach My Gospel</i>(see<i>PMG,</i>2004, 61–62).<br><br>1.<i>First, having a firm belief that Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.</i>This belief is probably what we first think of when we consider faith. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).<br><br>2.<i>Second, recognizing that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son's grace and mercy.</i>Nephi taught, "There is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ ... whereby man can be saved" (2 Nephi 25:20). We understand that it is essential to keep the commandments and receive the saving ordinances. But as mortals we simply do not have the power to save ourselves; it is only through Christ's Atonement that we can be saved. Again, as Nephi taught, "We know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). So there is no need for arguments between faith and works--we need both.<br><br>3.<i>Third, trusting in Him and what He says.</i>This is where I feel that I turned the corner in my own understanding of faith. Faith in Jesus Christ is more than just believing in Him; it is trusting in Him that He loves us, that He knows what's best for us, and that His commandments are for our benefit. Sometimes even the no answers to our prayers can help us strengthen our trust in Him, and we can better understand that His will is better than our own desires. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught:<br><br><i>Faith exists when absolute confidence in that which we cannot see combines with action that is in absolute conformity to the will of our Heavenly Father. Without all three--first, absolute confidence; second, action; and third, absolute conformity--without these three all we have is a counterfeit, a weak and watered-down faith.</i>["Shall He Find Faith on the Earth?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 83).<br><br>Conforming our actions to the will of our Heavenly Father comes from this trust.<br><br>Let me tell a story to illustrate the importance of trusting in God's will over our own desires. I don't know of a better place to build your faith growing up than Portage, Utah. It is a great LDS community with wonderful people. But it's not what you'd think of as a path to the engineering profession. As a young man, I knew very few people who had graduated from college, and I don't think I had ever met an engineer. To be honest, I thought engineers were people who drove trains. So at that time in my life there was no way for me to pray and ask God to help me on a path to what I now consider to be my dream job as an engineering professor at BYU. I could not have asked for that because I had no idea that such a thing even existed or that I would like it. But God knew. It is likely that with my immature understanding I prayed for other things. I am now grateful that those prayers were not answered in the ways that I probably would have liked at the time. Looking back on such experiences helps me appreciate that my understanding today is still immature compared to God's understanding and that I should trust in Him, even when the answers to my prayers are not what I hope for at the time.<br><br>But God's hand is in our lives even when we don't recognize it. Some of my understanding of God's guidance on the path to my career was brought about in an unusual way. A few years ago Finland's ambassador to the United States was visiting campus, and I was part of a group invited to have lunch with him. As he and I talked, the conversation naturally turned to my time as a missionary in Finland, and I mentioned some of the blessings that came from that experience. I told the ambassador that one of the blessings was that when I had completed my missionary service in Finland, I somehow knew that I wanted to be an engineer. That understanding came to me even though I'd been concentrating on missionary work and not worrying about my own future. I counted that as a fulfillment of the promise in the New Testament that as we lose ourselves in the service of God, we will find ourselves (see Matthew 10:39; 16:25). I still believe that is true, but the ambassador had an interesting addition.<br><br>He explained that while I was in Finland, I was exposed to a high-tech culture. He shared data that showed that an extraordinary percentage of Finns study science, math, and engineering in college. He further explained that as a young man, he and his friends, instead of following athletes and celebrities, could name the top scientific researchers in the country and what they did. He said I was exposed to that culture and it would have had an influence on my thinking. I reflected on this and thought of the great people I had met and respected in Finland, and I knew they had made an impact on me. I came to the conclusion that the ambassador and I were both right. And I also realized that he had pointed out a blessing I had not appreciated before. In addition to fulfilling more important purposes with my mission call, God was putting me in the right place to have experiences that would help me find my future career. This insight made me wonder how many other tender mercies God had given me that I had not recognized before. Experiences like this help me remember to trust in God.<br><br>I returned from my mission and studied mechanical engineering here at BYU. I also had the extraordinary good fortune to marry my wife, Peggy. As my graduation approached, Ihad a desire to get an advanced degree. Peggy had graduated in accounting and had a good job at a local CPA firm, I loved BYU, and it made sense to continue here for a master'sdegree.<br><br>However, as we thought and prayed about it, we felt a clear impression that I should accept a job offer from an aerospace company in Texas. Although not as obvious at first, after some thought the advantages of this decision seemed clear. We already had our first child, Angela, and Peggy would be able to stay home with her. The company offered a program where they would pay my tuition to pursue an advanced degree part-time. Several local universities offered courses where the lectures were sent to the company by closed-circuit television. The company would allow me to attend classes during the day so long as I made up the time later. Another advantage of the job was that I would be an engineer on the design of the YF-22, the first prototype of what would become the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor. This was an unusual opportunity for a recent university graduate, and it was right in line with my love of doing new things.<br><br>Our family moved to Texas, and I had a great work experience. But it was also intense. It was a secret defense project with a tight deadline, and I was required to work over 60 hours a week. After adding in the responsibilities of a Church calling and a growing family, taking classes just wasn't feasible.<br><br>I was disappointed and maybe even felt a little picked on. We were trying to do what we felt was right and follow the promptings we had received, but the goal of getting an advanced degree wasn't working out. It turned out once again, however, that God's plan was much better than my own. By taking this job, not only did I receive great work experience, but the long hours also came with overtime pay that we were able to save for a down payment on a house--or so we thought. Having those funds in the bank gave us the courage to eventually pursue graduate work full-time.<br><br>So our family, which by then included our son Travis, moved to Indiana, where I pursued an MS and a PhD at Purdue University. Having those doors opened gave me the educational experience that I needed to pursue my current career. By the time I finished my PhD, our third child, Nathan, had been born. And, as you might imagine, there were many other miracles and tender mercies required before I graduated. I wish I could say that I had the faith in Christ that helped this happen, but I can say that the experience, and others like it, provided opportunities to reflect and see God's hand in my life. Having those experiences strengthened my trust in Him. When things appear to not be going my way, I can reflect on those experiences and trust Him and His will.<br><br>4.<i>Fourth, knowing that He has the power to keep His promises.</i>His promises are really quite extraordinary. For example, consider the Resurrection. Once someone is dead and buried, there is no power on earth that can bring them back. There's no science, there's no medicine, there's no engineering, and there's no physician that can get that done. Yet we know that through the power of Christ's Resurrection, our loved ones who have gone before us will be resurrected, and we will have the opportunity to be together again. It gives us hope for the life after this life. As Alma taught:<br><br><i>The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame....</i><br><br><i>Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame.</i>[Alma 11:43–44]<br><br>Now that's an amazing promise.<br><br>While the Resurrection conquers physical death, Christ also promises that through His Atonement we can overcome the effects of spiritual death and that we can be forgiven of our sins. Sometimes it may be harder to believe that our sins can be forgiven than that our bodies can be resurrected. But Isaiah said, "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" (Isaiah 1:18). Some people feel that forgiveness applies to other people but not to themselves. But through faith, including knowing that Christ has the power to keep His promises, we can know that this power also applies to us. Someone here may be thinking, "You don't know about this terrible sin, this secret or humiliating thing in the past." But I can tell you that it too can be wiped away. Itestify to you that Jesus Christ has the power to keep His promises.<br><br>5.<i>Fifth, accepting and applying His Atonement and teachings.</i>If we believe in Christ and trust in Him and know that He has the power to keep His promises--and He has promised that we can be forgiven of our sins if we repent--then we will repent. So we see that the first principle of the gospel leads to the second principle.<br><br>Faith is fundamental to our commitment to keep the commandments. For example, let's consider the law of tithing. If I pay ten percent of my income as tithing, it turns out I have ten percent less money to spend. The math is pretty easy. But we also know God's promise in Malachi that if we pay our tithes and offerings, He will "open ... the windows of heaven, and pour ... out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it" (Malachi 3:10). So if we have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, then we believe in Him and trust Him and know that He has power to keep His promises, including the promise of opening the windows of heaven when we pay tithing. Paying tithing, then, is not so much a matter of money as it is a matter of faith. So it is with the Word of Wisdom or any of the other commandments.<br><br>So faith leads to action.<br><br>Let me share another example from my path to becoming an engineer. As I mentioned before, when I completed my missionary service, I was determined to become an engineer. But there were a number of obstacles in my path, not the least of which was that I was woefully unprepared in math. I was missing two prerequisites needed to take calculus, which is the starting point for engineering studies. Fortunately I was moved to action by the feeling that I was being led in my career direction. I went to the closest university bookstore at Utah State University and bought textbooks for the prerequisites that I needed: college algebra and trigonometry. That summer I went to work during the days and in the evenings did math. Never having had a college math class before, I didn't know what was expected, so I studied the books from beginning to end, working all the odd-number problems, comparing my solutions to the answers in the back of the book, reworking problems I didn't get right, and using the chapter summaries as self-administered exams to test my understanding. When fall semester approached I was nervous about taking calculus because I'd not had official courses in the prerequisites. I made an appointment with a math professor, told him what Ihad done that summer, and timidly asked if he thought I would be prepared to take calculus. He leaned back in his chair, gave me a curious look, and said, "I think you'll be okay."<br><br>Some of you, after hearing of a summer like that, are thinking that it is not as surprising that I became an engineer as it is that I got married. Fortunately not all of my summers were like that, and I am happy to report that not only did I eventually get married but I also did wonderfully well. So that should give some of you here hope.<br><br>There are a number of things that we can do to build our faith. Prayer is one of the key things in that regard. I take great comfort from the story in the New Testament about a father who brought his son to Jesus to be healed. Jesus explained to him the need for faith, and the man replied, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (Mark 9:24). Another important way to build faith is to study the word of God in the scriptures and the teachings of modern prophets. As I mentioned earlier, we also strengthen our faith by living a commandment and gaining our own testimony of its truthfulness (see John 7:17). An important way to build our faith is to repent and feel the power of the Atonement in our lives. I encourage you to try one other thing: reflect on experiences in your life and search for the times when you could see the hand of God. Sometimes it takes a few years of perspective to see that influence; it is not always obvious in the short term. But as you recognize the times that appeared to be challenges and trials, in the end you may see that those experiences helped you the most. Let that strengthen your trust in God and in Hiswill.<br><br>We learn from<i>Preach My Gospel:</i><br><br><i>As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life's challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually.</i>[<i>PMG,</i>2004, 62]<br><br>Just as my passport was essential for my trip to London, so is faith in Jesus Christ essential to our eternal salvation. It leads us to keep the commandments and apply the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Eventually I will stand before the judgment bar of God. No one there is going to ask me what I did for a living. No one is going to care how many papers I published or how many of my patents were granted; those things are going to be totally irrelevant. But faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, receiving the saving ordinances, and enduring to the end are essential, and if we don't do those things, nothing else will matter.<br><br>I want to leave you my testimony that the Church is true, that Jesus is the Christ and our Savior and our Redeemer. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry L.

<h1>to the Burn!&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I grew up on a small farm in Sanpete County, Utah, about seventy miles south of Provo. As I have reviewed my life, I have recognized the Lord's guidance and perhaps even intervention that has directed me onto paths I would never have thought to pursue myself. From a very young age I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up.<br><br>My grandfather owned the local sawmill and logged his own trees. As a little boy, Ioften went with him to the mountain. We would be logging trees, and quite often a green truck would pull up on the ridgeline and just sit there for a while. Being curious, I asked Grandpa who they were. He told me that they were forest rangers, upon which I asked what they did.<br><br>Grandpa said, "They drive around the forest in their green trucks and watch other people work."<br><br>I immediately knew what I wanted to be. It was a revelatory kind of experience! From that time right on through college, I worked hard to be a good student, and, nearing the end of my BS degree, could almost feel the relaxing seat of my new green truck. But God had other plans for me, because, just before I graduated, He let Ronald Reagan get elected to be president. One of Reagan's first actions was to freeze all federal hiring. So, no forest ranger job--and no green truck--for me.<br><br>I continued into a master's program doing research in North Africa and then went on to a PhD program in another foreign place: Texas! Before I had finished there, I was hired here at BYU, and I thank God for His caring enough to guide my path here. BYU is a wonderful place to work and learn, and in my early life I would never have been able to dream of this job that has given me and my family so many wonderful opportunities. The only bad thing was that I had to buy my own green truck, but I still do get to watch other people work. They're called students: grads and undergrads!<br><br>We all have to be taught, and we all have to learn. I have heard it said that there are three kinds of learners:<br><br>1. Nonlearners make the same mistake time after time, seeming to never learn.<br><br>2. Experience learners make the mistake once and learn from it--never to make the same mistake again.<br><br>3. Then there are observational learners--those who observe the consequences of others making the mistake and learn from that, never having to make the mistake themselves.<br><br>While we all fall into each of these categories with some things, by nature I fit the middle category. Growing up, I was a learn-by-doing kind of kid. Among other family chores was the twice-daily milking of our small herd of Jersey cows. We milked by hand, and, as I was the baby of the family and too small to milk, my assignment was to herd the cows in and out of the barn and then clean the milk-barn floors at the end of each milking session. It seemed as if those cows would save up all night so that they could relieve themselves onmy shiny, clean floor.<br><br>Being an observant child, I noticed that before they made their green deposits, they always lifted their tails. That signal gave me the best idea. I would stand by with my large aluminum scoop shovel, and when the tail went up, the scoop went under, and I caught the prize before it had a chance tosplatter all over the milk-barn floor.<br><br>My dad, seemingly amused and unimpressed by my creativity, said, "Son, I wouldn't do that if I were you."<br><br>I thought to myself, "Yeah, sure, but you don't have to clean up this mess every day."<br><br>So I chose to ignore him, and he allowed it. A couple of days later, after nearly total and very satisfying success, the tail went up and the scoop went under and midway through the event the cow gave a great cough. Now, at my age and stature, I had a birds-eye view of this fine part of the cow's anatomy, and that cough sent a spray of pasty, green liquid that covered me from head to toe. I stood there mortified.<br><br>My dad came over laughing and wiped the outline of first one eye and then the other and simply said, "I told you not to do that."<br><br>It was my first lesson of "lean not unto thine own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). It was a lesson I would have liked to learn through obedience and trust.<br><br>Another great lesson was learned when as a young man of eighteen I took a summer job with the U.S. Forest Service. One of our duties was to be part of a twenty-man fire crew that could be called out from time to time to fight wildfires. Earlier, a wildfire had claimed the lives of four firefighters when in a panic they failed to follow the direction of their crew boss and tried to outrun an unexpected and fierce advance of a fire. The shockwaves of that incident were felt all around the region, and rigorous training ensued. Following the command of the crew boss without question or hesitation was given particular emphasis.<br><br>We fought several fires that season, and then, late in August, our crew was called out to fight a wildfire in Southern California. This was a large fire that had many crews dispatched to fight it. Our crew, along with two other crews, was assigned a sector of the fire. It was a chaparral brush fire that had a tremendously fine fuel load of dried grasses and weeds in the understory. We were obliged to make a two-mile hike from the nearest road through the brush to where the fire was burning.<br><br>It was not a particularly intense blaze, and we were to build black line--a fire line right against the burning edge of the fire. As our three twenty-man crews, marching single file through the brush, approached the fire, the sector boss suddenly appeared on a nearby ridgeline. His urgent command was to become indelibly impressed upon my mind. His voice screamed through our radios, "She's blowing up, she's blowing up! Into the burn!"<br><br>My pulse raced and my heart sank as Iwatched the small campfire-type flames, fanned on by an intense wind shift, transform into a raging inferno racing directly toward us. The command "Into the burn!" meant that we would charge through the fire and into the area where the fire had consumed the fuel. My instinctive impulse was to turn and run, and I could see others considering that option. Our crew boss, without hesitation, reiterated the command "Into the burn!" and though it did not seem the intuitive thing to do, my training and my memory of the tragic earlier deaths compelled me to follow my leader through that wall of fire. On the other side we found a blackened moonscape where the fire could not return. With eyes and lungs burning from the heat in the whirling smoke and ash, we resorted to dancing on the top of hot rocks to protect our feet from the searing deep ash. We had made the right decision and were preserved.<br><br>After about thirty minutes the wind died down, and we were able to cross back out of the burn and begin our black line. That was an intense lesson that helped me to understand the importance of knowing in advance who you should trust and follow without hesitation, especially when the correct choice may be obscured by our own limited experience or instinctive bias.<br><br>That lesson was reinforced in my life just a few years ago when I was invited to participate in a grizzly bear study in Alaska, where we were to observe the response of grizzlies to the influences of smells, sounds, and colors that humans bring into the backcountry. Part of that experience was a safety training session that included instruction of what to do if approached or charged by a bear. If we were charged by a grizzly, the instruction we received was to turn and face the bear (do not run and invoke the predator/prey killing response), make yourself as big in posture as possible, and yell at the bear to go away. Well, I had been in Alaska before and had searched to see a bear with no such luck, so I wasn't too concerned and took the training somewhat lightly.<br><br>Shortly after the training, the bear biologist who had trained us asked if I wanted to go with him to wade the river and count bears. Of course I couldn't wait. We donned our chest waders and were off for a two-kilometer walk in a river. I couldn't believe all the bears and how close we were and how much they didn't seem to care. In that walk we counted over forty grizzly bears.<br><br>On our way back we got behind a mother bear and her three little cubs. She was going painfully slow, and I suggested we pass her. The biologist said that was only a good idea if I was tired of breathing. So we followed patiently behind the bears until we reached a place where the river made a great horseshoe bend and we had our chance to cut through on a brushy trail to get ahead of her. In our haste we apparently intruded on another bear that we hadn't seen, and as I waddled down the path behind my guide, I heard the huff and paw pounding of a bear coming up behind us. I spun and saw a large bear coming upon us fast. The biologist, true to his training, faced the attack, taking up a firm stand--right behind me! As I turned to face the bear, armed only with my small can of bear mace, it dawned on me why they had invited this great big, juicy botanist to join the party. I mean, what bear in their right mind would choose a tofu–diet-burger biologist when they could have the super–double-deluxe meal of a tender and juicy botanist--and, yes, fries with that!<br><br>While turning to run seemed the prudent thing to do, I trusted and followed the instruction I had received. Facing the bear, in my deepest, most menacing voice I yelled repeatedly, "Go away, bear! Go away!" The bear pulled up just short of me, paused for an eternal moment, twisted her head back and forth, and finally turned and slipped away into the underbrush. As I regained my faculties, I realized that I had begun to breathe again. After checking to be sure that I still had all of my body parts and functions, I trundled off back to camp, following my biologist friend who was explaining that this charge "wasn't really sobad!"<br><br>I have often reflected back on these occasions and considered the faith I had in the wisdom and decisions of my Forest Service crew boss and the bear-biologist trainer and in the pre-event decisions I had made to follow them. I have pondered the analogous circumstances in which many of the recorded prophets found themselves faced with commands from God that were, if anything, counterintuitive. How and why did they respond? I think of the response of Adam to the angel when asked why he offered sacrifices: "I know not, save the Lord commanded me" (Moses 5:6). Burning the biggest, unflawed best of his flocks and harvest must have seemed such awaste.<br><br>Noah likewise was given a command that seemed very odd (see Genesis 6:14–15). He built a huge and immovable ship far from water's edge. He likely endured endless ridicule over the highly improbable event of the whole earth being consumed by a flood and hence the improbable utility of such avessel.<br><br>When Abraham, after years of faithful obedience, was finally blessed with a child, his mind and heart must have undoubtedly questioned the command to take his only son to the mount and offer him as sacrifice. Sadly, but willing to do the Lord's will, based on his faith, Abraham built an altar and nearly executed his son before the Lord interceded and accepted his diligence as the offering (see Genesis 22:1–18). Perhaps because it is more similar to my own experience, I can relate to the uncertainty that must have crossed the minds of the children of Israel as Moses gave the command to follow him into the depths of the Red Sea to escape the armies of Egypt (see Exodus 14:21–22).<br><br>A question that is logically posed is "How do I know who to trust and follow?" This question brings us back to the styles of learning. We all learn by doing. The experiences we have while following a leader will build or destroy our confidence in them according to their record of success. Even as a young commander Moroni led his people successfully in war against the Lamanites, but he also led during times of peace, devoting himself to preparing his people and fortifying their lands. These people recognized that following Moroni was a safe and prudent decision. Perhaps more critical than recognizing temporal leadership of men is the recognition of a divine influence and the power of the Lord's Spirit to direct ourlives.<br><br>As I was nearing the end of my master's program I had the opportunity to attend an international professional meeting in Adelaide, Australia. A post-conference tour took us on a ten-day adventure from Adelaide on the south coast across the outback to Darwin on the north coast. Out in the middle we stopped near Alice Springs at a place called Ayers Rock. This is a large sandstone dome that seemingly rises up with nearly vertical walls over 1,100 feet out of an otherwise flat mulga desert. A tourist route that goes up the gentlest slope has metal posts cemented into the stone and connected to each other with chains. Even with this assistance, ascending the rock is only a feat for the fit and adventurous.<br><br>The night before our chance to assail the rock, a South African adventurer, a park ranger, and my roommate decided to do a free climb on the backside of Ayers Rock. This plan, hatched out over a few too many at the local bar, was shared with me upon my roommate's return to our room. I'm still not sure how, but early the next morning I found myself following these characters in the ascent. The first 500 feet weren't so bad, but, as I was the only climbing novice in the group, I was lagging behind, getting tired and a little nervous. It was apparent that we had passed the point of no return, as I found going up steep sandstone was much easier than going down. Three-quarters of the way up I found a little depression in the windswept stone to rest in, and Iknew Iwas in trouble. My legs had turned to jelly and quivered uncontrollably. I was scared nearly to the point of panic. My companions, all experienced climbers, were struggling to find solid grips, as the sandstone composition was flaky near the top. Seemingly strong grips would peel off when exposed toweight.<br><br>As I sat there on my perch and looked out over the vast, beautiful desert, I thought my family might want to know what I saw in my last moments on earth. I pulled out my camera, slipped off the case, snapped a couple of photos, and was brought back to reality as my camera case tumbled down the slope, previewing my unseemly path to the bottom. Paralyzed with fear, realizing one slip would have me ending with a splat, I wished we had told someone where we had gone--but no one knew. I'm not even sure that what we were doing was legal, and my hungover companions were not bolstering any confidence.<br><br>I felt all alone, overwhelmed by despair. And then a thought flickered in my mind, and I instantly remembered that somebody knew where I was: God knew! In an awkward beginning, realizing He knew how I had ended up in this predicament and also knowing I had probably not listened to His still-voiced counsel, Ibegan to plead with the Lord. In an effort to show my sincerity, I entered into one of those deal-making kind of prayers: "Lord, I'll give up this and this and I'll do that and that if you will only get me out of this mess!" It was then that I realized my legs had stopped trembling, my breathing had slowed, and a peace had replaced the panic. My group had found a way up the slope, and though it was the most treacherous and steepest part and required greater strength and effort, I was able to scramble up to the top with renewed confidence.<br><br>That was one of those moments in my life in which I received an infusion of spiritual reality and gained a sense of who I could really trust in every place and in every circumstance. From time to time we can have these powerful manifestations of the Lord's power and presence. They often come when we are sufficiently humbled by external forces, but they can come more often and more powerfully when we mature to true discipleship.<br><br>Through training and the development of faith, I take courage in the words of Nephi when he told his father Lehi:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Part of our mission on earth is to exercise agency and be tested to see if we can have the faith to "do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). I am reminded of Saul's experience after defeating the Amalekites. The Lord had commanded him to "utterly destroy" the Amalekites and all their possessions without exception. Instead, Saul brought back the best of the flocks and other spoils to make a sacrifice unto God (see 1 Samuel 15:1–22). He was chastened by the Lord through the prophet Samuel: "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1Samuel 15:22). Rather than follow the commandment precisely, Saul did what he thought best and what was intuitive.<br><br>An adequate test of our faith must necessarily be something that seems counterintuitive; otherwise we could "trust in the arm of flesh" (D&amp;amp;C 1:19), lean unto our "own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5), and make the right decision without exercising our faith in God. Early in our marriage, my dear wife, Ann, introduced a motto for our family that she has continually taught our children and has had to occasionally remind me of: "When the prophet speaks, the debate is over." This sound advice countermands all arguments, justifications, and rationales. Following this simple motto will always be to our benefit.<br><br>We must each be prepared ourselves and be about training our children and others for the trials that will surely come upon us. These trials will undoubtedly take many forms and may be faced alone or by the masses. In any event, our faith must be tested individually and independently. Few will face the unusual and high drama events of Moses, Paul, Nephi, or Joseph Smith in their trials. For most of the Saints, their trials will center in common elements of the gospel that when placed in unusual circumstances will seem impractical, illogical, orimpossible.<br><br>For some, paying an honest tithe may seem inordinately illogical when putting a roof overhead and bread on the table requires more than they have. As a bishop I have sat in counsel with people who when pressed to financial extremes chose not to pay their tithes. I have promised them the Lord's blessings, as promised through the prophet Malachi:<br><br><i>Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i>[Malachi 3:10]<br><br>While I had no fear in pledging the Lord's promise to them, I knew that they could not receive these great blessings if they could not live by faith and prove the Lord by paying tithing first.<br><br>Other people struggle to accept a call to serve in local wards and stakes or perhaps a full-time mission. These time liabilities may seem to come at an inappropriate or inconvenient time in life or at a perceived opportunity cost. I have found that my most productive years at work have been positively correlated with the years I have dedicated the greatest amount of time to service in the kingdom, for He has promised that "he that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken" (D&amp;amp;C88:83). If you want to find success in your chosen pursuits here at BYU and in the future, spend time seeking "first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>One of my father's greatest challenges was to accept a newly called bishop in our ward who was a neighbor and, according to my dad, an irrigation water thief--something not to take lightly in a desert environment! Dad struggled in his faith to allow this good, however imperfect man to serve him as God's representative.<br><br>Likewise, newly revealed truth has often caused faithful members to stumble when it has conflicted with their own ideology. Revelations by Joseph Smith relative to the restoration of the practice of plural marriage were a significant blow to the faith of many early Saints, as was the Manifesto that rescinded the practice, causing further fractionation in the Church. As a missionary in Newfoundland, Canada, I saw the 1978 revelation allowing the priesthood to be given to all worthy male members of the Church test the faith of members who struggled to accept this new revelation.<br><br>Regardless of the trial or the setting, it is important to know in advance whom you trust and whom you will follow, even if it seems counterintuitive to you. I take courage in the humble expression of one of my heroes, the great prophet Nephi, when he exclaimed:<br><br><i>O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless,</i>I know in whom I have trusted. [2 Nephi 4:17–19; emphasis added]<br><br>You see, that is the key: we are not perfect beings, but, whatever form it takes in our lives, the time will come when God, by His own voice or by that of His prophets, will command, "Into the burn!" and I bear witness to you that it is critical at that point in time to know whom you trust and whom you will follow, because our response to this command will define our faith in God and our place in the eternities. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Val Jo Anderson was chair of the BYU Department of Plant and Wildlife Sciences when this devotional address was given on 21 June 2011.</i><br><br><i>©Brigham Young University.

<br>
<br>
When I was young, my parents reminded me often that it is better to give than to receive. I used to hear this frequently at Christmastime. The statement is true enough, because the natural man is selfish, and learning how<i>not</i>to be selfish is one of life's most important pursuits.<br><br>But today I would like to discuss the reasons why it is important that we learn how to<i>receive</i>. Because this is a lesson that I am trying to learn myself, much of my address will be autobiographical.<br><br>When I graduated from high school, I had the opportunity to spend the summer and fall with two friends working in a factory in a city far from home. We attended the local branch of the Church. The members there thought we were an interesting bunch--three young men away from home, going to work in a factory each day doing things we weren't particularly good at, yet obviously surviving from day today.<br><br>We often received invitations from branch members to have dinner at their homes, and we always turned them down. It wasn't until years later that I realized that to do so was a big mistake. You see, we turned them down because we thought it was the noble thing to do.<i>We</i>had sufficient finances,<i>we</i>could take care of ourselves, and<i>we</i>didn't want to inconvenience anyone. We didn't realize at the time that in not accepting invitations to dinner, we were missing out on good experiences and fellowship with kindly Latter-day Saints. But, more important, we were depriving others of the blessing of serving us, and we were depriving ourselves of the blessing of<i>receiving</i>their service. Our real issue, of course, was pride. We were too proud to receive service from others who wished simply to bless our lives.<br><br>It is remarkable how often the scriptures teach that we must receive. For example, when we are confirmed members of the Church, we are told to "receive" the Holy Ghost. We cannot compel or conjure the Spirit's presence; we can only<i>receive</i>what has been freely offered. Likewise, the verb commonly used with the phrase "remission of sin" is<i>receive</i>. We can't<i>make</i>a remission of sin, earn it, attain it, or create it. Our faithfulness is required, but it is Jesus' agency that brings the remission of our sins to pass. And, finally, we are to be perfect, but we cannot perfect ourselves. The Book of Mormon teaches that we are to be "perfected" in Christ, something that is done "by his grace" (Moroni 10:32). The passive voice shows that we are not the doers of the verb but the receivers. Indeed, any notion that we have of personal spiritual accomplishment or self-sufficiency is shattered as we read the scriptures and come to a better understanding of the gospel. Peter learned this lesson the hard way when he refused Jesus' humble act of servitude, saying, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus responded, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" (John 13:8).<br><br>Once I was in Turkey with a busload of American tourists. One day we were sitting in our bus after a visit, waiting to continue our trip. Next to where we were parked was a fruit-and-vegetable shop. As we were sitting in the bus, I noticed a boy about ten years old leave the shop and board the bus with a box of fresh cucumbers to give to the people on the bus. Middle Eastern cucumbers are sweet and delicious, and people eat them for snacks. The boy had dressed up for his mission to our bus with his suit coat on and his hair freshly combed and still moist from the combing. I was touched by the kindness of the boy and his shopkeeper father for providing this treat as an act of love and hospitality for the foreigners in their town. It was in keeping with what I have grown to love so much from the culture of Muslims in the Middle East. The smiling boy walked from the front of the bus to the back, offering the delicious treats along the way. There were enough for all. As he began to walk back to the front of the bus, someone offered him money, which he refused; getting money was not the boy's objective in bringing the cucumbers. The American became insistent and eventually stuffed some money into the boy's pocket, much to the boy's embarrassment and dismay. As he tried to escape to the front of the bus, others followed suit, putting money in his pockets or throwing it in his box. As he made his way to the front exit, I noticed his expression change from happiness to disappointment to embarrassment to sadness. By the time he arrived at the front, he was in tears.<br><br>I was heartbroken and embarrassed. The boy was deeply hurt. His act of love had been prostituted into an act of business.<br><br>But the people on the bus--all fine people--felt good about themselves; they felt justified. Someone had provided them with a service for which they needed to pay. They had paid their own way, and they didn't want to owe anything to anybody.<br><br>I have found that the philosophy of self-sufficiency that underlies these instincts runs deep in many Latter-day Saints. Some think, "Idon't need any help. I can take care of myself, and everybody else should do the same." This idea forms the basis of the political and social feelings of many, and it has caused not a few Latter-day Saints to not only miss blessings in life but also to misunderstand the nature of the gospel.<br><br>In fact, God has created us to be<i>dependent</i>on others. And "dependent" means that we must quickly learn that others have things to offer us without which we cannot live. It is true that many of the Lord's creations never see a parent and are able to be self-sufficient the moment they hatch out of an egg. But not so with God's children. The most helpless creature on the planet is a newly born human, who could not survive for more than a few hours without immediate care. Newborn humans are programmed from birth to receive--and to do so for years. We remain dependent on others for the basics of life for a long time and usually aren't financially independent until our mid-twenties or later. Along the way, our quest is to continue receiving where we must, but to gain independence so eventually we can do more for ourselves. The conflict between our dependence and our imagined self-sufficiency starts early. Children, still very dependent on their parents, do things to demonstrate their independence. This was the source of most of the traumas you had with your parents while you were growing up.<br><br>Some of the greatest lessons of life, and the sweetest experiences, result from the giving and receiving between parent and child. Watching my children learn to walk was one of the best experiences of my life. Watching them learn to drive was not. Watching my children learn to speak, to read, and to make decisions; participating in their baptisms and ordinations; and witnessing their marriages made me a better person and welded our hearts together. And seeing them go off on their own, with various levels of independence, has been a blessing both for parent and child.<br><br>But we remain dependent in many ways throughout our lives. Sister Jackson and our four adult daughters are best friends and have frequent outings together. I still miss my parents, both of whom passed away in recent years, and even my grandparents, who died forty years ago. The emotional bonds of mutual dependence within families are part of God's plan and are not intended to go away, even with death.<br><br>Sometimes, when things go very wrong, we have a clear understanding of our need for others and know that we have no choice but to ask for and receive help. On those occasions our plight is obvious.<br><br>Years ago, I was with a friend from another university driving through the deserts of Jordan looking at obscure archaeological sites. In the middle of nowhere we had a flat tire. We soon found that there wasn't a workable spare in our rental car. This was in the days prior to mobile phones, so we had no option but to ask for help from total strangers. We jacked up the car, took off the tire, and stood by the side of the road. The very first vehicle that came by stopped and took us in. It was a small local bus. The occupants of the bus immediately got into a vigorous discussion about where the nearest tire shop was located. When they sorted it out, the van took us out of its way to a tire shop in a nearby town. The driver would accept no fare for our transportation. The repairman fixed the tire and wouldn't accept money for the repair job. We then stood out on the highway with our tire, and again the first vehicle that came by picked us up and took us back to our car. We put the tire back on and went on with our trip.<br><br>The next morning we headed off again for another day of exploration. History repeated itself. We soon had another flat tire with no spare. We jacked up the car, took off the tire, and stood by the side of the road. The first vehicle that came along stopped, let us in, and took us to a tire shop in the next town. The repairman fixed the tire. We then stood out on the road with our tire, and again the first vehicle that came along picked us up and took us back to our car. We put the tire back on and went on with our trip.<br><br>Now, you are probably thinking one or both of the following thoughts:<br><br>Number 1: Was there ever really a time in which there were no mobile phones?<br><br>Number 2: This story would never happen in Provo.<br><br>But let me add a few other thoughts. What if we had been unwilling to accept the reality that we had a serious need? Would we still be sitting in that car today? What if we had been unwilling to receive help? What if we had refused to accept the generosity of those who gave us assistance? After all, we received all four rides and one of the repair jobs for free. What if we had concluded that Arab generosity was silly and old-fashioned and we didn't want to have anything to do with it?<br><br>Well, we had no other options, we knew that we were in need of help, and we were smart enough to accept it when it came.<br><br>Most of our needs are not as obvious, and so we are sometimes deluded into thinking we can work things out on our own. What a tragedy it is when those occasions involve the things that matter most.<br><br>I have witnessed in my life that God often answers our prayers through other people. When we earnestly pray for help, someone might cross our path at the right time to say the right word, lift a burden we are bearing, or simply provide conversation and companionship. Such events are usually unexpected, but they<i>aren't</i>coincidences. We have all heard stories about someone being prompted to contact someone, knowing, "She needs me," or "He's in trouble," thereby averting some sorrow or tragedy. But most of the time the promptings are much more subtle, and the earthly ministering angel doesn't even know that he or she is being prompted. Either way the result is a miracle. The New Testament tells us that "some have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:2)--a reminder that we are always on the Lord's errand to bless others and that others are on the Lord's errand to bless us.<br><br>I learn two things from such experiences. First, I need always to be sensitive to the needs of people around me. What if<i>I</i>am to be the answer to someone's prayer or someone's need and I'm not sensitive to the prompting or I'm too preoccupied with my own concerns or too selfish to want to give of myself? I suspect that this has happened before.<br><br>Second, I need to be humble enough to receive of the kindness of others. How foolish would it be of me to ask the Lord's blessing and then turn down those He sends to respond to my prayers?<br><br>Learning how to receive is an antidote to pride. King Benjamin asked, "Are we not all beggars?" The answer is yes. He continued, "Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have?" (Mosiah 4:19). Again the answer is yes. A foolish person will consider such talk to be quaint, but a wise person will recognize this to be the foundation of our lives. King Benjamin taught how thoroughly we are dependent on God:<br><br><i>O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you ...</i><br><br><i>... and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i><br><br><i>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments;</i>[and]<i>if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you....</i><br><br><i>... He doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i><br><br><i>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? Ianswer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</i>[Mosiah 2:19–22, 24–25]<br><br>How are we to respond to this situation? King Benjamin said that we can't even boast of the dirt we're made of because we don't own the dirt! God creates us, preserves us from day to day, gives us breath so we can do what we want, and supports us from one moment to the next. We can't do any of this on our own, and yet we can't repay Him for any of it either. Moreover, when we do what He asks us to do--obey His commandments--what does He do? He immediately blesses us again and hence pays us, which places us even more in His debt.<br><br>We can't pay God back. We can never be "even" with Him. We will always owe Him. If you want life to be fair, you have come to the wrong planet. In the long run--the eternal long run--we all get much, much more than we deserve.<br><br>The word<i>grace</i>means service freely rendered. In a gospel context, grace is what the Father and the Son do for us that we cannot do for ourselves. The list is very long. Think about our eternal existence. We have a spirit that we did not create; it is a gift of grace from God. We have a physical body that we did not create; it is a gift of grace from God, brought to pass by the service of others. We cannot baptize ourselves, ordain ourselves, bless ourselves, endow ourselves, or seal ourselves; all are gifts of grace from God, brought about by the service of others. We cannot take away our own sins; the Atonement is a gift of grace from God, brought about through Jesus Christ. Likewise, we cannot resurrect ourselves; that will be a gift of grace from God. And we cannot clothe ourselves with eternal glory; that also will be a gift of grace from God.<br><br>Indeed, the gospel teaches us that we cannot bring ourselves to heaven. If we want to have a happy eternity, we need to receive the atoning work that only Jesus Christ can do. We must admit that there is no way we can pay Him for it, and there is nothing we can give Him to make us "even." The only thing He asks in return is that we keep His commandments. And when we do, He then blesses us more.<br><br>Thus King Benjamin asks, "Of what have ye to boast?" "Can ye say aught of yourselves? Ianswer you, Nay."<br><br>So what are we to do? The point is that we are to admit that this inequity exists. We are to<i>receive</i>this moral imbalance and receive it gladly, embrace it, welcome it, and feel good about it. But as King Benjamin said, feeling good about it is not to boast but to be thankful for it. We don't need to be embarrassed about our debt to our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. Our Father in Heaven will<i>always</i>be our God, and Jesus will<i>always</i>be our Savior. Through all eternity we will sing praises to Their names and acknowledge our indebtedness to Them. In this life we need to be truly and deeply thankful. Our thankfulness will motivate us to obediently keep Their commandments--not out of guilt or debt or fear, but out of genuine love for Them. We keep God's commandments and love Him, as the apostle John taught, because He loved us first (see 1 John 4:19). And then He blesses us more.<br><br>How, then, do we translate this attitude of receiving into our relationships with other people? I suggest that we learn to ask for help when we need it, that we receive it when it's offered, that we not feel guilty about doing so, and that we recognize that in serving us, others are the Lord's ministering angels doing His work. Here are some of the events that have helped me learn this principle.<br><br>When I was in graduate school, my wife and I hosted other couples in our home for dinner from time to time. We soon found that the instinct of many people was that if we invited<i>them</i>to dinner, they owed<i>us</i>a dinner in return. We enjoyed the fellowship, but this made the dinners a trade, which wasn't what we had in mind. After some consideration, we changed our strategy and told people we invited that if they wanted to return the favor, they should do so by inviting<i>others</i>to their home instead of us, thus spreading the blessing of hospitality. I thought it was a good idea, but we probably offended a lot of ward members.<br><br>Sister Jackson and I are aware that other people pray in our behalf. In some ways, prayers offered in our behalf by others may be more powerful than those we pray for ourselves. We know and feel the power of such prayers, and doing so has motivated us to reach out in our own prayers beyond our own small circle in ways we never did before.<br><br>We live in a very loving neighborhood in which blessing the lives of others is part of the day-to-day culture. Once or twice a year we have a neighborhood picnic on our street. On one such occasion about a dozen years ago, I was sitting in a lawn chair eating. I was having a hard time getting my cup of lemonade to sit securely on the grass next to my chair without it tipping over. Noticing my plight, a little girl from the neighborhood, about five or six years old, ran over and volunteered to sit on the ground next to my chair and hold my cup steady on the grass. It would have been a lot less work for both of us if I had just drunk the lemonade, but I couldn't resist the purehearted offer of service. Every so often I would tell her I needed a drink. She would hand me the cup, I would drink, and then she would put it back on the grass and hold it steady until I needed itagain.<br><br>Every Saturday my bishop works his way down our street edging people's lawns. What a tremendous image it provides for us to see this good, humble man serving his neighbors in this way. I didn't ask him to do our lawn. He just showed up one day and did it. At first I was embarrassed to see him working in my front yard. He's a very busy man with much to do, and I hadn't edged our lawn since the 1980s. But receiving his service has been a blessing far beyond the appearance of our yard. And the beautiful, straight edge of our lawn is a reminder of a service freely rendered and gladly received.<br><br>In my patriarchal blessing I was told to counsel with my mother and receive guidance from her. I found throughout my life that when I did so, I was blessed with wisdom beyond my own abilities. Likewise, when I was struggling with a health issue several years ago, I received a blessing in which I was told in clear language, "Listen to your wife." I apparently didn't do so very well, because six months later, in a similar blessing under the hands of someone else, I was told again, "Listen to your wife." Being willing to receive her counsel was an important part of the healing process. On that second occasion I was prompted also to finally receive the counsel of my doctor. My stubbornness in thinking I could diagnose myself was not serving me well.<br><br>Life has many such occasions in which we need the intervention of others who have a clearer vision of things than we do. Our challenge is to be humble enough to receive what they have to offer.<br><br>Sometimes life is not wonderful, and we have to learn to receive hard things as well as happy things. It is often the case that in receiving life's most difficult experiences, we grow and benefit the most. One of the great lessons we can learn from the Book of Mormon is that there will be times when good, worthy people find themselves in bad circumstances, not of their own making, that are beyond their ability to remedy on their own. Consider these two passages:<br><br>"And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there was no way that they could deliver themselves" (Mosiah 21:5). Later we read, "And he did exhort ... all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them" (Mosiah 25:16).<br><br>As in the Book of Mormon, when the Lord provides deliverance, or<i>any</i>blessing for us, He often does it through our fellow human beings, sent to serve in His stead if we are willing to receive them. These earthly ministering angels are types of Jesus Christ, the ultimate Ministering Angel. He stands at the door and knocks--sometimes in person and sometimes through the service of others. But<i>we</i>are the ones who need to open the door and receive His blessings. That we may do so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kent P.

<h1>e Is Sufficient - Brad Wilcox - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be here with my wife, Debi, and my two youngest children--who are currently attending BYU--and several other family members who have come to be with us.<br><br>It is an honor to be invited to speak to you today. Several years ago I received an invitation to speak at Women's Conference. When I told my wife, she asked, "What have they asked you to speak on?"<br><br>I was so excited that I got my words mixed up and said, "They want me to speak about changing strengths into weaknesses."<br><br>She thought for a minute and said, "Well, they've got the right man for the job!"<br><br>She's correct about that. I could give a whale of a talk on that subject, but I think today I had better go back to the original topic and speak about changing weaknesses into strengths and about how the grace of Jesus Christ is sufficient (see<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ether 12:27</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17.8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 17:8</a>, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 12:9</a></span>)--sufficient to cover us, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes.<br><h2><b>Christ's Grace Is Sufficient to Cover Us</b></h2><br>A BYU student once came to me and asked if we could talk. I said, "Of course. How can I help you?"<br><br>She said, "I just don't get grace."<br><br>I responded, "What is it that you don't understand?"<br><br>She said, "I know I need to do my best and then Jesus does the rest, but I can't even do my best."<br><br>She then went on to tell me all the things she <i>should</i> be doing because she's a Mormon that she wasn't doing.<br><br>She continued, "I know that I have to do my part and then Jesus makes up the difference and fills the gap that stands between my part and perfection. But who fills the gap that stands between where I am now and my part?"<br><br>She then went on to tell me all the things that she <i>shouldn't</i> be doing because she's a Mormon, but she was doing them anyway.<br><br>Finally I said, "Jesus doesn't make <i>up</i> the difference. Jesus makes <i>all</i> the difference. Grace is not about filling gaps. It is about filling us."<br><br>Seeing that she was still confused, I took a piece of paper and drew two dots--one at the top representing God and one at the bottom representing us. I then said, "Go ahead. Draw the line. How much is our part? How much is Christ's part?"<br><br>She went right to the center of the page and began to draw a line. Then, considering what we had been speaking about, she went to the bottom of the page and drew a line just above the bottom dot.<br><br>I said, "Wrong."<br><br>She said, "I knew it was higher. I should have just drawn it, because I knew it."<br><br>I said, "No. The truth is, there is no line. Jesus filled the whole space. He paid our debt in full. He didn't pay it all except for a few coins. He paid it all. It is finished."<br><br>She said, "Right! Like I don't have to do anything?"<br><br>"Oh no," I said, "you have plenty to do, but it is not to fill that gap. We will all be resurrected. We will all go back to God's presence. What is left to be determined by our obedience is what kind of body we plan on being resurrected with and how comfortable we plan to be in God's presence and how long we plan to stay there."<br><br>Christ asks us to show faith in Him, repent, make and keep covenants, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. By complying, we are not paying the demands of justice--not even the smallest part. Instead, we are showing appreciation for what Jesus Christ did by using it to live a life like His. Justice requires immediate perfection or a punishment when we fall short. Because Jesus took that punishment, He can offer us the chance for ultimate perfection (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 5:48</a></span>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 Nephi 12:48</a>) and help us reach that goal. He can forgive what justice never could, and He can turn to us now with His own set of requirements (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 2:7</a>;<span style="color: #33cccc;"> <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 Nephi 9:20</a></span>).<br><br>"So what's the difference?" the girl asked. "Whether our efforts are required by justice or by Jesus, they are still required."<br><br>"True," I said, "but they are required for a different purpose. Fulfilling Christ's requirements is like paying a mortgage instead of rent or like making deposits in a savings account instead of paying off debt. You still have to hand it over every month, but it is for a totally different reason."<br><h2><b>Christ's Grace Is Sufficient to Transform Us</b></h2><br>Christ's arrangement with us is similar to a mom providing music lessons for her child. Mom pays the piano teacher. How many know what I am talking about? Because Mom pays the debt in full, she can turn to her child and ask for something. What is it? Practice! Does the child's practice pay the piano teacher? No. Does the child's practice repay Mom for paying the piano teacher? No. Practicing is how the child shows appreciation for Mom's incredible gift. It is how he takes advantage of the amazing opportunity Mom is giving him to live his life at a higher level. Mom's joy is found not in getting repaid but in seeing her gift used--seeing her child improve. And so she continues to call for practice, practice, practice.<br><br>If the child sees Mom's requirement of practice as being too overbearing ("Gosh, Mom, why do I need to practice? None of the other kids have to practice! I'm just going to be a professional baseball player anyway!"), perhaps it is because he doesn't yet see with mom's eyes. He doesn't see how much better his life could be if he would choose to live on a higher plane.<br><br>In the same way, because Jesus has paid justice, He can now turn to us and say, "Follow me" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 4:19</a></span>), "Keep my commandments" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 14:15</a>). If we see His requirements as being way too much to ask ("Gosh! None of the other Christians have to pay tithing! None of the other Christians have to go on missions, serve in callings, and do temple work!"), maybe it is because we do not yet see through Christ's eyes. We have not yet comprehended what He is trying to make of us.<br><br>Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The great Mediator asks for our repentance <i>not</i> because we must 'repay' him in exchange for his paying our debt to justice, but because repentance initiates a developmental process that, with the Savior's help, leads us along the path to a saintly character" (<i>The Broken Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 149; emphasis in original).<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said, referring to President Spencer W. Kimball's explanation, "The repenting sinner must suffer for his sins, but this suffering has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is <i>change</i>" (<i>The Lord's Way</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1991], 223; emphasis in original). Let's put that in terms of our analogy: The child must practice the piano, but this practice has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is change.<br><br>I have born-again Christian friends who say to me, "You Mormons are trying to <i>earn </i>your way to heaven."<br><br>I say, "No, we are not earning heaven. We are <i>learning</i> heaven. We are preparing for it (seeD&amp;amp;C 78:7). We are practicing for it."<br><br>They ask me, "Have you been saved by grace?"<br><br>I answer, "Yes. Absolutely, totally, completely, thankfully--yes!"<br><br>Then I ask them a question that perhaps they have not fully considered: "Have you been <i>changed</i> by grace?" They are so excited about being saved that maybe they are not thinking enough about what comes next. They are so happy the debt is paid that they may not have considered why the debt existed in the first place. Latter-day Saints know not only what Jesus has saved us from but also what He has saved us for. As my friend Brett Sanders puts it, "A life impacted by grace eventually begins to look like Christ's life." As my friend Omar Canals puts it, "While many Christians view Christ's suffering as only a huge favor He did for us, Latter-day Saints also recognize it as a huge investment He made in us." As Moroni puts it, grace isn't just about being saved. It is also about becoming like the Savior (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moroni 7:48</a>).<br><br>The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can live after we die but that we can live more abundantly (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.10?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 10:10</a>). The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can be cleansed and consoled but that we can be transformed (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8</a>). Scriptures make it clear that no unclean thing can dwell with God (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.26?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 40:26</a></span>), but, brothers and sisters, no unchanged thing will even want to.<br><br>I know a young man who just got out of prison--again. Each time two roads diverge in a yellow wood, he takes the wrong one--every time. When he was a teenager dealing with every bad habit a teenage boy can have, I said to his father, "We need to get him to EFY." Ihave worked with that program since 1985. Iknow the good it can do.<br><br>His dad said, "I can't afford that."<br><br>I said, "I can't afford it either, but you put some in, and I'll put some in, and then we'll go to my mom, because she is a real softy."<br><br>We finally got the kid to EFY, but how long do you think he lasted? Not even a day. By the end of the first day he called his mother and said, "Get me out of here!" Heaven will not be heaven for those who have not chosen to be heavenly.<br><br>In the past I had a picture in my mind of what the final judgment would be like, and it went something like this: Jesus standing there with a clipboard and Brad standing on the other side of the room nervously looking at Jesus.<br><br>Jesus checks His clipboard and says, "Oh, shoot, Brad. You missed it by two points."<br><br>Brad begs Jesus, "Please, check the essay question one more time! There have to be two points you can squeeze out of that essay." That's how I always saw it.<br><br>But the older I get, and the more I understand this wonderful <i>plan of redemption,</i> the more I realize that in the final judgment it will <i>not</i> be the unrepentant sinner begging Jesus, "Let me stay." No, he will probably be saying, "Get me out of here!" Knowing Christ's character, I believe that if anyone is going to be begging on that occasion, it would probably be Jesus begging the unrepentant sinner, "Please, choose to stay. Please, use my Atonement--not just to be cleansed but to be changed so that you <i>want</i> to stay."<br><br>The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can go home but that--miraculously--we can feel at home there. If Christ did not require faith and repentance, then there would be no desire to change. Think of your friends and family members who have chosen to live without faith and without repentance. They don't want to change. They are not trying to abandon sin and become comfortable with God. Rather, they are trying to abandon God and become comfortable with sin. If Jesus did not require covenants and bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, then there would be no way to change. We would be left forever with only willpower, with no access to His power. If Jesus did not require endurance to the end, then there would be no internalization of those changes over time. They would forever be surface and cosmetic rather than sinking inside us and becoming part of us--part of who we are. Put simply, if Jesus didn't require practice, then we would never become pianists.<br><h2><b>Christ's Grace Is Sufficient to Help Us</b></h2><br>"But Brother Wilcox, don't you realize how hard it is to practice? I'm just not very good at the piano. I hit a lot of wrong notes. It takes me forever to get it right." Now wait. Isn't that all part of the learning process? When a young pianist hits a wrong note, we don't say he is not worthy to keep practicing. We don't expect him to be flawless. We just expect him to keep trying. Perfection may be his ultimate goal, but for now we can be content with progress in the right direction. Why is this perspective so easy to see in the context of learning piano but so hard to see in the context of learning heaven?<br><br>Too many are giving up on the Church because they are tired of constantly feeling like they are falling short. They have tried in the past, but they always feel like they are just not good enough. They don't understand grace.<br><br>There are young women who know they are daughters of a Heavenly Father who loves them, and they love Him. Then they graduate from high school, and the values they memorized are put to the test. They slip up. They let things go too far, and suddenly they think it is all over. These young women don't understand grace.<br><br>There are young men who grow up their whole lives singing, "I hope they call me on a mission," and then they do actually grow a foot or two and flake out completely. They get their Eagles, graduate from high school, and go away to college. Then suddenly these young men find out how easy it is to <i>not</i> be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, or reverent. They mess up. They say, "I'll never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "I'll never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "This is stupid. I will never do it again." And then they do it. The guilt is almost unbearable. They don't dare talk to a bishop. Instead, they hide. They say, "I can't do this Mormon thing. I've tried, and the expectations are just way too high." So they quit. These young men don't understand grace.<br><br>I know returned missionaries who come home and slip back into bad habits they thought were over. They break promises made before God, angels, and witnesses, and they are convinced there is no hope for them now. They say, "Well, I've blown it. There is no use in even trying any more." Seriously? These young people have spent entire missions teaching people about Jesus Christ and His Atonement, and now they think there is no hope for them? These returned missionaries don't understand grace.<br><br>I know young married couples who find out after the sealing ceremony is over that marriage requires adjustments. The pressures of life mount, and stress starts taking its toll financially, spiritually, and even sexually. Mistakes are made. Walls go up. And pretty soon these husbands and wives are talking with divorce lawyers rather than talking with each other. These couples don't understand grace.<br><br>In all of these cases there should never be just two options: perfection or giving up. When learning the piano, are the only options performing at Carnegie Hall or quitting? No. Growth and development take time. Learning takes time. When we understand grace, we understand that God is long-suffering, that change is a process, and that repentance is a pattern in our lives. When we understand grace, we understand that the blessings of Christ's Atonement are continuous and His strength is perfect in our weakness (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2Corinthians 12:9</a></span>). When we understand grace, we can, as it says in the Doctrine and Covenants, "continue in patience until [we] areperfected" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 67:13</a></span>).<br><br>One young man wrote me the following e-mail: "I know God has all power, and I know He will help me if I'm worthy, but I'm just never worthy enough to ask for His help. I want Christ's grace, but I always find myself stuck in the same self-defeating and impossible position: no work, no grace."<br><br>I wrote him back and testified with all my heart that Christ is not waiting at the finish line once we have done "all we can do" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 25:23</a></span>). He is with us every step of the way.<br><br>Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The Savior's gift of grace to us is not necessarily limited in time to 'after' all we can do. We may receive his grace before, during and after the time when we expend our own efforts" (<i>The Broken Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 155). So grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through the tunnel. Grace is not achieved somewhere down the road. It is received right here and right now. It is not a finishing touch; it is the Finisher's touch (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 12:2</a></span>).<br><br>In twelve days we celebrate Pioneer Day. The first company of Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Their journey wasdifficult and challenging; still, they sang:<br><br><i>Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;</i><br><i>But with joy wend your way.</i><br><i>Though hard to you this journey may appear,</i><br><i>Grace shall be as your day.</i><br>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/come-come-ye-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Come, Come, Ye Saints," <i>Hymns,</i> 2002, no. 30</a></span>]<br><br>"Grace shall be as your day"--what an interesting phrase. We have all sung it hundreds of times, but have we stopped to consider what it means? "Grace shall be as your day": grace shall be like a day. As dark as night may become, we can always count on the sun coming up. As dark as our trials, sins, and mistakes may appear, we can always have confidence in the grace of Jesus Christ. Do we earn a sunrise? No. Do we have to be worthy of a chance to begin again? No. We just have to accept these blessings and take advantage of them. As sure as each brand-new day, grace--the enabling power of Jesus Christ--is constant. Faithful pioneers knew they were not alone. The task ahead of them was never as great as the power behind them.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The grace of Christ is sufficient--sufficient to cover our debt, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes. The Book of Mormon teaches us to rely solely on "the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2Nephi 2:8</a></span>). As we do, we do not discover--as some Christians believe--that Christ requires nothing of us. Rather, we discover the reason He requires so much and the strength to do all He asks (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippians 4:13</a></span>). Grace is not the absence of God's high expectations. Grace is the presence of God's power (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/1.37?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 1:37</a></span>).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said the following:<br><br><i>Now may I speak . . . to those buffeted by false insecurity, who, though laboring devotedly in the Kingdom, have recurring feelings of falling forever short. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This feeling of inadequacy is . . . normal. There is no way the Church can honestly describe where we must yet go and what we must yet do without creating a sense of immense distance. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This is a gospel of grand expectations, but God's grace is sufficient for each of us.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CR</i>, October 1976, 14, 16</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Notwithstanding My Weakness," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1976, 12, 14</a></span>]<br><br>With Elder Maxwell, I testify that God's grace is sufficient. Jesus' grace is sufficient. It is enough. It is all we need. Oh, young people, don't quit. Keep trying. Don't look for escapes and excuses. Look for the Lord and His perfect strength. Don't search for someone to blame. Search for someone to help you. Seek Christ, and, as you do, I promise you will feel the enabling power we call His amazing grace. Ileave this testimony and all of my love--for Ido love you. As God is my witness, I love the youth of this church. I believe in you. I'm pulling for you. And I'm not the only one. Parents are pulling for you, leaders are pulling for you, and prophets are pulling for you. And Jesus is pulling <i>with</i> you. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brad Wilcox was serving as a member of the Sunday School General Board of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as a BYU associate professor in the Department of Teacher Education in the David O.

<br>
<br>
A couple of months ago when I was asked to speak at today's devotional, I was instructed to visit the university photographer's office to have a picture taken for use in publicizing this event. During the course of the picture taking, one of the student employees asked me what I teach here at the university.<br><br>I answered, "I'm an accounting professor."<br><br>After a short pause she said, "Oh, so it's going to be a boring devotional!"<br><br>I promised her I wouldn't talk about accounting and that I would do my best not to be boring, and she promised that she would be here--so, I won't name names, but, good sister, I hope you're out there!<br><br>When I was a child, my mother would invariably call out to me as I walked out the door, "Douglas, remember who you are!"<br><br>I answered, "Okay, Mom," and off I would go.<br><br>There were times in my youth when challenges and temptations arose when I made certain choices that were critically important to my personal growth--mainly because I did not want to disappoint my mother. I knew she loved me. I knew she would love me no matter what I did, but I knew what she expected of me. When I did make mistakes, she freely forgave and never withheld her love. Instead, she reminded me of who I am, encouraged me to move forward, and gave me the strength to do better.<br><br>But, looking back, I don't think I truly and deeply understood just who it was that I was supposed to remember that I was!<br><br>In May of 1984 I was finishing the last full day of my mission to the wonderful people of Uruguay. My shoes were worn, my feet were calloused, and my 100-percent polyester suits had taken on an almost mirror-like shine. Some of you might remember those--we called them our "steel-wool" suits. People had to shield their eyes when missionaries stepped out into the sunlight! I have to say that for my two sons who are offering the prayers today, the suits they took on their missions are much nicer than the missionary suits of thirty years ago. Well, back to the story. My bags were packed and I was in the mission home preparing to catch my flight home the next day.<br><br>As I waited for my final interview with my mission president, I was reflecting back on my experiences--the highs, the lows, the joys, and the sorrows. I had worked hard! I had given it my all. But at that moment I was focused on my shortcomings--the things that I wished I had done better. In the middle of my reflecting, President Waldo P. Call invited me into his office. He immediately asked me how I felt about my mission.<br><br>I told him that I had worked hard, that I had given it everything I had, but that I wished I could go back--go back in time. I would be so much more effective if I could just do it all overagain.<br><br>His answer did not comfort me much at the time. He said, "No, you wouldn't." And then he went on to explain: "If you could turn back the clock, you would do things the very same way. You wouldn't have had the experiences that you've learned so much from--you would have to start all over again." And then he finished with a rhetorical question: "That's the point of it all, isn't it?"<br><br>I pondered that counsel, but at the time I did not fully understand that it held one of the keys to a fulfilling and joyful life.<br><br>I had worked diligently; I had put my whole heart into my mission. But, at least for a time, I let the fact that I was not as capable at the beginning or the middle as I had become toward the end diminish my appreciation for the life-changing lessons I had learned and undermine the joy I could and should have experienced on completing an imperfect but honorable full-time mission.<br><br>In the succeeding years since that time--perhaps especially in the past few as I have served as bishop of my home ward in Springville--I have learned a different and, Ithink, clearer view of the nature and purpose of life. I have developed a deeper understanding of how our Father in Heaven sees you and me, our weaknesses and our shortcomings, and even the mistakes we make along the way. This perspective has made my life so much more joyful and so much more fulfilling! I hope my thoughts may be helpful to some of you.<br><br>Let's start with some basics. Elder L.Tom Perry said in the October 2006 general conference:<br><br><i>There are two purposes for life in mortality. The first is that we might gain experiences that we could not obtain in any other way. The second is to obtain tabernacles of flesh and bones. Both of these purposes are vital to the existence of man. We are now being tried and tested to see if we will do all the things the Lord has commanded us to do. These commandments are the principles and ordinances of the gospel, and they constitute the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every principle and ordinance has a bearing</i>upon the whole purpose of our testing, which is to prepare us to return to our Heavenly Father and become more like Him. ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/11/the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">The Plan of Salvation</span></a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 71; emphasis added]<br><br>Note the first purpose--to "gain experiences that we could not obtain in any other way." Let's consider that thought for a moment. Instead of sending us here to go through this difficult and challenging earthly existence, where our loving Heavenly Father knew we would suffer and make mistakes, why didn't He just gather us all around and teach us what we needed to learn? I believe John Stuart Mill, the great British philosopher and economist, touched on an important principle when he said, "There are many truths of which the full meaning cannot be realized until personal experience has brought it home" ("On Liberty," chapter 2 [1859]). There are simply things we need to experience in order to understand.<br><br>You'll also note that Elder Perry said that this life is a probationary period--a period of testing or trial. If we prove ourselves during this time, we will be welcomed back into our Father's presence, where He will bless us with all that He has. But, as Jacob warned the people of Nephi, "Wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the commandments of God . . . and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state!" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.27?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">2 Nephi 9:27</span></a>).<br><br>These are gospel truths. We have been both promised and warned. But understanding just who we are and what it is that we are to prove during our probation is important both to our success and to the joy that we will experience along the way.<br><br>Some people I've encountered seem to believe that we are here to prove to God, to everyone around us, and even to ourselves just how perfect we are--that we can and do live all of the gospel principles to their fullest, right from the start, never faltering!<br><br>There is danger in such a prideful perspective. Such a view may make us reluctant to admit our mistakes. When inevitably we do fall short, it becomes difficult for us to square our life view with the fact that we have weaknesses and have committed sin. It makes it hard for us to see clearly and acknowledge just where we are on the path of progress. It leads us to harshly judge and condemn ourselves and at the same time rationalize how and why our actions really don't disqualify us. It can lead us to try to hide our sins, which serves only to shade them from healing light. It can lead us to judge<i>others</i>harshly, crowding out the ability to develop the crowning virtue ofcharity.<br><br>Perhaps instead the Lord expects that we acknowledge that we are weak, that we have much to learn through the experiences we have, and that we make mistakes, and then prove to Him that we will repent and put our whole heart into doing better.<i>That we are here to humbly learn and grow and to make changes and turn to Him as we go is a liberating truth.</i>With such a view we will be more inclined to acknowledge and even accept what we are and where we are in our progress at any given point. Instead of trying to cover our sins, we will be inclined to search ourselves, to seek out where we fall short, and to reach out for help in moving forward. And, instead of perpetually berating ourselves for past shortcomings, we can rejoice in forward movement.<br><br>As a concerned and loving father, Alma the Younger carefully explained the plan of salvation and the laws of justice and mercy to his son Corianton, who had fallen into serious transgression. Alma explained that, as a result of the fallen state of mankind, "there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Alma 42:4</span></a>).<br><br>We see every day in the world around us that the natural order of things is for offspring to grow and to learn from their experiences and, eventually, to become like their parents. And we have been taught by prophets that this is an eternal principle--it is one of the purposes for our earthly existence.<br><br>The missionary guide<i>Preach My Gospel</i>teaches:<br><br><i>God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth.</i>We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.[<a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;"><i>PMG,</i>48</span></a>; emphasis added]<br><br>Having a deep understanding of this principle is so important! Armed with this truth, we can more fully understand how our Father in Heaven sees us, and in turn we can see ourselves more clearly: "We are literally His children, and He loves us."<br><br>Those of us who are parents know what it means to love our young children--we know just how deep and committed that love truly is! We love our children more than they can possibly understand. We would do anything in our power to help them to learn and to grow and to become happy individuals, experiencing joy,<i>fulfilling their potential.</i>But we understand that they are not yet fully developed, not yet comprehending all the principles they will eventually need to know--perhaps not yet having the maturity or strength to perfectly live the principles they<i>do</i>understand, not yet having the depth that will come through enduring trials and challenges. And of course we do not reject them just because they are not yet completely mature or developed--we love them<i>and we know what they can become.</i><br><br>Not long ago a youth in my ward came to my office for an annual interview. In the course of our discussion I asked this young man why he thought Heavenly Father wants us to live the principles of the gospel and how He feels when we fall short. He didn't even pause--his answer was, "God has the right to tell us what to do, and He's angry when we don't do it."<br><br>I tried to teach this good young man that the scriptures and our modern prophets suggesta different perspective. I tried to paint for him a picture of a loving Father standing with His arms stretched out, pleading with us to live the principles of the gospel to the best of our ability, so that He can bless us.<br><br>The Savior asked His disciples: "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/11.11?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Luke 11:11</span></a>).<br><br>Then He brought the lesson home: "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give good gifts, through the Holy Spirit, to them who ask him" (JST, Luke 11:14).<br><br>There is such beauty in this! The relationship that exists between loving earthly parents and their children is a model for us to understand how our Father in Heaven sees us! Except, of course, that His love is more perfect and complete than that of even the best earthly parents.<br><br>We are God's sons and daughters. He is literally the Father of our spirits. He loves each of us. He wants you to grow and develop and learn so that He can bless you and so that you can eventually become like Him. Please do not let yourself believe that you are an exception!<br><br>He will encourage you, even plead with you, to get back on your feet when you stumble, to try, try again. And He will cleanse you and heal you if you will turn to Him.<br><br>The Savior taught that the first and great commandment is to "love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." He taught that "the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/22.33-39?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Matthew 22:37, 39; see also verses 33–39.</span></a>)<br><br>Let's focus on the second of the great commandments for a moment. How are we to love our neighbor? As we love ourselves. But if we don't love ourselves very much--if we fall prey to harsh and excessive self-criticism, if we are constantly condemning ourselves for our shortcomings and denying who we really are--how much good will it do to love our neighbors in the same way?<br><br>We all know people who seem to constantly take a negative tone and who seem to have a cutting and judgmental attitude toward everything and everyone. And, on the other hand, we all know people who are full of "long-suffering" and "love unfeigned" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 121:41</span></a>), who are full of kindness and forgiveness, and who refuse to condemn others.<br><br>I believe that there is a great underlying truth in Christ's injunction to love others<i>as ourselves--</i>the reality is that you must love yourself in order to be able to be filled with love toward others. We can and must love ourselves for<i>who</i>we are even if we are not completely satisfied with<i>what</i>we are or<i>where</i>we are at the present. We can be loving and kind and even merciful with ourselves even while being fully and deeply committed to the knowledge that we can and must do better. When we do this, we will find greater tolerance and patience and love not only for ourselves but also for others. We can develop greater charity. And therein is peace and joy.<br><br>I share the following experience with permission. A husband and father in my ward requested an interview with me. He confessed that he was struggling with an addiction to pornography. He desperately wanted to put his destructive behavior behind him, but he had not been able to do so. He began to pour out his heart, explaining how the roots of this terrible habit were in his childhood. But in the middle of this outpouring he stopped abruptly and said, seeming to be almost angry, "No! I will not make excuses. What I am doing is wrong. It is evil, and nothing can justify it." He cut himself short, and then he went on to express concern that there were two sides to him. He told me of his feelings and worries that<i>he</i>himself might actually be evil.<br><br>I told this good brother, this beloved spirit child of our Heavenly Father, that, yes, he needed to repent and overcome, but that he also needed to quit tearing himself down. He needed to remember who he is--a son of God! "You are<i>where</i>you are," I told him. "Accept and acknowledge that. But you must also acknowledge and accept<i>who</i>you are." It was important that he not leave room for justifying his behavior--that he not rationalize or convince himself that somehow his actions were not destructive or contrary to the principles of righteousness. But at the same time, if he would not allow himself room to understand the roots of his problem, how could he hope to overcome it? If he allowed himself no room for understanding, no kindness, no mercy, how could he truly know and remember who he is and why he is here? And without this, how could he develop the determination to undertake and persevere in the difficult but vital task of overcoming?<br><br>Like many who become caught up in Satan's snares, this good brother had heard Lucifer's whispered lies, and in his guilt and shame he had begun to believe them. Satan would have us believe that when we do wrong, it is over--that we have irrevocably forfeited our promised blessings. "What you have done is too sinful, too ugly for you to ever be fully restored to your full potential," he might whisper. "After all, you are a returned missionary, you have made sacred temple covenants, you are a husband and father, or you are a wife and mother, and look what you have done!" In this way he would have us become caught up not only in a web of destructive sin but also in a self-reinforcing cycle of denying who we really are and why we are really here. That cycle results in self-loathing and discouragement and ultimately in the inability to move forward.<br><br>Is it not emblematic of his essential deceitfulness that the very being who tries to chain you into soul-destroying patterns then whispers to you that you are worthless because you have done the very things that he has urged you to do?<br><br>I did my best to encourage this good brother, to give him hope. I promised him that the Atonement of the Savior was still available to him, as it is available to each of us. I promised him that his<i>full potential</i>as a child of God was still available to him if he would repent. Iasked him to work toward remembering who he is, to learn to understand and love and eventually even forgive himself.<br><br>Some of his Church privileges were suspended for a time--with the sole intent of helping him to heal. I asked him to meet with a therapist who could help him understand his weakness and why, from his childhood, it had become so consuming. Together we formulated goals and plans that would, with faith and prayer, help him to eventually understand and overcome and move forward on the path to returning to his Father in Heaven--renewed and cleansed and healed.<br><br>Over time I saw the light of hope return to this brother's eyes. The process was not easy, and he was not perfect in his efforts at first, but he found immediate peace and joy in the<i>process of moving forward!</i>After months of learning and struggling and progressing, the day came when his temple recommend was returned to him. And we rejoiced together.<br><br>In his October 2006 general conference address, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland implored:<br><br><i>To all of you who think you are lost or without hope, or who think you have done too much that was too wrong for too long, to every one of you who worry that you are stranded somewhere on the wintry plains of life and have wrecked your handcart in the process, this conference calls out Jehovah's unrelenting refrain, "[My] hand is stretched out still."</i>[Isaiah 5:25; 9:17, 21]<br><br>Elder Holland continued:<br><br><i>His is the pure love of Christ, the charity that never faileth, that compassion which endures even when all other strength disappears</i>[see Moroni 7:46–47]<i>.</i><br><br><i>I testify of this reaching, rescuing, merciful Jesus.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/11/prophets-in-the-land-again?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Prophets in the Land Again</span></a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 106–7]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, fellow children of our loving and merciful God, if there is serious sin in your life, acknowledge and accept that fact. Understand that you are not here to prove to the Lord or to anyone else that you would never make mistakes; rather, you are here to<i>repent and give your all to serve Him.</i>Go to the Lord in sincerity and faith and plead with Him for mercy and help. Go to your bishop and get moving forward again on the path of progress.<br><br>Even if we are free from any such things, as we still struggle to overcome our persistent, petty weaknesses, every day can feel like a continual struggle. I know from personal experience that sometimes progress can be discouragingly slow--there are frustrations and setbacks and disappointments along the way. Sometimes it can even be difficult to tell whether or not we are actually winning the battle.<br><br>But I have found that a key to finding joy in daily living is to know this: If you are engaged in the daily struggle to overcome--fully engaged--if you are trying with everything you have, you are winning! And with the Lord's help you will prevail.<br><br>Even if you are not yet perfect, even if there are areas in your life that are in real need of improvement, if you are sincerely pushing forward, you are achieving the purpose for which you are here and you can find joy in that. The Lord will help you. He may not immediately make your path easy, because doing so might actually hinder your progress and development and happiness in the long run. But He<i>will</i>be with you, He<i>will</i>help you as you refuse to give up, as you call upon His name and continue to try to give Him your whole heart.<br><br>A few years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Knowing that she would pass through great agony and that death would inevitably take her, I arranged a trip to the sacred Church sites in upstate New York--just the two of us. It was my way to create some one-on-one time and to say good-bye. At one point, as we were driving together toward the Sacred Grove, I reached out and took her hand. I told her how much I loved her and how grateful I was for all that she had given me, all she meant to me. I told her how sorry I was for the little things that I had done along the way that had caused her disappointment or pain. Iwill never forget what she said. She squeezed my hand and, her eyes glowing, said, "Oh, Doug, you don't understand, do you? I forgave you those things before you ever did them."<br><br>Oh, the love of a parent for her imperfect child! I testify that our Father's love is like that--except it is even more complete. He is your Father. Regardless of where you have been or where you are now, He wants you, as His child, to learn and to grow from your experiences--even from the mistakes that He knew you would make. He wants you to properly put them behind you through the miraculous gift of the Atonement. He wants you to experience<i>joy</i>in your progress toward Him. And He wants you to complete that difficult but infinitely rewarding journey, safely and successfully.<br><br>May each of us learn to rejoice in the grand opportunity that has been afforded us to experience this earthly existence, to have trials and challenges that can lead to great personal growth and progress, to learn from our mistakes, and to put them behind us through repentance. May we understand and remember who we really are. May we openly and honestly acknowledge to ourselves and to God where we are in our own personal path of progress, wherever that may be. May we engage in the continual process of identifying where and how we most need to change, and then may we<i>get to work,</i>finding daily joy in<i>moving forward,</i>line upon line, precept upon precept. In the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Douglas F.

<br>
Happy August 2nd! Some of you may be celebrating a birthday today. If so, you join the likes of Rembrandt's wife, Saskia, who was born in 1612; Irish actor Peter O'Toole, born in 1932; and Andrew Gold, born in 1951. He wrote the song "Thank You for Being a Friend," which became the theme song for that popular TV series in the eighties called<i>The Golden Girls.</i><br><br>For others, however, today is one of sadness and reflection as they remember and honor someone who died. Some who passed away on August 2nd include Wild Bill Hickok, who died in 1876; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, in 1921; Alexander Graham Bell, in 1922; and, in 1998, the American ventriloquist and puppeteer, Shari Lewis (remember Lamb Chop?).<br><br>Well, like any good librarian, I did not stop there! After some additional research, I discovered that in 1776 the Declaration of Independence was actually signed on August 2nd (not July 4th, like most of us think!); in 1790 the first U.S. census was conducted; and in 1870 the Tower Subway, the world's first underground tube, opened in London. These are all good things, but August 2nd also had its share of tragedy. In 1922 a typhoon hit China, killing more than 50,000 people; in 1934 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany; in 1968 an earthquake shook the Philippines, killing 270 people and wounding nearly 300; in 1973 a flash fire killed fifty-one at the Summerland amusement center at Douglas on the Isle of Man; and in 1980 a bomb exploded at a railway station in Bologna, Italy, killing eighty-five people and wounding more than 200.<br><br>I next wondered what notable August 2nd events we have as Latter-day Saints and found that in 1831, Joseph Smith, who had traveled to Missouri for the first time, met with others on today's date to begin the building of yet another new settlement for the outcast Saints. Our Prophet recorded:<br><br><i>I assisted the Colesville branch of the Church to lay the first log, for a house, as a foundation of Zion in Kaw township, twelve miles west of Independence. The log was carried and placed by twelve men, in honor of the twelve tribes of Israel. At the same time, through prayer, the land of Zion was consecrated and dedicated by Elder Sidney Rigdon for the gathering of the Saints.</i><br><br>He concluded:<br><br><i>It was</i>a season of joy<i>to those present, and</i>afforded a glimpse of the future,<i>which time will yet unfold to the satisfaction of the faithful.</i>[<i>HC</i>1:196; emphasis added]<br><br>It was "a season of joy" and "afforded a glimpse of the future." Keep that thought!<br><br>Just two years later, on August 2, 1833, a revelation was given through Joseph Smith at Kirtland, Ohio. At that time members of the Church were being persecuted in Missouri, and the Prophet had been forced to sign an agreement in late July that the Saints would leave Jackson County. This revelation is section 97 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which gives beautiful insights into Zion and "the pure in heart" (verse 21) and instructions for building a temple, a house of the Lord.<br><br>LDS birthdays today include Matthew Cowley, born in 1897, apostle and great missionary to the Maori Saints.<br><br>Finally, I want to bring your attention to the fact that on August 2, 1985, our Church released the first new English hymnbook in thirty-seven years. This is the green hymnal, which replaced the navy one (for those of you who can remember that far back!). Since then, this hymnal has been translated into many languages and continues to be the one used today. (See "It Happened in August," What's Up?<i>New Era,</i>August 2006, 36.) More on hymns to come! (Unless otherwise noted, all songs cited are from<i>Hymns,</i>2002.)<br><br>So why point out all of this? I hope you recognize that we could research any day of the year and come up with similar results. Every day is important, and we need to remember that good and bad things happen. In fact, I think sometimes the difference between a good day and a bad day is about twenty-four hours. Good and bad are part of life, part of the "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11) that Lehi discussed in his final words to his son Jacob. In Ecclesiastes 3:1–4 we read:<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</i><br><i>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</i><br><i>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</i><br><br>I encourage all of us to savor every moment of every day and, on those bleak days when nothing seems to be going right, to think of hymn number 255 and "carry on!" ("Carry On"). Have that "season of joy" that affords "a glimpse of the future" that the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote about in his journal on August 2, 1831.<br><br>The hymn "Carry On" was written in response to the theme "Onward with Mormon Ideals" that was announced for the Mutual Improvement Association in 1930, the Church's centennial year. This was an exciting time in the Church as members looked back over the first hundred years yet looked to the future as well.<br><br>We have so many examples of Saints who press forward with faith during trying times. Our dear President Gordon B. Hinckley put it this way:<br><br><i>It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us.</i>[Quoted in "Excerpts from Addresses of President Gordon B. Hinckley," Latter-day Counsel,<i>Ensign,</i>October 2000, 73; see also Hinckley, "Put Your Trust in God,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 2006, 63]<br><br>If President Hinckley needed to remind himself daily to carry on, then we probably need to be reminding ourselves even more.<br><br>I believe that carrying on is a tradition that gets passed down through the generations, and I have been blessed by the valiant examples of my ancestors. My paternal grandmother, Eliza Teuscher Bischoff, was born in Switzerland. She fell in love about the same time that she and her family met the Mormon missionaries. The entire family eventually joined the Church and started preparations to join the Saints in America. Margaritha, her sister, was especially thrilled and could not wait to go, but my grandmother was pulled in two directions; she wanted to go with her family, but she did not want to leave her sweetheart. She called it her time of sadness and joy. Just before the family was ready to leave, tragedy struck when Margaritha became ill and died. It is said that my great-grandmother's hair turned white overnight. Nonetheless they followed through with their plans and sailed for America with heavy hearts.<br><br>Aunt Jo, from my mom's side of our family, was a stalwart Saint who carried on even though that meant being disowned. Johanna Adrianna Gobel Tonks was raised in Holland. She and her sister had to hide their Book of Mormon under the mattress up in their attic bedroom. The oil for their little lamp would burn just long enough for the sisters to read one chapter of the book every night. Their mother, suspicious of all things Mormon, said one evening, "No more light for you girls up there." Somehow Aunt Jo managed to get some matches, and she and her sister were able to continue reading that precious chapter nightly, even though the oil should have burned out long before. She stated, "No one in this whole wide world can tell me the hand of the Lord wasn't over us."<br><br>Aunt Jo could not get baptized until she turned 18, and that happened while her mother was away helping a sister. Aunt Jo recalled being discouraged, for she loved her mother and did not want to disobey her. She wondered if she was doing right in going against her mother's wishes, but when she came up out of the water, she exclaimed, "Oh, I am so happy!" for the greatest feeling of joy came over her, and she was glad she had done the will of the Father.<br><br>When her mother came home one week later, Aunt Jo met her at the depot, and during their late-night supper her mother said, "Jo, you have come of age while I was gone. What have you done?"<br><br>Aunt Jo answered, "Well, mother, I have been baptized, but let me stay here and live with you. You can go to your church and I can go to mine. I want to stay and take care ofyou."<br><br>Her mother replied, "I cannot live with a Mormon. You leave the house now."<br><br>It was 11:00 p.m. and raining terribly. That did not make any difference to her mother, however, and Aunt Jo had to walk twenty minutes to stay with an aunt, never to return toher home again.<br><br>Oh, how I love these stories of pressing forward with faith during trying times.<br><h2><b>Become an Instrument in the Lord's Hands</b></h2><br>One of the first poems I memorized is the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:<br><br><i>Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.</i><br><i>Where there is hatred, let me sow love.</i><br><i>Where there is injury, pardon.</i><br><i>Where there is doubt, faith.</i><br><i>Where there is despair, hope.</i><br><i>Where there is darkness, light.</i><br><i>Where there is sadness, joy.</i><br><br><i>O Divine Master,</i><br><i>grant that I may not so much seek</i><br><i>to be consoled as to console;</i><br><i>to be understood as to understand;</i><br><i>to be loved as to love.</i><br><i>For it is in giving that we receive;</i><br><i>it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;</i><br><i>and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.</i><br>[Attributed]<br><br>This simple prayer contains profound truths. The imagery of becoming an instrument in the Lord's hands is beautiful, and it is my first guideline for carrying on. This has become my motto.<br><br>I sang a setting of this poem at a BYU commencement back in the eighties. Often I find myself humming this song to remind me of the good I can do in the world today (see "Have I Done Any Good?" no. 223).<br><br>In recent years I have learned a lot about musical instruments. My husband, Daron, is a professional musician. He gets asked on occasion to acquire a new instrument for a recording gig, so we are usually on the lookout for something to complement his current lineup that now numbers 118!<br><br>Primarily we own wind instruments--like clarinets, flutes, saxophones, recorders, and some pretty cool ethnic ones--but we also have a nice piano, some keyboards, a couple of organs, guitars, a ukulele, and even some kazoos. Some are very big, like the baritone saxophone; others are very small, like the Oscar Meyer Wienerwhistle. No two are alike; each one is unique. They sound great, but it takes some effort to keep them playable. They must be kept clean, tuned, and regulated. Pads must be level, joints lubricated, endless reeds fixed and conditioned, wood bodies humidified, and silver bodies kept free of tarnish. So, too, must we keep ourselves in top condition to be directed by the Heavenly Maestro.<br><br>Mary Ellen Smoot said in the October 2000 general conference:<br><br><i>Truly, we may</i>each<i>be an instrument in the hands of God. Happily, we need not all be the same kind of instrument. Just as the instruments in an orchestra differ in size, shape, and sound, we too are different from one another. We have different talents and inclinations, but just as the French horn cannot duplicate the sound of the piccolo, neither is it necessary for us to all serve the Lord in the same way.</i>["We Are Instruments in the Hands of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 90; emphasis in original]<br><br>This is an important point. The Lord needs you to do it in your own way, using your own talents and your unique individual caring. Remember:<br><br><i>Angels above us are silent notes taking</i><br><i>Of ev'ry action; then do what is right!</i><br>["Do What Is Right," no. 237]<br><br>No one else can do what you can do. Please do not compare yourselves to others. Rather, bloom where you're planted! This is one of the lessons I learned from growing up in a very small farming community. Of course at the time I felt rather put upon because of all the chores and responsibilities this afforded. I wondered each time we left events early to "go home and milk" why I couldn't stay like my city cousins. Their life looked so much easier. But looks can be deceiving. Do not seek for greener grass or covet what is thy neighbor's. This is something my parents taught me: learn to be content where you are.<br><br>I also learned about service and how to be an instrument in the Lord's hands by observing my parents and their selfless acts of kindness to neighbor and stranger alike. It was common for my mom to feed a hobo passing by or to fix dinner for a needy family or to go visit someone "just because." My dad was always first in line to help put up hay or to fill up someone's gas tank because of miscalculated mileage to the next gas station. He was especially good at listening and lifting others' souls. He gave hope where there was despair and lightened many heavy burdens with his humor and kindness. He loved the Charlie Chaplin song<i>Smile,</i>which actually is a great carry-on song:<br><br><i>Light up your face with gladness,</i><br><i>Hide ev'ry trace of sadness,</i><br><i>Al-'tho a tear may be ever so near,</i><br><br><i>That's the time,</i><br><i>You must keep on trying,</i><br><i>Smile, what's the use of crying,</i><br><i>You'll find that life is still worth-while</i><br><i>If you just smile.</i><br>[Charles "Charlie" Chaplin, music (theme for<i>Modern Times,</i>1936); John Turner and Geoffrey Claremont Parsons, lyrics and title (1954)]<br><br>Sometimes we question our promptings because of what I call the "smallness factor." We think that because the Lord wants us to do just a tiny thing that it is not important. This is wrong. Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, former general Relief Society president, counseled:<br><br><i>What does it mean to be an instrument in everyday terms? I think it means to nurture others. Joseph Smith called it acting "according to those sympathies" in our hearts. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Believe me when I say each of us is much better than we think. We need to recognize and celebrate what we're doing right. Much of what we do seems small and insignificant--just a part of daily living. When we are called "to give an account to Jehovah," as the Prophet Joseph counseled, I know that we will have much to share.</i>["Sweet Moments,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2005, 107; see Relief Society Minutes, 28 April 1842, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38 and also 34]<br><br>Carrying on is about being consistent--line upon line, precept upon precept. Testimonies are built one step at a time.<br><br>In his 2006 October general conference address, Elder Don R. Clarke, then of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, spoke about becoming instruments in the Lord's hands. One story is so tenderly told that I want to quote it. He began:<br><br><i>My maternal grandfather, Alma Benjamin Larsen, was only 34 years old when he woke up one morning and noticed that he had problems seeing. Shortly thereafter, he lost his sight entirely. Grandfather had served a mission and been a faithful member of the Church. He was a farmer with a wife and three children, and he could not imagine life without sight. Grandfather's wife and small children now had to bear the extra burdens of helping on the farm, and money became tight.</i><br><br><i>During this time of physical darkness, many people became instruments in God's hands to help my blind grandfather. One experience that had a powerful impact on his family happened in 1919. It was a year of great financial difficulty for all the people in Grandfather's town. Farms were being foreclosed, and businesses were going broke. There was a sizable mortgage on his farm, and Grandfather received a statement saying he would have to pay $195 in order to carry the mortgage over for another year. For him, paying this bill was like demanding a pound of flesh. Nearly everyone was in the same condition, and it seemed impossible to obtain that much money. If he had gathered everything that the farm produced--the horses, cows, and machinery--he could not have sold them for $195. Grandfather asked a neighbor to butcher two or three of his cows, and he sold them and some other products. He had extended credit to his neighbors with the understanding that they would pay at the end of the year, but none of his debtors was able to pay him. The economic situation for his family was bleak.</i><br><br>Elder Clarke quoted from his grandfather's journal:<br><br><i>"I shall never forget that cold evening, just before Christmas of 1919. It looked as though we would lose the farm. My daughter, Gladys, laid a slip of paper in my hand and said, 'This came in the mail today.' I took it to her mother and asked her what it was. This is what my wife read to me, 'Dear Brother Larsen, I've had you on my mind all day today. I am wondering if you are in financial trouble. If you are, I have $200 you may have.' The letter was signed 'Jim Drinkwater.' Jim was a small, crippled man, and he would have been the last man on earth that anyone would have thought had that much money on hand. I went to his house that night and he said, 'Brother Larsen, I received a wireless message from heaven this morning, and I could not get you off my mind all day. I was sure you were in financial trouble.' Brother Drinkwater gave me $200 and we sent the $195 to the mortgage company, and with the extra $5 we bought boots and clothes for the children. Santa Claus did come that year."</i><br><br>Elder Clarke's grandfather then bore his testimony:<br><br><i>"The Lord has never let me down. He has touched the hearts of others as He touched the heart of Brother Drinkwater. I bear witness that the only safety and security that I have ever found has come through trying to keep the commandments of the Lord and upholding and sustaining the authorities of this Church."</i><br><br>Elder Clarke then concluded:<br><br><i>I have thought about Jim Drinkwater many times and wondered how he came to be one that the Lord could trust. Jim was a little, crippled man that God trusted to help a blind farmer with a heavy mortgage and three children. I have learned a great deal from my grandfather's experience with Jim Drinkwater. I have learned that a person does not need to have a Church calling, an invitation to help someone, or even good health to become an instrument in God's hands.</i>[Don R. Clarke, "Becoming Instruments in the Hands of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 97–98]<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, strive to be someone the Lord can trust. Always be listening for that still small voice. Have you received "a wireless message from heaven" today? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave this advice in the April 2011 general conference:<br><br><i>Often</i>[the Lord]<i>speaks to us in ways that we can hear only with our heart. To better hear His voice, it would be wise to turn down the volume control of the worldly noise in our lives. If we ignore or block out the promptings of the Spirit for whatever reason, they become less noticeable until we cannot hear them at all. Let us learn to hearken to the promptings of the Spirit and then be eager to heed them.</i>["Waiting on the Road to Damascus,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2011, 70–75]<br><br>As we help others carry on, our own burdens get lighter. Become an instrument in God's hands.<br><h2><b>A Hymn a Day</b></h2><br>Another suggestion for carrying on is to include the study of hymns in your daily personal worship time. Have you read what the First Presidency recommends in the preface to the hymnbook?<br><br><i>The hymns can greatly benefit us as individuals. Hymns can lift our spirits, give us courage, and move us to righteous action. They can fill our souls with heavenly thoughts and bring us a spirit of peace.</i><br><br><i>Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.</i>["First Presidency Preface,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, x]<br><br>I love the hymns! They are truly "song[s] of the heart" (D&amp;amp;C 25:12), and I highly encourage you to turn to them for inspiration. Each is a mini-sermon that can build testimony, strengthen resolves, and help us<i>carry on.</i>My own gospel convictions have developed and become stronger through the years as I have pondered their messages. I share a few personal experiences to illustrate the power of our hymns and hope as I do that you will recall your own teaching moments.<br><br>My first favorite was "There Is a Green Hill Far Away." The simplicity of this text gave me a basic, childlike understanding of the unconditional love of our Savior:<br><br><i>Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!</i><br><i>And we must love him too,</i><br><i>And trust in his redeeming blood,</i><br><i>And try his works to do.</i><br>[No. 194]<br><br>As a teen I participated in a dance festival at the annual June conference in Salt Lake City. This was so fun for me--a farm girl who came to the big city to participate with hundreds of other youth in a spectacular event at the football stadium at the U. After the finale, as we dancers learned that the prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, was there, everyone spontaneously began to sing "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" (no. 19). My voice broke as the Spirit bore witness to me that we do have a living prophet, and this feeling has come again and again as I have had opportunities to see prophets in person--not on TV but here at BYU or in the LDS Conference Center. I do give thanks for a prophet who guides us in these latter days!<br><br>I went to Ricks College (now BYU–Idaho) and attended the weekly devotionals. One particular day I was feeling a bit depressed--just sort of sad and wondering where my life was going--as I trudged into the meeting. I do not remember who spoke that day, but I do remember singing hymn number 250, "We Are All Enlisted." Verse three was particularly poignant:<br><br><i>Fighting for a kingdom, and the world is our foe;</i><br><i>Happy are we! Happy are we!</i><br><i>Glad to join the army, we will sing as we go;</i><br><i>We shall gain the vict'ry by and by.</i><br><i>Dangers may gather--why should we fear?</i><br><i>Jesus, our Leader, ever is near.</i><br><i>He will protect us, comfort and cheer.</i><br><i>We're joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.</i><br><br>As these words entered my sad heart that morning, I immediately felt buoyed up and happy to be part of God's army.<br><br>On my mission I had a goal to memorize as many hymns as possible. Hymn number 29, "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief," was one of the first. As you know, this is the hymn that John Taylor sang for Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum that fateful day in June 1844 at Carthage. John Taylor recalled:<br><br><i>All of us felt unusually . . . languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song, that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . After a lapse of some time, Brother Hyrum requested me again to sing that song. I replied, "Brother Hyrum, I do not feel like singing," when he remarked, "Oh, never mind; commence singing, and you will get the spirit of it." At his request I did so.</i>[<i>HC</i>7:101–2]<br><br>This was a carry-on moment!<br><br>It took me longer than most to marry. On occasion I thought I might be that stereotypical "old-maid" librarian! Turning to the hymns on many lonely evenings lifted my spirits and helped me to maintain eternal perspective. Where could I turn for peace? Where was my solace? Where was "the quiet hand to calm my anguish? Who, who [could] understand? He, only One" ("Where Can I Turn for Peace?" no.129).<br><br>In May 2002 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. About a month later my father had a stroke and died within a week on July 3rd. This, indeed, was a time I needed strength to carry on. Hymn number 115 gave me hope:<br><br><i>Here bring your wounded hearts; here tell your anguish.</i><br><br><i>Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot heal.</i><br><br><i>. . .</i><br><br><i>Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing</i><br><i>Earth has no sorrow but heav'n can remove.</i><br>["Come, Ye Disconsolate"]<br><br>I suspect that each of you has experienced similar soul-searching times, and I testify that the hymns can heal our wounded hearts and bring solace. They can also move us to action. Our dear prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, said:<br><br><i>My brothers and sisters, may we resolve from this day forward to fill our hearts with love. May we go the extra mile to include in our lives any who are lonely or downhearted or who are suffering in any way. May we "[cheer] up the sad and [make] someone feel glad"</i>["Have I Done Any Good?" no. 223].<i>May we live so that when that final summons is heard, we may have no serious regrets, no unfinished business, but will be able to say with the Apostle Paul, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith"</i>[2 Timothy 4:7]. ["Now Is the Time,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 61]<br><br>Daily hymns remind us how to live.<br><br><i>We are sowing, daily sowing</i><br><i>Countless seeds of good and ill.</i><br>. . .<br><i>By a whisper sow we blessings;</i><br><i>By a breath we scatter strife.</i><br><i>In our words and thoughts and actions</i><br><i>Lie the seeds of death and life</i>.<br>["We Are Sowing," no. 216]<br><br><i>You can make the pathway bright,</i><br><i>Fill the soul with heaven's light,</i><br><i>If there's sunshine in your heart.</i><br>. . .<br><i>You can live a happy life</i><br><i>In this world of toil and strife,</i><br><i>If there's sunshine in your heart.</i><br>["You Can Make the Pathway Bright," no. 228]<br><br><i>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?</i><br><i>Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?</i><br><i>Count your many blessings; ev'ry doubt will fly,</i><br><i>And you will be singing as the days go by.</i><br>["Count Your Blessings," no. 241]<br><br><i>In the days of trial his Saints he will cheer.</i><br>["Let Us All Press On," no. 243]<br><br><i>Improve each shining moment.</i><br>["Improve the Shining Moments," no. 226]<br><br><i>And never stand still till the Master appear.</i><br><i>His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,</i><br><i>And our talents improve</i><br><i>By the patience of hope and the labor of love.</i><br>["Come, Let Us Anew," no. 217]<br><br><i>Come unto him all ye depressed,</i><br><i>Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim,</i><br><i>Ye weary ones who long for rest.</i><br><i>Come unto him!</i><br><i>Come unto him!</i><br>["Come unto Him," no. 114]<br><br>It is my prayer that we can all stand "faithful and true" ("True to the Faith," no. 254).

<h1>gs Spiritual - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good afternoon. I feel honored and humbled to share a few words with you. How privileged we are to have attended this fine university. As we move forward, we cannot forget the great debt of thanks we owe those who have helped us get here--parents, friends, and loved ones, as well as the faculty, staff, and administrators of Brigham Young University. A special thanks to President and Sister Samuelson for their dedication and love in leading this university and to Elder Craig C. Christensen for speaking to us today.<br><br>I knew that BYU was a unique university when I sat down for my first day of calculus my freshman year and my instructor asked the class for a volunteer to offer an opening prayer. Never before had I witnessed an educator invite the Spirit into the classroom to magnify both her ability to teach and our capacity to learn.<br><br>The interconnected nature of the spiritual and secular learning that takes place at Brigham Young University is one of the defining characteristics of a BYU education. While many of us have grown spiritually through our religion courses, countless "nonreligious" experiences both on and off BYU campus have also encouraged our spiritual development.<br><br>I first began to appreciate how the Lord's hand guides all types of academic pursuits through a story that one of my professors shared. He related how his life's work for the past twenty years had centered on finding a new proof for a well-established theorem. This quest had begun in graduate school, when he had stumbled across a new technique that he believed could prove the theorem in a simpler, more efficient way. He came very close to finishing the proof but could never complete a certain step, despite years of work. The professor became somewhat emotional as he described how, after all his efforts, he finally admitted defeat and prepared to move on. Then the next morning, when he woke up, he could clearly see the solution in his mind. It was so simple and so beautiful that he thought it impossible no one else had seen it before. Needless to say, he was able to rigorously demonstrate that the proof technique was correct and that its correctness made it highly valuable.<br><br>These "sudden strokes of ideas,"<sup>1</sup>as Joseph Smith called them, can and do come to people in all disciplines. However, moments of inspiration in academic research are not the only ways in which we have seen the spiritual and the secular converge. We have each observed this pattern in different situations. Allow me toshare just a few of my own such experiences.<br><br>In a bookbinding class I discovered my ability to create something of beauty and worth, and the affinity that Heavenly Father feels toward us as His most precious creations. By writing a paper about President Hinckley speaking at a devotional, my testimony of prophets was strengthened. After watching dance performances and athletic events, I began to comprehend the magnificence of the human body. And through the Study Abroad program in Jerusalem, my eyes were opened to the reality of the Savior's life and Atonement. While your experiences may differ from mine, I'm sure that every graduate in this ceremony can appreciate the importance of enduring to the end. Our ability to grasp eternal truths through our worldly pursuits should not be surprising, for, as the prophet Alma taught, "all things denote there is a God."<sup>2</sup><br><br>The incredible gift of a BYU education is that it not only enlarges our intellectual capacity and strengthens our spiritual sensitivity, but that it accomplishes these two goals simultaneously. If you want to recognize ways in which the Spirit has influenced your educational path, I invite you to try to remember. President Henry B. Eyring would write in his journal each day to remember how he had seen the Lord's hand in his life. Of this experience he said:<br><br><i>As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, . . . I realized that trying toremember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I encourage each of you to take a few moments and try to remember how God's hand has touched your life during your time atBYU.<br><br>C. S. Lewis stated: "I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen, not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."<sup>4</sup>May we ever aim to see our life experiences through the Light of Christ. As we do so, we will gain a greater capacity to help others recognize the interconnected nature of spiritual and secular education and thereby pass on the legacy of learning we have attained here at Brigham Young University. Thank you.<br><br><i><i>Chelsea Johnson Kennedy spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 11 August 2011.</i></i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.<i>HC</i>3:381.<br><br>2.

<h1> of Good Cheer&quot; - to August 2011 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, faculty, staff, and friends--as you know, we have gathered to celebrate the accomplishments of those concluding this phase of their academic quests and to honor them for their achievements. In doing so, we also honor those of you who have played such key roles in the lives of those we identify for the special recognitions of the day. The names of the graduates and honorees are found in the official program. While the names of others assisting are not so recorded, the contributions of many kinds and the necessary support rendered are not diminished but likewise should be celebrated. In this we include spouses, parents, children, other family members, friends, classmates, faculty members, teachers, and mentors. We also honor with great respect and appreciation our board of trustees and other Church leaders, the faithful tithe payers of the Church, and the very many whose offerings and donations have enriched and enlarged the education and experiences of today's graduates.<br><br>I hope each of us realizes, at least in part, what a rich blessing it is to be at BYU. We are better prepared to receive and achieve the wonderful advantages and opportunities that life has yet to offer us because of what has happened to us here.<br><br>As has been increasingly the case in recent years, the world is experiencing more than a little turmoil. Our economy is unsettled, and many of our sacred values are being challenged, perhaps as never before. We are confronted regularly in different venues by very pessimistic people who tend to excuse their negativity as "only being realistic."<br><br>Make no mistake: we live in challenging times. We must recognize, however, that what we are experiencing is no surprise to prophets of the past or to those of the present. In fact, much of what is occurring today is fully consistent with prophecy. Without minimizing the risks and uncertainties of our day, I am grateful for the ultimate optimism we can enjoy because of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As we listen carefully to President Monson and others of our prophet leaders, we can be confident in their positive outlook about our future. One of President Hinckley's favorite responses when confronted with heavy or difficult problems was to say, "It will all work out." My promise to you today is that these prophet leaders are right, and things will eventually turn out as they should.<br><br>Please understand that I am not preaching passivity, nor am I suggesting in any way that each of us needs not do her or his very best. Likewise, I am not proposing that the troubles of our time are not real or serious. They are, and being concerned is not unreasonable. It is also most appropriate to have confidence that things will eventually turn out positively for those who pay attention to proper priorities and heed the counsel of the Lord's servants. For those of you who are married, you know what those priorities are. For those of you not quite there yet, don't give up or be deflected from your appropriate dreams. I personally take great comfort from this promise of the Lord found in the sixty-fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: "But all things must come to pass in their time" (verse 32). Perhaps, unfortunately, "their time" or the Lord's time might not fit our presently conceived timetables.<br><br>For those of you who have accepted employment or positions for further education, I encourage you to do your very best in this competitive world. For those of you still searching for the perfect situation or any job atall, I encourage you to be wise, thoughtful, and relentless. For those of you who will be turning your full attention to home, children, or the support of your spouse, you will need todo all of these things and more!<br><br>Whatever your circumstance, it will work out well eventually if you do your best to cause it to happen. Sometimes these trials are blessings in disguise, and what the Lord may have in store for you later could be dramatically better than your current conception of optimal achievement.<br><br>I am impressed by the counsel of Jesus given frequently and in varying circumstances to "be of good cheer." It is true that He never minimized problems, challenges, or difficulties. Indeed, He often prophetically predicted them. It is also true that He always placed the seemingly negative in a positive context for those willing to trust, follow, and obey Him. I would not be surprised if He were to send a message directly to us today in the midst of our interesting circumstances. He would say, "Be of good cheer." His counsel also would be never to forget the basics or the promises He and His Father have made to those who honor and obey Them.<br><br>In addition to the expertise, content competence, specialized skills, and broad educational achievements you have attained while at BYU, I expect with some very good evidence that you have also strengthened your faith and testimonies in the things of highest value and most lasting importance. Both the Mission and Aims of your BYU education have been crafted precisely to optimally prepare you to deal properly with the difficulties you will face both proximally now and throughout your future lives. Keep the big picture in mind. Remember to exercise your faith and carefully prioritize your time and your efforts. Remember, as Jesus counsels us to be of good cheer, He also asks that we keep His commandments and love one another as He has loved us.<br><br>Please accept my sincere congratulations on your achievements. Know that you have our confidence as you take the next exciting steps in your journey of life that will include growth, service, challenges, and ultimately great joy as you live as you know you should. Ileave my blessing and best wishes with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 11 August 2011.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. Iam especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy my family experiences through having children attend BYU.<br><br>Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:<br><br><i>I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually.</i>["Your Gifts Bless Generations," insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]<br><br>I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I trust you feel that as well.<br><br>Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed manytests--some academic and some in otherimportant areas of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.<br><br>It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when<br><br><i>Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. "It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, 'What have I done?' and, 'What do I do now?'" he recalls. "I found myself on my knees within minutes."</i><br><br><i>Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD '78). Edwards set achair directly in front of Mendenhall's chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.</i><br><br>"[LaVell Edward's]<i>first words were 'You have a tough job.' Then there was a pause and silence," says Mendenhall. "It wasn't very comforting to hear that. But then</i>[LaVell]<i>just said, 'But it's a great job.' I didn't know what he meant by either atthe time."</i><br><br><i>Mendenhall has come to consider</i>[Coach]<i>Edwards a mentor and an advocate. "It's nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what it's like to be a head coach here." The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be.</i>[Peter B. Gardner, "The Bronco Way,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>winter 2007, 22–23]<br><br>Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, contact your colleges and offer to mentor students. For those who will be farther away, stay close to students when they are home for vacations or to work between semesters. Just an arm on a shoulder, some encouragement and advice, and showing that someone cares about their success is a terrific way to take BYU with you. Be mentors.<br><br>I have a BYU ring that I always wear. I was on vacation in Southern California last fall, and it was amazing how many people saw it and told me they were BYU alums or supporters. It was a small thing--only visible if someone saw my hand--yet it generated a lot of discussion and inquiry everywhere I went. That one small ring had a huge effect on connecting people to BYU and to each other. You can have just as much impact and be significant in connecting people for good--just like my ring was to those people I encountered while on vacation--if you "wear the Y" wherever you are.<br><br>Wear the Y<br><br>in your countenance<br><br>in your speech and communication<br><br>in your example<br><br>in your choices<br><br>in your attitude<br><br>You will find that "wearing BYU" will allow you to share the gospel and stay connected for good to the university.<br><br>Here are three more ideas to consider: contribute, connect, and serve.<br><br>First, contribute annually with your monetary resources. One thing I have learned in my service to the BYU Alumni Association is that every gift to BYU--large or small--is important to the university.<br><br>Erlynn Lansing, a grateful alum who graduated in 1974, said this:<br><br><i>Our experience [at BYU] and our associations at the university have helped us as parents, in our Church callings, and in [my husband's] professional duties. . . . The only way we can adequately thank the Lord and all those who have helped us is to give back so that others may have wonderful experiences like we've had.</i>[Erlynn Ensign Lansing, "Funding Futures,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>summer 2010, 58]<br><br>Robbie Ross Tisch, a strategic planning and organizational effectiveness consultant, shared these thoughts on giving:<br><br><i>Being generous takes people out of narrow, fearfulplaces of scarcity and returns them to the spaciousness of connection and concern about others, into "we-ness" rather than "me-ness."</i>[http://www.managementassistance.org/ht/a/GetDocumentAction/i/11015]<br><br>Because of donations, thousand of students receive an outstanding education. Show your appreciation by supporting the financial needs of BYU. Your monetary resources are vital to the work of the university.<br><br>Next, stay connected to BYU by attending BYU-related events, allowing you to enjoy the fruits of what BYU students and alumni have to offer in the way of excellence in sports, performance, and intellectual knowledge. And update your records so we can keep you informed about BYU. Let us know where you are, because we want you to be "connected for good" to the university and to alumni everywhere you go.<br><br>And, finally, serve and volunteer.<br><br>Linda Palmer, executive director of the Alumni Association, said:<br><br><i>Service is a core part of being a BYU graduate. It's our charge. We enter to learn; we must go forth to serve. Bettering the world is part of the commitment we make in coming here.</i>[Linda Palmer, "Enter to Serve,"<i>BYU Magazine,</i>fall 2010, 49]<br><br>BYU is here to help all of us serve the world better. Look for opportunities in your life to be the one who makes the difference in the life of another. Bring light and goodness wherever you are through your service.<br><br>Mentoring, wearing the Y, contributing, and serving--these will keep the Spirit of the Y alive in you.<br><br>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>You have gained a rich heritage from your experiences as a student and member of the BYU community. You can bless others with your heritage wherever you are. Be a light to those who can be lifted, taught, and encouraged. Be proud of what BYU is, for it is much more than you might have seen in your time here. It is a wonderful combination of many colleges, teams, performing groups, clubs, academic associations, and religious affiliations that all combine to meet the needs of the world we live in. That world is begging for bright, wholesome, dedicated graduates to take all the goodness BYU has produced in you to serve the world with your talents and abilities.<br><br>May you maintain a meaningful connection to the people, relationships, feelings, experiences, and memories created at BYU. May your Christlike influence be felt wherever you may be found throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Chris Feinauer was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 11 August 2011.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>g for the Future: Tomorrow is Today - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers, sisters, and friends, I am grateful to be with you this afternoon. May I begin by expressing my deep feelings of respect and admiration to all who are graduating today. We are profoundly grateful for your righteous and exemplary lives. For the past several years you have devoted long days and seemingly endless nights studying and preparing, both academically and spiritually, to enter a world that, quite frankly, needs you desperately. By your work and your faith you have qualified yourselves to be recognized by this unique university and by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors and supports this university.<br><br>We enthusiastically salute you for all you have achieved and, more important, for who you are and for who you will become. We thankfully recognize the unwavering support of your parents and loved ones, dedicated faculty members and staff, and friends and others who have contributed to your success. Congratulations to you and to all who have helped you!<br><br>Now may I say that it is truly an honor and a privilege to be assigned by the First Presidency to participate in these commencement exercises. I convey to you their love, admiration, and gratitude for a job well done.<br><br>Without speaking too much of my own experience and life, please allow me to share a few principles and examples that may help you as you look forward to life's journey ahead. In doing so, I recognize that the majority of those present are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I also recognize those who come from other backgrounds and pray that my words and counsel will be meaningful to all.<br><br>Like you, Sister Christensen and I have been greatly influenced and blessed by our association with Brigham Young University. Three of our four children have received undergraduate degrees here, and we look forward to our youngest son's graduation in a few more semesters. Sister Christensen and I met at BYU some thirty-four years ago--something that likely would not have happened anywhere else. As I remember, we met as I was running off of the practice field in front of the Smith Fieldhouse, and she had just finished her daily run on the indoor track. Due primarily to the example and influence of family members, ward members, and a few roommates, I set aside my athletic pursuits to serve a full-time mission to Chile. Like many of you, my mission experience changed my life forever. Sister Christensen survived the dating frenzies while I was away, and we were married three months after I returned home. We lived at Wymount Terrace and had our first child a year before I finished my undergraduate studies. After working for a season to get out of debt, we attended graduate school to further our studies and personal preparation.<br><br>Thirty-one years ago this week, I was in this very building, sitting where you are, thinking many of the things you most likely are thinking and listening to those assigned to speak at our graduation ceremony. I suspect that in thirty years or so, someone from your class will be standing where I now stand, speaking to the graduates of that day. More importantly, many of you will become the next generation of leaders in your chosen professions and in the Church. As Elder M. Russell Ballard taught in a recent CES fireside, thirty years from now we will depend largely on you to direct the affairs of an ever-growing, worldwide Church.<sup>1</sup>In a few years my generation will gracefully exit the stage and invite you and your generation to take the lead in business, education, science, medicine, government, and the Church. I must confess that while I was sitting where you now sit, it never dawned on me that this transition would actually happen, or that it would happen so quickly.<br><br>As I have observed, there are many--perhaps more so among those of your generation<i>--</i>who prefer to focus on the present rather than think too seriously about the future. If you will pardon the reference, there are many who tend to embrace the infamous words of the Grand Master Oogway from the movie<i>Kung Fu Panda</i>(2008). In responding to Po Ping's concerns about what would happen in the future, Master Oogway taught the following: "You are too concerned about what was and what will be." He said, "There is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is agift. That is why it is called the 'present.'"<br><br>I hate to contradict a pop-culture icon such as<i>Kung Fu Panda;</i>however, please allow me to take some of the mystery out of Master Oogway's philosophy of the future. In doing so, I will start by sharing a brief history of a close friend. I know of a family who lived close to a large amusement park. Like others in the area, this family would drive by the park often. Each time their young son would ask, "Daddy, can we go there? I really want to go there and play on all the rides." Understanding that his son would continue to ask the same question week after week, the father would reply, "Maybe tomorrow we can go." This little interchange repeated itself again and again until finally, early one Saturday morning, the boy came running into his parents' bedroom. He jumped on the bed, startling both of them, and exclaimed with great enthusiasm, "Daddy, tomorrow is today!"<br><br>This interesting play on words--"tomorrow is today"--illustrates a valuable point. Everything we hope to accomplish in the future, how we prepare for the responsibilities that will ultimately be ours, is really a function of what we do today. Though some things about the future will always seem uncertain, the future is not entirely a mystery. To a great extent the future is shaped by the accumulation of all our daily activities and disciplined efforts. Remember the teachings of the prophet Alma to his son Helaman: "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."<sup>2</sup>Success in life, no matter how it is defined, is achieved in small steps, day by day, one day at a time. In this sense, tomorrow truly is today.<br><br>After working several years to establish our business, I remember having one of my missionary companions, whom I had not seen for several years, visit me at work. As he looked around and saw our organization and all that was being accomplished, he asked, "When did all of this happen?" My response seems obvious yet expresses my feelings for you today. Isimply answered, "One day at a time."<br><br>Today, as you look to the future--as your future "commences," if you will--the words of an often-quoted Chinese proverb are worth taking seriously: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." May I suggest a few small and simple steps that, if taken daily, will contribute to your long-term happiness and ultimate success. You will note that these recommended steps focus more on your personal and spiritual lives, yet, as is always the case, they will bless your professional lives and other pursuits as well.<br><h2><b>Seek Spiritual Experiences Every Day</b></h2><br>First and foremost, seek to feel the Spirit each and every day of your lives. Work diligently to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and to recognize the many times the Spirit speaks to your mind and to your heart.<br><br>I remember a defining moment while I was serving in the mission office in Chile. One night after dinner, my companion and I were helping the wife of our mission president clear the dishes before we went out to teach. As we finished, and somewhat out of the blue, she asked, "Elder Christensen and Elder Romney, have you felt the Spirit today?" Without waiting for our answer, she began teaching us that one of the most important ways of confirming that we are on the right track is by feeling the Spirit. She continued by emphasizing that, given all the challenges and distractions in life, we need the daily reassurance that we are both worthy of and guided by the Holy Ghost. She invited us to never go to bed at night without having recognized the feelings of the Spirit sometime throughout the day.<br><br>The Lord is anxious to pour out His Spirit on all who seek Him. I love this promise:<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Feeling the Spirit each day and drawing near to the Lord requires that we dedicate sufficient time and energy to daily prayer and personal devotion. Studying the scriptures, specifically the Book of Mormon, becomes the most important part of our daily routine.<br><br>From my own experience, I have learned that dedicating the effort to nurture feelings of personal revelation, given all of the demands on our time, is challenging at best. Like a resolve to exercise every day to become physically strong, our commitment to daily prayer and scripture study to become spiritually strong must be equally steadfast and absolute.<br><br>For me, the best time to draw near to Heavenly Father and feel His Spirit is early in the morning. This requires getting up well before work, classes, or other appointments begin. As suggested in the well-known hymn "Secret Prayer," we learn: "There is an hour of peace and rest, Unmarred by earthly care, . . . when before the Lord I go And kneel in secret prayer."<sup>4</sup>Notice that this hymn speaks of an hour to pray, not simply a few minutes before running out the door.<br><br>As we immerse ourselves in prayer and scripture study, we gain eternal perspective and open our hearts and minds to revelation--revelation we might not receive in other ways. My primary invitation as you begin this new season of life is that you dedicate your best efforts to daily seeking spiritual experiences and following the impressions that will inevitably come. As you do, your priorities will always be aligned with heaven, and you will be inspired in what you say and what you do. Your confidence will indeed wax strong in the presence of God, and the Holy Ghost will be your constant companion and most trusted friend.<sup>5</sup><br><h2><b>Work Productively Every Day with Purpose and Balance</b></h2><br>My second invitation is that you continue to work productively every day, yet with expanded purpose and greater balance. Many in the world embrace a philosophy that work is a necessary evil and that the pursuit of leisure and recreation is the primary focus and purpose of life. This philosophy is a direct contradiction to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I have long been intrigued with how Heavenly Father described His redemptive efforts on our behalf. He declared, "Behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>6</sup>Notice that what God does so lovingly and willingly, He calls work. Working hard and being productive is not only gratifying; it is one of the ordained ways we become like our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Of course you all know the value of hard work. Work is what qualified you to be here today. You also recognize that today is not the end of your efforts but the "commencement" of a long and productive life filled with work. In fact, one could argue that the whole purpose of all your hard work at BYU is to qualify you for the privilege of being trusted with even more challenging and influential work in the future.<br><br>For you, then, perhaps the greater issue is not learning how to work hard but learning how to balance more effectively all of the demands that will inevitably be placed upon you. Please consider the following example shared several years ago by Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. When asked by a group of priesthood leaders to address the most effective way to balance the demands of family, Church, profession, and personal interests, Elder Nelson responded by first acknowledging that finding a perfect balance is virtually impossible. He then compared trying to balance competing demands to flying an airplane. He explained that at times certain aspects of life will cause the plane to tilt to one side. Later, other demands may cause the plane to tilt the other way, back and forth, side to side, as we address the many challenges of life. The key, he explained, is simply not to crash.<br><br>He continued by recommending that we invite someone, perhaps a spouse or other trusted friend, to always be there, hands firmly planted on the control stick to help bring us back into balance when necessary. Finally, Elder Nelson compared the fuselage or main body of the airplane to the Savior Jesus Christ. He stated that everything we do in life--how we spend our time, how we invest our talents--should be connected to bringing us closer to the Savior.<sup>7</sup><br><br>As many of you are focused on making career choices or on other important steps, consider this quote by Elder Neal A. Maxwell: "While [your] career choices are clearly very important, [they] do not mark your real career path. Instead, brethren [and sisters], you are sojourning sons [and daughters] of God who have been invited to take the path that leads home."<sup>8</sup><br><br>As we progress on the path that leads home, our focus must be on living fully the gospel of Jesus Christ and on placing the utmost priority on those things that matter eternally--specifically on home and family. Even though we live in a world where the value of family is often questioned, our protection as individuals, as a people, and as a society comes from defending the purpose of marriage and family. Let me quote from Barbara Bush, wife of President George H. W. Bush and mother of President George W. Bush. In a commencement speech given to the women of Wellesley College during the time she was serving as First Lady and living in the White House, Barbara Bush said:<br><br><i>Whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: Fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first.</i><br><br><i>. . . Your success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White House</i>but on what happens inside your house.<sup>9</sup><br><br>Whatever your daily work will be, however you choose to concentrate your efforts, I invite you to focus on the preeminent goal of becoming more like the Savior Jesus Christ and on blessing the life of your spouse and the lives of your children. If you keep the focus on your ultimate destination, you will never fly too far off course.<br><h2><b>Find Ways to Daily Serve Others</b></h2><br>My final suggestion relates to the declarative statement "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." We now invite you to seek daily opportunities to serve others. Interestingly, we become familiar with the Lord's voice by immersing ourselves in the scriptures,<sup>10</sup>yet we become familiar with the Lord Himself and become His disciples by doing what He did: serve others.<sup>11</sup>Seeking daily opportunities to serve those around us brings us closer to the Savior and to a deeper understanding of life's real purpose.<b></b><br><br>Recently, in an early morning meeting with fellow General Authorities, we began by singing "Have I done any good in the world today?" You remember the words:<br><br><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i><br><i>Have I helped anyone in need?</i><br><i>Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feelglad?</i><br><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>As we finished singing, one of our companions exclaimed, "Wow, that's a lot of pressure to put on us at eight o'clock in the morning!"<br><br>While setting a goal to do good in the world every day may sound ambitious, those who do so find that opportunities abound. The distraction, it seems, is that we get so wrapped up in our own lives that we miss the needs of others all around us. To go an entire day and miss serving those who desperately need our help is to live far below our privileges. As the Savior taught, "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Commenting on this verse of scripture, President Thomas S. Monson taught:<br><br><i>I believe the Savior is telling us that unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives. Those who live only for themselves eventually shrivel up and figuratively lose their lives, while those who lose themselves in service to others grow and flourish--and in effect save their lives.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Finding ways to serve others, whether early in the morning or late at night, is essential to achieving spiritual balance and purpose in our lives. Our best example is the life of our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. Even as he leads the affairs of a worldwide Church, his focus continues to be on his personal ministry. I cite just one such example.<br><br>One day President Monson received a phone call from a woman he did not know. She explained that her father, Bernardo Salas, was dying of cancer and that his great desire was to meet President Monson before he died. She left an address and asked if the prophet would consider visiting her father.<br><br>According to President Monson, as he left the office that night, he felt impressed to visit Brother Salas in his home. In rather heavy traffic and with dimming lights, President Monson several times missed the street where Brother Salas lived. After offering a silent prayer, he felt impressed to turn around and attempt to find the home driving from the opposite direction. As he approached the street, he noticed a street sign lying on the ground and a tiny residence some distance from the main road. Driving into the lane, he was greeted by a small girl who ushered him into the house. President Monson speaks tenderly of the blessing he shared with Brother Salas and of his opportunity to minister to the Salas family.<br><br>In President Monson's own words he shares how he felt upon leaving the Salas home:<br><br><i>As I drove homeward, I reflected on the special spirit we had felt. I experienced, as well, as I have many times before, a sense of gratitude that my Heavenly Father had answered another person's prayer through me.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>The scriptural passage "I was sick, and ye visited me"<sup>16</sup>is not simply a catchphrase for President Monson; it is his constitution for life and the true course to eternal happiness.<br><h2><b>Conclusion and Testimony</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, on this special day of commencement I hope you will take a few minutes to reflect on how a multitude of seemingly small choices have qualified you for the rich blessings of a loving Heavenly Father and have brought you to this point in life. More important, I invite you to look forward and think about how the small steps you will take in the days to come will allow Heavenly Father to assure your destiny and ultimate happiness in the future. I share my personal witness that what Heavenly Father has in store for you begins now. Please consider how your lives will be affected as you (1) seek spiritual experiences every day, (2) continue to work hard with purpose and balance, and (3) look for opportunities to serve everyone around you. Indeed, your future will be blessed as you come to understand that what you do each day shapes who you will become in the future--that tomorrow truly is today. I express my personal congratulations and best wishes to each and every one of you on this special day and leave my testimony and this message with you in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Craig C.

<br>
Sister Jensen and I are pleased to be here, along with members of our family. I acknowledge my total dependence upon the Lord, and I have prayed and do pray now that during this devotional we will allow the Holy Ghost to be the true teacher that He is--about which I will say more in my message.<br><br>The theme of this Campus Education Week and the title to my remarks is "That All May Be Edified," coming from Doctrine and Covenants 88:122:<br><br><i>Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.</i><br><h2><b>Definition of Edify</b></h2><br>The word<i>edify</i>comes from the French<i>edifier</i>and from the Latin<i>aedificare</i>and means to "improve spiritually" and to "instruct" (Robert K. Barnhart,<i>The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology</i>[New York: H. W. Wilson Company, 1988], s.v. "edify," 315). The<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>gives this meaning: "In religious use: To build up (the church, the soul) in faith and holiness; to benefit spiritually; to strengthen, support" (2nd ed., s.v. "edify," 5:71). Thus, to edify is to instruct and improve the soul in knowledge generally, and in particular to increase in moral and religious knowledge, in faith and holiness.<br><br>To edify is part of a revelatory process. The word<i>revelatory</i>refers to the supernal gifts of the Spirit, the source of all light and truth. I witness to you that the Holy Ghost is the true teacher in this work. Teaching and learning that lead to edification and heavenly confirmation are fundamental to the Father's plan and require five principles gleaned from verse 122:<br><br>1. A teacher is appointed and recognized as such by the learners.<br><br>2. Teaching and discussion are governed by order and reverence.<br><br>3. What is discussed or said revolves around divine doctrines or truths.<br><br>4. Those who are not speaking have a duty to actively listen.<br><br>5. Both teacher and listener--or the learner--participate respectfully to invite the Spirit.<br><br>Fundamental to my message and the theme is the word<i>that</i>preceding the words "all may be edified." The placement of the word<i>that</i>sets up what some call a cause-and-effect relationship often emphasized using the words "in order that" or "so that." For edification to occur, it is necessary to have an appointed teacher, order and reverence, divine doctrine and truths, listeners, and respectful participation.<br><br>It is instructive to note that the word<i>edify</i>and the word<i>edifice</i>come from the same root. Building an edifice that will pass the test of time requires the right plan and the right materials. Similarly, to be edified and to have heavenly confirmation of your spiritual growth, a foundation has to be in place, and it has to be right. The need for a right foundation is made more relevant from a lesson learned during the building of the Salt Lake Temple.<br><br>In February 1853 President Brigham Young presided over the groundbreaking services. Work proceeded on the excavations and foundation stones for the temple until Johnston's army arrived in 1857. To protect the work, Brigham Young instructed the Saints to fill in the temple trenches with dirt, resulting in a vacant lot that looked like a plowed field when the soldiers walked past it. Following their departure the dirt was removed and the work continued. A few years later, President Young, along with others, made an inspection of the foundation and discovered faulty foundation stones. The faulty stones were replaced with the large granite stones you know today.<br><br>Brigham Young declared:<br><br><i>I want to see the Temple built in a manner that it will endure through the Millennium....</i><br><br><i>... We want to build that temple as it should be built.</i>[<i>JD</i>10:254]<br><br>His relevant words "as it should be built" serve my purpose to emphasize foundational principles that must be right so "that all may be edified."<br><br>Let us now examine more carefully these five essential principles from Doctrine and Covenants 88:122 that lead to edification.<br><h2><b>An Appointed Teacher</b></h2><br>The appointment of a teacher in the Church denotes someone with authority to appoint another. In other words, all true authority in this restored Church is under the direction of or submissive to a higher authority--ultimately God's authority. Today this is done under the direction of ecclesiastical leaders--such as bishops or priesthood presidents with priesthood keys--affirmed by this truth from the Book of Mormon: "And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God" (Mosiah 23:17). It is clear that worthiness is essential: "[They] had appointed just men to be their teachers" (Mosiah 2:4). Being a "just person" is to be guided by truth, divine doctrine, and reason or correct principle. In the Bible the word<i>just</i>means to be righteous or to conform to the laws of God. Alma taught: "Trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments" (Mosiah 23:14).<br><br>At home, an appointment to teach comes from or by the presiding authority of the father:<br><br><i>The father presides over the family and is responsible to teach the children....</i><br><br><i>The mother is an equal partner and counselor to her husband. She helps him teach their children the laws of God. If there is no father in the home, the mother presides.</i>["Organization and Purpose of the Family,"<i>Family Guidebook</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006), 2–3]<br><h2><b>Order and Reverence</b></h2><br>As a people and as a Church we need to improve our attitudes toward and performance of order and reverence, both at home and in our places of worship. In our society today we see more and more evidences of a drift toward casualness in speech, dress, and appearance. I heard President Hinckley say that there is a distressing lack of reverence in the Church. Ihave often heard one of the Twelve say that we need not point the finger at others; rather, he lovingly and candidly says, "You fix you!"<br><br>That this was a concern in the early days of the Church is evidenced by this statement by the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>But to return to the subject of order; in ancient days councils were conducted with such strict propriety, that no one was allowed to whisper, be weary, leave the room, or get uneasy in the least, until the voice of the Lord, by revelation, or the voice of the council by the Spirit, was obtained, which has not been observed in this Church to the present time. It was understood in ancient days, that if one man could stay in council, another could; and if the president could spend his time, the members could also; but in our councils, generally, one will be uneasy, another asleep; one praying, another not; one's mind on the business of the council, and another thinking on something else.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:25–26]<br><h2><b>Divine Doctrines or Truths</b></h2><br>Everything taught in this Church may fit under three headings:<br><br>1. Doctrine<br><br>2. Principles<br><br>3. Applications or Commandments<br><br>Imagine a pyramid divided horizontally into three sections. At the top is the heading "Doctrine: The Why"; in the middle section is the heading "Principles: The What"; and heading the bottom or largest portion of the pyramid is "Applications/Commandments: TheHow."<br><br>As a listener to sayings that come from the pulpit, the classroom, and the home, I have observed that speakers often devote more time and attention to applications and keeping of the commandments--or the how. Less effort is given to the doctrine--or the grand why--and the principle--or the what. As parents and teachers, we should provide our learners with a balance of all three, for, as the Savior taught, "these [things, commandments and applications] ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other [doctrine and principles] undone" (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>As President Boyd K. Packer has taught and re-taught:<br><br><i>True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.</i><br><br><i>The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.</i>["Little Children,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 1986, 17]<br><h2><b>Listeners</b></h2><br>About fifteen years ago a committee was formed to improve teaching in the Church. The Sunday School program "Teacher Development" was rewritten and called "Teacher Improvement." I remember Elder Holland counseling the writing committee members to remember the example of the Savior, who was "a teacher come from God" (John 3:2).<br><br>A few years later, after the implementation of "Teacher Improvement," those at Church headquarters responsible for this emphasis in teaching felt an important element was missing. The concept of learning had been relegated to the backseat of teaching. To place learning in its proper role, the February 2007 Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: Learning and Teaching satellite broadcast was developed. The general presidency of the Sunday School has since made a concerted effort to improve both learning and teaching in the Church.<br><br>As part of the effort to improve learning and teaching, the excellent publication<i>Teaching, No Greater Call</i>was refreshed. I pause to make a comment about this manual. With what I know about education and with the many books written on the subject, I consider it one of the finest books on education anywhere, and I commend it to you for your personal and family use and home library. I encourage you to pay careful attention to "Invite Diligent Learning," section 4 of "Part B: Basic Principles of Gospel Teaching." Stake and ward leaders are encouraged to make use of these materials and this emphasis.<br><br>Thus, in the Church<i>Handbook 2: Administering the Church</i>(2010), the word<i>learning</i>is given an emphasis not seen in earlier Church manuals. For example, the stated purpose of Sunday School is to "strengthen individuals' and families' faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through teaching, learning, and fellowshipping" (<i>Handbook 2,</i>12.1). In that same chapter, under the heading "Improving Learning and Teaching in the Ward," we read:<br><br><i>Members of the ward Sunday School presidency serve as specialists in the ward's efforts to improve learning and teaching. ... They help leaders orient newly called teachers and improve gospel learning and teaching in their organizations.</i>[<i>Handbook 2</i>, 12.5]<br><br>The scriptures themselves are our best sources on learning and teaching--the Savior being the perfect model of a learner/teacher. In addition to the scriptures, an extremely valuable source is the interview Elder L. Tom Perry conducted with President Boyd K. Packer published in the June 2007<i>Ensign--</i>the printed version of the February 10, 2007, Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: Learning and Teaching satellite broadcast. In the following list I draw upon President Packer's wise counsel and add one or two thoughts of my own. Each is introduced with "I am becoming a diligent learner":<br><ul><br> 	<li>when I am teachable and want to learn.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I study, search, ponder, and liken the scriptures to myself and my circumstances.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I ask questions and listen to both what is said by the teacher and not said verbally by others but by the Spirit to me.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I do not resent correction or instruction.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I stay at it and demonstrate persistence.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I observe others, especially the example and counsel of older people.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I pray in specifics for myself and for the teacher.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I retire early and arise early (see D&amp;amp;C 88:124).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I write impressions.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>when I am a punctual, reverent listener in Church meetings and at home.</li><br></ul><br><h2><b>Respectful Participation</b></h2><br>It is important to remember that there are basically two kinds of meetings held in this Church: one is formal and the other is informal. Examples of formal meetings in the Church are sacrament meetings, Sunday sessions of stake conference, and general conference. The Saturday evening session of a stake conference could be a formal meeting, or the presiding officer may make it an informal meeting with audience participation--something we of the Seventy and the Twelve are doing more and more. You have seen or will see that the Campus Education Week presenters determine whether their presentations are formal or informal. Because I will use visuals in my message, this formal devotional will have an element of informality.<br><br>In a formal meeting, audience participation by way of discussion or comments is not encouraged. For example, in a sacrament meeting the speaker should not invite the congregation to open their scriptures and follow along. Of course I may choose to do so on my own and listen attentively, take notes of impressions, and pray for myself, for others, and for the speaker. In a sacrament meeting, as per the instructions in<i>Handbooks 1</i>and<i>2,</i>the use of object lessons or other visuals is not approved.<br><br>On the other hand, in informal meetings such as quorum and classroom instruction, Primary, seminary and institute classes, and especially Church councils (ward and stake--and these include presidency and bishopric councils), listener participation is vital for edification to occur. At home, generally the most effective teaching is achieved when it is informal.<br><br>When I was a young boy attending the old white church in Mapleton, about ten miles south of here, I never carried my own set of scriptures to junior Sunday school or the evening sacrament meeting. Frankly, we did not have personal scriptures. It has only been since 1979 and 1981, the years the current English LDS scriptures were published, that we have obtained our own sets of scriptures and have become a scripture-carrying people. That we should carry them is implied in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them</i>[the brass plates]<i>with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land ofpromise.</i>[1 Nephi 5:22]<br><br>Edification for me is facilitated when I participate in informal instruction, having my scriptures with me as I travel through the wildernesses of life toward my promised land. Of course I must do more than carry them in my hands; I must open them and carry them inmyhead, in my heart, and in my life.<br><br>All are encouraged to bring their own set of scriptures to informal instructional settings so they may open them and follow along, make comments, and share insights. In connection with that approach, parents and teachers should provide opportunities for others to participate, discuss, ask questions, and share insights and experiences. Remember, inspired questions lead to inspired participation and revelatory experiences. Orson Hyde recorded that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Each should speak in his turn and in his place, and in his time and season, that there may be perfect order in all things; and that every man ... should be sure that he can throw light upon the subject rather than spread darkness ... , which may be done by men applying themselves closely to study the mind and will of the Lord, whose Spirit always makes manifest and demonstrates the truth to the understanding of all who are in possession of the Spirit.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:370]<br><br>When a husband and wife understand theseprinciples and truths, they are better prepared to lead their children so that they may be edified through gospel learning. Common settings for learning and teaching are family scripture study, family home evening, and mealtime discussions. Church research shows that these settings are more successful when parents make them relaxed, inclusive, expressive, and engaging. Gospel learning that leads to edification at home is more effective when it is more like a conversation than another meeting.<br><br>This learning is not limited to family home evenings, however. Our children are edified when we daily model correct learning, teaching, and leading. Spontaneous conversations at mealtime discussions, upon arrival from school, at bedtime, on a walk, or while working together provide brief moments suited to each child's attention span that are often one-on-one and relevant with real-life experiences.<br><br>My emphasis thus far has been on these five principles in formal and informal settings such as Church sacrament meetings, classrooms, and the home. Other significant settings in which these five principles are applied so that edification may occur are ward and stake councils, including presidency and bishopric meetings or councils.<br><br>The November 2010 and February 2011 worldwide satellite broadcasts on the Church handbooks and on councils include excellent role-plays based on doctrines, principles, and applications found in<i>Handbook 2.</i>The DVDs illustrate and emphasize what a council meeting should do, be, and accomplish. It is hoped that these excellent instructions will give leaders and parents a greater vision of how they should conduct councils.<br><br>In summary, here are the five principles leading to edification:<br><br>1. A teacher is appointed and recognized as such by the learners.<br><br>2. Teaching and discussion are governed by order and reverence.<br><br>3. What is discussed or said revolves around divine doctrines or truths.<br><br>4. Those who are not speaking have a duty to actively listen.<br><br>5. Both teacher and listener participate respectfully to invite the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Edifying Leadership</b></h2><br>Like teachers, leaders in the Church should strive to edify those whom they lead. Having served here in the heart of Zion as well as having lived and traveled abroad, I have witnessed different teaching and leadership styles. Elder Richard G. Scott articulated these styles for me as follows:<br><br>1. The general or commander<br><br>2. The egalitarian or three commanders<br><br>3. The phantom--meaning the self-reliant<br><br>4. The decision maker<br><br>5. The Lord's leader<br><br>I recognize that there are elements of stereotyping in the following descriptions, but there is much to be learned:<br><br>1.<i>The general or commander:</i>Here, the presiding officer, such as a bishop or a president, either implicitly or explicitly communicates that he presides. Like a military officer, he gives orders to his subordinates, and each one dutifully obeys.<br><br>2.<i>The egalitarian or three commanders:</i>In this case the presiding officer divides the responsibilities so that each has a third of what is to be accomplished--each clearly understanding the lines and limits for which he is responsible, and therefore working to accomplish them.<br><br>3.<i>The phantom:</i>A good description for this leader is he does not delegate. He has two worthy, able counselors but does not know how to use them or does not have confidence in them and does most things himself.<br><br>4.<i>The decision maker:</i>This model has two counselors or advisors and one decision maker. It is based on the Old Testament account in which Moses, as the presiding officer, sat in judgment over all cases, being the "decision maker" (see Exodus 18). I believe that the decision-making leader is more common than the first three mentioned. For example, a very good bishop may ask each counselor to suggest a name to fill a calling in the ward. They discuss it openly, and then the bishop announces either verbally or by his actions, "Thank you for your good counsel, and, as I hold the keys, I will now make the decision and ask you to sustain me in it."<br><br>5.<i>The Lord's Leader:</i>This presiding officer understands and implements the principles of the theme of this Campus Education Week. He understands<br><ul><br> 	<li>the source of his authority and what it is to be an appointed teacher,</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>that order and reverence must prevail in the council meeting,</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>that sayings or divine doctrines and truths will govern all decisions,</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>that listening to each other and to the whisperings of the Spirit of inspiration is fundamental to revelation, and</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>that respectful participation by all will lead to our theme today: "That All May Be Edified of All."</li><br></ul><br>To summarize the role of the appointed teacher in our Campus Education Week theme, I quote from cherished notes in my personal files from a talk given by Elder Spencer W. Kimball to missionaries that I heard as a young missionary fifty years ago:<br><br><i>Brother Lee is my senior, and I am Brother Mark E. Petersen's senior. When we go to work together, he never says, "You do this, and you can't do this." Brother Lee always says, "Now, Brother Kimball, what do you think about this? Shall we proceed along this line; shall we go here; and what shall we do there?" Always. He never tells me what I must do. When Brother Petersen and I go, I try to do the same: "Brother Petersen, shall we move in this direction? What shall we do? How do you feel about this?" It works out perfectly, and everyone is happy. But there is the senior element. When one of us is senior, someone has to take the responsibility; someone has to lead out. And that is all that it is! Sometimes I use "stick men" to show what I mean. I've seen places in missions where the senior companion is the big "stick man" about six feet tall and the little junior companion is way down here. That is not how it should be. We should have two "stick men" the same size. The one has a little more training, and he has been out in the field a little longer, but that doesn't give him any dictatorial rights. They are both the same size; the one leads out in suggesting.</i>[Personal journal of Jay E. Jensen, from a talk given by Spencer W. Kimball, 2January 1959]<br><br>The phrase "one leads out in suggesting" has become central to my life and ministry as a husband, father, grandfather, teacher, and Church leader.<br><br>Everything we have been saying about leadership in Church councils, meetings, and classrooms applies equally to marriage, the home, and the family.<br><br>We see in marriages the following:<br><ul><br> 	<li>A husband who is the general, or the commander, giving orders to his wife, whom he views as his subordinate, and she dutifully obeys him.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>A husband and wife who see their marriage as a fifty-fifty arrangement, having equally divided their responsibilities.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>A husband who seeks to manage things himself.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>A husband who sees himself as the decision maker, always seeking input from his wife on important decisions and then exercising his authority to decide and asking her to support him.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>A united couple with a husband who understands his role from the example of the Savior and temple covenants. He leads out in suggesting--not demanding, not commanding, and not insisting. He understands this humorous anecdote about listening: The Lord gave us two ears and one mouth so we may hear twice as much as we say.</li><br></ul><br>Having served in the Presidency of the Seventy, and with regular meetings with the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, as well as traveling with them and their spouses, I have seen and experienced how the Lord's leaders work in unity and harmony in presidency meetings, Church councils, and in their marriages.<br><br>In the meetings of the Presidency of the Seventy, each expresses his views openly, we listen carefully to each other, we weigh all available information, we discuss, we ponder, we pray, and we always reach a consensus as guided by the Spirit. Our decisions are described in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>The decisions of these quorums ... are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity;</i><br><br><i>Because the promise is, if these things abound in them they shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:30–31]<br><br>The idea of being fruitful in the knowledge of the Lord is captured by the Apostle Paul with these words: "But we have the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16).<br><h2><b>The Role of the Holy Ghost in Edification</b></h2><br>Let me be very clear about this. Edification will occur only through and by the power of the Holy Ghost. He is the true teacher in all spiritual learning and teaching. Although this is a very large classroom, let's illustrate these verses with the following description. Imagine at the top that I write the word<i>God,</i>and at the bottom I draw a few stick figures of us--the people, the learners. Then I draw a vertical line representing revelation or communication connecting God to man and man to God, showing two-way communication of prayer and revelation. To the side and a little bit above the learners I draw a stick figure of me, the teacher, and draw a line from me to God, connecting us by prayer and revelation. Then I finally draw a line from me to the people, showing a connection or a relationship or role with the people, the learners. This illustrates that God is the true Teacher, and He does so by and through the Holy Ghost, who "was sent forth to teach" (D&amp;amp;C 50:14).<br><br>The importance of being off to the side and a little above is confirmed by President Harold B. Lee: "You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is" ("Stand Ye in Holy Places,"<i>Ensign</i>, July 1973, 123). Being on higher ground comes by an assignment to be a teacher and, in informal settings, the invitation to be a spokesman. Thus in informal settings we regularly rotate our position on higher ground happily and willingly as we surrender our place the instant someone else becomes spokesman, allowing all to have an equal privilege--that all may be edified of all.<br><br>Thus, for edification to occur, we have different but not superior roles. Alma taught: "The priest [did] not [esteem] himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner" (Alma 1:26).<br><br>I will give a caution. No wise parent, teacher, leader, or missionary would ever want to place himself or herself between the Father and the people, thinking that his or her role is to edify, for their primary role is to turn people to the Lord, to allow them to act, rather than be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:13–14; D&amp;amp;C 93:30). In particular, parents will pray to be wise as they raise children--to know when to answer their children and when to turn them to the Lord to obtain answers.<br><br>Let me share with you a common example. Most missionaries, if not all, have what we call "eternal investigators." An eternal investigator is one who is edified through the love, care, teaching, and testimonies of the missionaries rather than through the Holy Ghost and His role to teach. They have, in effect, placed themselves between the investigator and light and truth from God through the Holy Ghost. The investigator-learner is dependent upon these wonderful missionaries. Some call this living on borrowed light.<br><br>Having been a full-time seminary teacher and early-morning seminary coordinator in daily informal learning settings, I can witness to the truth of Elder Richard G. Scott's wise counsel when he taught:<br><br><i>Never, and I mean never, give a lecture</i>[or a lesson]<i>where there is no student participation. A "talking head" is the weakest form of class instruction. The following passage from the Doctrine and Covenants reveals a principle much worth using:</i><br><br><i>"He that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth[.]</i><br><br><i>"Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth,</i>understand one another,<i>and</i>both are edified<i>and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:21–22;</i>[emphasis]<i>added).</i><br><br><i>The verb</i>[s<i>preach</i>]<i>and</i>understand [refer]<i>to that which is</i>[said and]<i>heard. It is the same message to all.</i>Edified [and<i>rejoice</i>concern]<i>that which is communicated by the Holy Ghost. The message can be different and tailored by the Spirit to the needs of each individual. Assure that there is abundant participation because that use of agency by a student authorizes the Holy Ghost to instruct. It also helps the student retain your message. As students verbalize truths, they are confirmed in their souls and strengthen their personal testimonies.</i>[An Evening with Elder Richard G. Scott, "To Understand and Live Truth," address to CES religious educators, Jordan Institute of Religion, 4 February 2005, 3]<br><br>Elder Scott's wise counsel should help teachers, leaders, and parents to avoid the pitfall of teaching lessons and not people, evidenced by either the comment or the action that "we must hurry on and cover all the material." Those who teach in this way do not allow us to act; rather, we are being acted upon. Increasing our exercise of agency as teachable learners increases our spiritual growth.<br><br>Agency is central to authorizing the Holy Ghost to edify or instruct:<br><br><i>And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am Imighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</i>[2 Nephi 33:1]<br><br>Please note the preposition<i>unto.</i>Only when we exercise our agency will the Holy Ghost edify and carry it<i>into</i>the heart. The Savior said, "I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20). In this way we see fulfillment of the promise that "the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, ... shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26).<br><br>In conclusion, edification will occur only when teachers and learners direct all their efforts in a shared responsibility to establish a climate where the converting power of the Spirit is present. The atmosphere or climate must be spiritual, warm, open, and reciprocal. Leaders, teachers, and parents will be more successful as they become more Christlike and adapt and respond to needs without being coercive or manipulative. By assignment, the appointed teacher is to lead out in suggesting ways to promote learning, in teaching divine doctrine, and in doing all in his or her power to create an atmosphere or setting that will invite the Holy Ghost to come and do what He alone may do so "that all may be edified ofall."<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>I witness that God our Heavenly Father lives and that He loves us and knows us by name; that Jesus Christ is His only Begotten Son, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind; that in all teaching and learning the Holy Ghost is the true teacher, the revelator of all truth, the testator of the Father and the Son and the restored gospel, which is the doctrine of Christ; that Joseph Smith conversed with the Father and the Son; that the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and it is true; and that Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet today, and he and fourteen other men are truly prophets, seers, and revelators. May we become better learners and teachers so "that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege," I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Jay E. Jensen was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional was delivered on 16 August 2011 during Campus Education Week.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>the Future - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As is usual at this great season of the university calendar, I share your excitement and enthusiasm for the start of another academic year filled with anticipation and expectation that the best is yet to come. I admit, as might some of you, a little regret at how quickly summers seem to slip away as we get a little older. Still, the changing of the seasons and the opportunities for new beginnings create for us feelings of exhilaration likely unmatched in other careers and occupations. What a wonderful thing it is to be involved in the life of a university, and what a signal privilege it is when it happens to be at Brigham Young University!<br><br>The theme for this year's annual university conference is taken from Proverbs 29:18: "Where there is no vision, the people perish." We want no one to perish, and particularly are we concerned with you, our students, and our entire community. Although some of us are developing cataracts and others struggle with nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other ocular limitations, I hope through the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and the guidance we receive from our dedicated board of trustees that our very talented and committed BYU community does see clearly the things we are asked and aspire to do. My thanks to all of you and our many other associates in the grand enterprise of Brigham Young University.<br><br>As is my custom on this occasion each year, I will report briefly on some of the developments on campus. I hope you all had the opportunity to see the Bloch exhibition at the BYU Museum of Art last winter and spring. In many respects it was one of the finest things BYU has ever done. While serving in Europe, now some years ago, I had the opportunity to see many of the sacred paintings in Denmark that bear such vivid testimony of the Savior and His mission. When the idea was initially raised to bring these paintings to BYU, I didn't think this exhibition would be possible. Thanks to the vision of our own people and the generosity of important donors, thousands visited the museum and found great inspiration and enjoyment. You are always welcome at the Museum of Art and at our other museums as well. Their exhibitions and displays will not disappoint you. Likewise, we have had--and will have again this year--many wonderful cultural events of great variety.<br><br>We have heard some remarkably outstanding devotional and forum messages recently. Through the David M. Kennedy Center, the Wheatley Institution, and our various colleges and other organizations, distinguished and renowned speakers and presentations have blessed not only our students and the university family but the greater outside community as well. We plan to continue in this tradition this year and invite you to refer regularly to the BYU website, the<i>Daily Universe,</i>and our other publications for these announcements. Outstanding people increasingly want to come to BYU, and we are grateful to have them with us.<br><br>It has been a good year in athletics. In addition to the many wins and championships that we have come to take for granted, we have been witnesses to a nickname, "Jimmer," that has become not only extremely well known but also commonly used as various parts of speech. It seems that almost everyone understands the multiple interpretations of what "being Jimmered" means. During last April's commencement exercises here at the Marriott Center, my wife, Sharon, heard one of the graduating coeds marvel to a friend that they were actually walking on the same floor where Jimmer had played basketball! I would welcome you all to do the same, if you are so inclined, but not until after I finish speaking, ifyou please.<br><br>In spite of the tenuous economy for the last few years, we have had considerable activity on the construction front. Just a week and a half ago, President Henry B. Eyring was on campus to dedicate the new BYU Broadcasting Building and the Information Technology Building. He was accompanied by Elders Nelson, Oaks, and Ballard of the Twelve, who serve on the board of trustees. We also were blessed to have many donors and special contributors and friends with us as well.<br><br>Both of these impressive new facilities reflect the changing times in which we live, and, with the encouragement and support of our board of trustees, we are determined to do what we can and must to take advantage of new technology and developments. Doing so will allow us to continue to progress on campus as well as take our message and that of the Church to the world in unprecedented ways. Many have contributed in various ways to these facilities and initiatives, and they deserve recognition and our profound thanks.<br><br>It is impossible to miss the impressive and large student housing project that is emerging on the site of the former Deseret Towers and that will eventually replace the aging Heritage Halls as well. The first two buildings will be occupied during this upcoming academic year, with two more to follow shortly. The board has also approved moving forward with phase two of the project in the months and years ahead, to be followed with additional phases as our resources and capacity allow.<br><br>I suspect you understand that these housing projects, as with others in the past, are financed by generous long-term loans at very favorable interest rates provided by the Church. This allows us to keep rents at levels as low as possible and yet be able to repay the debt incurred. As I have stated in the past, our studies show that students, particularly freshmen, living on campus do better scholastically and report a more fulfilling educational experience when they live in campus housing.<br><br>In addition to the regular maintenance and refurbishing going on across this large and complicated campus, you will see, and sometimes hear and feel, other construction projects that are related to the continued building of utility tunnels. In years past, our water, power, heating, and cooling utilities were buried in trenches. While perhaps less expensive initially, we have learned that as the campus ages, these systems fail and are often very expensive and difficult to manage. Eventually, all these delivery systems will be located in utility tunnels that will allow not only regular inspection and maintenance but will also lessen the emergencies, costs, and interruptions that can be so disruptive and expensive to repair otherwise.<br><br>I have mentioned in the past our plans to move forward in building a new Life Sciences Building. Soon we will present to the board of trustees the report of the planning work that has been done, together with cost estimates and other details for their consideration and, hopefully, their final approval to begin construction. The board recently has also approved the expansion of the Bean Museum, which is made possible because of generous contributions. Other improvements and projects are in various stages of consideration, planning, and implementation.<br><br>With great delight, we learned late last year that the hiring freeze, which had been in place for two years due to the severe recession, was lifted. Because our situation is different from most of the Church's enterprises, we were not asked to "downsize" our operation in any way but only to conserve resources as best we could, including the request not to replace unless absolutely necessary all of the retirees or others who were leaving the university for a variety of reasons. Since the board did not ask us to reduce the size of our student body, faculty, or work force on a permanent basis, but only to become more efficient, we have worked very hard to make sure that our new hires and replacements are of the highest quality in our quest to fulfill our ongoing prophetic charge of making BYU the best it can be. We have learned much and will be stronger than ever before in the days and years ahead.<br><br>We continue to be asked to be conservative in our expenditures and requests, and our resource planning process has reflected the courage of our university leadership in this regard. They have listened very carefully to what our leaders have asked of us. In turn, the board has given commendation and thanks to our university leadership broadly.<br><br>Some of you who are new will recognize that you have been recruited, selected, and hired with special care at every level. Because this is so important to the university and the board of trustees, we anticipate that it will take another two to four years to fully staff all of our open or soon-to-be-open slots. In the meantime, I once again offer my sincere expressions of gratitude to all who have cooperated with and supported our efforts so admirably during this interesting period. We have not faced the horrific challenges some other institutions have faced in forced layoffs, closures of departments or programs, and other financial challenges. We have, however, dealt with significant pain and tremendous sacrifice on the part of many who have not let our progress or the quality of the work we do lag in any way. What a wonderful tribute to the cause we represent and to those of you who are responsible for making it happen so well.<br><br>We can all appreciate that our economy is still fragile and uncertain. We are so grateful for the care, wisdom, and consistent support of our board of trustees in these interesting times. It is clear that our principles will not change and the continued determination of our current leadership in the various organizations across campus is noticed and highly valued by our board and other Church leaders.<br><br>As many of you know, Professor John S. Tanner completed his extended term as academic vice president earlier this year and is now presiding over the Brazil So Paulo South Mission of the Church. He served with distinction and has left us with the university even more solid than it was when he assumed the position. We are grateful for all he has done and look forward to him rejoining the faculty in 2014.<br><br>Although he did not seek the job, I have been very pleased that we were able to persuade Professor Brent W. Webb to assume the assignment as our academic vice president. On the job for only a few months, he is already making significant contributions to the university that will endure for a very long time. The active faculty will have the opportunity to hear from him this afternoon. We are very grateful for his willingness to serve. He brings much to his office and to the President's Council.<br><br>In another important transition in university leadership, Dean David B. Magleby recently completed his second term as the leader of the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences. Dave has been a tireless and courageous administrator, and I am very happy that he will have the privilege of a long overdue leave at the University of Michigan this next academic year. He has set a strong example and has made difficult decisions that have significantly strengthened this very large and complex college over the last decade. Many others have also completed various assignments at the university recently, and I hope they all know of our gratitude for their service and contributions.<br><br>In that context, I am pleased to add my welcome to Professor Benjamin M. Ogles, who is now serving as the new dean of the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences. He comes back to BYU after many years of distinguished accomplishment and leadership at Ohio University. In this college, as in others, we have what a coach might describe as a "deep bench"--meaning we have several faculty members who are qualified to assume these major leadership roles. It is a credit to the college and the university that a person of the stature of Ben Ogles has been recruited to join us and work with us in our assigned quest to become the best we can be.<br><br>I might mention others of you of great distinction who are joining us or who are assuming new responsibilities. BYU is an amazing place, and the talent of our leadership is substantial, as is their devotion to our unique and special mission. Across the board, I don't believe we have ever in our history had a stronger corps of exceptional people working to help fulfill the prophetic mission of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Any report on our activities and achievements should also make mention of our various performing groups, the individual achievements of students and faculty, and the continued high recognition given to so many of our academic programs. Likewise, the past year has been an impressive and memorable one in athletics.<br><br>There is a very long list of team championships, all-American honors, and other recognitions. Jimmer Fredette and his teammates brought much attention and admiration to our university, and we could mention other athletes, performers, events, and high accomplishments as well.<br><br>Perhaps the point of more questions than any other during the past year with respect to athletics has been the decision we made, with the full support and encouragement of our board of trustees, to leave the Mountain West Conference and become independent in football while joining the West Coast Conference in most other sports.<br><br>Although many still do not believe or understand our true motivations for these decisions, it is really quite straightforward. It is to do our very best to position our athletic programs and other components of the university in such a way that our light can shine brightly for as many of our friends, alumni, Church members, and others as possible. While we had hoped that our previous arrangement would provide the exposure and coverage we desired and knew to be possible, it simply did not develop that way. Meanwhile, we are now free to associate closely with a group of academically excellent, faith-based universities in the West Coast Conference. The landscape in competitive university athletics continues to shift, but don't be too anxious to accept the rumors and prognostications about possible new allegiances and relationships for BYU. We are delighted to be right where we are.<br><br>Now, with the tremendous reach and capacity of BYU Broadcasting and our new partnership with ESPN, most of our key athletic contests will be available nationally with the possibility for all interested fans and others to see them wherever they live. In this we will be able to maintain our strict policy against Sunday play and also protect the other necessary and significant values so unique to BYU.<br><br>In more than half of my annual university conference messages, I have addressed the matter of our accreditation as a university. If you are hoping that I will again raise this matter this August, I won't disappoint you. For those who might wish that I would not mention this topic, I hope you will forgive me. In fact, it is a reality never far from our thinking and consideration. It is not because our accreditation or academic standing is in question. Itis because, nationally, accreditation is coming under increasing scrutiny and pressure from a number of sources. It is also because having impeccable accreditation is our best defense against the various assaults we receive with respect to our values and our religious mission.<br><br>One of the great comforts to us is that we have always tried to be completely open with others and ourselves as to who we really are and what it is that we are really about. In that sense, we have recently reviewed with care and concern our board-approved Mission Statement and the BYU Aims, which have been in place for many years. In the very unlikely event that these are foreign or foggy to you, please look them up in available documents and on our website. It is a testimony to me that they have stood the test of time and are as relevant and reflective of who and what we are as they have ever been. The expectations and requirements in this area continue to be increased, and we will need to continue to respond, grow, and improve. We are grateful to Jim Gordon, Brent Webb, Jeff Keith, and the many others throughout the university who take our responsibilities seriously and are faithfully and expertly preparing for the reports to be submitted and the accrediting team visits scheduled in the coming months.<br><br>As this group all appreciates, BYU is absolutely unique in the universe of American higher education. Not everyone--individuals or institutions--understands or appreciates who and what we are. Because we are different, aspiring for greatness in both our religious and academic missions, it is absolutely essential that we represent ourselves in the very best and most accurate light.<br><br>There are some things that do favor us. First, we as an institution have the privilege and responsibility to define ourselves, our mission, our identity, and our goals for ourselves. It is by our own stated standards and aspirations that we are largely judged. Second, the quality of a BYU education and the complementary recognition accorded our present students and accomplished alumni are better known than ever before. Third, and I say this carefully and advisedly, we have the guidance and support of a remarkably supportive and insightful board of trustees who feel with us the hand of heaven as we attempt to move the university forward. Fourth, we have uncommonly dedicated and competent faculty and staff who are committed to making BYU shine in this process by assuring that we are really doing what we aspire to do in excellent ways and then presenting the evidence of these behaviors in compelling clarity. Fifth, and likely more important than most considerations, are the outstanding young people who come to BYU to study.<br><br>In terms of objective qualifications, by no means sufficient by themselves for admission to this university, our top 1,000 students in each entering class would be admissible at virtually any university in the country. Incredibly, to those who don't know us well, four out of every five offers we make to prospective students are accepted, and those students come to BYU. Only Harvard rivals BYU in terms of the high rate of entrance of the students who are accepted.<br><br>Meanwhile, there are also some issues that challenge us more than ever before. Because of the scrutiny that the accrediting agencies themselves feel from both the public and the government, their requirements are becoming more demanding, arduous, and consuming of effort and resources. Let me give just two examples in this regard. Learning objectives and specific learning outcomes are required for not only every academic program but now also for every course that we offer. You can imagine the amount of additional work and effort required as we come into compliance. While this is occurring, the cycle of reaccreditation is shortening. What was once a ten-year rotation is now a seven-year rotation, and, to even out the number of annual reviews for the agencies, we are in the midst of a five-year cycle that has no reflection on our high quality. Some institutions have one or three years in their cycle under the new standards.<br><br>In addition to our university-wide accreditation, our various departments and programs must deal with more than forty different discipline-specific accreditation requirements and processes. Thus we have more than ample opportunity to explain who we are, what we do, and how we do it so very well for the wonderful and able students we serve. Almost our entire campus community is involved in these endeavors in one way or another, and I express sincere and profound appreciation for the consistent, wise, and loyal efforts made in behalf of Brigham Young University.<br><br>In the last few years a number of factors have encouraged us to move away from Blackboard and develop the BYU Learning Suite. This new set of digital learning tools allows us to integrate our university AIM data with the tools that faculty and students need most. We feel that both faculty and students will be greatly benefited by the integration and new functionality that the BYU Learning Suite offers. If you have questions and would like to learn more about the BYU Learning Suite and the transition time line, please attend today's noon session in the Wilkinson Center Ballroom.<br><br>One of the features of BYU that impressed me when I first arrived and continues to encourage me today is the contribution made by our Faculty Center--especially to new faculty but also to some of us who have been around for a relatively longer time but are still trying to improve our teaching performance and contributions. I know of no other institution that has the consistent, long-term involvement with new and continuing faculty we are blessed to have at BYU. I am confident that those of you faculty members just arriving at BYU will avail yourselves of the help and encouragement in your duties that you will find there.<br><br>Of course the activities of the Faculty Center do not replace or compete with the necessary collegial support and mentoring that you have the right to expect from senior colleagues and especially from your deans and chairs. All of us who have experienced some success in our academic careers must give appropriate credit and thanks to those who have mentored and taught us by example and by precept. Mentoring at every level is vital for both the faculty and the university. It can also be one of the most rewarding parts of the significant work done here.<br><br>One of the important activities of the Faculty Center in recent months has been a study to determine the characteristics of those deemed to be the most successful as exemplary teaching members of our faculty in creating an atmosphere in their classes that is both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging. Last spring, Professor Alan Wilkins, representing himself and several colleagues, made an interesting and insightful presentation to our senior academic and administrative leadership on this important study related to the hopes and expectations of our students. They have gathered data not only from the most effective of our faculty based on student assessment but also from the students themselves.<br><br>I believe Academic Vice President Brent W. Webb will speak to this topic in more detail this afternoon, but I do want to mention what was most instructive and impressive for me. First, there is not one size or approach that fits all. Second, what the faculty member does and how she or he acts with students affects them much more than the specifics of what is said. For example, faculty members who make obvious efforts to know their students by name and are clearly interested in them as people with impressive and important potential seem to have a much greater positive impact than they would with their degree of polish in pedagogy or their command of subject. Third, the students are very attuned to whether or not they perceive the faculty member to be authentic and genuine. Striving to live the gospel and being fully aligned with the Mission and Aims of a BYU Education seem much more important to the students than do specific actions such as having prayer in class or having scriptural references included in discussions ofclass topics.<br><br>I am grateful to our BYU Faculty Center colleagues and to all who have contributed to this important work that is helping us understand ourselves better than ever. I am grateful to our students--who have been thoughtful, candid, sometimes critical, but usually quite generous in their contributions as well. All of this can help us become the best we can be.<br><br>I am now at the stage of my life and my BYU experience in which my wife, Sharon, occasionally reminds me as I begin to speak that I have already shared a specific treasured story or experience with a particular friend or audience. When I do so, I hope you will forgive me if you are so subjected to such a trial. As Elder Maxwell used to say, when he was not much older than I am, "I've reached the stage where I can hide my own Easter eggs." On the other hand, there are some things worth repeating.<br><br>I have mentioned before our need to be constantly monitoring and improving our collegiality, civility, courtesy, and sensitivity to each other. I believe we are making progress, but we still have some work to do. Elder Quentin L. Cook's April 2011 general conference address touched upon some of these issues that should concern members of our community. I hope you will all review and ponder his message.<br><br>We emphasize with some regularity the importance of integrity in all that we do--not in just the big things, as vital as they are, but also in the seemingly little things that can set an unfortunate pattern or cause lapses in judgment or conduct that would not occur if careful antecedent consideration had occurred. This is not just a BYU issue, although it is a BYU concern. The First Presidency gave counsel and caution on these matters to the General Authorities and Area Authorities in a training meeting recently. We hope and expect that you will all stay well away from the line.<br><br>Although in the past I have shared my views on the relationship between teaching and research or creative work, honorable questions are still asked. For that reason, let me share a part of a paragraph from the University Rank and Status Policy that is the standard by which we judge these things and that Iendorse:<br><br><i>The highest purpose of scholarly and creative work</i>[scholarship]<i>is to serve God and humanity. Scholarship should contribute to the university mission. It should achieve one or more of the following objectives: improving the education of the minds and spirits of students, contributing to the expansion of truth throughout the world, facilitating the solution of pressing world problems, and enhancing the quality of people's lives. Scholarship extends the university's influence and reputation, which benefits our students, serves our local and worldwide communities, and makes friends for the university and the Church. Scholarship should infuse and inspire the faculty member's teaching both directly and indirectly. It must not interfere with or detract from teaching, but support and strengthen it. University faculty members must be learners in order to be teachers worthy of the name. They must be intellectually alive and current in their disciplines, not only through participating in the substantive developments of the discipline, but also through constantly honing the skills and tools of scholarship used in the discipline.</i>[University Rank and Status Policy 3.4.1]<br><br>There is more, and I invite you, if you are interested, to read the entire section of this policy. I did not write it or participate in its creation, but I do endorse it and believe it accurately describes the standards by which we should operate.<br><br>Because of Sister Samuelson's caution and because I have now had the privilege of addressing this particular group many times--notwithstanding, mercifully, that some of you are new--I have read each of my previous annual university conference addresses again this past summer. While I can see now where I might have said some things with greater clarity, I do stand behind what I have said, because I believed it then and do so fully now. For those of you with excessive time and boring lives, you might also refer to those addresses, should you have any doubts or confusion about the things I regard to be of significant importance at BYU.<br><br>Since very few of my thoughts are truly original, and I intentionally refer without apology to our founding documents, scriptural supports, and the comments of prophet leaders, an even better and likely more productive exercise for you would be to go to these original sources yourselves. I will not give an exhaustive list today but will encourage you to develop your own. Our Mission and Aims documents are widely available, and I hope they will be even more widely read, understood, and incorporated in your thinking and your doing. President J. Reuben Clark Jr.'s "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," President Spencer W. Kimball's "The Second Century of Brigham Young University" address, the talks and presentations by President Hinckley and President Monson at BYU, and others will do for you what you need to do for our students. That is, be spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging. And it goes without saying that regular and rigorous study in the scriptures is necessary in addition to whatever else in a general or disciplinary way you are reading, writing, and pondering.<br><br>In my concluding moments, let me tell you about an interesting exercise our President's Council has undertaken in recent months. Commissioner Paul V. Johnson suggested that we consider our thoughts and predictions about what our university would be like in ten years. I believe his purpose in asking this of each institution is so that he might help us and also our board anticipate resources and efforts that will be necessary for our improvement and capacity to meet increasing challenges.<br><br>Each member of the President's Council undertook a study in his or her areas of responsibility and was asked to think about the things we must not only be prepared to react upon but also what may impact us from the outside. In other words, what are those things we must be doing internally to reach the prophetic destiny with which we have been charged? At the outset, and today, on many particulars, we are agnostic. That is, we do not know fully what the future holds for us. On the other hand, because we know the basis for our organization and because of our understanding of the remarkable concern and support for BYU by our prophet leaders, we understand the responsibility we have to keep moving this great institution along its charted course in becoming what it eventually must be.<br><br>With good reason and conviction, we believe that in the next decade BYU will be much like it is today, but better. Some institutions are struggling for survival. We are not. Some are striving to change their missions or their roles in education. We are not. Some have forgotten their foundational roots and reasons for establishment. We hope we have not and are committed that this will not happen.<br><br>We recognize that while some things remain the same, some are changing dramatically, and we will need to be wise enough and courageous enough to recognize when and how we will adapt. Let me share a few examples.<br><br>Our auxiliary services have facilitated the campus very well for many years, but they are under immense pressure in a number of ways. There is increased competition in such areas as the Bookstore as we transition from traditional textbooks and change the way we obtain course materials. Our beautiful campus is aging, although a great job has been done to keep facilities in excellent condition, and new ones are added when necessary. Technology is wonderful but creates tremendous changes in our necessary personnel qualifications, characteristics, needs, and opportunities. A similar point could be made about the ever-increasing regulations and reporting requirements facing all institutions of higher education.<br><br>From an academic perspective, I have already mentioned the rapid trends in accreditation and regulation. The nature of our libraries is changing rapidly. We will still have and want books, but we see new and expanding digital and internet information distribution models. New disciplines are emerging and older ones are changing. Traditional lectures and other learning modalities are being supplemented or replaced with online learning.<br><br>With respect to students, they are changing too. Not only are there going to be more than ever, and more with excellent qualifications, but, in some respects, their needs and expectations are different as well. Traditional dormitories are no longer acceptable to many, and apartment-style living is becoming the norm. More students with various disabilities or special needs are arriving, and financial aid for students from both public and private sources is at best uncertain and likely dramatically decreasing. With changes in the health care delivery system being mandated, the future of student health services is uncertain. Our students have contributed significantly to the recognition Utah has received as the top volunteering state in the nation, with Provo being the top volunteering city. Last year approximately 24,000 BYU students participated in some meaningful service. The list can go on. What the students choose to do and are asked to do is different from what past generations did and will almost certainly continue to change.<br><br>I have mentioned the shifts we have made in athletics. Much of the nation is caught up in an unsustainable arms race that we hope to avoid and believe we will. We feel most fortunate to be members of the West Coast Conference. Without exception, each of the nine members, now including BYU, has a rich and ongoing religious identity and relationship. Each is highly selective academically, and all are determined to maintain their focus on high academic quality and practical religious values and practices while sponsoring athletics in an excellent way as well.<br><br>I have mentioned our excitement about developments in BYU Broadcasting. While we will continue to have the fundamental educational broadcasting mission we have always had, we are also asked by the Church to help attract and retain larger audiences of both LDS and non-LDS people who share our values. We are still finding our way but anticipate continued success as we stick with our principles and prophetic guidance.<br><br>We will have expanding roles in Continuing Education that will be different and will accommodate more students than ever. We will continue to serve our communities but will also always remember that our primary focus is on our campus and the students here. Because of advances in technology, built on the firm foundation of many years of innovation in delivery methodology, we see tremendous possibilities for increasing our reach and our effectiveness.<br><br>We are committed, with board direction, tocontinue to be a university of positive distinction in all that we do. We are and will be a primarily undergraduate teaching university with selected graduate programs of accomplishment and stature that support, rather than supplant, our primary teaching mission. Through our various programs, both on campus and around the world, including the vehicle of BYU Broadcasting, we will advance the message and mission of BYU so that it will be recognized as a light unto the world.<br><br>We are aware of the risks of hubris but also are grateful for the assurances we have as a prophet-led and revelation-guided institution of higher learning that is committed to fulfilling its mission "in [the Lord's] own way" (D&amp;amp;C 104:16). It is my conviction we can and will succeed in helping Brigham Young University meet the charge given to it and to all who are blessed to study and serve here.<br><br>God does live, and this is an important part of the work authored by Him and His Beloved Son and our Savior Jesus Christ. We are led by apostles and prophets who love and support BYU. Of these things I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cecil O.

<h1>ere There Is No Vision, the People Perish&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to begin my remarks today with a word about my predecessor, John Tanner. For the past six years I have admired John's love of learning, his loyalty to the university, his advocacy of faculty, and his principled approach to decision making. John mentioned early in his administration that his intent was to be an "academic" academic vice president. From my vantage point I found this to be absolutely true. The conclusion of John's service marks the end of a wonderful period of university administration in the academic vice president's office. Going forward there will be far fewer, if any, allusions to Milton and fewer quotes from Shakespeare. And, I regret to inform you, the regular installments of John's "Notes from an Amateur" have come to an end. I confess that I would often save John's "Notes from an Amateur" in my email inbox until I had time to savor them--finding them to be, sprinkled through the year, a bit of the same encouragement and inspiration he annually delivered to us in this setting. I thank John for his service and do so, I'm sure, on your behalf as well as I wish the Tanners well in their new assignment.<br><br>The theme for this annual university conference is the well-known verse from Proverbs: "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18). This seems to have renewed relevance at a time in the university's history when we are considering the hiring of a significant number of faculty and when the economic turmoil might easily rob us of aspiration and direction for the future. Vision is woven into so many dimensions of our theology. The cornerstone experience in the Restoration was the First Vision. In his account of that experience, the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote that after seeking heaven's direction in the Sacred Grove, and before the appearance of the Father and Son, he was surrounded by thick darkness--the antithesis of vision. So many of the ancient prophets were granted as part of their ministry a sacred glimpse--a vision--of the world, its history from beginning to end. Repeatedly the scriptures refer to the adversary's influence as quenching the light or overpowering us "unto blindness" (1 Nephi 15:24). Finally, the strength of the leadership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the membership's sustaining vote of them as "seers"--those with authority to see "things which are past, and . . . things which are to come" (Mosiah 8:17). Indeed, Mosiah told us that "a seer is greater than a prophet" (Mosiah 8:15). Vision is more than just an important and desirable characteristic of service. It is at the heart of governance and progress in the Lord's kingdom. Without it, we shrivel--or perish, in the words of our conference theme.<br><br>An episode from Church history provides both an example of such vision and, I believe, an important parallel for us at BYU. The building of the city Nauvoo by the Saints in the 1840s presented all of the challenges one might expect of a land claimed from the swamps of the Mississippi River, of poor immigrants arriving regularly in the city with few belongings and often very little in the way of preparation to make a living. Over time the city took shape, a temple was conceived, and some in the city began to experience a modest level of stability, prosperity, and comfort. Despite hardship, eventually life in Nauvoo allowed for public lectures, concerts, debates, and even the beginnings of a university.<br><br>During this eighteenth-century period, throughout established communities in America, women were organizing themselves in societies, often religious, with the aim of encouraging moral direction and sustaining those in need. Thousands of such circles were found in towns and cities in the more developed East of the young United States. Latter-day Saint women in Nauvoo were not unaffected by this movement, having either heard of such activities elsewhere or having themselves been involved before joining the Saints in Nauvoo. Wanting to provide charitable aid to the poor in the young city of Nauvoo and seeking to contribute in some way to the construction of the temple, a small group of sisters came together determined to organize themselves formally. They often met in the home of Sarah Granger Kimball. On March 4, 1842, the members of this group voted to draft a set of rules governing the group, and Eliza R. Snow was commissioned to write a constitution and bylaws. These documents were presented to the Prophet Joseph Smith for his approval. Sister Kimball reported that Joseph was impressed with their work, observing that the constitution and bylaws "were the best he had ever seen,"<sup>1</sup>but he said "they were not appropriate to the purposes of the Church as a whole."<sup>2</sup>Inviting the group of sisters to meet with him, Joseph promised that he would provide "something better for them than a written Constitution."<sup>3</sup>The group of twenty women gathered with the Prophet Joseph Smith, John Taylor, and Willard Richards in a second-story room of the prophet's red brick store on March 17, 1842. The result of that meeting was that the women would function beyond the other benevolent societies of the time--organized according to heaven's plan for them and guided by priesthood and prophetic vision. Eliza R. Snow declared "that the popular Institutions of the day should not be our guide [that] we should set an example for all the world, rather than confine ourselves to the course which had been heretofore pursued."<sup>4</sup>The initiative of those sisters and their seeking Joseph's prophetic charge was the genesis of what we recognize to be the Relief Society, which has become a powerful force in the Church and world with membership now exceeding six million.<br><br>The Lord's vision for the Relief Society was not<i>just</i>providing aid to the poor and downtrodden. The new organization would embrace all that was worthy and appropriate from its contemporary peers and would aspire to much more in building the kingdom under the prophetic vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Similarly, Brigham Young University's purpose is more than the rigorous and demanding instruction and faculty scholarship of fine universities elsewhere. According to our Aims, "a BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>5</sup>In October 1975, on BYU's 100th anniversary, President Spencer W. Kimball charted the course for BYU in its second century in a talk delivered to this campus. He declared:<br><br><i>Your light must have a special glow, for while you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>As was the case with the Relief Society, we at BYU are not to be, to borrow the words of Eliza R. Snow, "confine[d] to the course which [has] been heretofore pursued."<br><br>This unique vision and purpose of Brigham Young University was established from its conception. The architect of BYU, Karl G. Maeser, was prepared by the hand of heaven to give leadership to the beginnings of what we now see and enjoy here. Karl grew up in Germany and enjoyed the privileges of the best education Germany had to offer. With that preparation, at the young age of twenty, he began his professional life as a schoolteacher and was soon appointed to the prestigious position of headmaster of the Budig Institute in Dresden. His interest sparked by the reading of an anti-Mormon book, Maeser wrote to the Church's Scandinavian Mission for information. His letter was referred to leaders of the Swiss and German Mission, who thought it was a ruse to entice them to enter Germany, which was hostile to Mormonism at the time and where they would be jailed. Consequently, Brother Maeser's letter was ignored. Karl wrote again, and his second letter was forwarded to President Franklin D. Richards of the European Mission. A mission representative was sent to Dresden, and within two weeks the Maesers had embraced the gospel and sought baptism. Wary of the local police, the Maesers were baptized at midnight on October 14, 1855, in the Elbe River. Karl joined the Church knowing that because of the opposition to the Mormons in Germany at the time, he would have to sacrifice his standing and position in the community.<br><br>Soon he and his wife and two children fled Dresden for Zion under the dark of night. They arrived in London, where, before they could make arrangements for transatlantic passage, Maeser was called on a mission to Scotland. After completing this mission he sailed with his family to America. Just two days from their destination port of New York, one of their two children died aboard ship. Traveling to Philadelphia, Brother Maeser accepted a second mission call, this time to the Southern States, following which he was asked to lead a wagon company across the plains. Finally, five years after the Maeser family left Germany, they arrived in Zion. Once in Salt Lake City, Karl sought immediately to make a living as a teacher. He established the Deseret Lyceum in 1860, seeking to provide education to the children of the Latter-day Saints. Of the teaching environment Karl would later write that he "began teaching in the 15th Ward under conditions so primitive that teachers of today [1890s] can have no conception of them."<sup>7</sup>The Lyceum was not successful financially, and Maeser was forced to seek employment elsewhere. President Brigham Young appointed Karl head of the Union Academy in 1861. It was envisioned that the school would educate students beyond elementary grades from Salt Lake City and surrounding areas.<br><br>In 1867 Brother Maeser's name was called from the pulpit in the Tabernacle at general conference to serve in the Swiss and German Mission, and he left immediately thereafter. In 1869 he became president of the mission. After his return Maeser took up teaching again and was teaching in the Twentieth Ward schoolhouse when an explosion damaged the building. He went immediately to President Brigham Young's office to seek help in repairing the building. President Young responded:<br><br><i>"I have another mission for you." . . .</i><br><br><i>"Yes," said the President, "we have been considering the establishment of a Church school, and are looking around for a man--the man to take charge of it. You are the man, Brother Maeser. We want you to go to Provo to organize and conduct an Academy to be established in the name of the Church."</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Returning the next day to President Young's office for direction in the establishment of the Academy, Brother Maeser was told, "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Brigham Young's emphatic direction to Karl G. Maeser that the restored gospel was to be an integral part of the instruction at the new academy was not an idle one. The deed of trust drawn up by President Young in October 1875 conveyed to the Academy property comprising 1.2 acres and stipulated that in addition to the usual subjects, the "Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants shall be read and their doctrines inculcated in the Academy."<sup>10</sup><br><br>After receiving President Young's assignment, Maeser moved his family to Provo--where the population at the time was 2,800--and set to work. His annual salary the first year of his appointment was $1,200--modest even in pioneer times for a man of his educational stature and position. The fledgling Academy grew and attracted students in increasing numbers but faced a continuous spate of problems that repeatedly left Brother Maeser wondering if the Academy could survive. By 1884, nine years after Maeser came to Provo, Brigham Young Academy hosted nearly 400 enrolled students and seemed on the verge of financial stability. However, on the night of January 27, 1884, the building occupied by the Academy was destroyed by fire. For the next eight years the Academy occupied several temporary buildings and teetered on the brink of financial collapse. Initially fiercely loyal, faculty grew discouraged as they went without pay and their families went hungry. The daunting challenges associated with the survival of the Academy took Karl to the brink of surrender. Brother Maeser wrote to the First Presidency:<br><br><i>I am</i>worn out and sick in spirit,<i>. . . and with all my love for this Academy, I feel that I owe it to my very life, which is needlessly wearing itself out here in an apparently hopeless task, to accept any change that will promise me opportunities for permanent usefulness.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Brother Maeser told his wife and daughter that because he couldn't earn enough to provide for his family, he was going to accept a position at the University of Deseret, where he could get a regular salary. His wife and daughter packed their belongings and waited for several days until his daughter finally asked her father when they were moving.<br><br><i>His response in substance was, "I have changed my mind. I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part in contributing to the fulfillment of that dream."</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>The Academy, nourished by this vision of its future granted to Karl G. Maeser, survived challenge after challenge to its existence and operation. Eventually construction of a new Academy building was undertaken, and on January 4, 1892, the new building was dedicated. That building, restored to its original splendor, is now the Provo City Library. But despite the new accommodations and steady progress in creating a fine educational program, a shortage of resources and mounting debt threatened the Academy. Construction on the Maeser Memorial Building--the cornerstone of which was laid in 1907--was idled for lack of funds. Finally it was concluded that the only option for financing the completion of the building was to divide the land on Temple Hill into housing lots and sell them. Alfred Kelly, a Brigham Young Academy student, was tasked with presenting the idea of the sale of housing lots on Temple Hill in his commencement address. Feeling uneasy about the assignment, he climbed Temple Hill early one morning to pray and was granted what appears to have been the same vision of the Brigham Young University of the future that had come years earlier to Karl Maeser. Rather than propose the sale of the property, Kelly, just a student, shared his visionary experience with those in attendance at the graduation exercises. Benefactors rose to the rescue, pledging support for the Academy and the completion of the Maeser Memorial Building.<sup>13</sup><br><br>The unrelenting problems faced by Brigham Young Academy make the recent hiring freeze seem like a walk in the park. Our challenges today are of a different nature, and we stand on the shoulders of those who struggled to build what we now enjoy. It was the vision of what Brigham Young University could and would be that guided our predecessors in challenges and moved the institution forward. It might interest you to know that the 1.2 acres deeded to launch Brigham Young Academy in 1875 have grown to the present-day 600-acre Brigham Young University campus with some 300 buildings comprising nearly 10 million square feet. These buildings are magnificently maintained on beautiful grounds adorned with landscaping that is the envy of universities elsewhere. Wouldn't Karl G. Maeser be stunned by the campus today--he having served seventeen years of his life in Brigham Young Academy mostly in borrowed and dilapidated facilities?<br><br>One more anecdote adds perspective to the progress we have made on this campus. In the last page of the BYU Library annual report for the academic year 1919 to 1920, the librarian accounted for the use of the $1,000 budget for new book acquisitions, then reported generally on the efficiency of the library operation. In a postscript to the document, the university librarian recounted the laborious drafting of thirty-two unique letters and a number of handwritten notes, then pleaded with then President George H. Brimhall: "Don't you think we need a typewriter?" It is an incredible journey from that plea for a special appropriation for the purchase of a typewriter in the library just ninety years ago to the 9,300 computers today on faculty and staff desks and in student labs across campus that are replaced on a regular and reliable schedule. We have much to be grateful for.<br><br>A look at BYU's past has a powerful effect, providing context and guiding our vision of BYU's future. The life-threatening challenges with facilities and financing are largely behind us, and we can focus with little distraction on fulfilling the destiny of the university. From its birth in 1875 to the BYU of 136 years later, this institution has been guided by prophetic vision implemented by determined faculty of faith and consecration. We are organized with a board of trustees made up of prophet-leaders who, at this particular time in BYU's history, not only have the vision of seers but who have extensive experience in the academic arena as well. Our board extends to us significant trust in setting our own curricular and scholarly directions at the university. In a BYU devotional address delivered in 1992, President Gordon B. Hinckley reaffirmed the more mature academic institution BYU had become since the charge of Brigham Young to Karl G. Maeser:<br><br><i>This is a world-class university, a great temple of learning where a highly qualified faculty instruct a large and eager body of students. These teachers impart with skill and dedication the accumulated secular knowledge of the centuries while also building faith in the eternal verities that are the foundation of civilization.</i><br><br><i>Such is our unqualified expectation.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_trust-accountability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a><br><br>I note President Hinckley's use of the very words with which Karl G. Maeser described the BYU of the future in his dream: "great temples of learning." In his 1975 "second-century" address, President Spencer W. Kimball made a clear statement regarding the faculty role in achieving BYU's destiny when he declared:<br><br><i>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>How can we legitimately stretch our extraordinary students in their learning if we are not learners ourselves? How can we teach in our disciplines unless we can speak credibly in those disciplines and are helping to define them? How can we equip students--many of whom pursue further educational opportunities--to answer the questions of the day in a faithful way if we are not demonstrating the same? With good reason, there is no apology for our aspirations and the high standards to which we hold ourselves in our scholarly work. As faculty we must excel in both legs of the dual mission defined by President Kimball. If we are to be bilingual--equally conversant in our discipline and in our faith--then let us be<i>fluent,</i>even<i>native</i>speakers in both tongues.<br><br>President Kimball's vision of faculty influence on students has been the focus of investigation for the past several years in the Faculty Center. Alan Wilkins, Jane Birch, and Brent Melling have been exploring how we are doing in achieving our Aims of being, at the same time, spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging. Some faculty have wondered whether it is possible to teach in a way that both builds faith and stretches the intellect. Some have feared a dilution of academic rigor as they share their faith. Drawing on student ratings, the Faculty Center has recently examined the correlation between two variables for all university classes taught between fall 2006 and winter 2008. To gauge the effectiveness of our efforts to be spiritually strengthening, ratings from four student-rating items were averaged:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Contributed to Aims</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Testimony strengthened</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Integrates gospel into subject</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Spiritually inspiring</li><br></ul><br>As a measure of "intellectually enlarging," the student-survey item "I learned a great deal in this course" was used. The data showed a strong positive correlation between the student's perception of the amount learned in a course and its ability to spiritually strengthen.<sup>16</sup>It is readily acknowledged that this positive correlation does not confirm causality--that being spiritually inspiring<i>guarantees</i>increased intellectual learning, or vice versa. The positive correlation does indicate, however, that the two are not mutually exclusive and, further, that they may be mutually reinforcing.<br><br>As a follow-up to the analysis of student-ratings data, a survey instrument was sent by the Faculty Center to a random sample of 1,200 sophomores and juniors. The survey sought to investigate student attitudes toward the importance of these unique BYU educational Aims and, further, their perception of how the university meets them. In response to a question as to whether "every course at BYU should be both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging," 90 percent of the students registered agreement at some level: "somewhat agree," "agree," or "strongly agree." Only 3 percent of students "disagreed" or "strongly disagreed."<br><br>When asked to assess the importance of courses being both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging, an astounding 90percent of students indicated that creating a learning environment that integrates both of these dimensions of our Aims is either "somewhat important" or "very important." Asked to determine whether courses at BYU are meeting their expectations in this regard, nearly 60percent of students expressed feeling that it is "very important" that courses be both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging, but only 36 percent believed we are doing "very well" at meeting their expectations. The survey reveals emphatically that most students come to BYU courses expecting to find instruction that both strengthens faith and expands the intellect. For the most part we are successful, but it appears we might improve in meeting student expectations.<br><br>Student response to a survey question about the frequency of faculty combining the elements of spirituality and disciplinary content in the classroom is quite interesting. Student expectations on the frequency of faculty incorporating spiritual dimensions in the classroom showed a spectrum of responses, with most (86 percent) feeling that the two Aims should be combined in "some" or "most" class periods while 8percent suggested that this should occur "every class period." The results suggest that most students are expecting that BYU courses involve both spiritual and intellectual content with considerable frequency. It is also the students' perception that this is achieved somewhat less often than they expect. Student comments solicited as part of the survey related to this question suggest, however, that they do not want faculty to artificially connect these Aims. In response to student-solicited comments, one student suggested, "I think that teachers and teaching assistants should take advantage of any opportunity they have to share gospel insights and/or connections when it fits in with secular subjects. But I do not feel like it is necessary or even effective if they go out of their way to make a stretched connection."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Students were asked what their professors could do to encourage the combination of secular and spiritual learning in their courses. Suggestions for student consideration in responding to this survey question were drawn from interviews with forty-four professors from across campus whose student ratings revealed them to be in the top 25 percent of their colleges in both the amount learned and whether their courses were spiritually strengthening. These factors were rated by students on a 7-point scale--7 being "extremely important" and 1 being "extremely unimportant." The responses are shown below with the importance as determined by aggregate student responses shown numerically.<br><br>Showing they believe in their students' potential--6.51<br><br>Being authentic and genuine--6.47<br><br>Being an example and role model of someone who lives the gospel--6.44<br><br>Helping students prepare to deal with professional ethical issues that persons of faith might encounter--5.97<br><br>Mentioning gospel connections and insights where it flows naturally from the current class discussion or topic--5.95<br><br>Feeling and expressing concern and empathy for the students--5.89<br><br>Having rigorous intellectual standards--5.70<br><br>Taking on controversial subjects in their field with a gospel perspective--5.56<br><br>Sharing personal experiences of reconciling differences between their faith and intellect when faced with difficult issues--5.53<br><br>Being personal and sharing personal experiences--5.43<br><br>Praying in the classroom--5.42<br><br>Explicitly sharing their testimony on occasion--4.90<br><br>Being open to deviations from the lesson plan to address gospel topics or questions from the students--4.80<br><br>Continuing honest attempts at bringing in the gospel, even if awkward at times--4.74<br><br>Sharing spiritual thought, devotionals, scriptures, or hymns during class--4.34<sup>18</sup><br><br>The student responses shown in the table reveal, interestingly, that what the highly rated faculty thought anecdotally might be considered as the most important to students are among the least important compared to other factors. While students strongly value the combination of spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging elements in their courses, there is a broad spectrum in the related course dimensions with which students resonate. Further, the students do not want to sacrifice intellectual standards for spiritual strength. "Having rigorous intellectual standards" was rated by students as "important"--of even greater importance than some more obvious elements of faithful instruction--and students indicate they are strengthened when faculty have high intellectual standards for them.<br><br>Student responses indicate that all of these elements of combining faith and intellect have some level of importance. However, it is revealing that the factors of greatest importance to students are "Showing they believe in students' potential," "Being authentic and genuine," and "Being a role model of living the gospel." Alan Wilkins and his team have concluded that what students generally find<i>most</i>helpful in integrating the spiritual with the intellectual are<i>characteristics</i>of professors rather than<i>techniques</i>or specific learning activities. Indeed, the students agree that the life and integrity of the professor are more important than what he or she says.<br><br>The Faculty Center's study reveals that students overwhelmingly expect the integration of faith and reason in their courses at BYU. This is undoubtedly part of what motivates them to come (another part certainly being the high concentration of Latter-day Saint young single adults). Of those select few who achieved admission to BYU this year, 78.6 percent enrolled in the university--among the highest yield rates of any university in the nation. These students appreciate that the directive given by President Brigham Young to Karl G. Maeser will be the norm: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<br><br>Given that the Faculty Center's study reveals that students value faculty showing that they believe in students' potential above all other factors, it might be helpful for me to introduce you to the entering freshman class who will populate our classrooms next week. Two-thirds of the more than 11,000 applicants were admitted this year. For those admitted, the average ACT score was 28.1, and the average high school GPA was 3.8--the highest ever for both metrics. Sixteen admits scored perfectly on the ACT exam, and one-third of the admitted class scored 30 or above. And 970 admitted freshmen (13 percent of them) had a perfect 4.0 high school GPA, with more than one in five freshmen having a GPA of 3.98 or above. Slightly more than one in nine students admitted were ranked academically number one in their high school graduating class, and one in six were ranked in the top five. In this freshman class, 96 percent were four-year seminary graduates--roughly one-half of those enrolled in early-morning seminary all four years; 4.3 percent graduated from a high school with a graduating class smaller than 100 students; and 19 percent of those admitted had a full load of Advanced Placement classes in high school while 14 percent had no AP enrollment. Three-fourths of those granted admission have three or more siblings. (One freshman reported having twenty-one siblings!) Roughly one in ten freshmen admitted is a first-generation college student in his or her family, and 9.1 percent have multicultural status.<br><br>We are sometimes prone (perhaps more particularly toward the end of the semester) to view our students as lazy, ill-prepared, entitlement-generation students who excel primarily in whining. However, there can be no doubt that the potential these students are hoping we will see in them is there. It is our opportunity to help them learn academic independence and responsibility, to cultivate discipline and rigor, and to let our passion as learners infect the students. One of my colleagues on the President's Council, Kelly Flanagan, recently shared an experience he had early in his career. At a lunch gathering with colleagues in his department, Kelly, who had taught a particular class several times in succession, lamented, "I am so sick of teaching this class." One of those in the lunch group was a senior colleague whom Kelly admired and acknowledged to be a superb teacher and who had taken an interest in Kelly as a young faculty member. This experienced and wise mentor responded to Kelly's complaint: "This semester, why don't you try teaching the<i>students."</i>This retort by his respected colleague stung a bit, but, after reflection, Kelly changed his teaching approach, and both he and the students benefited for the rest of his career. His colleague's simple suggestion reflects a unique vision of students, each of whom has a different potential and learning style. We sometimes see our courses as a composite of syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, essays, quizzes, term papers, review sessions, midterms, and on and on. We might do well to remind ourselves of the obvious when we sometimes suffer from "faculty fatigue": that all we do centers on our students. We teach<i>people,</i>not courses, and we do it in the classroom, the hall, the lab, the studio, the library, the cafeteria, on the quad, and in our homes.<br><br>I want to say a word about technology in our teaching. Most of you have adopted technology as a mechanism for some portion of your educational delivery and student interaction. A few have not. I encourage you to use technology as it fits your style and to explore its use if you see it can benefit the students. Technology is<i>one</i>tool available to us for enhancing the learning of our students. The university has a long relationship with a particular course content management system called Blackboard, used across campus. Our studies reveal that 95 percent of you use Blackboard for distribution of course documents and information, 84 percent communicate with students via Blackboard's email tool, 77 percent use its grade-book utility, and 31 percent administer quizzes, along with other lesser-used elements of the product. Our studies have also shown that there is a need for learning technology tools that are more modular, more customizable by faculty, and more seamlessly connected to the major databases of the university. Existing commercial products don't have the level of integration we need, nor do they offer teachers and students the flexibility we have heard you desire to enhance learning.<br><br>Consequently, under a unique and successful partnership between the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Office of Information Technology, we have been developing our own set of tools tailored to the BYU faculty and environment. We call it the BYU Learning Suite. Two of the modules in the Learning Suite--Syllabus Builder and Digital Dialog--are available now. Other modules are in development for a release to faculty early in December of this year. In email communications over the past few months, I have apprised faculty of the availability of the BYU Learning Suite. I have also communicated our firm intention to transition away from Blackboard--a transition that is targeted for May of next year. I encourage faculty to consider using the modules currently available in their fall classes. While the two modules now available--Syllabus Builder and Digital Dialog--are<i>not</i>the standalone replacement for Blackboard, they constitute the first step in our move to the new system. Data you enter in these tools will be carried forward to future semesters and to the additional BYU Learning Suite tools that come online later this semester. I recognize this will be a significant change, and transitioning to the new tools will require some additional up-front work on your part. However, I share the confidence and excitement of the developers that the BYU Learning Suite will yield significant benefit to you and to the students. At a recent national Campus Technology Conference in which the BYU Learning Suite was presented, a man from a prominent East Coast university approached the BYU contingent and said, "You are doing exactly what we tried to do at my university but were not able to accomplish. For me personally, your project [the Learning Suite] is the Holy Grail!"<br><br>May I now turn to important faculty matters. Over two and a half years ago, facing an economy on the slide, the board of trustees announced a hiring freeze at BYU and in other units of the Church. That freeze applied to both faculty and staff. Gratefully, the board made it clear that their vision of the fundamental nature of the university would not change, and there was no direction to reduce the number of faculty and students on campus. The entire campus shouldered up under the added strain during this difficult two-year period. You, the faculty, have taught additional sections and additional students. Some of that added effort surely came out of time you would have productively spent on other activities, and perhaps you sacrificed some time at home. We learned to use students in roles not previously designated as student positions. Some faculty who had imminent retirement plans as we entered the freeze postponed their retirement, and we hear anecdotally that they did so to ensure their departments were not short-handed.<br><br>Thank heaven we have students who are bright and trustworthy and faculty who are unselfish and committed. The board allowed us to propose exceptions to the hiring freeze in programs with critical needs--which we did sparingly. Although not without pain, the freeze has given units across campus the chance and a unique motivation to reconsider how programs function and how our faculty resources are positioned. We have heard the deans express that out of the discipline imposed by the freeze has come profitable reconsideration of our operations, our programs, our curriculum, and some needed change.<br><br>In January of this year the board announced a lifting of the hiring freeze. I hope the recent fluctuating economic winds won't call that suspension of the freeze into question. Over the past eight months departments across campus have filled staff positions previously vacant. Departments have begun to recruit faculty and invite them to campus for interviews. Activity in Craig Hart's office has picked up significantly. So far this year we have hired fifty continuing faculty status–track faculty--not quite the pre-freeze annual average of sixty-five permanent faculty hires the campus has seen since 1994. Fifty of our faculty colleagues have already retired this year--up from the average of past years. The net effect of all of this is that, campuswide, we currently have over 180 vacant CFS-track positions. This represents nominally one in eight permanent faculty positions currently unfilled! Unlike what we have seen at some fine universities across the nation, our board has affirmed its support for us returning to our full faculty complement. We have assured the board that we will do this in a measured and deliberate way, suggesting that it will take us three to five years to return to a steady state. This pool of faculty positions--perhaps our most valuable resource at the university--presents both an exciting opportunity and a sobering responsibility. We are so unlike other universities, in which mobile faculty move regularly from one university to the next. The average faculty tenure at BYU is twenty-six years. Generally speaking, faculty come to BYU to stay.<br><br>It is sobering to think that we are now one-third of the way through the second century envisioned by President Kimball. We are now considering faculty candidates who, historical data suggests, will be at BYU through the middle of the twenty-first century and who will take our places in BYU labs and classrooms and as department chairs and deans. We need the vision, determination, and discrimination to hire faculty with extraordinary scholarly and teaching credentials who are also faithful and equally prepared and committed to our unique Aims. In many of our disciplines, gratefully, the pool of candidates qualified to do just that is deep. In others we have some work to do as we encourage gifted students to pursue graduate work and qualify to join our ranks. Let us seek faculty candidates who are not just credible in their disciplines but<i>incredible.</i>Let us seek candidates who are equipped to contribute with their scholarship in a way that shapes their disciplines, who will lead their fields, who are anxious to profess their scholarship in the finest scholarly venues, and who will invite students to be part of that endeavor. We project that finding such extraordinary faculty will take time. The deans are working with departments to assure that our hires meet this standard. With the excitement of new faculty hires, the fresh perspective and energy they bring, and the additional capacity in carrying the teaching load, we are all inclined to be impatient in making these hires. I hope you will agree with me that there are a number of reasons for hiring deliberately:<br><br>1. The recruiting, interviewing, and hiring process is itself demanding--consuming thought and time and obligating faculty and department administrators to considerable additional responsibility as this is done right. Interacting with candidates, recruiting them, hosting them on campus, and providing collegial follow-up takes effort. I have a dear friend and colleague at a university on the East Coast who served for a time as chair of his department. During one year of particularly intense hiring, he frequently hosted the candidates at dinner in the evening as part of their campus interviews. He lamented to me that he gained twenty pounds that year. Spreading the load of the hiring process over time seems prudent.<br><br>2. Let us be cautious in recruiting simultaneously for multiple vacant slots. In offering this caution I recognize that some departments on campus have a number of open faculty positions, and those vacancies have resulted in considerable added load to the department. Iam sensitive to that, and I am only encouraging us to exercise the vision of our forebears--a vision of the long-term--as we develop and follow careful hiring strategies that we know will guide us decades into the future. Hiring more than one candidate at a time can sometimes result in the hire of a "<i>second-</i>best," no matter how excellent the candidate pool. No one wants to be second best. A phased approach in our recruiting efforts can impose the discipline to discriminate as we evaluate the candidates to identify the most qualified, the best trained, and the most committed to BYU's mission.<br><br>3. Faculty who join our ranks need training and mentoring as they adjust to faculty life and the university's expectations. This demands the time and attention of department administrators and colleagues. New faculty, often functioning independently for the first time, need to learn how to get their scholarship jump-started, how to manage time, how to develop the discipline to write, how to interact with students in the classroom and recruit and involve them in their research, and how to appropriately manage budgets. New faculty need to be taught how to involve themselves as colleagues in the department and the university, how to penetrate their academic associations, and how to navigate the administrative system at the university. Many of our new faculty have never taken full and ultimate responsibility for teaching a course. Frequent encouragement and thoughtful feedback from colleagues--both critical and constructive--are needed to help these new faculty adjust. I believe we can do this better here. I have heard President Samuelson express his desire that we mentor new faculty more carefully, more energetically, and more formally. All of us have benefited from such mentoring relationships and would perhaps have enjoyed more. Encouragement to every department chair and every senior colleague to mentor new faculty--both formally and informally--seems particularly timely as we enter this period. Section 50 of the Doctrine and Covenants, while usually providing direction regarding teaching in the Church, may have real relevance to the mentoring of new faculty: "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22). Senior faculty are certainly not hesitant to preach, but we can all be reminded that both the mentored and the mentor are to be edified and should rejoice together.<br><br>4. Every new faculty hire triggers the need thereafter for careful annual stewardship evaluations, an initial CFS review three years later, and the final CFS review. These formative and summative evaluations must be done thoroughly, carefully, and according to our established policies and processes. Expectations must be clearly communicated early and oral and written feedback given frequently. Many departments have found that faculty committees provide effective feedback to assist the department chair in annual evaluations. I commend this practice to you campuswide. We do faculty no favors when we provide little or no feedback or when our feedback ignores critical areas in which improvement is needed. We can be simultaneously encouraging and candid. All of this evaluation work can be challenging for a department to do effectively if there are too many new faculty at once.<br><br>5. With new faculty hiring often come needs for equipment, laboratory or studio space, supplies, more modest citizenship responsibilities for a time, and other help in getting started. One element of this start-up help is the need for attentive, ongoing mentoring by the faculty colleagues I mentioned earlier. This start-up assistance in all its forms clearly has resource implications. While we are generously resourced at BYU, those resources are finite, and we wouldn't want to handicap our new hires because our resources were spread too thin. Phasing our new faculty hires positions us to address these new-faculty needs effectively.<br><br>6. Finally, hiring strategically requires work on the part of department faculty. Questions related to where the discipline is going, where the department is going, and where students are going all need to be carefully considered in guiding future hires. My experience is that this takes time and doesn't come without the hard labor of discussion and deliberation and evaluation of changing landscapes. Often there is a bit of tension among the faculty that needs resolution in this process. There seems to be little that generates more passion among faculty than hiring, with faculty CFS deliberations a close second. (I recognize here that campus parking is also a passion-generating element of faculty life.) This passion is wonderful, as it illustrates how strongly we feel about our work and how important a decision we see the recommendation of new faculty candidates to be. That passion ignites and sustains our work. However, all such hiring discussions must be cordial and civil, without the intrigue and backroom posturing that can occur in these processes. When a decision is made, sometimes without achieving unanimity in the department, I would hope we would move forward with unity to support the new hire and do all that is possible to assure his or her success. Ihave found myself in the situation in which<i>my</i>position was not the<i>majority</i>position in a hiring deliberation. It was an emotional experience--one that caused me in that situation to question why everyone else just didn't "get it." I'm not too proud to admit that years later I've been pleased to have been proven wrong. Latter-day scripture again offers the pattern for such discussions: "Let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all" (D&amp;amp;C 88:122). Here, of all places, we should understand and embrace this divine principle in our hiring discussions. I might add, the same should be said of rank and status decisions, in which the same tendency for animated discussion prevails.<br><br>It is my hope, as we ease out of the hiring freeze, that we can identify faculty who will help us achieve our dual mission at the university more ably than do we who are already here. Intimidating as it may sound to us, and as unfair as it may sound to our junior colleagues, the only way for us to improve is for the next generation to be better than we are. Iborrow a thought from a previous BYU president who expressed that it is "not failure but low aim [that] would be the most severe indictment of a Latter-day Saint fortunate enough to be at BYU."<sup>19</sup>This is certainly true for us as we chart the course for our future and nominate candidates for faculty positions at BYU. I have said in other settings that I would hope our faculty would be so distinguished in their disciplines that they would be regularly sought after by other fine universities, but my prayer would be that they couldn't bring themselves to leave.<br><br>I close with the words of an ancient hymn entitled "Be Thou My Vision," attributed to the Irish monk Dallán Forgaill from the sixth century. Historical writing from the period suggests that Forgaill, a scholar and teacher, studied so intensively that he lost his sight. Forgaill was beloved by his students, and legend has it that after his death his students dispersed, as they would accept no other master. I hope you'll find the words to the hymn as relevant and inspiring as I do.<br><br><i>Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;</i><br><i>Naught be all else to me, save that thou art.</i><br><i>Thou my best thought, by day or by night,</i><br><i>Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.</i><br><br><i>Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word;</i><br><i>I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord;</i><br><i>Thou and thou only, first in my heart,</i><br><i>Great God of heaven, my treasure thou art.</i><br><br><i>Great God of heaven, my victory won,</i><br><i>May I reach heaven's joys,</i><br><i>O bright heav'n's Sun!</i><br><i>Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,</i><br><i>Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.</i><br><br><i>Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,</i><br><i>Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>We need such vision at this time in BYU's history. It is critical in all aspects of our university service--our teaching, our scholarship, our faith and consecration, our hiring, our mentoring of both students and faculty, our faculty evaluations and discussions, and so on. I am the product of a visionary and consecrated BYU faculty. As an undergraduate student here, I had faculty who saw potential in me I did not see. As my department recruited me twenty-five years ago, their interest in me gave me confidence. After my arrival on campus, I benefited from their treatment of me as a full colleague with encouragement and invitations to collaborate. May you have success this year in the full scope of your university service. I wish you success in your teaching and in all student interactions. I wish you success in your scholarly work. May a vision of the influence you may have in the lives of students and on your disciplines renew you as we begin this new year with enthusiasm and passion.<br><br><i><i>Brent W.

<h1> Ye Therefore Perfect&quot; - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to add my welcome and greeting to you at the beginning of an exciting fall semester. This is a wonderful time of year. We hope you have had a productive, if not restful, summer and a welcome change of pace to help prepare for the challenging and exciting work of the weeks ahead. You are not yet too far behind in your course work, and the prospects for this fall are bright. This has the promise of a terrific year. It will be an even better year for each of us personally if we can avoid making unnecessary or foolish personal mistakes. You may believe I am talking only about slothfulness or Honor Code violations. Equally concerning to me is the rather common problem of perfectionism.<br><br>One area of confusion not rare among us is the notion that worthiness is synonymous with perfection. It is not! One can be fully worthy in a gospel sense and yet still be growing while dealing with personal imperfections. It might be understandable to believe what behavioral scientists describe as perfectionism is laudable. In fact it is not. It is corrosive and destructive and is the antithesis of the healthy quest for eventual perfection that the Savior prescribes.<br><br>All of us need to come to realistic and true perceptions about our environment and ourselves. Part of our educational responsibility at BYU is to gain wisdom, personal insight, and understanding as well as informed appreciation for the world around us. Because, as a group, you are so good, I hope you will understand my concerns. They are not criticisms, butthey occasionally give me pause.<br><br>The uneasiness of which I speak is largely rooted in misunderstandings some have about timing and also about definitions. With respect to timing, we can confuse our current or proximal circumstances with distant or eternal expectations. With definitions, as I have mentioned, some mistakenly consider worthiness to be the same as perfection. This is not true. While both errors--timing and definitions--may be comprehensible, and thus somewhat excusable, errors they are, and these faulty views of reality may have serious consequences if not corrected. Just as it is necessary to have the fundamentals of architecture and engineering in place to build a successful bridge across a body of water, so it is necessary to be properly grounded in understanding and in doctrine to build the proper bridge from where we are to eternal life.<br><br>The Savior said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). What did He mean? To whom does it apply? How might this happen? As you ponder these and other related questions, let me make some observations that might be helpful to you in conceptualizing this commandment as it applies to each of us.<br><br>The Lord gives no commandment that is not possible for us to keep or achieve. Likewise, much of what the Lord requires us to do is focused on our interactions with others. Frequently, heaven's expectations involve the support of families, friends, teachers, and Church and priesthood leaders, as well as the efforts we make in behalf of others. BYU exists precisely because we need each other, and especially our trusted faculty and advisors, to guide and assist us in our quest for education, which will serve all of us for eternity.<br><br>Some things, like the law of chastity and our BYU Honor Code, are rational, current perfection possibilities because they are mainly up to us alone. They are, as the Doctrine and Covenants explains, "given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints" (D&amp;amp;C 89:3).<br><br>Other things, like our test scores and grades, are mostly up to us, but also depend on the judgment and standards of our teachers and professors. Still, they are not entirely in our control, and thus our goals for achievement and perfection need to keep the involvement and choices of others in mind.<br><br>Under even less control, although not entirely out of our hands, are matters such as whether or not we will be asked out for a date next weekend. Or, if we are doing the asking, the issue arises as to whether or not our invitation will be accepted. If we are unsuccessful, then we can try a new strategy or perhaps an improved mouthwash next time. Just remember, other people may make poor decisions that affect us in these matters too!<br><br>Lastly, we all run the risk and usually have an experience of being the recipient of the terrible choices of another person in which we have virtually no control or influence in an event that might be extremely hurtful to us. Ithink of the tragic victims of drunk drivers oruninvited physical assaults and the like.<br><br>Thus it is extremely important to understand clearly which options and events are under our control and which are not. Too often we may be tempted to blame others for our deficiencies when in reality we should take responsibility. I have heard students offer criticisms of faculty members who chose to give examinations after a holiday weekend, for example, when the students could have prepared better and earlier. Unfortunately, we also see those who blame themselves unduly when circumstances were not completely under their own control. This is not only unproductive but can be debilitating.<br><br>Let us be clear: No one is perfect in everything and likely will not be any time soon. Almost thirty years ago I heard Elder Bruce R. McConkie, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, explain to a group of university students that "you can't be purer than pure." If this is true, that we won't likely be perfect in everything in this life whatever we do or how hard we try, then what are we to make of the Savior's commandment to be perfect?<br><br>At the outset, let me remind you of the footnote references to a Sermon on the Mount verse found in our LDS edition of the New Testament. First, the Prophet Joseph Smith did not shy away from this notion of perfection. This is what the Joseph Smith Translation of this verse says: "Ye are therefore commanded to be perfect" (JST, Matthew 5:50). Perfection isn't just something nice to inspire us or uplift us to greater heights. It is a commandment of the Lord. Second, from the Greek, where the English translation of this scripture comes, we are reminded that the notion of being perfect should be understood as being "complete, finished, [or] fully developed" (Matthew 5:48, footnote b).<br><br>Further, this instructive footnote refers us to a verse in the Doctrine and Covenants given to the Saints in the early days of the Church. In November 1831, all members of the Church were relatively new converts. They had testimonies of the gospel and its truthfulness, and they were trying to do their best, but they did not fully understand all of the details or nuances of our doctrine. At least in this respect they may have been very much like most of us. Listen to what they were told: "Wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected" (D&amp;amp;C 67:13). At least two things seem clear in this instruction. First, we are not perfect now. Second, we can become perfected if we are patient and take advantage of the requisite ways of thinking and behaving.<br><br>Thoughtful patience is part of the perfection process. Like these early Saints, we may be confused and make the mistake of misplacing an eventual essential eternal goal with the expectation of total perfection in the immediate now. This can be a serious error that can be very harmful.<br><br>The admonition for patience seems to implymultiple efforts and necessary time as part of our quest for perfection rather than sudden spurts or immediate events. What are the steps and how long is the time? How do we deal with our impatience? How do we set the proper balance in our striving that results in positive progress and also in recognition and understanding when we fail or do not immediately achieve the perfection we seek? How do we come to an understanding that theLord's promises really apply to you and me individually in spite of our significant weaknesses? These are important questions. All of the standard works are replete with references to the expectation of perfection, and yet all seem to acknowledge that the perfecting of the Saints is a process that is likely never to be absolutely complete in mortality. (See Topical Guide, s.v. "perfection," 364–65.)<br><br>In the Lord's great Intercessory Prayer found in the Gospel of John, we learn that as Jesus prayed to the Father for the unity of the apostles and the Saints, He also prayed that these, His devoted followers, might "be made perfect in one" (John 17:23). They were good, loyal, and devoted but apparently were not yet perfect. Again, maybe a little like most of us, Ihope.<br><br>The Apostle Paul admitted he had what he described as "a thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 12:7) that caused him to be buffeted by Satan. He prayed for relief from this weakness or problem, and Paul recounted the Lord's answer to him:<br><br><i>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore</i>[said Paul]<i>will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</i>[2 Corinthians 12:9]<br><br>We may not be happy with our deficiencies, but we also should not be incapacitated by them.<br><br>We teach the importance of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. I believe if you look carefully at what, for example, I myself and others have said and written, you can find ample evidence that we endorse these notions. There are times, however, when these cardinal strengths can become handicapping sins. Just as a young mother or father reaches out a hand of encouragement and support for a young baby who is beginning to think about walking, so our Savior and His Father do the same for us as we begin to think about risking a quest to get on the road to eventual perfection. Remember, while we mortals may tease each other on occasion, it is not in the personality or approach of our Redeemer. That is, He never pulls back his hand when it is extended. True, you and I, like Peter walking on the Sea of Galilee, might lose faith and withdraw ourselves, but God never does and never will withdraw the hand and support offered. But, and this is really a significant qualification, because of the necessity of agency and choice, we must be the one to grasp, figuratively or literally, the extended hand.<br><br>It is that outreached hand that we call grace. I believe this is what Nephi was explaining when he said:<br><br><i>For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</i>[2Nephi 25:23]<br><br>Some may opine that Nephi is suggesting that a bargain is being struck. That is, Jesus offers His salvational hand only after we have done everything possible by ourselves. Others have proclaimed that since He offers His grace, we don't need to do anything at all ourselves to achieve salvation. While it is true that the gifts of immortality and resurrection are given universally to all, without qualification, it is also true that eternal life, meaning living again in the presence of the Father and the Son, is made available to those willing to make and keep covenants and live according to the commandments--in other words, being committed to reach out our hands and grasp the hand of grace offered by the Savior.<br><br>We all know, as did the Father and the Son from the very beginning, that "the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41). That is why we have repentance, baptism, and the sacrament. Our perfection is a very long process and not an event or even a fairly short series of progressive events. In my judgment, perhaps the most helpful explication of this is given by the great prophet Moroni in literally his concluding counsel, teaching, and testimony before sealing up the plates that we now know as the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i>[Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>For me, this is the great secret and the tremendous comfort that a clear understanding of the Savior's Atonement and grace provides. We do not and cannot become perfect in everything by ourselves. We achieve eventual perfection because of, not in spite of, His grace. In a real sense we are called to be partners with Him in the perfection process. He knows what we do not know and has the strength we do not have. He asks that we do our part, but He does ask that we<i>really</i>do our part.<br><br>How do we do our part? We try our very best, understanding that we have both strengths and weaknesses. We understand that the Savior is reaching out to us and provides all that is necessary if we accept Him fully. He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). But that is not all. As He affirmed His love for us, He also gave this instruction:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>Most suffering from the syndrome of perfectionism do not have nearly as much trouble loving God and others as they do themselves. Almost all of us can accept without reservation that we must love God without restrictions or qualifications (see Matthew 22:37–38) while sometimes forgetting the essential components of the companion verse. Yes, we must love our neighbor (see Matthew 22:39), but, just as certainly, we need to learn to love ourselves. Loving ourselves includes not being unreasonable or too hard on ourselves when we make mistakes or act imperfectly. Please be clear that I am not excusing sin or slothful behavior. I am hoping for clarity and wisdom in our own personal assessments.<br><br>I do not believe that the Lord wishes us to be unrealistic about our limitations. In fact, I believe Moroni got it right as he reported the explanation of the Lord to him after he went in prayer because of the weaknesses he felt in himself. This was the assurance Moroni received in the face of his self-recognized deficiencies:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>Please remember that at BYU you never need to be alone. When you have challenges about your abilities to measure up--and we all do from time to time--recognize that your teachers, advisors, bishops, and other Church leaders and the excellent professionals in our Counseling Center are all willing to assist you as you do your part in accepting the grace of Christ and being patient in your progress.<br><br>Please remember that worthiness is vital, but it is not the same as perfection. It is an important step along the way, but it may reflect more on your current direction than on your final destination. As the Lord has promised, "All things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:32), and your time at BYU and during mortal life is to move toward the ideal with hope and confidence while retaining the necessary perspective that not everything, especially perfection, can be achieved quickly or atonce.<br><br>The gospel is true, and so are you. Because our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, are perfect, our dearest aspiration is to become like Them and eventually achieve the perfection that is possible and promised, even though each of us has such a long way to go. You have the confidence and prayers of the leadership of the Church and of this university. I invoke my blessings and love for you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1> Your Bridges - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Fall has always been one of my favorite times of the year. I love the changing colors of the leaves and the crispness in the air. I remember the excitement I felt in my younger years at the beginning of a new school year. Even though I am no longer attending school, I am blessed to be associated with all of you here at Brigham Young University. It is a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to share this exhilaration with you and express a heartfelt welcome to fall semester at this wonderful place. Hopefully your summer months were pleasant and the memories will not be forgotten during the exciting and sometimes stressful days ahead.<br><br>This past summer I had the opportunity to travel over and sail under one of the marvels of New York City: the Brooklyn Bridge. It is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States and was completed in 1883. It connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. At the time of its construction it was the longest suspension bridge in the world and continued to be so until 1903. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.<br><br>The Brooklyn Bridge took thirteen years to complete and could not have been constructed and have endured these many years without detailed blueprints, knowledge of mathematics, use of strong and sturdy materials, and innovative tools and equipment as well as careful and strategic planning and study. There was also much diligent and hard work involved in the process. Construction did not always go as planned, and accidents occurred and lives were even lost. There were times of discouragement as well as satisfaction during those thirteen years, but a bridge was erected that is strong and safe. The original designer was John Roebling, who died as a result of an accident that occurred when he was conducting surveys for the bridge project. He began construction of a bridge he never had the opportunity to cross, and it stands today as an engineering marvel.<br><br>All of you here today are crossing bridges you did not build but that were constructed by others to bless your lives in many ways and circumstances that are truly remarkable. Your education at Brigham Young University is possible because of men and women who valued education and learning in an atmosphere of faith. They built these bridges through their hard work, foresight, and testimonies of what Brigham Young University could and would become in the future.<br><br>For example, there is the prophet Brigham Young, who asked a German convert, Karl G. Maeser, to go to Provo to be the principal of Brigham Young Academy. Brother Maeser became the spiritual architect of what is now the largest private, church-sponsored university in the United States, which also has the reputation of high academic standards as well as for being "stone-cold sober."<br><br>Jesse Knight, his wife, Amanda, and Abraham O. Smoot helped keep the Academy functioning with monetary assistance when the school was struggling financially. Others could be named who contributed in so many ways to create this institution you attend today. These men and women won't pass this way again, but they marked the pathway foryou.<br><br>In 1995 my husband received a Church assignment to serve in the Europe North Area Presidency, and we moved to Solihull, England, where we lived for three years. Soon after arriving there, he and I were asked to accompany Elder and Sister Joseph B. Wirthlin to a fireside in Cardiff, Wales.<br><br>It was a marvelous meeting, and I was especially touched by the music that evening. The Welsh people are beautiful singers. It would not surprise you to learn that the majority of the original members of the Tabernacle Choir were Saints from Wales who had immigrated to the Salt Lake Valley in 1849. As the congregation was singing the closing hymn, I was touched by the Spirit, and the thought entered my mind "I think I may have some Welsh ancestry." I am ashamed to admit that I had not paid much attention to my family history up to that stage of my life. However, before we moved, my mother had given me a family history book that contained family group sheets and other information about my ancestors and their lives. Upon arriving back home, I retrieved it from the shelf and opened it to see exactly "who I was."<br><br>I was not surprised--because the Spirit had told me so--to discover that I was approximately one-third Welsh. No wonder I had felt so at home at that time. A majority of my mother's maternal and paternal ancestors were from Wales. In learning of this, and as a result of the spirit I felt in Wales, I began to feel a powerful attachment to my ancestors. I read more about my progenitors and began to appreciate, respect, and admire them in a new way. From the time I had this experience to the present day, my desire to learn more about them has intensified. It is as if a bridge is connecting my past to my present. For me, the time and space between then and now is connected in a precious way with the bridges my ancestors built with the lives they led. The constructions of their bridges for their descendants have had and will continue to have an effect on me and on the life I live today.<br><br>There is a classic poem entitled "The Bridge Builder" that expresses the importance of building bridges during your lives. It reads:<br><br><i>An old man, going a lone highway,</i><br><i>Came at the evening, cold and gray,</i><br><i>To a chasm, vast and deep and wide,</i><br><i>Through which was flowing a sullen tide.</i><br><i>The old man crossed in the twilight dim;</i><br><i>The sullen stream had no fears for him;</i><br><i>But he turned when safe on the other side</i><br><i>And built a bridge to span the tide.</i><br><br><i>"Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near,</i><br><i>"You are wasting strength with building here;</i><br><i>Your journey will end with the ending day;</i><br><i>You never again must pass this way;</i><br><i>You have crossed the chasm, deep and wide--</i><br><i>Why build you the bridge at the eventide?"</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>The builder lifted his old gray head:</i><br><i>"Good friend, in the path I have come," he said,</i><br><i>"There followeth after me today</i><br><i>A youth whose feet must pass this way.</i><br><i>This chasm that has been naught to me</i><br><i>To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.</i><br><i>He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;</i><br><i>Good friend, I am building the bridge for him."</i><br>[Will Allen Dromgoole, in James Dalton Morrison, ed.,<i>Masterpieces of Religious Verse</i>(New York and London: Harper and Brothers, 1948), 342; quoted by Thomas S. Monson in "<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2003/11/the-bridge-builder?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bridge Builder</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2003, 67]<br><br>You have loved ones in your past who created pathways and bridges to connect you to them and thus enable you to benefit from their dreams, experiences, sacrifices, and teachings--necessary components of bridge building. Hopefully each of you can relate stories and histories of ancestors who have contributed to and helped create the person you are today. They have lived their lives and built bridges for you. They will not pass this way again but knew you would one day have to travel your own way. They knew that your journeys though life would take you over many hills and down into deep valleys. You will find a myriad of dangers along the way, but hopefully bridges created by your ancestors will enable you to avoid them during your earthly travels. Daily activities and experiences can be difficult if you do not have the safety of a bridge on which to travel.<br><br>Now, my dear friends, it is your turn. At this moment you are constructing bridges for your descendants. I don't believe I thought as much as I should have about what I was doing with my life in relation to my descendants when I was your age and pursuing my university education. I knew that I wanted to earn a degree, teach school, hopefully get married, and have children. I don't recall thinking too much about grandchildren and great-grandchildren other than being sealed in the temple to have my family be an eternal one. However, in the world of today, where the morals and standards are declining and the adversary is gaining many in his camp, it is vital that we build bridges to link the generations before and afterus.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley once stood at this pulpit and said:<br><br><i>You young men and you young women, most of you will marry and have children. Your children will have children, as will the children who come after them. Life is a great chain of generations that we in the Church believe must be linked together.</i><br><br><i>I fear there will be some broken links. Do not let yourself become such, I pray.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_keep-chain-unbroken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keep the Chain Unbroken</a>," in BYU devotional address, 30November 1999]<br><br>It is now your responsibility to knit your generations together with the bridges you build. It may be that your descendants will have to cross many more troubled waters beneath them than the ones you are crossing over today. None of you wants to be the weak link in the chain of your family's generations. You are now the architects and project managers of your own bridges, which are to be constructed for those who will one day follow you. You must make and follow your own blueprints, secure the best and strongest materials and tools, study, and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to complete the projects. Your bridges will only endure when well built. Construction at times will be difficult, and you can be assured that challenges and struggles will block your way unexpectedly. There will be discouragements, sorrows, and heartaches as well as successes and joys as you lay their foundations and build upon them.<br><br>One may ask where to find a textbook or manual that can assist you to become a competent bridge builder. What are the building blocks that are necessary to create an enduring and magnificent bridge?<br><br>The answers are available to all. They are encompassed in the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Guidance is available in the scriptures as well as in the writings and discourses of our modern-day prophets and leaders. You cannot construct perfect bridges because you are not perfect people, nor will you have perfect lives. However, by following the example of our Savior, Jesus Christ, during the building process, as well as by keeping His commandments, you will be guided in creating sound and sturdy bridges.<br><br>In conclusion, may I remind you that the Savior of the world built many bridges that can enable you to return and live with Him and your Heavenly Father. The ultimate one, however, is the bridge over death into eternal life. His life and teachings provide for you the blueprints to enable you to create your own bridges for others to use.<br><br>It is my prayer that each of us may travel daily over the bridges our Savior constructed with love for us. May we continuously build our own bridges to be structurally strong and unbending as we are stalwart in our testimonies of Him is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>d Tolerance - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young brothers and sisters, Kristen and I feel privileged to be with you on this significant occasion. We meet on 9/11, the tenth anniversary of an event that has profoundly influenced our lives and thinking and will do so for many years to come. It is forever associated with the Twin Towers.<br><br>I have felt impressed to speak this evening about another set of twins, the twin ideas of Truth and Tolerance. These subjects were not chosen because they are uniquely your concern as young adults, like the dating, hanging out, and marriage I described to this audience some years ago. My treatment of truth and tolerance will invite you to consider and to teach these twin subjects because they are vital to the rising generation, in which you are the senior members.<br><h2><b>We Believe in Absolute Truth</b></h2><br>First: Truth. We believe in absolute truth, including the existence of God and the right and wrong established by His commandments. We sing:<br><br><i>Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst,</i><i>Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,</i><i>Eternal, unchanged, evermore.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In the words of President Joseph F. Smith:<br><br><i>We believe in all truth, no matter to what subject it may refer. No sect or religious denomination in the world possesses a single principle of truth that we do not accept or that we will reject. We are willing to receive all truth, from whatever source it may come; for truth will stand, truth will endure.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The existence and nature of truth is one of the fundamental questions of mortal life. Jesus told the Roman governor Pilate that He came into the world to "bear witness unto the truth."<br><br>"What is truth?" that unbeliever responded. (See John 18:37–38.)<br><br>In earlier times the Savior had declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). In modern revelation He declared: "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, we know that the existence of God and the existence of absolute truth are fundamental to life on this earth, whether they are believed or not. We also know that evil exists and that some things are simply, seriously, and everlastingly wrong. You whom I address shun evil and seek truth. Isalute you for your righteous actions and your righteous desires. As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I seek to help you make right choices in a world that is increasingly polarized between belief and disbelief, between good and evil.<br><br>Shocking reports of large-scale thievery and lying in civilized societies in the last two months suggest a moral vacuum in which many have little sense of right and wrong. Last month's widespread rioting and pillaging in Britain and the scandalous, widespread cheating by teachers on state-mandated tests in elementary and middle schools in Atlanta, Georgia, have caused many to wonder whether we are losing the moral foundation Western countries have received from their Judeo-Christian heritage.<sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>Beware of Moral Relativism</b></h2><br>It is well to worry about our moral foundation. We live in a world where more and more persons of influence are teaching and acting out a belief that there is no absolute right and wrong, that all authority and all rules of behavior are man-made choices that can prevail over the commandments of God. Many even question whether there is a God.<br><br>The philosophy of moral relativism, which holds that each person is free to choose for himself what is right and wrong, is becoming the unofficial creed for many in America and other Western nations. At the extreme level, evil acts that used to be localized and covered up like a boil are now legalized and paraded like a banner. Persuaded by this philosophy, many of the rising generation--youth and young adults--are caught up in self-serving pleasures, pagan painting and piercing of body parts, foul language, revealing attire, pornography, dishonesty, and degrading sexual indulgence.<br><br>On the foundation belief in right and wrong, there is an alarming contrast between the older and the younger generations. According to survey data of two decades ago, "79 percent of American adults [believed] that 'there are clear guidelines about what's good and evil that apply to everyone regardless of the situation.'"<sup>4</sup>In contrast, a more recent poll of college seniors suggests that "three-quarters of [them] believe that the difference between right and wrong is relative."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Many religious leaders teach the existence of God as the Ultimate Lawgiver, by whose action certain behavior is absolutely right and true and certain other behavior is absolutely wrong and untrue.<sup>6</sup>Bible and Book of Mormon prophets foresaw this time, when men would be "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God" (2 Timothy 3:4) and, indeed, when men would deny God (see Jude 1:4; 2 Nephi 28:5; Moroni 7:17; D&amp;amp;C 29:22).<br><br>In this troubled circumstance, we who believe in God and the corollary truth of absolute right and wrong have the challenge of living in a godless and increasingly amoral world. In this circumstance, all of us--and especially you of the rising generation--have a duty to stand up and speak up to affirm that God exists and that there are absolute truths His commandments establish. In doing so, we Latter-day Saints rely on the truth we sing in the hymn I quoted earlier:<br><br><i>The pillar of truth will endure to the last,</i><br><br><i>And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast</i><br><br><i>And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>As I face this audience of committed youngpeople, I know that some of you may be wondering why I am speaking about what is obvious to you and what, you might assume, is obvious to others. Recall the survey data I mentioned earlier, suggesting that about three-quarters of all college seniors believe thedifference between right and wrong is relative.<br><br>I have chosen to speak about truth because teachers in schools, colleges, and universities are teaching and practicing relative morality. This is shaping the attitudes of many young Americans who are taking their places as the teachers of our children and the shapers of public attitudes through the media and popular entertainment. This philosophy of moral relativism denies what millions of believing Christians, Jews, and Muslims consider fundamental, and this denial creates serious problems for all of us. What believers should do about this introduces the second of my twin subjects: Tolerance.<br><h2><b>Tolerance</b></h2><br>Tolerance is defined as a friendly and fair attitude toward unfamiliar opinions and practices or toward the persons who hold or practice them. As modern transportation and communication have brought all of us into closer proximity to different peoples and different ideas, we have greater need for tolerance. When I was a young adult, about sixty years ago, it was only in books and magazines that most Americans were exposed to great differences in cultures, values, and peoples. Now we experience such differences in television and the Internet, through travel, and often in personal interactions in our neighborhoods and the marketplace.<br><br>This greater exposure to diversity both enriches our lives and complicates them. We are enriched by associations with different peoples, which remind us of the wonderful diversity of the children of God. But diversities in cultures and values also challenge us to identify what can be embraced as consistent with our gospel culture and values and what cannot. In this way diversity increases the potential for conflict and requires us to be more thoughtful about the nature of tolerance. What is tolerance, when does it apply, and when does it not apply?<br><br>This is a harder question for those who affirm the existence of God and absolute truth than for those who believe in moral relativism. The weaker one's belief in God and the fewer one's moral absolutes, the fewer the occasions when the ideas or practices of others will confront one with the challenge to be tolerant. For example, an atheist has no need to decide what kinds and occasions of profanity or blasphemy can be tolerated and what kinds should be confronted. Persons who don't believe in God or in absolute truth in moral matters can see themselves as the most tolerant of persons. For them, almost anything goes. "You do your thing, and I'll do my thing" is the popular description. This belief system can tolerate almost any behavior and almost any persons. Unfortunately, some who believe in moral relativism seem to have difficulty tolerating those who insist that there is a God who should be respected and certain moral absolutes that should be observed.<br><h2><b>Three Absolute Truths for Tolerance</b></h2><br>I will say no more about the tolerance or intolerance of nonbelievers. I am speaking to an audience of Latter-day Saints who believe in God and in absolute truth. What does tolerance mean to us and to other believers, and what are our special challenges in applying it?<br><br>I begin with three absolute truths. I express them as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, but I believe that most of these ideas are shared by believers generally.<br><br><i>First,</i>all persons are brothers and sisters under God, taught within their various religions to love and do good to one another. President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed this idea for Latter-day Saints:<br><br><i>Each of us [from various religious denominations] believes in the fatherhood of God, although we may differ in our interpretations of Him. Each of us is part of a great family, the human family, sons and daughters of God, and therefore brothers and sisters. We must work harder to build mutual respect, an attitude of forbearance, with tolerance one for another regardless of the doctrines and philosophies which we may espouse.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Note that President Hinckley spoke of "mutual respect" as well as tolerance. Speaking at BYU a decade later, a Muslim scholar, Dr. Alwi Shihab, an Indonesian, elaborated that idea in these words: "To tolerate something is to learn to live with it, even when you think it is wrong and downright evil. . . . We must go, I believe, beyond tolerance if we are to achieve harmony in our world."<br><br>Relying on the teachings of the Quran, Dr. Shihab continued: "We must respect this God-given dignity in every human being, even in our enemies. For the goal of all human relations--whether they are religious, social, political, or economic--ought to be cooperation and mutual respect."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Living together with mutual respect for one another's differences is a challenge in today's world. However--and here I express a<i>second</i>absolute truth--this living with differences is what the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us we must do.<br><br>The kingdom of God is like a leaven, Jesus taught (see Matthew 13:33). A leaven--yeast--is hidden away in the larger mass until the whole is leavened, which means raised by its influence. Our Savior also taught that His followers will have tribulation in the world, that their numbers and dominions will be small (see 1 Nephi 14:12), and that they will be hated "because they are not of the world" (John 17:14). But that is our role. We are called to live with other children of God who do not share our faith or our values and who do not have the covenant obligations we have assumed. So it was that, at the conclusion of His ministry, Jesus prayed to the Father, "Not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil" (John 17:15). We are to be<i>in</i>the world, but not<i>of</i>the world.<br><br>Since followers of Jesus Christ are commanded to be a leaven--not to be taken out of the world, but to remain in it--we must seek tolerance from those who hate us for not being of the world. As part of this, we will sometimes need to challenge laws that would impair our freedom to practice our faiths, doing so in reliance on our constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion. As described by an attorney supporting a Lutheran school in a case now before the United States Supreme Court, the big concern is "the ability of people of all faiths to work out their relationship with God and one another without the government looking over their shoulder."<sup>10</sup>That is why we need understanding and support--including<i>your</i>understanding and support--when we must contend for religious freedom.<br><br>We must also practice tolerance and respect toward others. As the Apostle Paul taught, Christians should "follow after the things which make for peace" (Romans 14:19) and, as much as possible, "live peaceably with all men" (Romans 12:18). Consequently, we should be alert to honor the good we should see in all people and in many opinions and practices that differ from our own. As the Book of Mormon teaches:<br><br><i>All things which are good cometh of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, take heed . . . that ye do not judge ... that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</i>[Moroni 7:12–14]<br><br>That approach to differences will yield tolerance and also respect.<br><br>Our tolerance and respect for<i>others</i>and their<i>beliefs</i>does not cause us to abandon our commitment to the truths we understand and the covenants we have made. That is a<i>third</i>absolute truth: We do not abandon the truth and our covenants. We are cast as combatants in the war between truth and error. There is no middle ground. We must stand up for truth, even while we practice tolerance and respect for beliefs and ideas different from our own and for the people who hold them.<br><br>While we must practice tolerance and respect for<i>others</i>and their<i>beliefs,</i>including their constitutional freedom to explain and advocate their positions, we are not required to respect and tolerate wrong<i>behavior.</i>Our duty to truth requires us to seek relief from some behavior that is wrong. This is easy to see when it involves extreme behaviors that most believers and nonbelievers recognize as wrong or unacceptable. For example, we must all deplore murder or other terrorist behavior, even when done by extremists in the name of religion. And we must all oppose violence and thievery.<br><h2><b>The Two-Sided Coin of Tolerance and Truth</b></h2><br>As to less extreme behaviors, where even believers disagree on whether or not they are wrong, the nature and extent of what we should tolerate is much more difficult to define. Thus, a thoughtful LDS woman wrote me about her concern that "the world's definition of 'tolerance' seems to be increasingly used in relation to tolerating wicked lifestyles." She asked how the Lord would define "tolerance."<sup>11</sup><br><br>President Boyd K. Packer gave an inspired introduction to this subject. Speaking to an audience of institute students three years ago, he said: "The word<i>tolerance</i>does not stand alone. It requires an object and a response to qualify it as a virtue. . . . Tolerance is often demanded but seldom returned. Beware of the word<i>tolerance.</i>It is a very unstable virtue."<sup>12</sup><br><br>This inspired caution reminds us that for persons who believe in absolute truth, tolerance for behavior is like a two-sided coin. Tolerance, or respect, is on one side of the coin, but truth is always on the other. You cannot possess or use the coin of tolerance without being conscious of both sides.<br><br>Our Savior applied this principle. When He faced the woman taken in adultery, Jesus spoke the comforting words of tolerance: "Neither do I condemn thee." Then, as He sent her away, He spoke the commanding words of truth: "Go, and sin no more" (John 8:11). We should all be edified and strengthened by this example of speaking both tolerance and truth: kindness in the communication, but firmness in the truth.<br><h2><b>Facing Profanity, Cohabitation, and Sabbath Breaking with Truth and Tolerance</b></h2><br>Let us consider how to apply that example to some other behaviors. Another thoughtful LDS member wrote:<br><br><i>In Mosiah 18:9 Alma tells us that when we are baptized we covenant "to stand as 'witnesses' of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in." . . . What does this scripture mean for our day and how can it be applied by Latter-day Saints?</i><br><br><i>Living in the mission field, I often hear the name of the Lord taken in vain, and I also have acquaintances who tell me that they are living with their boyfriends. I have found that observance of the Sabbath is almost obsolete. How can I keep my covenant to stand as a witness and not offend these people?</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Profanity, cohabitation, and Sabbath breaking--excellent examples to illustrate how Latter-day Saints might balance their competing duties to truth and tolerance in their own lives in these difficult circumstances.<br><br>I begin with our personal conduct, including the teaching of our children. In applying the sometimes competing demands of truth and tolerance in these three behaviors and many others, we should not be tolerant with ourselves. We should be ruled by the demands of truth. We should be strong in keeping the commandments and our covenants, and we should repent and improve when we fall short.<br><br>As President Thomas S. Monson taught us in the conference where he was sustained as our prophet:<br><br><i>My young friends, be strong. . . . The face of sin today often wears the mask of tolerance. Do not be deceived; behind that faade is heartache, unhappiness, and pain. You know what is right and what is wrong, and no disguise, however appealing, can change that. The character of transgression remains the same. If your so-called friends urge you to do anything you know to be wrong,</i>you<i>be the one to make a stand for right, even if you stand alone.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Similarly, with our children and others we have a duty to teach--such as in our Church callings--our duty to truth is paramount. Of course, teaching efforts only bear fruit through the agency of others, so they must always be done with love, patience, and persuasion.<br><br>I turn now to the obligations of truth and tolerance in our personal relations with associates who use profanity in our presence, who live with a partner out of wedlock, or who do not observe the Sabbath day appropriately. How should we react toward and communicate with them?<br><br>Our obligation to tolerance means that none of these behaviors--or others we consider deviations from the truth--should ever cause us to react with hateful communications or unkind actions. But our obligation to truth has its own set of requirements and its own set of blessings. When we "speak every man truth with his neighbour" (Ephesians 4:25), and when we "[speak] the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15) as the Apostle Paul taught, we are acting as servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, doing His work. Angels will stand with us, and He will send His Holy Spirit to guide us.<br><br>In this sensitive matter we should first consider whether or the extent to which we should communicate to our associates what we know to be true about their behavior. In most cases this decision can depend on how directly we are personally affected by it.<br><br>Profanity consistently used in our presence is an appropriate cause for us to communicate the fact that this is offensive to us. Profanity used out of our presence by nonbelievers probably would not be an occasion for us to confront the offenders.<br><br>Cohabitation we know to be a serious sin in which Latter-day Saints must not engage, whatever the circumstances. When practiced by those around us, it can be private behavior or something we are asked to condone, sponsor, or facilitate. In the balance between truth and tolerance, tolerance can be dominant where the behavior does not involve us personally. If the cohabitation does involve us personally, we should be governed by our duty to truth. For example, it is one thing to ignore serious sins when they are private; it is quite another thing to be asked to sponsor or impliedly endorse them, such as by housing them in our own homes.<br><br>On Sabbath observance, Latter-day Saints know that we are taught to observe the Sabbath day in a different way than many other Christians. Most of us are troubled by packed shopping centers and other commercial activities on the Sabbath. Perhaps we should explain our belief that our observance of the Sabbath, including our partaking of the sacrament, restores us spiritually and makes us better people for the rest of the week. Then, to other believers, we might express appreciation for the fact that we share common ground on what is most vital because each of us believes in God and in the existence of absolute truth, even though we differ in our definitions of these fundamentals. Beyond that, we should remember the Savior's teaching that we should avoid contention (see 3 Nephi 11:29–30) and that our example and our preaching should "be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness" (D&amp;amp;C 38:41).<br><br>In all of this we should not presume to judge our neighbors or associates on the ultimate effect of their behaviors. That judgment is the Lord's, not ours. Even He refrained from a final mortal judgment of the woman taken in adultery. Tolerance requires a similar refraining in our judgment of others.<br><h2><b>Four Principles of Truth and Tolerance When Seeking Government Action</b></h2><br>Having discussed the balancing of truth and tolerance in our personal behavior and in our relations with associates, I come to a different and more difficult circumstance. When believers enter the public square to try to influence the making or the administration of laws motivated by their beliefs, they should apply some different principles.<br><br>As young adults, you may wonder why I am speaking to you about the principles we should follow when we seek government action, such as by the legislature. You might say, "That is a matter for senior Church authorities to handle." I describe these principles to you young adults because you are current members and future leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ, and you will need to decide these kinds of questions sooner than you think. You will need to understand how our efforts in the public square are informed by the balance between truth and tolerance.<br><br>Whether or how we might seek to obtain laws that would compel or influence behavior that we deem desirable because of our belief in God and His commandments is too large a subject for adequate treatment in the concluding few minutes of my talk. I will, therefore, limit myself to describing four paramount principles that should govern such an effort.<br><br><i>First,</i>when believers in Jesus Christ take their views of truth into the public square, they must seek the inspiration of the Lord to be selective and wise in choosing which true principles they seek to promote by law or executive action. Generally, they should refrain from seeking laws or administrative action to facilitate beliefs that are distinctive to believers, such as the enforcement of acts of worship, even by implication. Believers can be less cautious in seeking government action that would serve principles broader than merely facilitating the practice of their beliefs, such as laws concerning public health, safety, and morals.<br><br>In any event, as defenders of the faith, believers can and must seek laws that will preserve religious freedom. Along with the ascendancy of moral relativism, the United States is experiencing a disturbing reduction in overall public esteem for religion. Once an accepted part of American life, religion is now suspect in the minds of many. To them it has become something that must prove its legitimacy as a part of our public life. Some influential voices even question the extent to which our constitution should protect the free exercise of religion, including the right to practice and preach religious principles.<br><br>This is a vital matter on which we who believe in a Supreme Being who has established absolute right and wrong in human behavior must unite to insist on our time-honored constitutional rights to exercise our religion, to vote our consciences on public issues, and to participate in elections and debates in the public square and in the halls of justice. In doing so we stand with angels. We must also stand shoulder to shoulder with other believers to preserve and strengthen the freedom to advocate and practice our religious beliefs, whatever they are. For this purpose we must walk together on the same path in order to secure our freedom to pursue our separate ways when that is necessary according to our separate beliefs. Guided by heaven in this righteous cause, our words will be sweet and find place in the hearts of many.<br><br><i>Second,</i>when believers seek to promote their positions in the public square, their methods and their advocacy should always be tolerant of the opinions and positions of others who do not share their beliefs. We should not add to the extremism that divides our society. As believers, we must always speak with love and show patience, understanding, and compassion toward our adversaries. Christian believers are under command to love their neighbors (see Luke 10:27), to forgive (see Matthew 18:21–35), and to do good to those who despitefully use them (see Matthew 5:44). They should always remember the Savior's teaching that we "bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them which despitefully use [us], and persecute [us]" (Matthew 5:44).<br><br>As believers, we should also frame our arguments and positions in ways that contribute to the reasoned discussion and accommodation that are essential to democratic government in a pluralistic society. By this means we will contribute to the civility that is essential topreserve our civilization.<br><br><i>Third,</i>believers should not be deterred by the familiar charge that they are trying to legislate morality. Many areas of the law are based on Judeo-Christian morality and have been for centuries. Our civilization is based on morality and cannot exist without it. As John Adams declared: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."<sup>15</sup><br><br><i>Fourth,</i>believers should not shrink from seeking laws to maintain public conditions or policies that assist them in practicing the requirements of their faith where those conditions or policies are also favorable to the public health, safety, or morals. For example, even though religious beliefs are behind many criminal laws, and some family laws, such laws have a long-standing history of appropriateness in democratic societies. But where believers are in the majority, they should always be sensitive to the views of the minority.<br><br>We Latter-day Saints are sometimes accused of being self-righteous and intolerant of others, especially where we are in the majority or where others are in the majority and our beliefs cause us to oppose them. Surely Latter-day Saints do need to be more wise and skillful in explaining and pursuing our views and in exercising our influence when we have it.<br><br>That is the spirit of the two-sided coin of truth and tolerance. President Thomas S. Monson has provided an excellent example of the practice of these twin virtues. Throughout his life he has been exemplary in reaching out and working with the members and leaders of other faiths in cooperative efforts on matters of common interest and in the Christian fellowship and concern that have no denominational boundaries.<sup>16</sup><br><br>Finally, the spirit of our balance of truth and tolerance is applied in these words of President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>Let us reach out to those in our community who are not of our faith. Let us be good neighbors, kind and generous and gracious. Let us be involved in good community causes. There may be situations, there will be situations, where, with serious moral issues involved, we cannot bend on matters of principle. But in such instances we can politely disagree without being disagreeable. We can acknowledge the sincerity of those whose positions we cannot accept. We can speak of principles rather than personalities.</i><sup>17</sup><br><h2><b>The Gift to Know and the Gift to Believe</b></h2><br>I close with this assurance and this testimony: The Bible teaches that one of the functions of a prophet is to be a "watchman" to warn Israel (see Ezekiel 3:17; 33:7). In revelation the Lord added this parable for modern Zion: "Set . . . a watchman upon the tower," who will "[see] the enemy while he [is] yet afar off" and give warning to save the "vineyard from the hands of the destroyer" (D&amp;amp;C 101:45, 54).<br><br>I have spoken to you as one of those watchmen on the subject the Spirit has assigned me. Iassure you that my message is true. If you have doubts about this, or if you have questions about how to apply these principles in your own life, I urge you to seek guidance from the same source.<br><br>On the broader question being widely agitated by the atheists of our day, I proclaim my knowledge that God lives! His creations witness His existence, and His servants hear and proclaim His voice. Modern revelation teaches that some have the gift "to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, . . . crucified for the sins of the world," and that it is given to others "to believe on their words" (D&amp;amp;C 46:13, 14). As one who knows, I invite you to believe on my words.<br><br>I testify of Jesus Christ, the Lord of the vineyard. He is our Savior, and He reaches out to each of us with the timeless invitation to receive His peace by learning of Him and by walking in His way (see D&amp;amp;C 19:23):<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i>[Matthew 11:28–30]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this CES devotional address was given on 11 September 2011.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>The Heart of Spirituality - Neil L. Andersen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I bring you the love and blessing of President Thomas S. Monson and the First Presidency of the Church. President Monson asked me specifically to share his love and greeting with you. Just over an hour ago I left a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve. They also asked that I extend to you their love and blessing.<br><br>I want to mention the great respect and appreciation the leaders of the Church feel for President and Sister Samuelson. President Samuelson was called from a very prominent and financially rewarding medical and healthcare profession to become a General Authority seventeen years ago. The service of this wonderful couple reflects the unselfishness and devotion of disciples of Christ. We love you, President and Sister Samuelson.<br><br>BYU is a very special place. The Lord's influence is upon this school. For a young man or woman desiring a university education, it is an oasis of righteousness. For a young disciple of Christ, BYU offers an extraordinary environment for learning, for meeting others, for making important decisions, and for growing spiritually. BYU's prophetic direction, its history, its faculty and administration, and its students make it what it is. You help make BYU what it is. We love you for who you are.<br><br>BYU holds a special importance for our family. Kathy and I met here, and we both graduated from BYU. Our four children also graduated from BYU, and three of our four met their eternal companions here.<br><br>When I fell in love with Kathy, I wondered how an insecure Idaho farm boy could attract a beautiful, intelligent woman from Florida. I then remembered one talent I possessed: Ihad served my mission in France, and I spoke French. I had been told that young women loved to hear French spoken to them. But, to my dismay, I realized I did not know the French words of romance. I only knew missionary words. I won Kathy's heart with<i>machérie</i>at the front,<i>je t'aime</i>at the end, and the plan of salvation in between.<br><br>As a sidenote, let me encourage you young women to have the courage to let an insecure but interesting young man know that you would like to know him better. Take a risk! I remember coming home to my roommates and incredulously saying, "I think she actually likes me. Can you believe it? She likes me!" It does a lot for the initiative of an insecure man.<br><br>While attending BYU, I remember hearing frequent references to BYU's first president, Karl G. Maeser. President Brigham Young instructed Dr. Maeser that he "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup>1</sup>I would like to acknowledge BYU's most impressive faculty. To attract the intelligence, preparation, and spiritual maturity of those who teach here is a miracle itself. How fortunate we are to have this faculty.<br><br>I come to you today under assignment by the First Presidency. I have thought and prayed much about what the Lord would have me say. I hope to elevate your mind and spirit with a principle that, if followed, will enhance your time at Brigham Young University. It is a principle you all believe in, but I promise you that if you will think about it more intently, pray about it more specifically, and embrace it more fully, it will bring an abundance of blessings to you now and throughout your life. My subject is honesty.<br><br>Why would I speak to<i>you</i>about honesty? Were we to compare you to others, you would undoubtedly rank very high. However, the standard for honesty is not determined through comparison with others. Ours is a divine standard. I speak to you as fellow disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, committed to His restored gospel and striving to keep His commandments.<br><br>God our Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are beings of absolute, perfect, and complete honesty and truth. We are sons and daughters of God. Our destiny is to become like Him. We seek to be perfectly honest and true like our Father and His Son. Honesty describes the character of God, and therefore honesty is at the very heart of our spiritual growth and spiritual gifts.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Jesus declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."<sup>3</sup><br><br>The Lord asked the brother of Jared, "Believest thou the words which I shall speak?"<br><br>The brother of Jared answered, "Yea, Lord, Iknow that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie."<sup>4</sup><br><br>And here are the Savior's own words: "I am the Spirit of truth."<sup>5</sup>"I tell you the truth."<sup>6</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Satan is described as "the father of all lies":<br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Jesus said, "The devil . . . abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The Savior constantly rebuked those who professed one thing publicly but lived differently in their hearts.<sup>9</sup>He praised those who lived without deception.<sup>10</sup>Can you see the contrasting difference? On the one hand there is truth and light and honesty and integrity. On the other hand there is lying, deceiving, hypocrisy, and darkness. The Lord draws a sharp distinction.<br><br>In general conference in April 2011, President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and it's growing ever wider. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Savior of mankind described Himself as being in the world but not of the world</i>[see John 17:14; D&amp;amp;C 49:5].<i>We also can be in the world but not of the world as we reject false concepts and false teachings and remain true to that which God has commanded.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/priesthood-power?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>The world would tell us that truth and honesty are difficult to define. The world finds humor in casual lying and quickly excuses so-called "innocent" deception. The contrast between right and wrong is dulled, and the consequences of dishonesty are minimized.<br><br>Brigham Young University was established by the hand of the Lord and is watched over by His prophets. At Brigham Young University, truth received through the Spirit of the Lord is readily available to those who are worthy and desire this influence.<br><br>To constantly receive the Spirit of Truth, our lives must be filled with truth and honesty. As we become completely honest, our spiritual eyes are opened to increased enlightenment.<br><br>You can easily understand how this spiritual strength lifts our learning in the classroom. But can you also see how this principle applies to your critical decisions of how you spend your time, with whom you spend your time, and how you shape the life that will follow BYU?<br><br>You cannot separate the spiritual endowment of truth you need and want to receive here at BYU from your being a person of honesty and truth. The truth you seek is tied to the person you are. Light, spiritual answers, and heavenly direction are unalterably linked to your own honesty and truth. Many of your lasting satisfactions here at BYU will come as you continually elevate your commitment to personal honesty.<br><br>As a student you will appreciate the story told by Roy D. Atkin:<br><br><i>After a number of students dropped out following</i>[my first]<i>year</i>[in dental school, the]<i>classes became even more competitive. Everyone worked hard to be at the top of the class. As the competition increased, some students decided that the way to succeed was by cheating. This troubled me greatly....</i><br><br><i>During summer break, I</i>[visited]<i>a dentist who had graduated from my school. I talked to him about cheating. He said he had encountered the same problem.</i><br><br><i>"What did you do?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"What could I do?" he replied. "I had no choice but to cheat occasionally." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I knew I couldn't cheat. I wanted to be right with God even more than I wanted to become a dentist.</i><br><br>[During]<i>my</i>[third]<i>year, I was offered a copy of an upcoming test in a crucial class. Obviously that meant some of my classmates would have the test questions ahead of time. I declined the offer. When the corrected test papers were returned, the class average was extremely high, making my score low incomparison. The professor asked to speak to me.</i><br><br><i>"Roy," he said, "you usually do well on tests. What happened?"</i><br><br><i>"Sir," I told my professor, "on the next exam, ifyou give a test that you have never given before, Ibelieve you will find that I do very well." There was no reply.</i><br><br><i>We had another test in the same class. As the test was handed out, there were audible groans. It was a test the teacher had never given before. When our graded tests were handed back, I had received one of the highest grades in the class. From then on, all the tests were new.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2006/10/i-wouldnt-cheat?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>As disciples of Christ, the divine standard of honesty grows within us. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin's admonition to "[put] off the natural man"<sup>13</sup>is in part a call for a more heightened sense of honesty and truth.<br><br>To the Ephesians, the Apostle Paul counseled: "Put off . . . the old man, which is corrupt . . . and be renewed in the spirit of your mind." Paul then gave specific counsel on becoming a "new man" or a "new woman." The very first thing he told them to do was, "[Put] away lying, speak every man truth."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Thank you for your noble efforts in your young years to "put off . . . the old man."<br><br>I like this definition of honesty: "Honesty is to be completely truthful, upright, and just."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Also, integrity is "[having] the moral courage to make [your] actions consistent with [your] knowledge of right and wrong."<sup>16</sup><br><br>President James E. Faust once told of applying for Officer's Candidate School in the United States Army. He said:<br><br><i>I was summoned before the board of inquiry. My qualifications were few, but I had had two years of college and had finished a mission for the Church in South America.</i><br><br><i>The questions asked of me at the officers' board of inquiry took a very surprising turn. Nearly all of them centered upon my beliefs. "Do you smoke?" "Do you drink?" "What do you think of others who smoke and drink?" I had no trouble answering these questions.</i><br><br><i>"Do you pray?" "Do you believe that an officer should pray?" The officer asking these questions was a hard-bitten career soldier. He did not look like he prayed very often. . . . I wanted to be an officer very much. . . .</i><br><br><i>I decided not to equivocate. I admitted that I did pray and that I felt that officers might seek divine guidance as some truly great generals had done. . . .</i><br><br><i>More interesting questions came. "In times of war, should not the moral code be relaxed? Does not the stress of battle justify men in doing things that they would not do when at home under normal situations?"</i><br><br><i>. . . I suspected that the men who were asking me this question did not live by the standards that I had been taught. The thought flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs, but I did not wish to impose them on others. But there seemed to flash before my mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as a missionary. In the end I simply said, "I do not believe there is a double standard ofmorality."</i><br><br><i>I left the hearing resigned to the fact that these hard-bitten officers would . . . surely score me very low. A few days later when the scores were posted, to my astonishment I had passed. I was in the first group taken for Officer's Candidate School! . . .</i><br><br>[And then President Faust, realizing how small decisions can have large consequences, said:]<i>This was one of the critical crossroads of my life.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/honesty-a-moral-compass?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>17</sup></a><br><br>Honesty, integrity, and truth are eternal principles that significantly shape our experience in mortality and help determine our eternal destiny. For a disciple of Christ, honesty is at the very heart of spirituality.<br><br>Honesty envelops every part of your daily life, but let me refer to a few specifics here at BYU.<br><br>The most obvious is the BYU Honor Code. Itis not new to BYU. The Honor Code was here when I was a student--in what seems like a hundred years ago. Its value and contribution to this special environment you enjoy is time-tested and proven. In signing the Honor Code, you promise "to demonstrate in daily living on and off campus those moral virtues encompassed in the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup>18</sup><br><br>The first of nine virtues mentioned in the Honor Code is "Be honest." The Honor Code issigned not only by students but by the faculty, administration, and staff. It adds greatly to the unique environment in which you are learning.<br><br>The BYU Honor Code includes eternal principles such as honesty, chastity, and service. It also includes specific rules that apply to BYU here and now. These generally have to do with housing visitations and dress and grooming standards. To some, these rules will appear childish, but they are time-tested and proven. For those with an honest question, let me explain how they can be of help to you in yourlife.<br><br>In my student days, I remember then BYU President Dallin H. Oaks sharing this quotation from President Karl G. Maeser:<br><br><i>My young friends, I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_honest-behavior/"><sup>19</sup></a><br><br>There are times we honor commitments simply because we have agreed to honor them. You will have situations in your life after your university years when you will be tempted to disregard an agreement you have made. You will initially make the agreement because of something you wish to receive in return. Later, because of a change in circumstances, you will no longer want to honor the terms of the agreement. Learn now that when you give your word, when you make a promise, when you sign your name, your personal honesty and integrity bind you to your word, your commitment, your agreement.<br><br>I promise you that you will have increased spiritual power as you are absolutely obedient to the specific rules set forth in the BYU Honor Code. Obey them because you signed your name, agreeing that you would obey them, and there will be added light and truth in your experience here.<br><br>How grateful we are that you "believe in being honest,"<sup>20</sup>that you tell the truth, that you would not cheat on an exam, plagiarize a paper, or deceive one another. Listen to this scripture:<br><br><i>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, andas they were, and as they are to come;</i><br><br><i>And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Our challenges often come in the "more or less"--the small temptations on the edge of being completely honest. As a freshman at BYU, I kept a statement above my desk often quoted by then President David O. McKay. It read: "The greatest battle of life is fought out within the silent chambers of the soul."<sup>22</sup><br><br>I have appreciated a vignette on television that depicts the courage of being honest. Please watch. [A video from values.com was shown.<sup>23</sup>]<br><br>This video is about more than sportsmanship. It is about honesty. How do you think the Lord feels when we make difficult decisions of honesty? My young brothers and sisters, there is enormous spiritual power in remaining true and honest when the consequences of your honesty could appear to be a disadvantage. Each of you will face such decisions. These defining moments will test your integrity. As you choose honesty and truth--whether or not the situation works out the way you hope--you will realize that these important crossroads become fundamental pillars of strength in your spiritual growth.<br><br>Brigham Young once said, "We must learn to be righteous in the dark."<sup>24</sup>One definition of this phrase is that we must learn to be honest when no one would know if we were dishonest. I challenge you to be "righteous in the dark." Choose the course that the Savior Himself would choose.<br><br>The poet Edgar A. Guest wrote:<br><br><i>I don't want to keep on a closet shelf</i><br><br><i>A lot of secrets about myself,</i><br><br><i>And fool myself as I come and go</i><br><br><i>Into thinking that nobody else will know.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Remember the beautiful words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>There are pressures facing you at BYU. Pressure to achieve. Pressure to keep a high GPA, pressure to find employment, pressure to find friends, pressure to please those around you, pressure to graduate. Pressures continue after BYU. Do not allow these pressures to crack your character of honesty. Be honest when the consequences appear to move against you. Pray for greater honesty, think about the areas in which the Lord would want you to be more honest, and have the courage to take the needed steps to lift your spirit to a higher level of resolve in being completely honest.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson admonished us at the conclusion of this past April general conference, "May we be examples of honesty and integrity wherever we go and in whatever we do."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/at-parting?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>27</sup></a>You might consider putting this counsel by the Lord's prophet where you can see it often.<br><br>In Sunday's CES broadcast, Elder Dallin H. Oaks counseled, "We should not be tolerant with ourselves. We should be ruled by the demands of truth."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_truth-and-tolerance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>28</sup></a>Be uncompromising with yourself. The Savior said, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."<sup>29</sup><br><br>I end where I began. Our Heavenly Father and His Son are beings of absolute, perfect, and complete honesty. I testify that our Father in Heaven and His beloved Son live. They know you personally. They love you. Your destiny as a son or a daughter of God is to become like Them. We are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us have the courage to follow Him.<br><br>As you humbly ponder and pray about your own desire to be honest and quietly make decisions that lift your personal integrity, I promise that you will have greater clarity come into your life. You will feel the grace of the Savior as He leads you along to ever greater honesty, assuring you of His love and approval. As you are honest, you will know that He is aware of you. He will bless you as you seek to be like Him. I testify that He lives. I testify that this is His holy work and that He is involved in the comings and goings of Brigham Young University. You will know of His influence in the details of your life. I so testify as one of His servants, even one of His apostles, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil L.

<h1>e in the Making: Finding the Meaning in... - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was a young adult, about the age of many of you in this room, I had my life carefully planned out. I was going to become a registered nurse, meet the most handsome and charming man, get married in the temple, and have four children and a wonderful life (whatever that meant). I was well on my way: Imet and married a terrific man, I had two sons, and I was working as a nurse. My life was going according to my plan.<br><br>July 11, 1981, was a classic Utah summer day with blue sky and sunshine. It was one of those days that starts out cool and crisp but in which the temperature rapidly climbs to the unbearable heat of summer--a harsh reminder that Utah is part of the Southwest desert. I had been married to my husband, Scott, for over six years. I was twenty-five years old and the mother of two sons, ages two and four years. We were barbecuing with our neighbors in our backyard, and I remember thinking it was almost time to get ready to work the three to eleven p.m. shift as a nurse.<br><br>Out of the blue I heard someone yell, "There is a child pinned under your garage door!" Scott went through the garage to try to get our automatic garage door off the child, and Iran into the house and called 911. This small child was my oldest son, Joshua. Scott tried to lift the heavy garage door but was unable to lift it alone. He continued to struggle to lift the bulky door with no success. Suddenly he saw hands slip under the garage door from the outside to help lift it off of Joshua. To this day we do not know to whom the hands belonged. Josh was not breathing and did not have a pulse; Scott yelled for me to come help him. I could tell by the tone of his voice that I needed to hurry. I dropped the phone, ran outside, and began CPR, which the paramedics continued as soon as they arrived.<br><br>Josh was transported to the hospital in extremely critical condition and, once stable, then taken by helicopter to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City. We were told that he had suffered severe anoxia, or lack of oxygen to his brain. The doctors did not know if he would live, and, if he lived, it was unclear if he would be "normal," as the lack of oxygen likely had caused brain injury.<br><br>Joshua was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he remained for about six weeks. He came off the mechanical ventilator and began to breathe on his own, but he was still comatose and did not "wake up all at once and start talking" like you see in the movies.<br><br>One iconic day, one of Joshua's physicians told Scott and me that Josh could be released from the hospital and be admitted to a long-term care facility. The doctor indicated that it was possible that Josh would not walk or talk again, and the doctor did not know if Josh would be able to attend a regular school--if he ever attended any school at all. Further, the doctor indicated to us that we might want to consider placing Josh in an institution that could provide the full-time care he would require. The doctor offered to provide us a list of appropriate facilities that Josh's condition would demand. This hit us like a brick--we had not planned, nor had the thought crossed our minds, that our son would not be coming home with us and that we might need to place him in an institution. This was something we simply chose not to consider, and it certainly was not part of my newly modified life plan.<br><br>We were young, untrained, and unprepared for the drastic changes and extreme challenges that had come uninvited into our relatively calm life. Even though I was a nurse and thought I knew what to expect, I was wrong. We were completely overwhelmed, but we learned to manage our life by taking it one day at a time--thinking two days ahead was beyond our ability to cope or manage. We took Joshua home and proceeded to embark on a daily course of laborious physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and cognitive rehabilitation, not to mention having to feed, dress, bathe, and change diapers on a four-year-old. We had support from our families, neighbors, many friends, and even people we did not know, but still the days were long, hard, and exhausting. Progress for Joshua was slow. Occasionally I would wonder why this had happened to a small, fragile, four-year-old boy and to me and and to our family.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 states:<br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br>All of us will experience difficult challenges in life. How you deal with and overcome adversity is what is important. Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, stated in his book<i>The Last Lecture,</i>"We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand" (with Jeffrey Zaslow [New York: Hyperion, 2008], 17).<br><br>Approximately one year after Josh's accident he attended his first day of kindergarten. Even though now Josh was walking using a walker, he couldn't be considered sure on his feet. He was talking, although his speech was very slurred and difficult to understand. His kindergarten teacher, upon meeting Josh, asked if he was supposed to attend our neighborhood school or the district school for children with disabilities. We assured her that Josh was at the correct school, and she was at the very least a bit taken aback. However, she quickly regained her composure and over time became one of Josh's greatest champions.<br><br>Joshua continued to improve slowly as he attended therapy. As his physical abilities improved, we added swimming, horseback riding, and skiing to our "therapy" schedule. Even though the rehabilitation regime seemed to be working, it was absolutely tiring to a small, skinny child. My days were full as a chauffeur, therapist, and nurse.<br><br>During this time I researched the effects of anoxia on the brain. I searched the rehabilitation research literature trying to find the therapy we needed to help Josh. I was surprised to learn that there was very little practical information regarding rehabilitation following anoxic brain injury. Further, the existing literature stated that the outcomes following anoxic brain injury were bad--dismal, to be exact. I thought that maybe I needed to look at the basic science literature on anoxia. There were scientific articles that discussed the possible mechanisms of anoxic brain injury and a few articles that provided information about anoxia and associated cognitive, neurological, behavioral, and motor morbidities--with which I was already well acquainted. None of the articles provided information regarding how to best help Joshua. I was frustrated and tired and felt I had reached a deadend.<br><br>A typical daily schedule for me involved getting myself up and ready, feeding and dressing my two-year-old, then feeding and dressing Joshua so we could drive to Primary Children's Medical Center for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. We would spend four to six long hours at the hospital every day and then come home to start dinner, do laundry, clean the house, and do our "therapy homework"--yes, more therapy.<br><br>One day I was home at noon eating lunch, and I turned on the TV. I have no idea why I was home that day. There on one of the channels was Jane Russell, an actress from the 1940s and 1950s--but I knew her from the TV commercials that she did for the Cross Your Heart bra, and, frankly, that did not inspire much respect or confidence. Jane Russell was on a TV talk show talking about the adoption agency she had founded: the World Adoption International Fund, which helps find homes for children. In the program Jane Russell stated something to the effect that "if God wants you to do something, sometimes He rubs your nose in it." I knew at that moment that I needed to return to school and earn a doctorate degree so I could study the effects of the lack of oxygen on the brain. This was a startling thought, since Ihad no idea where to begin.<br><br>A friend suggested I talk to a professor at the University of Utah. I called and made an appointment. The professor and I had a long conversation about my interests in graduate school. He encouraged me to apply to the doctoral program in psychology. This was madness. We had no time, little money, and mounting medical bills, and I had the equivalent of a full-time job taking care of Joshua and taking him to therapy every day. Scott and I discussed it, thought it over, and prayed about it, and the feeling remained that Ishould attend graduate school.<br><br>I applied to the PhD program. I was not accepted. I was very depressed by this news. I knew this was what I was supposed to do. When I asked why I was not accepted to the program, I was told I had no psychology background and they had no basis on which to judge whether or not I could succeed in the graduate program. It was true. These were facts--I was a nurse.<br><br>When I visited again with the faculty member, he suggested that over the next year Itake some undergraduate psychology courses and a graduate course and then reapply to the doctoral program. I followed his advice, did well in my course work, reapplied, and was admitted to the psychology doctoral program the following fall. This was the beginning of a long journey, and along the way I have learned many important lessons.<br><h2><b>Education and Learning</b></h2><br>One lesson that was reinforced by this experience was the importance of education and lifelong learning. My father, a former BYU<b></b>professor, had five daughters and two sons. I am sure he would have preferred five sons, but life sometimes gives you what you need, not what you think you want. Education was always very important to my father, and he taught all of his children the importance of obtaining an education. All seven of his children have earned bachelor's degrees, and three of us have earned advanced degrees. When Scott asked for my father's permission to marry me, my father's response was not "How will you provide for my daughter?" but rather "How will you see that she completes her education?" Scott assured him that he would see that I did.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 88:118 reads, "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." Education includes formal classroom education and lessons learned from missions, Church callings, travel, parenting, and experiences in both secular and gospel knowledge. Elder Monte J. Brough, in a message published in the<i>Ensign,</i>stated:<br><br><i>Many of the most important principles of intelligence cannot be taught at universities, from books, or through other temporal learning processes. Often these great principles are learned from afflictions, tribulations, and other mortal experiences. All that we learn in this manner will benefit us not only in this life but also in the next, for "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18).</i>["Adversity, the Great Teacher,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 2006, 10]<br><br>I completed my doctorate degree and continued to study the cognitive, psychological, and quality-of-life outcomes following anoxia and other medical disorders in order to improve outcomes for individuals and their families.<br><h2><b>Laugh Often</b></h2><br>An important lesson that Scott and I have learned from the changes and challenges brought to our lives after Josh's accident is to keep a sense of humor. When life gets difficult, the tough find the humor. In an article entitled "If We Can Laugh at It, We Can Live with It," Brad Wilcox writes that humor can help us cope with adversity, help us heal, improve our relationships with each other, and provide a needed perspective on life (see<i>Ensign,</i>March 2000, 26–30).<br><br>My mother had a wonderful sense of humor. When I was in high school, unbeknownst to any of us children, Mom and Dad decided to redecorate the living room and kitchen. Upon returning from school one day, we arrived home to find royal purple carpet in the living room and bright blue, green, and yellow flowered drapes in the kitchen. They were not just bright, they were very bright--the Provo version of Hawaiian aloha floral. My mother loved the floral drapes. While none of us children were particularly fond of the drapes, my sister Kristi was very vocal about it and made it quite clear that she thought the drapes were especially ugly.<br><br>On most of her visits home to see Mom and Dad, Kristi would tell Mom that she should definitely replace those hideous drapes. Mom in return told Kristi that the kitchen drapes were to be a large part of her inheritance and to be sure to remember to take them when the time came. One day in May 2003, about two weeks before my mother passed away unexpectedly, Mom and I were making plans to redecorate her kitchen. Mom said that when we purchased the new drapes, we should take the old ones down and make shorts out of them for everyone in Kristi's family, just like Maria did for the von Trapp children in the Rodgers and Hammerstein 1959 musical<i>The Sound of Music.</i><br><br>After Mom passed away, Kristi did in fact receive the drapes as part of her inheritance as Mom had wished, even though it was a joke. At a family reunion the following summer, when Kristi, Jim, and their children arrived at the reunion and got out of their car, they all were wearing "stylish" bright blue, green, and yellow floral, handmade shorts.<br><h2><b>Serve Where Called</b></h2><br>The importance of service is another lesson I have learned. An act of service can have long-lasting effects and touch many lives.<b></b>I learned service from my parents, a lesson that was refined and enlarged by Josh's accident as we received service and later as we served my parents after their health failed due to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. There was rarely a day that went by in which my mother didn't call, checking on each one of her children--particularly her daughters. She would always start the phone conversation with "Ramona, it's your mother"--a statement that was not needed, as Iknew immediately who was calling.<br><br>President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency said:<br><br><i>The Lord and His Church have always encouraged education to increase our ability to serve Him and our Heavenly Father's children. For each of us, whatever our talents, He has service for us to give. And to do it well always involves learning, not once or for a limited time, but continually</i>. ["Education for Real Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 2002, 17; see also "Real-Life Education,"<i>New Era,</i>April 2009, 4]<br><br>Mom was always serving others, especially her family. She was a registered nurse and frequently used her nursing skills to help people in our family, ward, and neighborhood. For several years two neighborhood boys would stop by the house in the morning before school to receive their required injections.<br><br>Mom always found ways to serve, often without being asked. During Josh's rehabilitation, our two-year-old son, Travis, was faced with the difficult choice of going with me to the hospital for long, tedious hours of rehabilitation for his brother or spending the day with Grandma. Most of the time he chose Grandma. Travis was a very talkative two-year-old, and, like most two-year-olds, much of what he said was understandable only to him.<br><br>Travis was very inquisitive. He wanted to know how things worked and why, how birds fly, and why we breathe air. He could talk all day long without tiring. At the end of one such day Mom was pretty much worn out, but she still had to be a mother to my three youngest sisters. As my sisters arrived home from school, she told them firmly yet lovingly that no one was to talk to her for<i>at least 30 minutes.</i>She needed some quiet time to relax and reflect--and recuperate!<br><br>Josh's experience has taught us all that each individual needs some quiet time to think, ponder, and reflect. It is especially important to make time for reflection and gratitude, even when dealing with adversity, and to reflect on the many ways we are blessed in this life.<br><br>During the Second World War Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist and an Austrian Jew. He had a visa to immigrate to the United States but decided to stay in Austria to stay with and protect his parents from the Nazis and the concentration or extermination camps. Dr. Frankl's book<i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>details his and others' experiences as prisoners in Auschwitz and other camps. Dr. Frankl described the shock, humiliation, apathy, and depersonalization that he and the other prisoners experienced and their reactions to their experiences in the concentration and extermination camps. He described their arrival at the camps in overcrowded cattle cars, the loss of all possessions including clothing and hair, starvation, overwork, and many other hardships that were endured for years--if they survived the camps. Dr. Frankl also wrote about some individuals who did not allow the situation and their treatment in the camps to dehumanize them:<br><br><i>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.</i>[Trans. Ilse Lasch (Boston: Beacon Press, 2006), 65–66]<i></i><br><br>We can choose our response to adversity. We can be bitter and angry, and we can choose to let it fester, canker, and destroy who we are. Or we can learn to love, forgive, accept, and learn from our fate and forget ourselves in the service of others.<br><br>While the road was and is hard and long, it has been a little over thirty years since Joshua's accident. We have gone through good times and bad, successes and failures; we have grown close as a family. The experience, although something I would never want to happen to anyone, has been one of refinement, change, and, I hope, improvement. We have learned patience and love. And as the day-to-day challenges present themselves to us, we realize that they are not that large, and although they are sometimes inconvenient and poorly timed, we are able to overcome them and move forward. Even when the occasional major stumbling block shows up on our doorstep, we face it head-on and realize it is probably not as difficult as something that we have already been through. The refiner's fire burns bright. It is up to us to decide if it will consume us or mold us into something new, something better, something great.<br><br>You may be wondering what happened to our two sons. Joshua graduated from high school and served an honorable mission to the Oregon Portland Mission. He attended a singles ward, where he met and married a wonderful young woman, Calli. Josh and Calli have two children: our only granddaughter and a four-month-old son.<br><br>Travis used his "advanced conversational skills" while serving a mission to the Cambodian-speaking Pennsylvania Philadelphia Mission. He too met his eternal companion, Marcie, at a singles ward, and they recently had their third son, our fifth grandchild.<br><br>Both of our sons and their families live close enough to us that we see them often, and we are able to watch and smile as the miracle continues.<br><br>In general conference, Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated:<br><br><i>Healing blessings come in many ways, each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. Sometimes a "healing" cures our illness or lifts our burden. But sometimes we are "healed" by being given strength or understanding or patience to bear the burdens placed upon us....</i><br><br><i>The healing power of the Lord Jesus Christ--whether it removes our burdens or strengthens us to endure and live with them like the Apostle Paul--is available for every affliction in mortality.</i>["He Heals the Heavy Laden,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 7–8]<br><br>While a prisoner in Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith received the following reassurance about adversities and the trials of life: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7).<br><br>Adversity in some form will likely come into all of our lives. For some of us it might be a light dusting while for others it may appear as an insurmountable, all-encompassing avalanche. If we rely on the Lord, we not only can survive adversity, we can learn, grow, and thrive. It is my hope and prayer that each of us will not only triumph over the adversity in our lives but will be able to serve and lighten others' burdens. I say this in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ramona O.

<br>
As a scientist, I make observations that help me develop explanations for what Isee in the laboratory. These explanations are called hypotheses, and they can be tested in the laboratory to determine whether or not they are true. An example of a hypothesis that I might make is "because chemicals A and B are known to be reactive, I reason, or 'hypothesize,' that if A and B are mixed together, they will react and form product C."<br><br>One of the first challenges that we as scientists face in testing our hypotheses is to determine the "definitive test," or the analysis that allows us to unequivocally establish whether or not our hypothesis is correct.<br><br>While many times our hypotheses can be simply stated, actually testing whether or not our expected outcomes materialize can be tricky.<br><br>Let me give you an example of a simple experiment. If I mix solutions A and B--both of which are clear but reactive--I predict, or hypothesize, that when they are mixed, they will form product C, which is colored. Let's watch this experiment.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL1sUnljNHY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br><br>Here we have clear solution A, in which we pour solution B. Product C, which is dark colored, eventually develops.<br><br>As we saw, product C was dark blue, and thus its presence was quite easy to detect. But did you notice that there was a time element involved in this test? If we only watched for the first seven or eight seconds, we would not have seen the colored product C and would have erroneously concluded that the prediction was incorrect. The take-home message from this experiment is that in order to really test the prediction we had to be willing to wait long enough for things to happen. Stated differently, we needed a degree of patience.<br><br>Another frequent outcome of scientific experiments is that they don't always work as we expect.<br><br>Let me show you another experiment that illustrates this principle. In this example we're going to watch as an ice cube is placed on top of some gray powder. Based upon previous experiences of mixing water with such powders, you might suppose that we'll get a pile of damp gray powder or gray mud.<br><br>Let's do the experiment and see what happens. I should caution you that this is notone that you want to do at home!<br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK6PFN_tPj4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br><br>Here is our gray powder, and here is the ice cube. The powder explodes and burns.<br><br>I suspect that's not the outcome you were predicting, and you may have been surprised by what you saw. While these types of experiments have surprising conclusions, such outcomes can be truly enlightening because they lead us to think more deeply and often generate important new understanding and knowledge. However, they can also be discouraging because we don't immediately understand what has happened. In this case we may give up and, in doing so, fail to gain the understanding and new knowledge that we could have received.<br><br>The reason that I have taken time to discusshow scientists learn in their laboratories is that I believe there are similarities between how and what we as scientists learn in our laboratories and how and what we as brothers and sisters in the gospel learn from the experiences of our lives. I would even go a step further and suggest that the process of learning that each of us undergoes in our lives might be described as "learning in life's laboratory."<br><br>How is it that learning in life's lab and learning in the science lab are similar?<br><br>We as brothers and sisters experience situations in life and try to understand them in the context of what we know and what we have previously experienced. While we don't often make formal hypotheses, we do try to understand the meaning of our experiences and to learn and grow from them.<br><br>Just as in the experiment with the ice cube and the gray powder, sometimes what we experience is not what we expect or predict or even desire. Another way of saying this is that "sometimes our lives simply don't go as we plan."<br><br>Applying this to life as a college student, examples of things not going as planned might include a low exam score after hours of studying or a relationship that just doesn't turn out as we hoped or a disappointing response to applications to graduate or professional schools or for work.<br><br>Just as we have seen in the science lab, these unplanned and unexpected results in life's laboratory can be at times confusing, frustrating, and discouraging.<br><br>Today I would like to share three lessons that I have learned from the experiences from my life. I do so with the sincere hope that these lessons might in some way be helpful to you.<br><h2><b>The Lesson of the Green Table</b></h2><br>The first lesson that I would like to share is one I call the Lesson of the Green Table.<br><br>In my bedroom as a child there was a small, green table. There wasn't anything special about this green table, other than the fact that I played on it frequently. One of my treasured possessions as a young boy was a genuine cavalry fort and soldier set from a classic American TV adventure program entitled <i>Rin Tin Tin.</i><br><br>During the day I would get out the <i>Rin Tin Tin</i> set and line up the toy soldiers and their horses on the green table. In my imagination Iwould send the cavalry troops out on exciting adventures to rescue the innocent from some impending disaster. As a young boy, it just didn't get much better than that.<br><br>At the end of the day I would put away my toys, and the green table became the place where my parents and I would meet as they taught me to pray. I remember vividly my mother or father or both coming into my room and teaching me to kneel down by the green table and say my prayers. I don't remember much about those simple prayers, but I suspect they contained my thanks for my toys, my love for my family members, and some simple requests for things that seemed important to me at the time.<br><br>And yet this was one of the great training events in my life.<br><br>As a result of this training and experience, I don't ever remember questioning whether my Heavenly Father was on the other end of my prayers. I didn't think this belief was particularly unusual until I spoke with some of my friends who didn't share my beliefs. As the years went by, the green table and my toys eventually disappeared, but my prayers and my faith that they would be answered did not disappear.<br><br>Many of my prayers were undoubtedly for trivial things, but as I grew and gained more experience, my prayers became highly focused and intensely sincere as I pled for help with the challenges of my life.<br><br>One day when I was probably about eight to ten years of age, I came home on a Saturday afternoon to find my father outside our home, wandering about in a dazed and not very coherent manner. I had never seen my father like this before, and I became genuinely worried about him. I went to get help, and we were able to get my dad into bed and call the doctor. While we waited for the doctor to come and help my father, we investigated and found a ladder tipped over the steep stairs that led down to our basement. We surmised that my dad had been trying to change the light bulb over the stairway and, in the process, had fallen from the ladder onto the long row of stairs that went to our basement. This apparent fall had left him in a state that I had never witnessed before. This was a crisis in my young life, for I had no idea whether my dad's injury was truly serious or not.<br><br>Based on my previous experiences at the green table, I went into my room, where I knelt and pled with my Father in Heaven to help my earthly father to be all right. As with previous prayers, my Heavenly Father answered my plea for help, and my earthly father recovered nicely. This and a number of other experiences with prayer helped me to develop great trust and faith in my Father in Heaven and in prayer.<br><br>While the childhood experiences are long since gone, life's challenging experiences continue. When I was your age, I was intent on going to medical school. My life was planned around this goal. As often as I could, I went to hospitals to shadow physicians I knew, and I worked in a clinical laboratory to gain experience. Just as it is now, getting into medical school in my day was intensely competitive. Imade this goal a matter of sincere prayer, asking for the help that Ineeded to accomplish my goal.<br><br>I applied to medical schools several times and kept praying for success. After many months and nothing but rejection letters, an answer to my prayers was received. The answer that came into my mind was a very distinctive impression that "all would work out well," and it was accompanied by an intense feeling of peace. This made me feel good, and I interpreted this answer to my prayer as meaning that I would be accepted into medical school and live happily ever after.<br><br>But this was not to be. No acceptance letters came after months of trying, and it became time for me to graduate. I ended up working for a few years while I struggled to figure out what to do with my life that wasn't going as planned. Idecided that if I couldn't go to medical school, I needed to move on and make a new plan for a career. Because I loved the sciences--immunology in particular, which is the study of the body's immune system--I decided to continue my education in this subject. My wife, Ann, and I did what was needed to make this new goal a reality. She sacrificed greatly for me to be able to go back to school for master's and doctoral degrees and a postdoctoral fellowship--some nine and a half years of additional education that took us from coast to coast. The long and the short of this story is that "everything did indeed work out," just as the answer to my prayers had indicated, even though it didn't work out in the way that I initially had anticipated or in the time frame that I had expected.<br><br>As I look back upon my life, great blessings have come to us because I didn't go to medical school. I am involved in a career that I absolutely love, and it has brought great blessings, wonderful people, and fascinating experiences into my life.<br><br>I suspect that there are those in the audience today for whom life will not work out as you plan or expect or anticipate. For example, you also may not be able to do what you always planned on doing, or challenges may occur that you didn't anticipate.<br><br>The concrete lesson that the green table experience has taught me is that we have a loving and kind Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and who will help us in our lives. I have also learned that what is important to me also seems important enough to my Heavenly Father that He will listen and answer in a way that is truly best for me, just as He will answer in the way that is best for you.<br><h2><b>The Lesson of the Berlin Wall</b></h2><br>The second lesson that I would like to share is what I call the Lesson of the Berlin Wall.<br><br>In August 1989 I was able to visit Berlin to attend a world conference on immunology. This was a very special event for me for a number of reasons that were not all related to science. I was raised in a family of German missionaries. My father and brother, my aunt and uncle, and my cousins had served missions in Germany and spoke with great love for the country and its people. This was also a moving time for me because my German missionary father had passed away a few months prior to this conference.<br><br>My uncle and aunt, who had spent a considerable portion of their lives serving in Church callings in Germany, knew that this was a tender time for me, and they were gracious enough to contact their friend, Dieter Berndt, in Berlin to see if there were any possibility that I could stay with him during my short visit. Brother Berndt graciously invited me to stay at his home, and I had the opportunity of a lifetime to interact with him and his family in a city that my father had served in.<br><br>At the time of my visit Berlin was a divided city due to the presence of the Berlin Wall, which was erected in August 1961.<br><br>[Image of the Berlin Wall shown.] This is a snapshot of the Berlin Wall that doesn't show the barbed wire, the armed guards, or the gloom that was associated with this wall. However, it clearly shows the division that it brought about in the city of Berlin.<br><br>This wall broke Berlin into the free western portion and the communist eastern one. Two separate governments ruled the city, and each had a very different philosophy about life and personal freedom. I had the opportunity to visit East Berlin while I was there, and I found it as different from West Berlin as a black-and-white image is different from a color photograph.<br><br>One rainy night Brother Berndt took me out for a tour of West Berlin. As we traveled along the wall that separated philosophies, governments, and families, he pointed out that there were places with white crosses painted on the Wall or adjacent to it. He explained to me that these crosses represented memorials to those who had lost their lives as they tried to escape the captivity of East Berlin into free West Berlin.<br><br>As we drove along I asked Brother Berndt if he thought the Wall would ever come down.<br><br>Now, to appreciate his answer, you have to understand who Brother Berndt was in terms of his background. Here was a man who had his feet in both church and university circles; he was educated in both spiritual and secular things. If anyone might give a valid prediction of the Wall's future, it was Brother Berndt.<br><br>Now to his answer to my question about the Wall coming down: he turned to me and stated, "No, it can't come down." He went on to explain that economically it made no sense and that it just couldn't occur because the governments would not allow it to do so.<br><br>Well, for those of you who are not familiar with the rest of the story of the Wall, some eight to twelve weeks after my conference concluded, I was back home in Virginia glued to our TV, watching as the dismantling of the Berlin Wall was taking place. Thus the wall that could never come down was being taken apart before my eyes! I believe that this happened because the Lord was ready for it to come down to further His purposes.<br><br>What is the lesson that this experience taught me? Events can and do occur in our lives that are unexpected and, often, on a timetable that is not our own. Whether different than expected or faster or slower than anticipated, the Lord works on His own time schedule and in His own way.<br><br>In the case of the Berlin Wall, there was not a hint of its coming down when I was there--not even to a leader in the Church with years of education and experience in the secular world.<br><br>It is important to note in the case of the Berlin Wall that the time frame of its coming down was much more rapid than anyone might have conceived.<br><br>In contrast, there are many instances when the Lord's time schedule is much longer than what we might predict or desire. I think this latter situation is reflected in the phrase "learning to wait upon the Lord."<br><br>I have experienced, as I suspect you have, prayers to which answers seem to be long in coming. Nevertheless, my experiences in life have taught me with assurance that the answers do and will come.<br><h2><b>The Lesson of the Savior's Power to Heal</b></h2><br>The third lesson that I have learned through my experiences in life's laboratory is one that gives me constant hope. It has been taught to me through my own experiences and through the experiences of others. It is tightly linked to the other two lessons that I have shared.<br><br>This third lesson is that the healing power of the Savior is real and that it can touch our lives.<br><br>The all-encompassing nature of the Savior'spower to heal is taught in many placeswithin the scriptures. One of my favorite places is in the Book of Mormon in 1 Nephi, when Nephi saw the vision of the tree of life and was shown the life, mission, and sacrifice of the Son of God. Let me read from 1 Nephi 11:31:<br><br><i>I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. ... And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</i><br><br>As I have pondered this scripture, I have marveled at the Savior's love and His efforts toheal us.<br><br>I am first struck with the observation that the Savior was not distant from those whom He healed. In point of fact, He was "among" them. His healing act was personal. I am amazed that among all the creations so extensive that they cannot be numbered by man, the Lord knows us as individuals.<br><br>The second message that this scripture brings to my mind is the depth and variety of challenges and problems that the Savior dealt with. It appears to me from my reading of this scripture that His healing capacity was not limited to healing physical illness, as those who came to the Him had "all manner of disease," which sounds all-encompassing. This scripture, when coupled with life's experiences, teaches me that He can heal even the maladies of our souls.<br><br>As I consider my life, there are times when I am in need of that healing that comes only from Him. Perhaps you, too, have felt this need in your lives.<br><br>Because I have felt His healing power in my life and in my family's lives, I have learned that He who is our Savior is the friend of the comfortless and of those who are having problems--whether they are problems with classes, with dating, or with any of the other significant challenges that specifically trouble you and trouble me.<br><h2><b>The Silver Lining</b></h2><br>The message that I have endeavored to share today is that life's experiential laboratory has been a wonderful teacher. The learning process for me has not been easy--just as I suspect it has not been for you. Three important lessons that I have learned in life's laboratory are:<br><br>1. That prayer is real and that the Lord is not only accessible to us but He is a God of miracles. I have come to know through the experiences of my life that He is interested in us and what is important in our lives.<br><br>2. That the timetable of the Lord is different than our own and that it can be either quicker or slower than what we might expect. This observation leads me to understand that we must learn to "wait upon the Lord."<br><br>3. And, finally, the Lord knows us as individuals, and He can lift us and heal us.<br><br>Now, just as I began this talk with a science experiment, I would like to end it with one. This experiment illustrates the most important lesson I have learned in my life.<br><br>Let me describe to you what you are about to see. I will preface this description with the suggestion that what you will see is, in my view, a metaphor of the testing that goes on in life's laboratory.<br><br>You will see two colorless liquids mixed together. I would like you to pay careful attention to what you then see. Look for three color changes to occur: change 1, from clear to dark; change 2, from dark to a muddy but lighter brown; and change 3, from muddy brown to, well, let's watch and see.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSimsVRcak" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br><br>Two colorless liquids are mixed together. Look for the color changes. You can see the darkness coming in. Then it begins to lighten. And at last we have a beautiful silver lining to the vessel.<br><br>What do these stages of this reaction suggest to me?<br><br>1. The mixture started out as clear--much asour lives do when everything is going well.<br><br>2. It then became very dark--almost black--similar to the storms that come into our lives. These storms may consist of low exam scores, personal relationship problems, failure to meet a goal, or feeling all alone with great personal struggles.<br><br>3. The dark then lightened and became a muddy brown color--similar to the storms passing and things seeming a bit better; yet we continue, perhaps, to still feel confused or be in need of further help.<br><br>4. Lastly, the brown color gave way to shining silver--the "silver lining" at the end ofthe trials.<br><br>It is important to note that the silver lining comes when we gain understanding and the Savior's influence and love enter our lives. You'll note that this didn't occur until after the dark period had already transpired.<br><br>In a beautiful scripture in the book of Revelation, the Savior referred to Himself as "the bright and morning star" (22:16). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once taught that after the "long night of darkness" comes the morning and "the bright and morning star," or the influence, love, power, and peace of the Savior (from the Saturday evening session of astake conference in the Orem, Utah, Cascade Stake, 2007). It is this influence in our lives that is the quiet after the storm and the peace that exceeds all understanding. He is the silver lining to our lives. He is the Bright and Morning Star.<br><br>The experiences of my life, a few of which Ihave shared today, logically teach me of a loving Heavenly Father and Savior who are vitally interested in us.<br><br>However, and far more important than logic, is the witness of the Holy Ghost that allows me to testify that we have a living Heavenly Father who loves us and is vitally interested in and concerned about us.<br><br>Furthermore, His divine Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior, and through His atoning sacrifice we can be lifted, healed, and redeemed.<br><br>I bear witness of these things and the ultimate peace, light, and life that come from the Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gregory F.

<h1>d the Public Square - Joseph Lieberman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, President Samuelson, for that introduction. And thank you all for that extremely warm welcome. It's great to be here at this beautiful and storied Brigham Young University campus. I must say, President Samuelson, that in listening to your introduction, which was very generous, I thought back to an occasion a few years ago in Washington, DC, when former secretary of state Henry Kissinger was the keynote speaker.<br><br>The chairman of the meeting got up at the moment Kissinger was going to speak and said, "Henry Kissinger really needs no introduction, so I give you Dr. Henry Kissinger."<br><br>Kissinger got up and said in his inimitable voice: "It's probably true that I do not need an introduction, but you know it's also true that Ilike a good introduction."<br><br>President Samuelson, that was a great introduction from a great man who honored me with a comment that appears in the front of my book <i>The Gift of Rest</i> and who has done such an extraordinary job here at BYU. I have the greatest admiration for this university's work in educating minds, ennobling spirits, and inspiring in its students a commitment--a real-life commitment--to the words etched in stone at the entrance of this great campus: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." I will come back to that.<br><br>Let me now personally thank Elder L. Tom Perry and Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for being here this morning and for their leadership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am truly honored by their presence and very grateful for the opportunity we had to speak for a few moments before this forum began. It is the faith of the Church that has inspired, informed, and energized this great university and succeeding generations of its graduates.<br><h2><b>An Ecumenical Spirit</b></h2><br>The Spirit of God fills this campus, and with it I can tell you today that I feel an ecumenical spirit. I feel that ecumenical spirit so deeply that I'm going to venture forth and take the risk of telling a joke--an ecumenical joke. Perhaps some of you have heard it; if you haven't, I hope you enjoy it.<br><br>This is the story of the day when the chief rabbi in Jerusalem called the pope in the Vatican and said, "Your Holiness, I have good news and bad news to tell you. Which would you like to hear first?"<br><br>The pope said to the chief rabbi, "I'd like to hear the good news first."<br><br>So the rabbi said to the pope, "Well, here's the good news: I can tell you for a certainty that the Savior is coming to earth tomorrow." (Now we have a minor doctrinal dispute about whether this is the First or the Second Coming, but we'll be able to handle that.)<br><br>So the pope said, "That is not just good news; that's the greatest news. That's the news we've all been waiting to hear. What possibly could be the bad news?"<br><br>"Well," the chief rabbi said, "apparently He's going to Salt Lake City."<br><br>Thank you for laughing. I do feel a special connection to the Mormon faith and to BYU because of the core principles this university stands for, which are at once rooted in the tradition of the Mormon faith but also clearly shared by most Americans and, I would say, certainly most religiously observant Jewish Americans. Throughout my life I've been blessed to experience the bond that exists between people of faith whose faiths are different. And I have felt that in my life with the Mormons I have been privileged to know, to have as friends, or to work with. People of faith share a lot, beginning with our gratitude for what we've been given--first and foremost for our lives.<br><br>We believe both what the Bible and the Declaration of Independence tell us. The Bible clearly tells us we are not here by accident but because of a divine, godly act of creation. And as the declaration, written by men of faith, tells us, every one of us is a child of God, and, as such, each and every one of us has inalienable rights, by birth, to "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." Webelieve that each of us, with those rights, also has responsibilities that are articulated in our faiths. And we believe that each of us has a destiny and that this great nation of ours has a destiny.<br><br>That's why I'm so pleased that you have asked me to speak this morning about faith in the public square--faith in the American ­public square. It is a subject that I've thought about a lot, written about a little bit, and lived a lot in what I think is a classically and wonderfully American way. My Jewish faith is central to my life. I was raised in a religiously observant family. Given to me by my parents and formed by my rabbis, my faith has provided me with a foundation, an order, and a sense of purpose in my life. It has much to do with the way I strive to navigate in a constructive way through every day, both personally and ­professionally, in ways that are large and small.<br><h2><b>The Sabbath Day</b></h2><br>One of the central observances of my faith and also of the Mormon faith is the observance of the Sabbath: to "remember the sabbath day," as the commandment says, "to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8). As President Samuelson has been kind enough to say, my observance of the Sabbath is the subject of the book I've written called <i>The Gift of Rest: Rediscovering the Beauty of the Sabbath.</i><br><br>Some people have asked, "Why would a United States senator write a book about a religious subject like the Sabbath?"<br><br>It's a good question. This book is very different from anything I've ever written. I think that while people in Connecticut certainly know I'm Sabbath observant--and perhaps people around the country, because of my vice-­presidential campaign in 2000, also know that I'm Sabbath observant--I never really was asked to talk a lot more than that about it. I think people probably know what I don't do from Friday night sundown to Saturday night sundown--which is I don't work unless there's an emergency of some kind--but they don't know what I do. So I decided to write this book to try to share what I call the gift of Sabbath rest.<br><br>It is interesting that the Sabbath is observed by all of us as the result of a commandment in the Bible that God gave to Moses. Though it started as a directive, I know that many of you who observe the Sabbath, as my family and I do, now experience it as a gift. In the Talmud a rabbi of centuries and centuries ago imagined a conversation between God and Moses in which God said, "Moses, in my storehouse I have a very special gift for you. It is called the Sabbath" (paraphrased from <i>New Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, </i>ed. Michael L. Rodkinson, vol. 1, <i>Tract Sabbath</i> [New York: New Amsterdam Book Company, 1896], 18).<br><br>I decided to write this book because I think Sabbath observance has diminished in our country over the course of my life, and the country has lost something as a result. I believe that this day--this institution, thousands of years old--is probably more relevant and necessary today than ever before. And it is relevant not just in a religious sense but in a quality-of-life sense, because we're all working so hard and we never get away from work unless we choose to. We always have our cell phones, our Blackberries, our iPads, or our iPhones with us. This book is an attempt to invite the reader to come with my wife, my family, and me through a typical Sabbath day observed according to a traditional Jewish practice.<br><br>I wrote this book in part for Jews who may not be observing the Sabbath as much as I would like, but I really wrote it for people of all faiths--and even for people with no particular faith--hoping that they will decide to accept the gift in whole or in part and bring it into their lives.<br><br>At different times in my career my Sabbath observance has intersected with my political life in governmental responsibility because it is different from the rules most people live by. When I first ran for office back in the 1970s and was lucky enough to become a state senator in Connecticut, I made an early decision that I would never be involved in politics on the Sabbath. If I held an office that had governmental responsibilities that I couldn't delegate, such as voting as a senator or going to a meeting about a national security crisis, Iwould do that. I was instructed by my rabbis that when life intersects with religious law, life has to triumph, particularly on the Sabbath, which after all is a day in which we are honoring God's creation of life. How inconsistent it would be if one had the opportunity to protect life--to protect security--and to not do that in observance of a religious law that's meant to commemorate the Sabbath.<br><br>Early on, when I was a state senator and people would ask me to a political event or a testimonial dinner on the Sabbath, I'd say no. Sometimes they were puzzled; other times they were just plain angry, and I would have to explain. But I can tell you that, over time, as they realized I couldn't come as a matter of religious observance and belief (and that I was doing so consistently), they accepted my answer and respected it. I was different from most of them in those practices, but in the spirit that I think is fundamentally American, those differences did not get in the way of them respecting my beliefs, supporting my career, and, in some sense, even feeling that interfaith bond. Though we were of different faiths, we were joined in a classically American style by a shared belief in God and everything that comes from that.<br><h2><b>America, a Faith-Based Initiative</b></h2><br>We are now at the start of a presidential campaign in which discussions and debates about the relationship between politics and religion--about the proper place of faith in the public square--have already begun to play a prominent role.<br><br>These are not new questions; they are very old. They go back to the founders of our country who wrote the Declaration of Independence and later the Constitution. The words of our founders are relevant because they remind us that from the beginning of America we have been a nation that has defined itself not so much by our geographical borders as by our national values. One of those values was and is a belief shared by most Americans that there is a God. I know that may be controversial to some, because though we have that belief, we respect the rights of those who don't share that belief. The new nation of the United States of America was formed "to secure these rights"--the rights that are mentioned in the second paragraph of our first document, the rights to "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness," which are the endowment of our Creator. I always like to say that the truth is that America has been from the beginning a faith-based initiative, and anybody who tries to separate faith from America's public square is doing something unnatural and ultimately bad for our country.<br><br>Our founders were all men of a particular Christian disposition, mostly Protestant, so you have to give them extraordinary credit, for when it came to religion, the remarkable documents they wrote and embraced guaranteed religious freedom for everyone--not just the people who shared their faith. They prohibited the establishment of any one religion, an official religion. They might have been tempted to have an official religion and still give others freedom of religion, but they didn't--even though Christians were, and are now, a large majority in this country.<br><br>The founders were remarkable people. The First Amendment of our constitution prohibits the "establishment" of an official religion and ensures for every American the right to worship (or, as I said, not to worship) as he or she chooses. I was delighted one day with the thought that one of the rights to liberty that our Creator has endowed us with is the right to <i>not</i> believe in the Creator. And though that's not a right many Americans exercise, it's a measure of the breadth of the vision of the founders that it is so.<br><br>In Article VI of the Constitution of the United States, the founders did something else quite specific to guarantee this vision: They protected every American from religious discrimination in politics by prohibiting what they called religious tests for public office.<br><br>The truth is that in many of the original colonies of the United States there were laws saying that you had to be of a particular Christian denomination to run for public office. But, quite remarkably, the founders wanted to rise above that.<br><br>Succeeding generations have been inspired by this founding vision and have endeavored to make real its promise--the promise of what I call freedom <i>of</i> religion, not freedom <i>from</i> religion.<br><br>Our unique constitutional history created in turn a unique American public square in which there is no establishment of one religion but freedom for all religions. There is the presence of religion in our public life. The greatest laws that are written, including our constitution, are the ones that are so broadly accepted by the people of a nation such as ours that they become not just laws that one feels compelled to follow, because they are in the law, but part of the fiber of the country; they become part of our national system of ethics. So, too, is it with freedom of religion.<br><br>Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French student of America, noted the remarkable religiosity of Americans in his definitive account of the United States written in the nineteenth century. He wrote that there was no country that he had ever seen in which "religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men [Iwould add, now, women, too] than in America." He added that "there can be no greater proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature, than that its influence is powerfully felt over the most enlightened and free nation of the earth" (<i>Democracy in America, </i>trans. Henry Reeve, vol. 1 [New York: The Century Co., 1898], 388).<br><br>I think that is still true today. I saw a recent independent public opinion poll that said that over 90 percent of Americans say they believe in God. I'm always encouraged to see how far ahead of politicians God is running in those polls. And the majority of Americans say that they regularly attend a house of worship.<br><br>Alexis de Tocqueville also observed that though Americans were divided into many different religious sects, as he called them, "they all look upon their religion in the same light" (<i>Democracy in America: Part the Second, The Social Influence of Democracy, </i>trans. Henry Reeve [New York: J. &amp;amp; H. G. Langley, 1840], 27). He recognized that though Americans follow many different belief systems, there are universal values that unite us all, and that is a second consequence of our country's unique commitment to freedom of religion but not freedom from religion.<br><h2><b>Faith in the American Public Square</b></h2><br>Religious freedom in America in the public square has given birth to the development of a set of shared religious values that were obviously evident in the nineteenth century and, Ithink, at our best moments, remain so today. President Abraham Lincoln called this America's "political religion" (<i>Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings, </i>ed. Roy P. Basler [New York: The World Publishing Company, 1969], 81), and the poet Walt Whitman praised what he called "a sublime and serious Religious Democracy" in America (<i>Complete Prose Works </i>[Philadelphia: David McKay, 1897], 244).<br><br>In American history this sublime and ­serious combination of religion and democracy has overall been a force for great good. Some of the most important movements of conscience in our history emerged from the convictions of religious people and used the language and liturgy of faith to build popular support. I am thinking of the abolitionist movement in the nineteenth century that led to the end of the evil of slavery. It was that same spirit that motivated much of the suffragist movement in the early part of the twentieth century that fought for and won rights for women in our country. And it was that same spirit that I was personally privileged to witness when I was a college student in the sixties and participated in the civil rights movement led by a religious figure, Dr. Martin Luther King, who invoked America's political religion, as Lincoln called it, in advancing that noble cause.<br><br>I, myself, was inspired to join that movement because of the values it represented, which were deeply rooted in my own faith and religious history: the values of equality, of­service, of tolerance, and of respect for law.<br><br>It was also while I was at college that another important barrier in America was broken. In the fall of my freshman year a Roman Catholic, John F. Kennedy, was elected to the presidency of the United States for the first time in American history. I will tell you that as a young Jewish American (though I was not thinking of a political career, believe me, at age eighteen), when he won I had some sense that doors had opened for me, that somehow a horizon had expanded for me and for others who were from faiths that were not the majority, for different races, or for other nationalities. I didn't know how or where that might happen, but I felt inspired and empowered by Kennedy's election. At that point I certainly wasn't dreaming yet of being a senator, and Inever could have imagined what would ­happen to me in 2000.<br><br>In 2000, then vice president Al Gore gave me the privilege of being the first Jewish American to be nominated for national office when he asked me to be his vice-presidential running mate. In that year I personally experienced so much of what I have described--the American people's generosity of fairness and acceptance of religious diversity.<br><br>The Reverend Jesse Jackson said on the dayI was nominated, "Each time a barrier falls for one person, the doors of opportunity open wider for every other American" ("Lieberman on Joining the Democratic Ticket: 'I Am Humbled and Honored,'" <i>New York Times, </i>9August 2000, A16).<br><br>I felt that warm sense of shared progress throughout the campaign. I also felt free--as somebody noted recently, freer than Kennedy did in some ways--to talk about my religion and the central role of faith in my life. I wrote about all this in my book, but I want to share a few anecdotes from my book with you that make a larger point, I hope, about the constructive role of faith in America's public square.<br><br>There was a secret service agent who ­traveled with me during that campaign. He hadworked several national campaigns before, and he told me one day that he had never heard so many people saying to a candidate, "God bless you." I thought about that, and I honestly think it's a reflection of Christian Americans saying to me in those magical words: "We know you are a religious person. We know you don't have exactly the same religious faith or observance that we do, but we know we share a common history, and we're glad you're running."<br><br>On another occasion, in a slightly more humorous example, I remember speaking to a rally of Latino Americans and seeing in the front row a woman who had created a poster that vividly expressed this sense of shared values and rising together of which I am speaking now. With two powerful words that I don't think have ever appeared together before, the poster read, "Viva Chutzpah!" That said it all.<br><br>In the end the Gore-Lieberman ticket ­actually received over half a million more votes than the Bush-Cheney ticket--something I enjoyed reminding President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney of very often. Believe me, I do not cite these numbers to relitigate that small matter of Florida's electoral votes but because I think, like sports, politics ultimately comes down to numbers. So I cite those half million votes as the best--to me, and I hope to everybody--inspiring evidence, unambiguous evidence, that our ticket was judged on the basis of our qualifications and policies and most definitely not on the basis of my religion, because my religion <i>is</i> different, asI said before.<br><br>And as I get to the next section of what I want to say, let me describe some of the ways in which my religion is different. You know there is a code; there are rules. There are rules that rabbis created over the centuries to define some of the basic principles in the Torah, the Hebrew Bible, and the Old Testament. For instance, we have pretty rigid rules for observances about what we can eat and drink and when. We observant Jews, particularly women, have a dress code that we're supposed to follow. Something that is probably not known by many people is that there is even a prescription for Jewish men to wear a particular undergarment. Is this beginning to sound familiar? We have different practices. But the great thing I experienced in 2000 was that those practices were set aside because of all we shared and also because of our national ideals of religious freedom and because we had no religious tests for public office.<br><h2><b>A Return to American Founding Principles</b></h2><br>In this 2012 presidential election cycle, faith and politics are again going to become a source of some controversy--first in the expression that some have given to their faith (particularly Governor Rick Perry and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann). Some people have real anxiety about that.<br><br>I don't share that anxiety. A candidate does not give up their freedom of religion or freedom of expression when they decide to run for office. They have the right, if they choose, to talk about the role that faith plays in their life, understanding that others (voters) have the right to decide, based on those expressions, whether that affects their view of those candidates. Personally, I always welcome the opportunity to hear about a candidate's faith and what it means to them because I think it helps me understand them better as a person.<br><br>The second religious controversy in the 2012 campaign is, of course, close to BYU. It is that two members of The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints are running for president: Governor Mitt Romney and Governor Jon Huntsman. And one of them, Governor Romney, a distinguished graduate of this university, may well end up as the Republican nominee.<br><br>In these Republican primary campaigns, and in the general election, if Governor Romney is nominated, Americans are going to be challenged again to be true to our founding principles of equality of opportunity and the clear prohibition of Article VI of the Constitution of areligious test being applied for public office.<br><br>In 1960, when John F. Kennedy was running for president, there was still significant anti-Catholic prejudice in America. On the eve of the vote, he spoke about this. His words remain quite relevant today--I think this time more relevant to Governor Romney and Governor Huntsman, at least based on some of what I consider to be the prejudicial things that have been said about their faith and its relevance to this campaign. President Kennedy said in the 1960 campaign:<br><br><i>If this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans</i> [who happen to be Catholic] <i>lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.</i> ["Address of Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, September 12, 1960"; www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/ALL6YEBJMEKYGMCntnSCvg.aspx]<br><br>And, of course, the same will be true if Americans judge Governor Romney or Governor Huntsman in the primaries or ­general election based on their Mormon faith and not on their personal qualities and their ideals and ideas for office.<br><br>Just as Americans rose above their prejudices or their discomfort at the differences when Kennedy's Roman Catholic faith was different in 1960--and sixteen years later when Jimmy Carter's Christian evangelical faith was different and again in 2000 when my Jewish faith was different--so, too, must Governor Romney be judged, not on the basis of his faith, which may be different to many, but on his personal qualities, his leadership, his experience, and his ideas for America's future.<br><br>My personal experience in 2000, which I have described to you today, gives me great confidence that voters will again reject any sectarian religious tests and show their strong character, their instinctive fairness, and their steadfast belief in the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And when they do, another barrier may well be broken for another group in America. And the doors of opportunity will thereby open wider for every American.<br><h2><b>Regaining Characteristic American Optimism</b></h2><br>Now let me conclude by sharing just one more way in which I believe that faith in the public square is profoundly important, not just to the current campaign but to this current difficult time of American life: a time when millions of Americans can't find work; when millions of other Americans who have work are worried about whether they will still have their jobs next year; when a shocking number of Americans have lost the characteristic American optimism in America's future; when all too many Americans, an overwhelming majority, unfortunately, for reasons that are understandable, have lost confidence in our government; and when many, both here at home and among our enemies in the world, believe that America has begun an irreversible decline.<br><br>In my opinion this pessimism is absolutely unjustified--unjustified by fact or history. I believe that this twenty-first century will be another great century for America. But we must regain confidence in ourselves.<br><br>One of the big reasons for my optimism is those numbers I cited earlier: that more than 90 percent of the American people believe in God and more than half of Americans regularly attend houses of worship. Now why is that important? To me it is important--and we have to come back to it as a people to connect our faith with our feelings about our national future--because faith generally leads to hope. The members of the LDS Church whom I have known show every day in their lives a faith that leads to hope and good values and hard work, producing amazingly great results.<br><br>Faith in God, love of country, sense of unity, and confidence in the power of every individual--these are the things that have carried the American people through crises greater than the ones we face today and will, I am sure, propel us forward to a better place if only we will return to those values and recognize them as asource of national strength. I hope the presence of faith in the public square will let us dothat.<br><br>The greatest source of America's strength and hope for the future is not in the current divisive and rigid politics of Washington. Instead it is in the broadly shared faith and ­values of the American people and in the reasons for unity and inspiration to serve that so many of us find in the varied houses of worship we attend in this country. We need America's faith and values to be brought to Washington. We come to Congress, to the White House, and to the administration generally as people of faith. And it seems to me that when we get there, we don't act as if those principles that I've just talked about guide ourlives.<br><br>I will say to you here in this great center that Brigham Young University for a long, long time now has produced graduates who have understood all of this and spread progress and growth throughout our country and indeed the world. As the old Uncle Sam poster used to say: Your country needs you now--and what you believe in--more than ever. I'm confident that when you go forth from these gates, moved by your faith and enabled by the education you receive here, your work and your service will help make America not only better but help create the more perfect union we have always aspired to be.<br><br>I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this great honor and opportunity to be with you this morning, and I pray with you that God will bless us all and our great country, now and into the future. Thank you very, very much.<br><br><i>Joseph Lieberman was a senator for Connecticut when this forum address was delivered on 25 October 2011.</i><br><br>© Joseph Lieberman. All rights reserved.

<h1> the World: Be an Example - Thomas S. Monson - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a glorious sight you are! It's an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.<br><br>As I gaze at this vast audience, I'm reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do--and don't do--here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.<br><br>We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>1</sup>He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be "as lights in the world."<sup>2</sup><br><br>This is what I would hope for each of us--that we might be a light to the world.<br><br>What is light? Webster's dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun<i>light</i>. I prefer the simple "something that illuminates." Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness--and therefore being a light--can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.<br><br>Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God--that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of</i>[that light,]<i>that Spirit when he said:</i><br><br><i>"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God." (Moroni 7:16.)</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, for many that light with which all were endowed at birth has dimmed--in some cases almost to the point of being extinguished--as outside influences have come to bear and the sometimes harsh realities of life have been experienced. Ours is the responsibility to keep our lights aflame and burning brightly, that they might shine for others to see and follow.<br><br>With the decline of religion in our society, many people have come to feel that they are sufficient unto themselves and have no need of a higher power. Wrong. A loss of religious faith implies a loss of faith in anyone greater than oneself.<br><br>In 2 Nephi we read these words, so pertinent today:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>It can at times be easy to fall into the erroneous thinking that we ourselves are capable of handling anything that comes our way, that we have all the answers, and that there is no need for assistance from a higher power. When we realize, as one person put it, that "we are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience,"<sup>5</sup>we come to understand where our main emphasis should be and on whom we are reliant.<br><br>In order for us to be examples of the believers, we ourselves must believe. I would think that each of us within the sound of my voice has a testimony, although our testimonies are no doubt of varying degrees. It is up to each of us to develop the faith necessary to survive spiritually and to project a light for others to see. Amidst the confusion of our age, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives. Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Among the most effective ways to gain and keep the faith we need would be to read and study the scriptures and to pray frequently and consistently.<br><br>Many years ago I was shown the flyleaf of a triple combination given to the late Maurine Lee Wilkins by her father, President Harold B. Lee. He had inscribed it with these words:<br><br><i>April 9, 1944--To my dear Maurine: That you may have a constant measure by which to judge between truth and the errors of man's philosophies, and thus grow in spirituality as you increase in knowledge, I give you this sacred book to read frequently and cherish throughout your life. Lovingly, your father, Harold B. Lee</i><br><br>Wise words which can apply to each of us.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, have you read the Book of Mormon? Have you put to the test the promise found in Moroni 10:4, asking your Heavenly Father "with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ" whether or not that which is found in that book is truth?<br><br>May I share with you the experience of Brother Clayton M. Christensen as he sought to know for himself. Brother Christensen has served in many positions of leadership in the Church, including as an Area Seventy. He has received far too many academic awards for me to mention here. He is currently the Robert and Jane Cizik Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School. He is also an alumnus of Brigham Young University, and I believe his son Spencer and daughter Catherine are currently students here.<br><br>When Brother Christensen finished his schooling at Brigham Young University, he received a scholarship to go to Oxford University in England as a Rhodes Scholar. When he arrived at Oxford, he realized that it would be somewhat challenging to be an active member of the Church in Oxford. The Rhodes Scholarship Trust that had given him his scholarship had a lot of activities for the recipients of the scholarship, and if he were going to be active in the Church, it would be difficult for him to participate in those activities. He intended to obtain in just two years a degree in applied econometrics--a program which took most students three years to complete. This, of course, added to his lack of extra time. He realized, as he thought through how involved in the Church he could be, that he didn't even know for certain if the Book of Mormon was true. He realized that he had read the Book of Mormon seven times up to that point, and that after each of those seven times he had knelt in prayer and had asked God to tell him if it was true. He had received no answer. As he thought through why he hadn't received an answer, he realized that each time he had read the Book of Mormon it was because of an assignment--either from his parents or a BYU instructor or his mission president or a seminary teacher--and his chief objective had been to finish the book. But now, as he was about to commence his studies at Oxford, he realized that he desperately needed to know if the Book of Mormon was true. He recognized as well that he had sustained himself on a belief in many of the doctrines of the Church and in his parents because he knew they knew it was true, and he trusted his parents. Here he was, however, desperately needing to know for himself if it was true.<br><br>Oxford University is one of the world's oldest universities. The building Brother Christensen lived in was built in 1410 and was beautiful to look at but horrible to live in. The only heat which was provided was from a small heater inserted into a hole which had been dug in the wall. He decided that he would commit every evening from 11 p.m. to 12 midnight to reading the Book of Mormon--this time with the purpose of determining if it was true. He wondered if he dared spend an entire hour each night, because he was in a very demanding academic program and he just didn't know if he could afford allocating such an amount of time to this effort. Nevertheless, he<i>did</i>allocate the time, and he began at 11 p.m. by kneeling in prayer by the chair by his little heater, and he prayed out loud. He told God how desperate he was to find out if this was a true book, and he told Him that if He would reveal to him that it was true, then he intended to dedicate his life to building this kingdom. And he told God that if it wasn't true, he needed to know that for certain, too, because then he would dedicate his life to finding out what<i>was</i>true. Then Brother Christensen would sit in the chair and read. He began by reading the first page of the Book of Mormon, and when he got down to the bottom of the page, he stopped, and he thought about what he had read on that page, and he asked himself, "Could this have been written by a charlatan who was trying to deceive people, or was this really written by a prophet of God?" And he asked himself what did it mean for Clayton Christensen in his life? And then he put the book down and knelt in prayer and verbally asked God again, "Please tell me if this is a true book." Then he would sit in the chair and pick up the book and turn the page and read another page, pause at the bottom, and do the same thing. He did this for an hour every night--night after night--in that cold, damp room at the Queen's College in Oxford.<br><br>By the time Brother Christensen got to the chapters at the end of 2 Nephi, one evening when he said his prayer and sat in his chair and opened the book, all of a sudden there came into that room a beautiful, warm, loving spirit that just surrounded him and permeated his soul and enveloped him in a feeling of love that he had not imagined he could feel. He began to cry, and he didn't want to stop crying because as he looked through his tears at the words in the Book of Mormon, he could see truth in those words that he never imagined he could comprehend before. He could see the glories of eternity and what God had in store for him as one of His sons. That spirit stayed with him for the whole hour, and then every evening as he prayed and sat with the Book of Mormon by the little heater in his room, that same spirit returned, and it changed his heart and his life forever.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson, thirteenth president of the Church, said, "When you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed. ... The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature . . . , and changed men [and women] can change the world."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Brother Christensen has indicated that he loves to return to Oxford. Most of the people there are either students or tourists who have come to look at a beautiful university. But he loves to return there because it's a sacred place to him, and he can look at the windows of that room where he lived, and he recognizes it as the place where he learned that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith was the prophet of the restoration for the true church.<br><br>Brother Christensen has stated that he looks back at the conflict he experienced when he wondered if he could afford to spend an hour every day apart from the study of applied econometrics to find out if the Book of Mormon was true. He said, "I use applied econometrics maybe once a year, but I use my knowledge that the Book of Mormon is the word of God many times every day of my life. In all of the education that I have pursued, that is the single most useful piece of knowledge that I ever gained."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, many of you probably came to Brigham Young University already knowing that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is indeed a prophet, and that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ. Some of you, however, may still be living on the testimony of others--your parents, your friends, your Church leaders. May I suggest that, as Brother Christensen did, you set aside time every day to find out for yourself if the Book of Mormon is a true book, for it will change your heart and change your life. If you seek this knowledge "with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ,"<sup>8</sup>I promise that you will receive an answer. And once you know that the Book of Mormon is true, then it will follow that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. You will have that burning testimony and knowledge that this church is true.<br><br>Such knowledge, such a personal testimony, is essential if we are to safely navigate the sometimes treacherous paths through life with the adversary attempting to deceive us at every turn. As you keep the flame of testimony burning brightly, you will become a beacon of righteousness--even a light--for all to see. Said the Savior: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<sup>9</sup><br><br>I share with you an example of two individuals who let their lights shine and whose good works were recognized and appreciated. Several years ago I received a letter from a lady whom I did not know but who chose me, for whatever reason, to write to concerning the example of two members of the Church who had had an influence for good in her life.<br><br>Her letter began, "Dear President Monson," and then she wrote:<br><br><i>I would like to commend two of your church members for their extraordinary compassion and faith. I am a practicing Catholic and grew up in Salt Lake City. Oftentimes, as a youth, I remember feeling ostracized by the other children who lived on our block because I was not a member of the LDS Church. I must admit that this impression has stuck with me for many years, until my encounter with Rick and Dan McIntosh. Last year my sister's husband, Tom Brown, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and was given one year to live. He passed away last week. Of course neither my sister nor her husband are members of your church. For the past year, Rick, who is the bishop of the ward close to my sister, and Dan have spent countless hours with my sister and her family. They have prayed numerous times for Tom, and their wives have brought food to the house. They shoveled the walks in the winter. And each time they have come they have asked my sister if there was anything she needed or that they could do. And they meant it. It was not important to them that my family was not LDS. Tom was their neighbor and their friend, and they were there to do whatever they could to help. These two men truly live their faith, and I felt deeply moved by their compassion and example. From one who used to indulge in Mormon bashing, I am writing this letter to tell you that through the example of these two men, not only will I never again criticize the LDS faith, but I will not allow it to be criticized in front of me. Your church has my deepest respect.</i><br><br>Our opportunities to shine are limitless. They surround us each day, in whatever circumstance we find ourselves. As we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light, as it were, in the lives of those around us--whether they be our own family members, our coworkers, mere acquaintances, or total strangers.<br><br>It has been my opportunity through the years to associate with countless individuals who I would consider to be outstanding examples, even lights to the world. There is a special spirit we feel around such people which makes us want to associate with them and to follow their example. I would venture to guess that some of you in this audience are members of the Church today or have become active in the Church because of such examples. When we encounter them, they are a powerful influence, for they radiate the love of the Savior and help us to feel His love for us.<br><br>In speaking of those who are unafraid to live lives of righteousness and example, I am reminded of one of the missionaries who served in Eastern Canada when I was the mission president there. He was a special young man by the name of Elder Roland Davidson. He was dedicated and hardworking and obviously loved the gospel of Jesus Christ. And then he became very ill. After weeks of hospitalization, as the surgeon prepared to undertake extremely serious and complicated surgery, the surgeon asked that we send for the missionary's parents. He indicated that there was a great likelihood that Elder Davidson could not survive the surgery. His parents came. The evening before the surgery, his father and I, in that hospital room in Toronto, Canada, placed our hands upon the head of that young missionary and gave him a blessing. What happened the following day provided for me a never-to-be-forgotten example of the influence of a true "believer."<br><br>Elder Davidson was in a six-bed ward in the hospital. The other beds were occupied by five men with a variety of illnesses. On the morning of Elder Davidson's surgery, his bed was empty. I learned later that the nurse came into the room with the breakfast these husky men normally ate. She took a tray over to bed number one and said, "Fried eggs this morning, and I have an extra portion for you." Bed number one was occupied by a man with his toe wrapped up in a bandage. He had suffered an accident with his lawnmower. Other than his injured toe, he was well physically. He said to the nurse, "I'll not be eating this morning."<br><br>"All right," said the nurse. "We'll give your breakfast to your partner in bed number two!"<br><br>As she went over to bed number two, he said, "No, thank you. I think I'll not eat this morning."<br><br>She said, "That's two in a row. I don't understand you men, and there is no one this morning in bed three." She glanced at the bed Roland Davidson had occupied, and then she went on to bed four, bed five, and bed six. The answer was the same from each one: "No, this morning I'm not hungry."<br><br>The young lady put her hands on her hips and said, "Every other morning you eat us out of house and home, and today not one of you wants to eat. What's going on here?"<br><br>And then the man who occupied bed number six came forth with the answer. He said, "You see, bed number three is empty. Our friend, Davidson, is in the operating room under the surgeon's hands. He needs all the help he can get. He is a missionary for his church, and while he has been lying on that bed he has talked to us about the principles of his church--principles of prayer, of faith, and of fasting wherein we call upon the Lord for blessings." He continued, "We have come to admire Davidson as a person of great goodness and compassion and faith. He's an example of what a follower of Christ should be. He has touched our lives--each one of us--and we are fasting for him today."<br><br>The operation performed on Roland Davidson was a success. In fact, when I attempted to pay the surgeon, he refused any money, saying, "It would be dishonest for me to accept a fee. I have never before performed surgery when my hands seemed to be guided by a power which was other than my own. No," he said, "I wouldn't take a fee for the surgery which Someone on high helped me to perform."<br><br>My friends, may we be, as the Apostle Paul admonished, "an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>10</sup>May we always be known as followers of Christ and, as such, become "as lights in the world."<sup>11</sup><br><br>I want you to know that I can feel your collective goodness here today. You are choice sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven. Just think how much good can come to the world from our collective lights as we allow the gospel to radiate through us.<br><br>Over the years I have enjoyed collecting gems of wisdom from movies and musicals. I always have with me a pen and a piece of paper so that I can write down any quotes I might find worthwhile. I have quite a collection. On one occasion some years ago I was watching the animated movie<i>The Lion King</i>with a few of my grandchildren. I took many notes, for I found lessons there. That which I desire to share with you is an exchange which takes place between a grown-up Simba and the spirit of his departed father, Mufasa, as Simba is doubting himself and his destiny. Says Mufasa's spirit, "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become. . . . Remember who you are. . . . Remember."<br><br>To all who are here today, I say, "Look inside yourself. You are more than what you have become. Remember who you are." You are a son or daughter of our Heavenly Father. You have come from His presence to live on this earth for a season and to live in such a way that you are an example of the believers and a true light to the world. When that season has ended, you will be able to return to live with Him once again. May this be your blessing as you nurture your testimony and as you follow the example set for you and for all of us by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, "the true Light, which lighteth every man [and woman] that cometh into the world."<sup>12</sup>Of Him I testify: He is our Savior and our Redeemer, our Advocate with the Father. He is our Exemplar and our strength. He is the light that shineth in darkness. That each of us here today may pledge to follow Him and to be His lights among men and women is my prayer. In His holy name--even Jesus Christ the Lord--amen.<br><br><i>Thomas S.

<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for the blessings which allow you to see and hear me from across the earth. I am most grateful for the gift of the Holy Ghost, a miracle which requires no satellite transmission and allows me to picture you in your many places in my mind's eye. You are consummately precious. We look forward to the day when we can pass the keys of the kingdom on to you.<br><br>Rather than take notes, pay attention to the impressions you receive as we consider a most sacred topic. If all that you know after tonight is what you hear, then you will have missed the meaning of this discussion.<br><br>Some come with questions and are searching for direction. Others are wondering how they got off the gospel path and how they might return. While I speak to all, I speak most earnestly to the one who is seeking.<br><h2><b>Seek and Accept Guidance</b></h2><br>I have watched my senior Brethren move around the circle and then graduate to the other side of the veil--so many great ones. President Harold B. Lee told me that I should associate with the older Brethren and learn from their experiences. I followed that counsel.<br><br>From Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br><br><i>Lives of great men all remind us</i><br><i>We can make our lives sublime,</i><br><i>And, departing, leave behind us</i><br><i>Footprints on the sands of time;</i><br><i>Footprints, that perhaps another,</i><br><i>Sailing o'er life's solemn main,</i><br><i>A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,</i><br><i>Seeing, shall take heart again.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>These "footprints on the sands of time" will always remain visible to help guide you.<br><br>When I was a young member of the Quorum of the Twelve, we walked from our weekly temple meetings back to our offices. I would linger behind and walk with Elder LeGrand Richards. He had been somewhat crippled in an accident in his youth and walked slower than the others.<br><br>The other Brethren would say, "You are so kind to take care of Elder Richards," and Iwould answer, "You don't know why I do it!"<br><br>As we walked, I listened. He could remember President Wilford Woodruff. He was twelve the last time he heard President Woodruff speak. Elder Richards was a link to that generation. I absorbed every word he spoke.<br><br>There is a charge given to the Twelve in the Doctrine and Covenants: "The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world."<sup>2</sup><br><br>I have had an unquenchable desire to bear testimony of the Father and of Jesus Christ. Christ said, "If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."<sup>3</sup>I have yearned to tell what I know about what Christ did and who the Father and the Son are.<br><br>I know words carried by the gift of the HolyGhost can bring to your understanding "the truth of all things."<sup>4</sup>All truth is worth knowing. Some truths are more useful, butthere are truths that are most worth knowing.<br><h2><b>Experience Helps Us Understand Our Heavenly Father's Love for His Children</b></h2><br>I have asked young missionaries, "Do you know what the word<i>father</i>means?" They say, of course, they do know. I respect their answer, but deep down I think, "You know so very little." They do know what the word<i>father</i>means, but their knowledge is immature.<br><br>To you who are married and have a child, the word<i>father</i>takes on a new meaning; the word<i>father</i>comes into clearer focus.<br><br>Perhaps there will come a day when a doctor tells you, "I think you are not going tokeep this one." Finally, you learn about the Father and about yourself.<br><br>We had been married for nine years when we first heard those words from the doctor: "I'm afraid you're not going to keep this one." As parents, we looked at our tiny baby son and did the only thing we could do. He was named and given a father's blessing in the hospital. We prayed, had faith, and said aloud, "Thy will be done."<br><br>Hours passed, and then days. The doctors and nurses continued to work with our son.<br><br>At last we heard the words from the doctor, "I believe you<i>will</i>keep this one."<br><br>As parents, we grew in understanding and strength and drew closer to each other and to the Father.<br><br>Thirteen years later, in a much larger hospital, that experience was repeated with our tenth child. He was given a name and a father's blessing in the hospital. We prayed, had faith, and once again said aloud, "Thy will be done."<br><br>Hours crept slowly by. Once again we were greatly blessed. He would live. The lessons learned years before had been repeated.<br><br>Such experiences will teach you what<i>father</i>and<i>mother</i>mean. Then you know that you would give your life if that little son could live to experience mortality. You then can begin to understand our Heavenly Father. Then you will truly know what the words<i>father</i>and<i>mother</i>mean.<br><br>Many times I have yearned to relieve the suffering of a child or erase the grief or pain from someone that I love, only to realize that I could not do that. But I have learned that the fact that I would do it if I could is of very great consequence in my relationship to the Lord.<br><h2><b>Recognize Our Need for a Mediator</b></h2><br>There is a puzzle in the scriptures about justice and mercy. These are two seemingly conflicting principles which I addressed on another occasion by teaching somewhat of a parable.<sup>5</sup>Listen carefully.<br><br>There once was a man who wanted something very much. It seemed more important than anything else in his life. In order for him to have his desire, he incurred a great debt.<br><br>He had been warned about going into that much debt and particularly about his creditor. But it seemed so important for him to do what he wanted to do and to have what he wanted right now. He was sure he could pay for it later. So he signed a contract with a lender. He would pay it off sometime along the way. He did not worry too much about it, for the due date seemed such a long time off. He had what he wanted now, and that was what seemed important.<br><br>The lender or creditor was always somewhere in the back of his mind, and he made token payments now and again, thinking somehow that the day of reckoning really would never come. But as it always does, the day came, and the contract fell due. The debt had not been paid.<br><br>His creditor appeared and demanded payment in full. Only then did he realize that his creditor not only had the power to repossess all that he owned, but the power to cast him into debtor's prison.<br><br>"I cannot pay you, for I have not the power to do so," he confessed.<br><br>"Then," said the creditor, "we will enforce the contract, take your possessions, and you shall go to prison. You agreed to that. It was your choice. You signed the contract, and now it must be enforced."<br><br>"Can you not show mercy? Can you not extend the time or forgive the debt?" the debtor begged. "Arrange some way for me to keep what I have and not go to prison. Will you not be merciful? Surely you believe in mercy?"<br><br>The creditor replied, "Mercy is always so one-sided. It would serve only you. If I show mercy to you, it will leave me unpaid. It is justice I demand. Do you believe in justice?"<br><br>"I believed in justice when I signed the contract," the debtor said. "It was on my side then, for I thought it would protect me. I did not need mercy then nor think I should ever need it. Justice, I thought, would serve both of us equally well."<br><br>"It is justice that demands that you pay the contract or suffer the penalty," the creditor replied. "That is the law. You have agreed to it, and that is the way it must be."<br><br>There they were: one meting out justice, the other pleading for mercy. Neither could prevail except at the expense of the other.<br><br>"If you do not forgive the debt, there will be no mercy," the debtor pleaded.<br><br>"If I do, there will be no justice," was the reply.<br><br>Both laws, it seemed, could not be served. Mercy cannot rob justice.<sup>6</sup>Each is an eternal ideal that appears to contradict the other. Is there no way for justice to be fully served and mercy also?<br><br>There is a way! The law of justice can be fully satisfied and mercy can be fully extended, but it takes someone else. And so ithappened this time.<br><br>The debtor had a friend. He came to help. He knew the debtor well. He knew him to be shortsighted. He thought him foolish to have gotten himself into such a predicament. Nevertheless, he wanted to help because he loved him. He stepped between them as a mediator and made this offer to the creditor:<br><br>"I will pay the debt if you will free the debtor from his contract so that he may keep his possessions and not go to prison."<br><br>As the creditor was pondering the offer, the mediator added, "You demanded justice. Although he cannot pay you, I will do so. You will have been justly dealt with and can ask no more. That would not be just."<br><br>The mediator then turned to the debtor. "IfI pay your debt, will you accept me as your creditor?"<br><br>"Oh, yes," cried the debtor. "You save me from prison and show mercy to me."<br><br>"Then," said the mediator, "you will pay the debt to me, and I will set the terms. It will not be easy, but it will be possible. I will provide a way. You need not go to prison."<br><br>And so it was that the creditor was paid in full. He had been justly dealt with. No contract had been broken. The debtor, in turn, had been extended mercy. Both laws stood fulfilled. Because there was a mediator, justice had claimed its full share and mercy was fully satisfied.<br><br>Unless there is a mediator, unless we have a friend, the full weight of justice, untempered and unsympathetic, must--positively must--fall on us. The full penalty for every transgression, however minor or however deep, will be exacted from us to the uttermost farthing.<br><br>There is a Mediator, a Redeemer who stands both willing and able to appease the demands of justice and extend mercy to those who are penitent, for "he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered."<sup>7</sup>All will one day stand before Him "to be judged at the last . . . judgment day, according to their works,"<sup>8</sup>"for there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Through Him, mercy can be fully extended to each of us without offending the eternal law of justice. The extension of mercy will not be automatic. It will come through covenant with Him. It will be on His terms--His generous terms.<br><br>To activate His mercy, we must repent. Our transgressions are all added to our account, and one day, if it is not properly settled, unless we have repented, each of us will be found wanting and stand condemned.<br><h2><b>Repentance Erases Guilt and Disappointment</b></h2><br>We all live on spiritual credit. In one way or another, the account builds and builds. If you pay it off as you go, you have little need to worry. Soon you begin to learn discipline and know that there is a day of reckoning ahead. Learn to keep your spiritual account paid off at regular intervals rather than allowing it to collect interest and penalties.<br><br>Because you are being tested, it is expected that you will make some mistakes. I assume that you have done things in your life that you regret, things that you cannot even apologize for, much less correct; therefore, you carry a burden. It is time now to use the word<i>guilt,</i>which can stain like indelible ink and cannot easily be washed away. A stepchild of guilt is disappointment, regret for lost blessings and opportunities.<br><br>If you are struggling with guilt, you are not unlike the people of the Book of Mormon of whom the prophet said, "Because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face."<sup>10</sup><br><br>We often try to solve the problem of guilt by telling one another and telling ourselves that it does not matter. But somehow, deep inside, we do not believe this. Nor do we believe ourselves if we say it. We know better. It does matter!<br><br>Prophets have always taught repentance. Alma said, "Behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Alma bluntly told his wayward son, "Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness."<sup>12</sup><br><br>There are two basic purposes for mortal life. The first is to receive a body which can, if we will, be purified and exalted and live forever. The second purpose is to be tested. In testing, we certainly will make mistakes. But if we will, we can learn from our mistakes. "If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."<sup>13</sup><br><br>You, perhaps, may feel inferior in mind and body and are troubled or burdened with the weight of some spiritual account that is marked "past due." When you come face to face with yourself in those moments of quiet contemplation (which many of us try to avoid), are there some unsettled things that bother you? Do you have something on your conscience? Are you still, to one degree or another, guilty of anything small or large?<br><br>Too frequently we receive letters from those who have made tragic mistakes and are burdened. They beg: "Can I ever be forgiven? Can I ever change?" The answer is yes!<br><br>Paul taught the Corinthians, "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."<sup>14</sup><br><br>The gospel teaches us that relief from torment and guilt can be earned through repentance. Save for those few--those very few--who defect to perdition after having known a fulness, there is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no offense small or large which is exempt from the promise of complete forgiveness. No matter what has happened in your life, the Lord has prepared a way for you to come back if you will heed the promptings of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Some are filled with a compelling urge, a temptation that recycles in the mind, perhaps to become a habit, then an addiction. We are prone to some transgression and sin and also a rationalization that we have no guilt because we were born that way. We become trapped, and hence comes the pain and torment that only the Savior can heal. You have the power to stop and to be redeemed.<br><h2><b>Satan Attacks the Family</b></h2><br>President Marion G. Romney told me once, "Don't just tell them so that they can understand, tell them so that they cannot misunderstand."<br><br>Nephi said: "For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding."<sup>15</sup><br><br>So listen up! I will speak plainly as one called and under obligation to do so.<br><br>You know that there is an adversary. The scriptures define him in these terms: "That old serpent, who is the devil, . . . the father of all lies."<sup>16</sup>He was cast out in the beginning<sup>17</sup>and denied a mortal body. He has now sworn to disrupt "the great plan of happiness"<sup>18</sup>and become an enemy to all righteousness. He focuses his attacks on the family.<br><br>You live in a day when the scourge of pornography is sweeping across the world. It is hard to escape it. Pornography is focused on that part of your nature through which you have the power to beget life.<br><br>To indulge in pornography leads to difficulties, divorce, disease, and troubles of a dozen kinds. There is no part of it that is innocent. To collect it, view it, or carry it around in any form is akin to keeping a rattlesnake in your backpack. It exposes you to the inevitable spiritual equivalent of the serpent's strike with its injection of deadly venom. One can easily understand, with the world being what it is, that you can almost innocently be exposed to it, to read it, or to view it without realizing the terrible consequences. If that describes you, Iwarn you to stop it. Stop it now!<br><br>The Book of Mormon teaches that all "men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil."<sup>19</sup>That includes you. You know what is right and what is wrong. Be very careful not to cross that line.<br><br>Although most mistakes can be confessed privately to the Lord, there are some transgressions that require more than that to bring about forgiveness. If your mistakes have been grievous, see your bishop. Otherwise, ordinary confession, quietly and personally, will do. But remember, that great morning of forgiveness may not come all at once. If at first you stumble, do not give up. Overcoming discouragement is part of the test. Do not give up. And as I have counseled before, once you have confessed and forsaken your sins, do not look back.<br><br>The Lord is always there. He is willing to suffer and pay the penalty if you are willing toaccept Him as your Redeemer.<br><h2><b>The Savior's Suffering Was for Our Sins</b></h2><br>As mortals, we may not, indeed cannot, understand fully<i>how</i>He fulfilled His atoning sacrifice. But for now the<i>how</i>is not as important as the<i>why</i>of His suffering. Why did He do it for you, for me, for all of humanity? He did it for the love of God the Father and all mankind. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."<sup>20</sup><br><br>In Gethsemane, Christ went apart from His Apostles to pray. Whatever transpired is beyond our power to know! But we do know that He completed the Atonement. He was willing to take upon Himself the mistakes, the sins and guilt, the doubts and fears of all the world. He suffered for us so that we would not have to suffer. Many mortals have suffered torment and died a painful, terrible death. But His agony surpassed them all.<br><br>At my age, I have come to know what physical pain is, and it is no fun! Nobody escapes this life without learning a thing or two about suffering. But the personal torment that I cannot bear is when I have come to know that I have caused another to suffer. It is then that I catch a glimpse of the agony the Savior experienced in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>His suffering was different than all others before or since because He took upon Himself all of the penalties that had ever been imposed on the human family. Imagine that! He had no debt to pay. He had committed no wrong. Nevertheless, an accumulation of all of the guilt, the grief and sorrow, the pain and humiliation, all of the mental, emotional, and physical torments known to man--He experienced them all. There has been only One in all the annals of human history who was entirely sinless, qualified to answer for the sins and transgressions of all mankind and survive the pain that accompanied paying for them.<br><br>He presented His life and in essence said, "It is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world."<sup>21</sup>He was crucified; He died. They could not take His life from Him. He consented to die.<br><h2><b>Complete Forgiveness Is Possible</b></h2><br>If you have stumbled or even been lost for a time, if you feel that the adversary now holds you captive, you can move forward with faith and not wander to and fro in the world any longer. There are those who stand ready to guide you back to peace and security. Even the grace of God, as promised in the scriptures, comes "after all we can do."<sup>22</sup>The possibility of this, to me, is the truth most worth knowing.<br><br>I promise that the brilliant morning of forgiveness can come. Then "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding"<sup>23</sup>comes into your life once again, something like a sunrise, and you and He "will remember [your] sin no more."<sup>24</sup>How will you know? You will know!<sup>25</sup><br><br>This is what I have come to teach you who are in trouble. He will step in and solve the problem you cannot solve, but you have to pay the price. It does not come without doing that. He is a very kind ruler in the sense that He will always pay the price necessary, but He wants you to do what you should, even if it is painful.<br><br>I love the Lord, and I love the Father who sent Him. Our burdens of disappointment, sin, and guilt can be laid before Him, and on His generous terms, each item on the account can be marked "paid in full."<br><br>"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." That is, Isaiah continued, "if ye be willing and obedient."<sup>26</sup><br><h2><b>Come unto Him</b></h2><br>The scripture "learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God"<sup>27</sup>is an invitation attended by the promise of peace and protection from the adversary. "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Do not expect that all will go smoothly throughout your life. Even for those who are living as they should, it sometimes will be just the opposite. Meet each of life's challenges with optimism and surety and you will have the peace and faith to sustain you now and in the future.<br><br>For those who do not yet have all of the blessings you feel you want and need to have, I firmly believe that no experience or opportunity essential for redemption and salvation will be denied you who live faithfully. Remain worthy; be hopeful, patient, and prayerful. Things have a way of working out. The gift of the Holy Ghost will guide you and direct your actions.<br><br>If you are one of those struggling with guilt, disappointment, or depression as a result of mistakes you have made or blessings that have not yet come, listen to the reassuring teachings found in the closing hymn, "Come unto Him,"<sup>29</sup>which the choir will sing at the close of this meeting.<br><br>I claim, with my Brethren the Apostles, to be a special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. That witness is reaffirmed each time I feel within myself or in others the cleansing effect of His sacred sacrifice. My witness, and that of my Brethren, is true. We know the Lord. He is no stranger to His prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>In closing, I know you as the youth of the Church, and I understand that you're not perfect, but you are moving along that road. Have the courage. Know that any person who has a body has power over one who has not.<sup>30</sup>Satan is denied a body; so if ever you are confronted with temptations, know that you outrank all those temptations if you will exercise the agency given to Adam and Eve in the garden and passed on to this very generation.<br><br>I invoke a blessing upon you that life will be full and that you can find peace. And if you look forward with hope and desire to do that which the Lord would have you do--that is all that is expected. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>erefore Ye Are No More Strangers and Foreigners&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. As was noted in the introduction, I come from Australia, so that's why I think you talk funny. As was also mentioned, I'm a linguist. Linguistics is the scientific study of language.<br><br>In 1978 Pam and I were living a pretty comfortable life in Brisbane, Australia. We had a nice house close to Pam's parents and three wonderful children, ages five, four, and two. I had a good job. But I also had a dream. I wanted to know more about how language works, especially for people acquiring a second language. At that time one of the best graduate linguistics programs in the world was at the University of Southern California, located just south of downtown Los Angeles. So we left this good life and went off to Los Angeles.<br><br>The second day in LA we bundled the kids into a borrowed car and visited the USC campus to keep an appointment with a linguistics professor. I was excited to be finally going to the temple of my academic dreams. We arrived on campus and acquired a campus map, but there was no Linguistics Department listed on the map. We found a traffic station and asked a security guard where the Linguistics Department was.<br><br>"The what?" he asked.<br><br>"The Linguistics Department," I answered.<br><br>He picked up a phone and asked, "Hey, Joe, do you know where the ling ... ling ..." Turning to me, he asked, "The what?"<br><br>"The Linguistics Department."<br><br>"Do you know where the Linguistics Department is?"<br><br>We eventually found the department in a rickety old building. It wasn't a good start. I'll never forget the bemused smile on Pam's face as we began this adventure. Thank you, Pam.<br><br>Most days I leave my BYU office in the early evening and wander around campus trying to remember where I parked the car that morning. I look at the beautiful mountains, this incredible campus, and the miracle that each of you represents. I can't help but think of G. K. Chesterton's poem titled "Evening":<br><br><i>Here dies another day</i><br><i>During which I have had eyes, ears, hands</i><br><i>And the great world round me;</i><br><i>And with tomorrow begins another.</i><br><i>Why am I allowed two?</i><br><br>This is what I'd like to talk to you about today--some aspects of this great world around us and how we interact with the world using our eyes, ears, and hands. Perhaps I can also provide one answer to why we are allowed so many days beyond the one.<br><br>What is our relationship to the great world around us? We are told to be "in the world but not of the world." We are instructed to "go ... into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15), which of course we take to mean preaching the gospel to all of God's children. In so doing we follow the example of Christ, who also went "into the world" (John 3:17). Based upon how Christ went into the world, let me suggest that going into the world means righteously interacting closely and lovingly with all of God's children. In so doing we fulfill the mission assigned to us, because we are "children of the prophets; and [we] are of the house of Israel; and [we] are of the covenant which the Father made with [our] fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed" (3 Nephi 20:25). This is our responsibility to all the kindreds of the earth. Note that this responsibility extends not just to people who are like us, or to people who want to become like us, but to all the kindreds of the earth.<br><br>Let me now talk about some aspects of this great world around us and all the kindreds of the earth who live here from a linguistics perspective. We are living in times that some describe in terms of two "ages": the information age and the age of proximity. Much has been said about the information age, during which incredible growth in technology has allowed each of us to have access to vast troves of information. A huge portion of the world's current scientific, technological, or cultural information is stored and retrieved in the English language. In many respects, Anglo-American cultural values, carried by the English language, dominate global behavior either in terms of adopting these values or reacting to them. As native or near-native English speakers, we at this university have inherited a linguistically and culturally privileged position among the world's population. In fact, it may be no historical accident that English, so far, is the working language of this dispensation as well as history's first world language.<br><br>The information age has a companion. Never in human history have so many people moved around so much and so often for so many purposes. The global population is on the move, whether it be through international immigration, internal in-country migration, tourism, or short-term travel for business or educational purposes. This is exciting, but with these movements come the challenges of a new age--one that I have labeled the age of proximity, adapting a term used in slightly different contexts.<br><br>Over many millennia, human beings have developed modes of behavior that have grown out of social comfort zones in which we interact with people "just like us." Beginning with interaction in settings such as those found within families, clans, tribes, villages, towns, cities, regions, and nations, we like to spend time with people who share our linguistic and cultural ways. We are most comfortable when we are with "our people." Things go more smoothly. But in this age of proximity we spend more and more time proximate to people from other families, other tribes and villages, and other cities, regions, and nations. These people speak other dialects of our language or totally different languages. They share different cultural norms that seem strange to us. In essence, we interact more and more with--and are closer and closer to--people who speak in strange tongues and who do strange things. We are living in a world of strangers. This is the age of proximity. This situation often threatens to take us out of our same-language and same-cultural comfort zones. The sociocultural and sociolinguistic consequences of this age of proximity are notas apparent here at BYU as they are in LosAngeles, for example, but they are here, and it is likely that you will be dealing with them both here and elsewhere throughout your life.<br><br>We can choose to respond to challenges brought about by the age of proximity in a number of ways. We can withdraw into our sameness--our family, friends, and regional and national identities--setting up barriers that protect us from interacting in meaningful ways with those who are different. Some people of the world have chosen to do this by withdrawing geographically behind walls of national or religious exclusion. Others choose to do it in more subtle ways, relying on technology, so that even though they are physically surrounded by those from different backgrounds they can always be "virtually" at home, encased in their familial comforting iPod music, their electronic Facebook and Twitter friends, and their same-minded political blogs and digital social networks. In many ways, even though they are surrounded by different people, they are always immersed in their virtual tribe. They only have to interact with nontribal members in minimal and superficial ways. It's comforting, and it's natural human behavior--default behavior for the natural man. But, as suggested earlier, it's not what Heavenly Father wants us to do.<br><br>Over the past few months in Sunday School, many of us have followed Paul's apostolic mission as he went fearlessly into strange places, introducing strange people to Christ's teachings while at times coping with those at home in Jerusalem who wanted to keep Christianity "within the tribe." He often pled with those at home to welcome these strangers into their families, their homes, and Christ's Church. In one memorable exchange, he argued that there should be "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19).<br><br>Similar to a standard modern Church mission, Paul had to go elsewhere to interact with strangers and bring them to Christ. But here's what is interesting about our current times. In the age of proximity, the strangers and foreigners are coming to us. They are all around us. Our challenge then is to overcome our natural-man reluctance to interact with those who come from different languages, dialects, and cultural backgrounds and to treat them as no more strangers but actual, or potential, fellow citizens with the Saints in the household of God. This challenge is not easy. Even when we can overcome language barriers, there are a host of other more subtle difficulties.<br><br>Let me give you a brief linguistic lecture that focuses on one of these difficulties. Language consists of sounds that make words that make sentences that make meaning. So far, so good. But things get complicated. Consider the following exchange between two people in a home setting.<br><br><i>Pam: That's the phone.</i><br><br><i>Bill: I'm washing the dog.</i><br><br><i>Pam: Okay.</i><br><br>Those three utterances are grammatically correct, but as a meaningful set of sequenced expressions devoid of context, they don't make sense. But you know what they mean.<br><br>By saying, "That's the phone," Pam's intention is to say, "The phone is ringing. I'm not going to answer it. You answer it."<br><br>By saying, "I'm washing the dog," Bill intends to say, "I am unable to answer the phone. You answer it."<br><br>Pam's "Okay" means, "I'll answer it."<br><br>Often things we say not only have a grammatical sense but also an intentional sense. We say one thing when we mean another thing. This phenomenon is what linguists call pragmatics. You were able to make sense of Pam and Bill's exchange because you have developed "pragmatic competence,"<i></i>or the ability to express and comprehend hidden, intended, or unstated meaning that is embedded in understandings of particular situational or cultural contexts. Your pragmatic competence comes from lifelong experiences dealing with similar cultural and situational contexts.<br><br>Even when people share the same or similar linguistic and cultural backgrounds, pragmatic problems arise. Consider the following (many of the anecdotes I will relate are exemplars of actual published research):<br><br>Let's say an imaginary Jack and Jill are driving home to Provo from Salt Lake City.<br><br>Jill asks Jack, "Are you thirsty?"<br><br>Jack responds, "No."<br><br>Things go silent in the car. They arrive in Provo, at which time Jill turns to Jack and says, "You know, you need to work on being a little less self-centered," and departs rather frigidly.<br><br>Jack stares into the void wondering what just happened.<br><br>So what happened? By asking if Jack was thirsty, Jill was intending to signal that she was thirsty and perhaps they could pull into their favorite fast-food place in Lehi. Jack didn't comprehend Jill's indirect intended meaning. (Adapted from Deborah Tannen,<i>You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation</i>[New York: Quill, 2001], 15.) This is an example of what linguists call "pragmatic failure." As a noted researcher in the field states:<br><br><i>Most of our misunderstandings of other people are not due to any inability to hear them, or to parse their sentences, or to understand their words</i>[.]<i>... A far more important source of difficulty in communication is that we so often fail to understand a speaker's intentions.</i>[George A. Miller, "Psychology, Language, and Levels of Communication," in Albert Silverstein, ed.,<i>Human Communication: Theoretical Explorations</i>(New York: John Wiley, 1974), 15; cited in Jenny Thomas, "Cross-Cultural Pragmatic Failure," in Kingsley Bolton and Braj B. Kachru, eds.,<i>World Englishes: Critical Concepts in Linguistics</i>, 6 vols. (London; New York: Routledge, 2006), 4:22]<br><br>So if examples of pragmatic failure abound when people from shared backgrounds communicate, you can imagine how frequently they occur when people from different cultural or linguistic backgrounds interact--which of course happens frequently in this age of proximity.<br><br>Here's a personal example of pragmatic failure at the cross-cultural level. Prior to attending graduate school at the University of Southern California, I taught English as a second language to immigrants and refugees in Australia in an adult basic education context. During breaks, the teachers would gather in the teachers' lounge and often commiserate about this or that teaching problem, class, or student. I might say I have a problem with teaching a particular class; a colleague would respond by saying something like, "Yeah, there are some real problem students in that class. I had them last semester. What a bunch of losers!" End of conversation.<br><br>We moved to Los Angeles for graduate school, and for a time I taught in a similar context--except in this school's teachers' lounge, when I related that I had a problem, my American colleagues gave me unwanted advice on how to teach. I often listened to this advice stone-faced, suppressing righteous indignation and thinking that they obviously felt that I was an inexperienced teacher in need of assistance. How dare they! As I got to know my colleagues more and as they became my friends, I realized that they interpreted my whining about students as a plea for help, and they selflessly took the time to provide that help. Sometime later, an American teacher started at the school. She had just completed a teacher exchange to an Australian school. I heard that she thoroughly enjoyed her Australian experience, except she felt that she didn't get much help from her Australian colleagues. I imagine that she thought she was asking for help by expressing a concern, but all she got back was commiseration rather than assistance. Even though Australians and Americans share approximately the same language, we do have slightly different cultural expectations that can often lead to pragmatic failure--to be more precise, cross-cultural pragmatic failure. These misunderstandings resulted in my thinking, for a time, that Americans were patronizing "know-it-alls" and resulted in that other teacher's thinking that Australian teachers were unhelpful, especially to foreigners.<br><br>I even went through a period during which I started thinking about "know-it-all, patronizing Americans" in terms of stereotypes reinforced by a process known as "confirmation bias,"<i></i>in which we only recognize and cognitively register features that confirm our preconceived notions, totally disregarding any nonconfirmatory evidence. Sadly, confirmation bias in cross-cultural contexts happens all too frequently. The process can easily become a silent killer of goodwill, charity, and compassion, especially in situations where non-native English speakers are involved. Linguistics researcher Jenny Thomas expressed the problem in this way:<br><br><i>Grammatical errors may be irritating and impede communication, but at least, as a rule, they are apparent ... so that</i>[hearers are]<i>aware that an error has occurred. ... Pragmatic failure, on the other hand, is rarely recognized as such by non-linguists. If a non-native speaker appears to speak fluently ..., a native speaker is likely to attribute his/her apparent impoliteness or unfriendliness, not to any linguistic deficiency, but to boorishness or ill-will.</i>["Cross-Cultural Pragmatic Failure," 29]<br><br>Here's a brief review of some of the many cross-cultural pragmatic failures recorded in research literature. The labels "Culture A" and "Culture B" in one example refer to different cultures in a different example.<br><br>Culture A creates and maintains friendships through expressions of positive worth. Culture B maintains friendships partially through mutual insult. Culture A thinks Culture B is rude and aggressive. Culture B thinks Culture A has superficial friendships constantly in need of maintenance.<br><br>When Culture A folks come to class late, they enter the classroom quietly and crouch over slightly as if they are wearing a Harry Potter cloaking device so as not to disturb the class. Culture B, a high-honor–based culture, requires its late students to apologize openly and sit in a prominent position in the classroom. Culture A thinks Culture B students are rude and disruptive. Culture B thinks Culture A students are cowardly, untrustworthy, and sneaky.<br><br>See if you can predict the interpretive results of pragmatic failure in the following scenarios:<br><ul><br>	<li>Culture A speakers require that most polite conversations end with a series of closure exchanges. Culture B folks simply walk away when the purpose of the conversation is completed.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Culture A speakers expect regular eye contact during face-to-face conversations. Culture B speakers show respect to the conversant by looking down and away.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Culture A speakers are uncomfortable with silence in conversations. Culture B speakers have a long silence-tolerance period.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>When Culture A speakers like someone, theycompliment that person on a possession, such as a watch or an item of clothing. When Culture B speakers receive a compliment for an item of clothing or a watch, for example, they are under an obligation to offer that item to the person issuing the compliment.</li><br></ul><br>Each of the various cross-cultural pragmatic features mentioned in this list is built upon one or more significant foundational cultural values.<br><br>A much-studied cultural value revolves around personal autonomy--as in who has the power to tell someone else what to do, as revealed in Hofstede's Power Distance Index (PDI). (See Geert Hofstede,<i>Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations</i>[Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, 2001]; cited in Malcolm Gladwell,<i>Outliers: The Story of Success</i>[New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2008], 204; see also 209 and note on 293–294). People from cultures with a low power-distance index are reluctant to tell others what to do, and they devise intricate linguistic complexities in order to avoid expressions of raw power. Low power-distance nations are more likely to be English-speaking. English speakers are masters at mitigating or masking power. For example, if you want someone to close the door, you are more likely to use a "wh-imperative" such as "Would you mind closing the door?" rather than the direct polite imperative "Please close the door." Here is another example: Even though you know for sure that the party begins at 7:00, when someone asks you what time the party begins, you are more likely to soften your certainty by saying something like, "Ah, I think it starts at 7:00." And another example: If you have to give someone advice, you are more likely to use softeners and hedges such as "You know, ah, maybe it'd be good if you did this." People from high power-distance cultures do not have such a complex repertoire of power-avoidance linguistic devices; and so, from the perspective of native English speakers, they often come across as being rude, assertive, and disrespectful. On the other hand, our attempts at avoiding power are often interpreted as an indicator of uncertainty, weakness, or insincerity.<br><br>So what has this linguistic lecture got to do with our goal of trying to figure out how strangers and foreigners can become fellow citizens with the Saints in the household of God? As I mentioned some time back, our language (English), our Anglo-American culture, and our pragmatic ways play dominant roles in the globalized world. In essence, it can be argued that the world is coming to us. Our language, our culture, and our pragmatic behaviors can easily be seen as the default--as the normal. We can almost subconsciously develop a sense of ethnic superiority--a stance that says all these other ways of doing things are strange, odd, cute, or interesting, but we really know what the right way is, don't we. And as soon as all these other folks become like us, the better things will be.<br><br>It is likely that this attitude is not going to help all the kindreds of the world be blessed through us. It smacks of ethnic superiority--a trait that President Gordon B. Hinckley warned us about in his first general conference after being called by the Lord as prophet:<br><br><i>There is so great a need for civility and mutual respect among those of differing beliefs and philosophies. We must not be partisans of any doctrine of ethnic superiority. We live in a world of diversity. We can and must be respectful toward those with whose teachings we may not agree.</i>["This Is the Work of the Master,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, 71]<br><br>If we are to fulfill the charge given to us by our prophets in this age of proximity, we need to develop a sophisticated ability to analyze language use and cultural values in a conscious manner so as to solve pragmatic misunderstandings. Doing so can lead to positive outcomes.<br><br>Let me provide two very personal examples. My sister and I joined the Church when I was fourteen years old. We became members because two young elders--one from Utah and the other from Arizona--gained the trust and confidence of my parents, especially of my father. One of these missionaries, Kent Thurgood, is sitting here in the front row. My father never became a member, but he often told me how impressed he was with "those two American boys," especially with their kindness, their humility, and their respect for his cultural values. Because of their ability to gain my father's trust, my father allowed them to teach the family, which, in turn, allowed my sister and me to gain testimonies of the truthfulness of the gospel and be baptized. This would never have happened if these two young men had not developed a love for and an understanding of the strangers and foreigners they were teaching.<br><br>Many years later I had the pleasure of having lunch in Sydney, Australia, with Elder and Sister Hafen. Elder Bruce Hafen was BYU's provost during the time Rex E. Lee was president of BYU. He was later called as a Seventy and for a time served as the area president for the South Pacific region based in Sydney. Elder Hafen had no historical connection to Australia, but during that lunch it was apparent that he and Sister Hafen had become authorities on Australian history, culture, language, and pragmatics. He had accomplished this through hard work, prayer, humility, and compassion. In so doing he had developed a deep love and respect for the people he was called to serve. His accomplishments in Australia during his time of service became legendary.<br><br>These two examples show what happens when we learn to love and respect strangers and foreigners. I began this talk by quoting G.K. Chesterton's poem. Let me repeat it:<br><br><i>Here dies another day</i><br><i>During which I have had eyes, ears, hands</i><br><i>And the great world round me;</i><br><i>And with tomorrow begins another.</i><br><i>Why am I allowed two?</i><br><br>I have argued that one reason we are "allowed two" and many more than two is so we can be instrumental in bringing strangers and foreigners to the household of God by developing an awareness and appreciation of the cultures and the ways of thinking and speaking of these strangers and foreigners, who, in this age of proximity, are part of our great world around us.<br><br>There is another very sacred scripture concerning strangers that stands as a challenge to us all:<br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:34–40]<br><br>My prayer is that the matters we have discussed today can help us be more successful in bringing strangers and foreigners to the Lord's house. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>William G.

<h1>a, They May Forget, Yet Will I Not Forget Thee&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I received the call to give a devotional, I accepted the invitation, got off the phone, and knew immediately what--at least some part of what--I would be speaking about today. Then I second-guessed this first impression and considered a whole variety of intellectually provoking things that I might talk about, and I realized that, whatever interesting ideas I might have, they were not the things the Lord was trying to inspire me to speak about.<br><br>Maggie, who just offered the prayer, left me a note from some students who had taken a Freshmen Academy class from me a couple of years ago saying that they wished me well in the devotional, thanking me for the class that they had taken, and making reference to a particular story that I had shared with them while I was their teacher. So, I apologize to them because I'm going to be sharing that same story today. In reading their note, I was already moved to tears. I said to my husband, "This is not a good sign; I'm crying even before I've started giving the talk."<br><br>What I want to talk to you about today is memory, and more specifically, the idea of us remembering the Lord and the Lord remembering us. I have been thinking a great deal lately about memory and remembering. I suppose this is in part because of the gradual deterioration of my own memory as I get older. I sometimes find myself walking from one end of my house to the other (a very short walk, I might add) and finding that I cannot recall why I came to the new location, although I<i>can</i>recall that I had some very specific purpose in mind when I started out.<br><br>You students, I have no doubt, think about memory every time you have the prospect of an examination looming over you, hoping and praying that you will be able to remember everything you have studied and perhaps even--with very good luck and divine intervention--some things you did not.<br><br>On a more serious note (although I recognize you may not be able to imagine anything more serious than your looming tests), memory has become especially important to me as in recent months I have witnessed the quite rapid and serious loss of the powers of recall in someone I love very much and who, I assumed, would always remember me: my mother. A change that began slowly a few years ago has so accelerated in recent months that during a trip to see my parents just over a month ago, my own mother, upon first seeing me, did not recognize me. For the first two days of my visit, I needed to remind her repeatedly that I am her daughter. She did eventually recall me more regularly, but all the details of my life--that I am married, that I have children, that I live and work in Utah--remained completely unfamiliar to her. It was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life when my mother looked at me and did not know me.<br><br>In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne was the personification of memory. She was the mother of the Nine Muses. The Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature and the arts. They were considered the sources of the knowledge contained in poetry, myth, and history, which for many centuries was celebrated and disseminated orally. The types of work inspired by the Muses were the artistic, the creative. Memory is therefore the grandmother, so to speak, of almost all creative endeavors and a critical component in the relationship between the creator and the created. This was in part because of the profound orality of the ancient world, where even when something was preserved in writing, the average person did not have access to copies of that writing. The memorization of long passages of poetry, drama, and oratory was the presumed activity of educated artists and citizens. All literature, indeed, arguably all language, knowledge, and skills were preserved and transmitted orally. For the created work to have any value, it must be remembered. If it is not remembered, it cannot exist.<br><br>My mother's lack of recognition cut right to the heart of my identity and my security. If<i>she</i>did not know me, who was I?<br><br>There are many scriptures and ordinances in the Latter-day Saint corpus that speak of remembering. The verb<i>remember</i>is used 15 times in the first 14 verses of Helaman, chapter five, and six times in verse six alone. Verse nine of that chapter is just one example:<br><br><i>O</i>remember, remember,<i>my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea,</i>remember<i>that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea,</i>remember<i>that he cometh to redeem the world.</i>[Helaman 5:9; emphasis added]<br><br>The sacrament prayers that we hear repeated every Sunday commit us to "always<i>remember</i>him" (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79). The injunctions to remember the Lord our God, to remember the covenants we have entered into, and to remember and keep God's commandments are frequent and powerful, but what I want to talk about with you today is not the significance of us remembering the Lord, but the consoling reality of His remembering us.<br><br>Now, it may seem obvious that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are aware of us, but, as Isaiah notes, His people sometimes believe otherwise: "Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me" (Isaiah 49:14). Whether as a people or as a person, I believe we all have times in life when we feel forsaken and forgotten. But think of what the Lord says in Isaiah immediately after this citation of Zion's perception:<br><br><i>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</i>[Isaiah 49:15–16]<br><br>He has made us His own in the great atoning sacrifice of the garden and on the cross, and He cannot forget us. You are never forgotten or forsaken; your Father in Heaven and your Savior, Jesus Christ, know and remember you in a very personal and often very direct (and directed) way.<br><br>Allow me to share with you an experience I had when I served many years ago as a full-time missionary in Germany. Just after my junior year of college, I prepared to serve a full-time mission. I waited anxiously, as people will for their mission calls, and I had a very strong feeling that I would be called to Germany. And I was. When I found out what mission Ihad been called to--the Germany Frankfurt Mission--I was immediately concerned to know whether the city of Cologne was in the boundaries of that mission. And, at the time, the city of Cologne was. I had no particular interest in that city. I just had a feeling about it.<br><br>I entered the mission field and served for four months in Dusseldorf, a city quite close to Cologne. Then I received a letter from my mission president stating that I was going to be transferred to the city of Cologne. I thought, "This is it, this is what I've been waiting for, there's something there for me to do." For the next two months, my companion and I worked diligently to find people to teach. Things were going relatively well, but I always had this sense that something critical was missing. We also had some very challenging experiences. So challenging, I think, that I reached a point, as so many missionaries do, when I began to doubt and wonder why I was doing this. It was not only one of the most challenging but also one of the most rewarding and most transforming experiences of my life.<br><br>After I had been with my companion for two months, she was transferred, and I received a new companion, who had been my companion during my two months in the Missionary Training Center. She brought with her the news that a mother and a son who lived in the ward she had just been serving in had a son and brother living in Cologne. He was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the mother had urged the sister missionary to go by and visit this son and his family. It was actually outside of the area where we typically worked. The city was divided into regions, with two sets of elders that served there as well. Although it was rather out of our way, my companion had a direct connection to this family, the Maass family. So we decided we would make an effort to go and visit them.<br><br>Most of the travel that we did on our mission was on bike, but my companion was recovering from a broken leg, so she actually had a car for a few weeks. The car made this rather lengthy, out-of-the-way trip more viable; so several times we drove over to their home to try and make contact with them. And every time we failed. We tried at various times of day, and we never found them at home. One evening as we were preparing to go to bed, I said to my companion, "We've made a genuine effort, but this is taking us out of our area and away from other work that we need to be doing. We haven't been able to reach them, and she can call her son and say hello if she needs to." My companion agreed.<br><br>The mail came quite early, so we got it before leaving to set about our business the next day. Among the mail that we received was a note from a sister missionary who had been serving in Cologne some months before Iarrived there. She outlined in a letter that she had met a woman on a streetcar who was interested in having a copy of the Book of Mormon, that she had completely forgotten about this, and would we please go by and visit this woman.<br><br>I don't know the exact population of the city of Cologne, but those of you who have ever been in an older European city know the massive, tangled, warren of old streets that they tend to be. Cologne is certainly a city of more than a million people. The address of the woman that she wanted us to visit was on a street called Roonstrasse, Roon Street, which is the same street that the family we had been trying to visit lived on. This struck me as quite an extraordinary coincidence, and I thought, "Maybe we should have kept tracting on that street. We would have met this woman who wanted a copy of the Book of Mormon." We went back to the street and went to this woman's apartment, but she had moved to Israel, and so we were unable to give her a copy of the Book of Mormon. But since we were on the street again--and by now were back to using bikes--we decided to make another attempt to meet the Maass family. Again they were not home. We decided we'd try one more time, which we did the following day, and we did not reach them. I said, "Okay, back to the regular business of our work and our lives. We needn't make that attempt again."<br><br>The next day when the mail came, there was a referral card. This was in the mid-1980s when there was still an East and a West Germany. The referral was from missionaries serving in West Berlin. The missionaries had met a gentleman at a street display who had expressed some interest in hearing more about the gospel. They provided his address: his apartment was on Roonstrasse, the same street that we had been to. Cologne is a big, complex city. The chances of three referrals all being on the same street was quite extraordinary.<br><br>It so happened that my companion and I were doing a split with the stake missionaries that night. Since my companion had a connection to the family, she said, "Why don't I follow up on this referral and also make one more attempt to meet the Maass family." She and one of the stake missionaries went to the home of the gentleman to whom we had been referred by the missionaries in Berlin. He was not happy to see them. He was not actually interested in having missionaries visit him, and his wife chased them off in a rather hostile fashion. I think it involved a broom.<br><br>At any rate, my companion did make one more attempt to meet the Maass family, and this time they were home. When she explained that we had come by several times, they said, "Oh, we're so sorry." As far as I knew, our task was simply to come by and say, "Your mom says hi," to which I thought, "For heaven's sake, the woman can call him." Clearly, I'm a little obtuse, and I needed some guidance in this regard, so we were continually sent back to this street until we made contact. My companion made an appointment with this family to come back at another time and have us visit them.<br><br>So, after these many weeks we finally were prepared to go and visit them. Then when the evening came that we had scheduled to visit with them, I didn't want to go. I mean, I really didn't want to go. There was a ward party going on that really sounded fun--lots of food, chocolate probably. I was sort of hesitant, thinking, "Well, they haven't been there, maybe we could just call and delay." Then I thought, "This is ridiculous! Try to remember why you are a missionary."<br><br>We got on the bikes, drove quite some distance to get across town, and went to meet this family. The moment we walked in the door and the husband greeted me, I had an overwhelming sensation such as I'd never experienced before and have not experienced with anyone since--no offense to my husband. It was the feeling that I was encountering someone I already knew very well and was intimately associated with. We shook hands and sat and visited with them for about half an hour. Through the entire visit and immediately after the visit, I felt like I had found that critical missing piece: this family, and particularly the husband, was the reason I had come on my mission and to this city.<br><br>The day after we finally made contact with this family, my companion, who had been the connection to this family, was transferred out of the city, and I got a new companion who had been out in the mission field only a few weeks and who didn't speak much German yet. My new companion and I then began, though irregularly, a wonderful experience teaching them. We had a certain plan that we followed when we were meeting with people and talking to them about the gospel, and things never went according to plan with this family. But in many ways they went far better than we could have imagined. We invited them to church on a number of occasions, but they hadn't come yet. At the end of every appointment, we hoped that at some time Klaus Maass would offer the prayer, but he always called on someone else to pray--my companion or myself or his wife or his son, but he never prayed himself. They finally agreed to come to church, and we gave them close directions. We offered to come and pick them up. They said they would meet us there. They never showed up, which is, as anyone who has served a full-time mission will know, a devastating disappointment. We tried to reach them after the church meeting ended and were unable to do so for the next couple of days.<br><br>We were in the habit of always having a standing appointment with them on Tuesday evenings. Tuesday came around, and as it happened, at the advice of our mission president, we switched our preparation day activities so that rather than stay home in the morning and do laundry and write letters, we did missionary work most of the day and laundry and letters in the evening in preparation for leaving the next morning for a conference of all the sister missionaries at the mission home in Frankfurt. So we happened to be home just slightly after dinnertime in the evening, which was rarely the case, and the phone rang. It was Klaus Maass, and he wondered why we had not come to their house. I explained our unusual schedule that week and that we had tried to reach them. He said, "Oh, we thought you were mad at us for not coming to church." I replied that we were very sad not to see them there, but we weren't angry. He explained that there had been a death in his wife's extended family, and they had been out of town.<br><br>We spoke briefly about that, and then there was a pause in the conversation and he said to me (my maiden name is Mahoney), "Sister Mahoney, I know you. Do you know what I mean?" I said, "Yes, I do." He said, "After you left the first time you visited, I turned to my wife and said, 'I know her; how can I know her? She reports that she's never been to Germany before. She's certainly never been here before. I don't actually recognize her, but I have the overwhelming feeling that I know her.'" I assured him, saying, "I do understand. I know you too."<br><br>We spoke briefly about the premortal existence and my conviction that he and I very well may have known each other there and made some kind of covenant, commitment, or agreement together that one of us would share the gospel with the other some day. Then he said, "I'm afraid to read the Book of Mormon."<br><br>I asked him why. He answered, "Because every time I take it into my hand, it burns like a fire." Then he added, "Can we have a prayer?"<br><br>I said, "Yes," expecting that he would ask me tooffer it.<br><br>But he said, "I would like to pray. This is the first time I've prayed." And he offered a prayer on the phone asking for the courage to do what was right, whatever that may be.<br><br>The next morning my companion and I left for the sister missionary conference. There were workshops to choose from, but every sister missionary was asked to attend in either the first or the second hour of these lessons a presentation that was being given by the wife of Elder Derrick Cuthbert, who was in the area presidency at the time. Sister Cuthbert was giving a presentation on teaching by the Spirit. My companion and I attended Sister Cuthbert's presentation during the second hour.<br><br>Sister Cuthbert began her talk, introduced her subject, and then stopped. She said, "I would not be a very good advocate of teaching by the Spirit if I did not now heed the promptings of that Spirit and do what it's telling me to do. Instead of what I've prepared, I would like to tell the story of my family's conversion to the gospel."<br><br>She then shared with us the story of her family's conversion in England. Specifically, she told about one particular missionary and their experience with him and his teaching them. I can no longer remember any of the details of what Sister Cuthbert said, but one of the things she did say was, "This will not be true for all of you, but for some of you it is the case that you were called to this mission at this time to teach some particular person or family that you had a covenant with, and you must find the person you were called to teach." I felt as if she were speaking directly to me. Then she added, "Elder Cuthbert had a hard time accepting the Book of Mormon." And looking directly at me she said, "I did not even need to read it to know that it was true, because every time that I took it into my hand, it burned like a fire."<br><br>Sister Cuthbert cannot have known that what she said was a direct translation of what Klaus had said on the phone the previous evening. She concluded her presentation, and I approached her to thank her. She knew that for whatever other reason she may have been giving the presentation, it was in part for me. We said nothing; we just gripped each other's hands and cried.<br><br>The next day my companion and I returned to Cologne. We met several more times with the Maass family and invited them to be baptized. They agreed. At their baptism Klaus spoke, and one of the things he shared was his fear of reading the Book of Mormon and making a commitment. He said that he prayed about this fear, and the answer that he received was a powerful reminder of the Savior's atoning sacrifice and the recognition that if Christ could, in spite of all, give that for us, then surely he could overcome his fears to follow Him.<br><br>The experience I had as a missionary taught me many things. It confirmed in my mind the rightness of the work we were doing, the truthfulness of the gospel. But beyond that, what I knew the moment Sister Cuthbert looked at me and quoted Klaus and what I have known absolutely since is that Heavenly Father knows me personally and will never forget me. He knows you, too.<br><br>The creator actively remembers His creation. Closely linked to His remembrance of us is the loving attention associated with it. He not only remembers you; He cares deeply about where you are, what you are doing, who you are becoming, and what you are feeling. He is interested and involved in your life. As Isaiah reminds us, in a comparison as moving and dramatic as that of the mother who may forget her child while the Lord can never forget His own, the Lord says:<br><br><i>For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</i>[Isaiah 54:10]<br><br>Extending this mercy and doing all He can to assure our safe return to the Father who knows us and whom we will know when we see Him again is His most important work. I testify to you that<i>you</i>are His most important work. That He knows you by name individually and that He will never forget you, I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecilia M.

<h1>ue Opportunities of Living at This Time in This Dispensation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I can remember only one occasion in all the opportunities I've had to speak in which they actually raised the podium before I spoke. I'm reminded of the first talk Iever gave as a member of a stake presidency eleven and a half years ago. I stood up to the podium and then asked the other counselor and the president to stand next to me. They were both over six feet tall, and I'm not quite six feet tall--I'm five foot something. The whole congregation burst out laughing, which is the reaction I expected, because then I quoted one of my favorite scriptures: "And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things" (1 Nephi 16:29). That's actually an underlying theme for my remarks, because I speak today of the unique opportunities that come with living at this time in this dispensation. When I walk the sidewalks of this campus I am often impressed with the innate goodness that radiates from you. There is divine purpose in people of your caliber being on the earth during times like these.<br><br>I begin by bearing my testimony that the man who stood at this pulpit two weeks ago, even President Thomas S. Monson, is God's prophet for this time. My hope is to expound upon his words by following the dictates of that same Spirit that directed him.<br><br>When I joined the Church at the end of my junior year in high school, I set three goals for myself:<br><br>1. Marry the woman of my dreams in the holy temple and create an eternal family.<br><br>2. Go to BYU to become a teacher.<br><br>3. Serve a full-time mission.<br><br>Here's how I have fared so far.<br><br>Over thirty-five years ago I asked a wonderful woman to take a chance on me. I had to ask her twice, and fortunately she said yes the second time. Kim is accompanying me today, along with some of our children, their spouses, and some of our grandchildren.<br><br>I have been privileged to obtain not one but two degrees at this institution and to spend thirty-two years of my professional life dedicated to the education of children. Part of those thirty-two years have been spent here--an opportunity that I could scarcely have imagined at the time I set my original goals. I love this institution.<br><br>Concerning my third goal, two years after joining the Church I was called to serve a mission in Australia--the context for which I will use to set the stage for the remainder of my remarks.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said recently:<br><br><i>I repeat what prophets have long taught--that every worthy, able young man should prepare to serve a mission. Missionary service is a priesthood duty--an obligation the Lord expects of us who have been given so very much.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/10/as-we-meet-together-again?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As We Meet Together Again</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2010, 5–6]<br><br>This doctrine has been taught since at least 1974. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>The question is frequently asked: Should every young man fill a mission? And the answer has been given by the Lord. It is "Yes." Every young man should fill a mission. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Every man should also pay his tithing. Every man should observe the Sabbath. Every man should attend his meetings. Every man should marry in the temple.</i>["When the World Will Be Converted,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1974, 8]<br><br>I remember hearing those words for the first time as a freshman here at BYU. I had been told previously that not every young man was allowed to serve a mission, even if he wanted to, so when I heard President Kimball's prophetic words, I felt assured that I would be able to accomplish my goal. Yes, I get to serve a mission!<br><br>I have often pondered that period of my life in the context of the larger picture provided by the history of this dispensation. When the early members of the Church faced extreme difficulties traversing this continent, they were responding to the counsel of a living prophet. Although they recognized the reasons why they were doing so, I doubt very many of them thought about the legacy they were leaving behind for future generations as they pulled a handcart over a troublesome rock, faced early winters, or coaxed tired oxen to continue forward. I also doubt that they could have predicted that they would be known and honored by future generations of this dispensation in the manner we remember and honor them now.<br><br>I have wondered what my generation will be known for in this final gospel dispensation. Perhaps we might be known, among other things, as the generation that responded to the call of a prophet that every young man should serve a mission--a response requiring great sacrifice on the part of both young men and young women and their families. History records that as a result of this sacrifice there was an almost immediate doubling of the full-time missionary force.<br><br>Now I ask you, what might your generation be known for?<br><br>Because "it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), as righteousness grows in the earth so does wickedness. It is as President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The devil is just as much opposed to Jesus now as he was when the revolt took place in heaven. And as the devil increases his numbers by getting the people to be wicked, so Jesus Christ increases his numbers and strength by getting the people to be humble and righteous.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:38]<br><br>I suggest the amount of wickedness<i>and</i>the degree of wickedness are both increasing in our time. This means that staying on the Lord's side is becoming increasingly difficult, and nowhere is this difficulty more apparent than in the adversary's attacks on the family.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>Many of the social restraints which in the past have helped to reinforce and to shore up the family are dissolving and disappearing. The time will come when only those who believe deeply and actively in the family will be able to preserve their families in the midst of the gathering evil around us.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Families Can Be Eternal</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, 4]<br><br>Two years later President Kimball described why this commitment to the kingdom in general and to the family specifically is of greater importance than merely preserving our own families. He said:<br><br><i>We must not falter nor weary in well-doing. We must lengthen our stride. Not only is our own eternal welfare at stake, but also the eternal welfare of many of our brothers and sisters who are not now members of this, the true Church.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1982/10/the-lord-expects-righteousness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lord Expects Righteousness</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, 6]<br><br>Our Father has consistently demonstrated an ability to produce good results from difficult circumstances. When the people of Ammon saw their unconverted brethren preparing for war, this was their reaction:<br><br><i>Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And all the people . . . assembled together, ... took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now when the people saw that</i>[the Lamanites]<i>were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began toslay them with the sword.</i><br><br><i>And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them.</i>[Alma 24:6, 17, 21–22]<br><br>Now let's pause for a minute. Would you pay good money to see a movie in which the good guys get mowed down and slaughtered? This event is not exactly what I would call a happy Hollywood ending. Now listen for the hand of the Lord in the commentary relative tothis event:<br><br><i>Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and</i><sup></sup><i>praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword--</i><br><br><i>Now when the Lamanites saw this they did</i><sup></sup><i>forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved.</i>[Alma 24:23–26]<br><br>Pondering that event enables me to believe more fully in a prophecy of Nephi. He described a natural consequence of increasingly difficult times that similarly testifies of the hand of the Lord:<br><br><i>For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish.</i>[2 Nephi 28:19]<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell called this shaking of the devil's kingdom "redemptive turbulence." Hesaid:<br><br><i>It is a very intriguing verse. . . . It will be such that a few people now caught up in</i>[the]<i>kingdom of the devil will be "stirred up" and find their way out and into the kingdom of God. . . . There will be in this redemptive turbulence some jarring inconsistencies brought to the fore--jarring enough that they will cause some people who are caught up in the</i>[kingdoms of the world]<i>to leave and find the truth.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_sharing-insights-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing Insights from My Life</a>," BYU devotional address, 12 January 1999]<br><br>In other words, some people will tire of the natural consequences of living a worldly lifestyle--indeed, of living "without God in the world"--and seek for a better way of life. They will then ask, as we sing in Emma Lou Thayne's touching hymn "Where Can I Turn for Peace?":<br><br><i>Where can I turn for peace?</i><br><i>Where is my solace</i><br><i>When other sources cease to make me whole?</i><br><i>When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,</i><br><i>I draw myself apart,</i><br><i>Searching my soul?</i><br><br><i>Where, when my aching grows,</i><br><i>Where, when I languish,</i><br><i>Where, in my need to know, where can I run?</i><br><i>Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?</i><br><i>Who, who can understand?</i><br><br>You and I know the answer to those questions: "He, only One" (<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 129).<br><br>What is our role as redemptive turbulence literally shakes people out of the kingdoms of the world? We must stand with our arms open, ready to catch them, accepting the Lord's invitation to "come ye after me, and Iwill make you to become fishers [or catchers] of men" (Mark 1:17; see also Luke 5:10). We must be ready to answer as Jesus answered when those shaken by redemptive turbulence wish to know if there is a better way to live--"Come and see" (John 1:39).<br><br>In probably the most often-quoted scriptural verses relating to example and light shining, I invite you to listen for four different candle-bearing conditions:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</i><br><br><i>Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;</i><br><br><i>Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</i>[3 Nephi 12:14–16]<br><br>Our Lord explicitly, or implicitly, alludes to four different candle-bearing conditions in these verses. First, there are candles that are never lit. Second, there are lit candles that are lit but are deliberately hidden away under a bushel. You and I know what happens to lit candles placed under containers. Third, there are lit candles that are not hidden, but they aren't really placed in a position in which their light is very visible either. Fourth--and this is the condition the Lord desires--there are candles placed in locations, like hills, that optimize their enlightening capabilities.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie encouraged us to "stand as lights and guides to the people" around us ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1980/04/the-coming-tests-and-trials-and-glory?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Coming Tests and Trials and Glory</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, 72). And may we remember that "we must be different in order to make a difference" in a darkening world (Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Deposition of a Disciple</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976], 55).<br><br>Thus, as insignificant as we feel our lights can be, they become brighter simply by contrast as the darkening occurs. Nowhere is that contrast more apparent than in our unwavering commitment to the family<i>.</i><br><br>If you will set your light on a hill, President Spencer W. Kimball has promised, "I feel the Lord has placed, in a very natural way within our circles of friends and acquaintances, many persons who are ready to enter into his Church" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/02/are-we-doing-all-we-can?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Presidency Message: Are We Doing All We Can?</a>"<i>Ensign</i>, February 1983,4).<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said two weeks ago:<br><br><i>Our opportunities to shine are limitless. They surround us each day, in whatever circumstances we find ourselves. As we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light, as it were, in the lives of those around us--whether they be our own family members, our coworkers, mere acquaintances or total strangers.</i>["Be a Light to the World<i>,"</i>BYU devotional address, 1November 2011]<br><br>Recently, a good friend in the McKay School of Education told me of his conversion. It began when he was an undergraduate in Rhode Island. When he asked a non-LDS faculty mentor where he might consider applying to graduate school, the mentor suggested, with no apparent explanation, that he attend a university somewhere in Utah. He applied to and was accepted at Utah State in Logan. Over time he noticed that he naturally gravitated toward certain USU faculty and later observed that every one of those faculty were Latter-day Saints. Their influence is why he is now a member, sealed in an eternal family unit.<br><br>In Sioux City, Iowa, I worked as a janitor before my mission. One evening a coworker who was more than twice my age approached me and said, "You are different." My kids would say that's no revelation, but I don't think that's what he meant. He said, "When Iam around you I feel something." My young friends, when I am around you, I feel something too.<br><br>President James E. Faust described a similar experience:<br><br><i>I recently recalled a historic meeting in Jerusalem about 17 years ago. It was regarding the lease for the land on which the Brigham Young University's Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies was later built. Before this lease could be signed, President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then president of Brigham Young University, agreed with the Israeli government on behalf of the Church and the university not to proselyte in Israel. You might wonder why we agreed not to proselyte. We were required to do so in order to get the building permit to build that magnificent building which stands in the historic city of Jerusalem. To our knowledge the Church and BYU have scrupulously and honorably kept that nonproselyting commitment. After the lease had been signed, one of our friends insightfully remarked, "Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?" He was referring to our students who were studying in Israel.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/the-light-in-their-eyes?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Light in Their Eyes</a>,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 2005, 20]<br><br>Being ready to catch those shaken out of the world by redemptive turbulence means being ready to do the catching in some unusual places.<br><br>A few years ago we would regularly receive on our home phone a number of sales or solicitation calls. I remember answering three of those calls in one day. At the conclusion of the third call I placed the phone on the receiver rather energetically and remarked to my wife that if salespeople were going to interrupt me on a regular basis, I was going to teach them the gospel.<br><br>A few days later I answered a sales call and thought, "Okay, here we go." After politely declining the sales offer, I said, "I would like to ask you a question. Do you believe in Jesus Christ?"<br><br>The saleswoman replied, "Why, yes, I do."<br><br>I then asked, "Have you ever heard of the visit of Jesus Christ to America after His death and resurrection in Jerusalem?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Well, 600 years before His birth, God directed a small group of people to leave Jerusalem and travel to the Western Hemisphere. These people were taught by prophets whose words were written on gold plates. Their words have been translated in our time in what we now know as the Book of Mormon, and this record describes the visit of Christ to them."<br><br>She said, "That is the most wonderful thing I have ever heard."<br><br>A few days later I got another call. I'm on a roll!<br><br>After the initial sales pitch, I replied, "I don't really want what you are trying to sell me, but I would like to ask you a question. Do you believe in Jesus Christ?"<br><br>The salesman replied, "No, I'm a Muslim, and besides, I am not supposed to talk about personal things, so I better hang up."<br><br>I said, "Before you do, let me say one thing. Do you have a family?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Do you care about them?"<br><br>"Yes, of course."<br><br>"Before you hang up, I want you to know that I may be the only person you will ever talk to who can tell you how you can have your family after you die."<br><br>He replied, "What's that?"<br><br>I said, "I thought you said you had to hang up."<br><br>"Oh, no, I want to hear about this."<br><br>Sometimes you get a little surprise in these kinds of situations. A saleslady gave me her spiel, and then I asked her if she believed in Christ and knew of His visit to America. She replied, "Yes, I read the Book of Mormon every day with my family. I'm an LDS mom in Las Vegas."<br><br>Sometimes you can wonder if your offers to be a catcher are ever hitting home. Upon graduation Kim and I packed up our belongings and our new little baby--who is now thirty-two years old--and headed for St. George, Utah, where I began my teaching career. We lived next door to Trish and her husband, Al. Trish wasn't a member of the Church, and Al was a member but didn't attend very often. We tried to do all the things a good neighbor does--plates of cookies, Christmas greetings, all that sort of thing--but we never received much reciprocation.<br><br>One day, out of the blue, I suggested to Kim that we purchase a gift subscription to the<i>Ensign</i>for Trish and Al. She is used to crazy suggestions from me, so she agreed.<br><br>A few months later, while riding my bike home from work, I noticed Trish was standing outside our home looking right at me with a sort of intense look.<br><br>I thought, "This is unusual."<br><br>I stopped to greet her, and she asked, "Are you the one who sent us the<i>Ensign</i>?"<br><br>I thought, "Uh oh, I'm in trouble now," and I meekly replied, "Uh . . . yeah." How's that for being bold?<br><br>She said, "I want to thank you for sending it to us, and I have one question for you. Would you mind coming to my home and teaching me about your church?"<br><br>I baptized Trish three weeks later.<br><br>Sometimes you start catching and then think folks don't want you to catch them anymore. I was ordained a Seventy in St. George when dirt was new and Enoch was the president of the Church. In those days the office of a Seventy was a local office in the priesthood. Another Seventy and I were stake missionaries, and we helped our neighbor Matt and his wife come into the Church and to full Church activity. Then we were allowed to go to another stake and teach Matt's parents, Ward and Louise. It was clear that Louise was quite interested, and it was also abundantly clear that Ward only listened--if you could call it listening--to be courteous to Louise. After several months, despite Louise's progress, we had to stop teaching them.<br><br>A couple of years later, a colleague who was the ward mission leader in the ward Louise and Ward lived in came to my room and told me Louise wanted me to call her. Because I began my teaching career when dinosaurs roamed the earth, I didn't have a cell phone available to use, because they weren't invented yet. I had to wait until recess to call her on the office telephone. When I reached her, we exchanged greetings, and then she said, "I have decided to be baptized. I woke up this morning with this feeling that I wanted to be baptized."<br><br>I was elated. Then I asked, "Louise, how does Ward feel about this?"<br><br>She said, "I don't know. He hasn't said much."<br><br>I called her back that evening to follow up on the arrangements for her baptism, and, to my surprise, she told me Ward had decided to be baptized too. They were baptized a few days later and then were sealed in the holy temple a year after that. A few months later I received word that Louise had passed away.<br><br>Here's another story.<br><br>I recently heard Brother Russell T. Osguthorpe, the general Sunday School president and a member of the McKay School of Education faculty, talk about his brother-in-law, Steve. In his teenage years Steve decided to pursue a different lifestyle than that of the rest of his active LDS family. He later married a person who wasn't a Latter-day Saint and remained apart from the Church for fifty years.<br><br>About halfway through this fifty-year period Steve received a phone call from his newly assigned home teacher. He refused the invitation to accept home teaching visits but agreed to allow his home teacher to mail him a monthly postcard. This faithful home teacher mailed a postcard to Steve every month for twenty-two years. When Steve experienced redemptive turbulence in the death of his wife, who do you suppose Steve turned to for comfort and support? His faithful home teacher who had not tired of holding his arms out ready to catch for twenty-two years. (See "What If Love Were Our Only Motive?" BYU devotional address, 8 March 2011.)<br><br>Sometimes you are just doing your thing, and the next thing you know you are in the catching business. Three years ago I was in San Diego attending a mathematics education conference. I rode a shuttle to the San Diego airport and noticed the driver might be a person who spoke Spanish. I deliberately sat in the front seat and used my limited Spanish vocabulary to say, "Cómo está?"<br><br>He replied, "Bien, gracias. Y usted?"<br><br>I said, "Bien."<br><br>He asked in Spanish, "Dónde aprendió a hablar espaol?"<br><br>I replied, "In inglés, por favor?"<br><br>"Where did you learn to speak Spanish?" hesaid.<br><br>I responded, "I am a Latter-day Saint, or Mormon, and I am in charge of ten of our congregations in Utah. One of them includes people who speak Spanish, so I have tried to learn a little. And besides, we have many Spanish-speaking people moving into our area, so I have learned a little Spanish so I can help them feel welcome."<br><br>He replied positively, and then I asked a question I had never asked before: "Do you know where your ancestors came from?"<br><br>"Over the Bering Sea, I guess."<br><br>I said, "Well, that's partially true, but the truth is, most of your ancestors came from Jerusalem."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Yes, really."<br><br>Then I told him the story of Lehi and the Book of Mormon and said, "Your ancestors prayed to God that their book would be preserved so that their children--and that would be you--could have it and use it to be as close to God as they were. Prophets of God wrote that book, and they are your ancestors. You are a descendant of prophets."<br><br>He said, "I did not know I was a descendant of prophets. How can I get hold of this book?"<br><br>You can guess the rest of the story.<br><br>In my next story I want you to notice howobviously the Lord was involved--and Itestify that He is that involved in every catching story.<br><br>About a month ago my wife went to Iowa to visit our son and his family and our daughter-in-law. While she was gone, I did what every red-blooded American temporary bachelor does--I stopped on the way home from work to get some dinner to avoid starvation. I stopped at the Bajio in Riverwoods down in Provo and was waited on by a young man who was obviously of Latin-American descent. I greeted him in Spanish. He complimented me on my accent and asked me where I had learned Spanish.<br><br>I thought, "Here we go again," and I told him about my Church calling.<br><br>Before I could continue, he said, "I'm a Mormon, but I am inactive. But today I went to Temple Square."<br><br>I must have looked interested--because I was--so he continued: "The other night I had a strange dream in which I heard some words I did not really fully comprehend. I came to work the next day and told my coworker, who is LDS, about it, and he said the words I heard in my dream were the words you hear when you view the<i>Christus</i>statue in the Temple Square Visitors' Center. He told me to go up there, so I did, and sure enough I heard those words. I think the Lord was trying to tell me something. I am going to get active. I know who my bishop is, and I am going to ask him to help me repent of the bad decisions I have made."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I am a member of the Church today and a possessor of an eternal family because of a person who held his arms out to catch me--my brother.<br><br>In conclusion, I would ask, What might your generation be known for at this time in this dispensation? Perhaps your generation will be known as the generation that stood up in the face of great opposition to preserve their own families and, by so doing, shined such a light to the world that it became "a standard for the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 115:5).<br><br>My young friends, as I say to my children, the world is your oyster. There is so much riding on whether or not you will stand steadfast, firm, and immovable in the face of redemptive turbulence (see 1 Nephi 2:10; 3 Nephi 6:14). Don't just focus on simply meeting the challenges of a darkening world in your own life. Seize the opportunities these conditions provide you. God sent you to earth at this time for a very real reason. You are the generation with the capacity to stand up and be counted in ways that will change the course of history. The light you shine in so doing, even the light of Jesus Christ, will literally be the means the Lord will use to save many in this generation and in generations to come. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Damon L.

<h1> Men and Women of Integrity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is good to be with you today. This is my alma mater--the place where I found my beloved wife and a place that has a treasure trove of happy memories for me. First, I would like to pay tribute to President and Sister Samuelson, who have served with such distinction and devotion. They command my highest respect.<br><br>Today I would like to speak about becoming men and women of integrity. It is this attribute that often defines the greatness of a man or a woman. People such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, William Wilberforce, and John and Abigail Adams are revered as icons of integrity. These icons are like spiritual magnets. Every time we read about their lives we are drawn to their higher way.<br><br>What then is this integrity that is such a dominating force in determining greatness? Integrity is a purity of mind and heart that knows no deception, no excuses, no rationalization, nor any coloring of the facts. It is an absolute honesty with one's self, with God, and with our fellowman. Even if God blinked or looked the other way for a moment, it would be choosing the right--not merely because God desires it but because our character demands it.<br><br>Integrity is the very core of our being. It is who we really are. When all the scaffolding is removed, it is our integrity that both defines us and identifies us. Men of integrity are like the Rock of Gibraltar--steadfast and immovable. Men without it are like the shifting sands on the Sahara Desert--tossed to and fro by every variant wind of life.<br><br>Many years ago Elder Sterling W. Sill was driving down a road. He became thirsty, so he pulled into a gas station. He put a dime in the soda pop machine and pulled out a bottle, but his dime was returned. He took the dime, looked at it, put it in his pocket, and said, "They charge too much for this stuff anyway."<br><br>He didn't get very far before the still small voice said, "Sterling, are you really going to be a thief for a dime?"<br><br>"Of course not," he said. "The price is not nearly enough."<br><br>He then returned the dime to the gas station attendant.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hartman-jr-rector_get-glow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br>This story only speaks of small sums, but it teaches of great principles. Each of us might appropriately ask: Does our integrity, our honor, have a purchase price--a dime, a thousand dollars, the approval of our peers, some physical pleasure, or temporary recognition? Is there some point at which our integrity can be purchased? Or is it priceless--not for sale atanyprice?<br><br>On one occasion I read Robert Bolt's classic play<i>A Man for All Seasons.</i>It is the story of Sir Thomas More. He had distinguished himself as a scholar, a lawyer, an ambassador, and, finally, as Lord Chancellor of England. He was a man of absolute integrity. The play opens with these words of Sir Richard Rich: "Every man has his price! ... In money too. ... Or pleasure. Titles, women, bricks-and-mortar, there's always something."<sup>2</sup>That is the theme of the play. It is also the theme of life. Is there a man or woman in this world who cannot be bought, whose integrity is beyond price?<br><br>As the play unfolds, King Henry VIII desires to divorce Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. But there is a catch: divorce is forbidden by the Catholic Church. And so King Henry VIII, not to be thwarted in his desires, demands of his subjects the taking of an oath that will support him in his divorce. But there is a further problem. Sir Thomas More, who is loved and admired by the common people, is a holdout--his conscience will not let him sign the oath. He is unwilling to submit, even at the king's personal request. Then come the tests. His friends apply their personal charm and pressure, but he will not yield. He is stripped of his wealth, his position, and his family, but he will not sign. Finally, he is falsely tried for his life, but still he will not succumb. They have taken from him his money, his political power, his friends, and his family--and will yet take his life--but they cannot take from him his integrity. It is not for sale at any price.<br><br>At the climax of the play, Sir Thomas More is being falsely tried for treason. Sir Richard Rich commits the perjury necessary to convict him. As Sir Richard Rich exits the courtroom, Sir Thomas More asks Rich, "That's a chain of office you are wearing. ... What [is it]?"<br><br>Prosecutor Thomas Cromwell replies, "Sir Richard [Rich] is appointed Attorney-General for Wales."<br><br>More then looks into Rich's face with great disdain and retorts, "For Wales? Why, Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world. ... But for Wales!"<sup>3</sup><br><br>In the life to come, no doubt many will look back amidst uncontrollable sobs and repeat again and again, "Why did I trade my soul for Wales or temporary physical pleasure or fame or a grade or the approval of my friends? Why did I sell my integrity for a price?"<br><br>For a few moments I would like to address seven principles of integrity that I hope will inspire us to make this Christlike attribute a fundamental character trait in our personal lives.<br><br><i>First: Integrity is the foundation of our character and all other virtues.</i>In 1853 the Saints commenced the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. For the better part of seven long, hard years the Saints dug the excavations and laid the foundation--over eight feet deep, all made of sandstone. One day the foreman came to Brigham Young with this devastating news--there were cracks in the blocks of sandstone. Brigham Young was faced with this dilemma: (i) do the best they could to patch up the cracks and build a temple of much less weight and grandeur than anticipated or (ii) rip out seven years of work and repair it with a granite foundation that could support the magnificent temple God envisioned for them. Fortunately Brigham Young chose the latter course.<br><br>Integrity is the foundation upon which character and a Christlike life are built. If there are cracks in that foundation, then it will not support the weight of other Christlike attributes that must be built upon it. How can we be humble if we lack the integrity to acknowledge our own weaknesses? How can we develop charity for others if we are not totally honest in our dealings with them? How can we repent and be clean if we only partially disclose the truth to our bishop? At the root of every virtue is integrity.<br><br>C. S. Lewis noted that once we make a mistake in a mathematical equation, we cannot just keep on going. His exact words are as follows: "When I have started a sum the wrong way, the sooner I admit this and go back and start over again, the faster I shall get on."<sup>4</sup>Likewise, we cannot continue to fully acquire other Christlike virtues until we first make integrity the granite foundation of our lives. In some cases it may require us to go through the painful process of ripping out an existing foundation built upon deceit and replacing it stone by stone with a foundation of integrity, but it can be done. Shakespeare understood the inseparability of our integrity and all other Christlike virtues:<br><br><i>Mine honor is my life; both grow in one;</i><br><i>Take honor from me, and my life is done.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br><i>Second: Integrity is not doing just that which is legal but that which is moral or Christlike.</i>It may be legal to have premarital relationships, it may be legal to commit adultery, it may be legal to gossip, but none of those actions is moral or Christlike. Integrity is not just adherence to the legal code; it is adherence to the higher moral code. It is as Abraham Lincoln suggested--living in accord with "the better angels of our nature."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Every young man on this campus has the moral duty to protect and preserve the virtue of his date, and every young woman has the reciprocal moral duty for her date. It is a test of his or her integrity. The man or woman who is striving for integrity will develop a resolve and a discipline that transcend even the powerful passions of physical emotions. It is that integrity to God and to self and to others that sustains them and empowers them even when Satan unleashes his arsenal of moral temptations upon them. To this generation the Lord said: "I will raise up unto myself a pure people."<sup>7</sup>God is counting on you to be that generation.<br><br>Some years ago my business partner and I needed to terminate an employee. After some discussions we reached a settlement to compensate him for his past services. I felt the settlement was more than fair, but, nonetheless, there were some strained relationships as a result of the negotiations. That night I felt a gloom come over me. I tried to dispel it by reasoning within myself that I had been fair, but the feeling would not leave. Then this impression came: "It's not enough to be fair; you must also strive to be Christlike." Adherence to the highest moral code is a hallmark of a man or a woman of integrity.<br><br><i>Third: Integrity makes decisions based on eternal implications.</i>One of the young women in our ward was taking a test at the local high school. As she looked up, she saw one of her friends cheating. Their eyes made contact. Embarrassed, the friend shrugged her shoulders and mouthed the words "I need the grade." Somehow this young lady had lost her eternal vision--it is not grades but godhood that is our destination. What good does it do to be accepted to the most prestigious university but forfeit our exaltation in the process? Every time someone cheats, he trades his spiritual birthright for a mess of pottage. In his shortsightedness he has opted for a dollar today rather than infinite wealth in the life to come. In loving-kindness the Lord gave us this warning:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The man of the world has his heart focused upon his temporal net worth. The man of integrity has his heart focused upon his spiritual net worth. No doubt there will be a lot of millionaires, even billionaires, who in the life to come will find themselves spiritually bankrupt and a lot of goodly Saints who with meager net worths will become spiritual billionaires--discovering that integrity has been the wisest investment of all. Those with integrity have that eternal foresight.<br><br>A disappointed father once told me that his teenage daughter wanted to "live it up" and then three months before her intended marriage clean up her act so she could receive a temple recommend. I do not know of any stake president who would give a recommend under such circumstances. But even if it were given, it would be a curse, not a blessing. Integrity is not shortsighted--it is not just a temporary change of behavior; it is a permanent change of nature.<br><br>When I first entered the field as a mission president, I met several times with a missionary who was struggling with obedience.<br><br>One day in frustration he blurted out: "What then do you want me to do?"<br><br>I replied: "You have missed the point. It is not what do<i>I</i>want you to do but what do<i>you</i>want to do?"<br><br>There was a moment of silence, and then he made this insightful observation: "You are not just asking me to change my behavior; you are asking me to change my nature."<br><br>He was so right. If someone only changes his behavior while a missionary, then, when he goes home, he will be the very same person he was when he left, subject to the same problems that plagued him before. But if someone changes his nature, he will go home a new man, with the power and discipline to conquer his old Goliaths. If someone is only moral because his date insists on it, then he has only changed his behavior and will be equally susceptible when each new temptation confronts him. But if he is moral whether or not his date so insists, he has changed his nature. Then he will have an increased resistance when similar temptations come. If someone speaks good words but entertains bad thoughts, he has only changed his behavior. If he also changes his thoughts, then he will also change his nature. Our natures have changed when our inner motives and thoughts are consistent with our outward behavior. With the Lord's help we can transform our natures. King Benjamin told us how we might change our natures from a natural man to a spiritual man:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever,</i>unless<i>he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Changing our natures, not just our behaviors, is facilitated by an eternal perspective that we are the children of God, that we do have His spark of divinity within us, and that through the Atonement we can become like Him--the perfect model of integrity.<br><br>My grandfather used to say to my grandmother: "What do you think we will be doing 30 million years from now?" Men and women of integrity make their decisions based on eternal implications and consequences--not on what is expedient but on what is right in the eternities.<br><br><i>Fourth: Integrity is disclosing the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</i>I believe the Lord can live with our weaknesses and mistakes, provided there is a desire and effort to repent. That is what the Atonement is all about. But I do not believe that he can easily tolerate a deceitful heart or lying tongue.<br><br>A few years ago I conducted a mission tour. Some of the missionaries were struggling with obedience. That evening the mission president and I conducted interviews with some of the missionaries. The next morning the mission president commenced our zone conference by giving a masterful talk on integrity. I felt impressed to further speak on that subject. We observed that in a few moments we would be conducting additional interviews. We requested that the missionaries not play the game in which someone only discloses the truth if he is asked the perfect, pointed question. If they were men of integrity, they might say, "President, I don't need any questions--I've made some mistakes, and I want to voluntarily disclose them. I want to be 100 percent honest."<br><br>Well, you know what happened. The Spirit was there, and four missionaries from the night before privately stepped forward and said, "We have something else to disclose."<br><br>One of them said, "I want to be an honest man." That day he changed his foundation of sand for a granite foundation of integrity.<br><br>The question is often asked: When should we confess our sins? When the sin is of such a serious nature that it might warrant a disciplinary action or it continues to linger in our mind so we cannot find peace. If we then fail to confess, our spiritual horizons become limited. It is like being surrounded by a circular, impenetrable wall. In such a circumstance we have some limited room in which to move, but we are trapped. We will look in vain for a slit through which we can squeeze, an opening through which we can escape, an end around which we can travel. There are no end runs, no secret openings, no hidden passages. Years of service do not obviate confession; years of abstinence do not erase its need; one-on-one pleading with the Lord is not a substitute. Somewhere, sometime, somehow we must face the wall, square up, and climb it. That is confession. That is total integrity--disclosing the whole truth and nothing but the truth. When we do this, our spiritual horizons become unlimited.<br><br><i>Fifth: Integrity knows no alibis or excuses.</i>There is something ennobling about the man or woman who admits his or her weaknesses or takes the blame "square-on" without excuse or alibi. On multiple occasions Joseph Smith recorded his weaknesses in the Doctrine and Covenants for all to read. What does this tell us? It tells us he was not perfect, but it also tells us he had nothing to hide--he was a man of integrity. What does this do for his credibility when he tells the story of the First Vision or the account of Moroni's visitation? It tells us that we can trust him; that we can believe his every word because he is, indeed, a man of integrity. The Lord said to George Miller, "He may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart."<sup>10</sup>And so it is with Joseph Smith. And so it can be withus.<br><br><i>Sixth: Integrity is keeping our covenants and our commitments, even in times of inconvenience.</i>Integrity is the courage to do right regardless of the consequences and regardless of the inconvenience. President N. Eldon Tanner told of the following experience:<br><br><i>A young man came to me not long ago and said, "Imade an agreement with a man that requires me to make certain payments each year. I am in arrears,and I can't make those payments, for if Ido,it is going to cause me to lose my home. What shall Ido?"</i><br><br><i>I looked at him and said, "Keep your agreement."</i><br><br><i>"Even if it costs me my home?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "I am not talking about your home. I am talking about your agreement; and I think your wife would rather have a husband who would keep his word, meet his obligations, keep his pledges or his covenants, and have to rent a home than to have a home with a husband who will not keep his covenants and his pledges."</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>He had a difficult choice--his home or his integrity. A man of integrity does not yield or succumb merely because it is hard or expensive or inconvenient. In this respect the Lord has a perfect sense of integrity. He has said, "Who am I ... that have promised and have not fulfilled?"<sup>12</sup><br><br>For a number of years I represented a retired attorney named Larry Beilenson. He was one of the most brilliant men I had ever met--a Harvard graduate in the true tradition. He also was a man of exacting integrity--a refreshing combination of traits. For years he served as the personal attorney for Ronald Reagan when he was in the entertainment field. Later he served as one of his political advisors.<br><br>It was about three days before the end of the year. Mr. Beilenson was negotiating the purchase of a large supply of equipment. It would give him a tax write-off and a good return on his investment, but he needed to conclude the transaction before December 31. The other party called back to say that there was simply not enough time to draft and prepare the necessary documents before year-end. I will never forget the instructions that Mr. Beilenson then gave me: "Tell them that they have my word. It is better than a written contract." And then he added, almost parenthetically, "If I were bound only to a written contract, I might find a loophole, but there are no loopholes in my word."<br><br>One of the acid tests of our integrity is whether or not we keep the commitments and promises we have made or whether there are loopholes in our word.<br><br>We might appropriately ask: Do we live the honor code with exactness, or are there loopholes in our word--cracks in our foundation of integrity? Do we honor our commitments as home teachers and visiting teachers, or are there loopholes in our performance? In other words--is our word our bond?<br><br><i>Seventh: Integrity is not governed by the presence of others. It is internally, not externally, driven.</i>Elder Marion D. Hanks told of the man and his small son who stopped at an isolated cornfield on a remote country road and eyed the delicious corn beyond the fence. The father, after looking in front of him, behind him, to the left of him, and to the right of him, started to climb the fence to take some ears of corn. His son looked at him and said reproachfully, "Dad, you forgot to look up."<sup>13</sup><br><br>In Shakespeare's play<i>Hamlet,</i>Polonius says to his son Laertes:<br><br><i>To thine own self be true,</i><br><i>And it must follow, as the night the day,</i><br><br><i>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>What wonderful counsel! We have a choice. We can either seize the moment and take control of our lives or become mere puppets to our environment and our peers.<br><br>Would you watch pornography in front of your mother, your date, your spouse, or your bishop? If it is wrong in the presence of others, it is just as wrong in their absence. The man of integrity who is true to self and to God will choose the right whether or not anyone is looking because he is self-driven, not externally controlled.<br><br>A lack of integrity is a major problem in the world. That deficiency undermines every business transaction and every spousal, family, and social relationship it touches. It is a concern of every profession. There are attorneys who bill for hours of service that they never rendered; physicians who recommend surgeries and procedures that were never needed; teachers who fail to prepare lessons but deposit their paychecks just the same; and, unfortunately, politicians whose integrity is governed by popular polls rather than by eternal principles. It is a day and age in which men and women of integrity are in desperate demand but in short supply.<br><br>May the integrity of our souls have a sign that reads in bold, black letters "NOT FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE" so that it might be said of us, as it was of Hyrum Smith, "Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart."<sup>15</sup>We love you for the integrity of your hearts and the purity of your lives.<br><br>May we all become men and women of integrity--not because we have to but because we want to. The Lord announced the reward for those who do so: "Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest ... and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice ...<i>they are accepted of me.</i>"<sup>16</sup>May we all be accepted of God because we are striving to become men and women of integrity. I so pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Tad R.
