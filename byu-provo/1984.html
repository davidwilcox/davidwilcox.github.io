<h1>nk Ye of Salvation by Grace? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I think I'll take as a text what we just sang:<br><br><i>Glory to God on high!</i><br><i>Let heav'n and earth reply;</i><br><i>Praise ye his name!</i><br><i>His love and grace adore,</i><br><i>Who all our sorrows bore;</i><br><i>Sing aloud evermore,</i><br><i>Worthy the Lamb!</i><br>[James Allen, "Glory to God on High,"<i>Hymns</i>no. 44]<br><br>I wonder how many of us are aware of one of the great religious phenomena of the ages, one that is now sweeping through Protestant Christianity, as only one other thing has ever done in the whole Christian Era.<br><br>We are silent witnesses of an almost worldwide religious craze that had its birth in the minds of a few great religious reformers nearly five hundred years ago and which is now receiving a new birth of freedom and influence.<br><br>May I divorce myself for a moment from the mainstream of present-day evangelical Christianity, swim upstream as it were, and give forth some rather plain and pointed expression on this supposedly marvelous means of being saved with very slight effort.<br><h2><b>The Original Heresy</b></h2><br>But before zeroing in on this religious mania that has now taken possession of millions of devout but deluded people, and as a means of keeping all things in perspective, let me first identify the original heresy that did more than anything else to destroy the primitive Christianity.<br><br>This first and chief heresy of a now fallen and decadent Christianity--and truly it is the father of all heresies--swept through all of the congregations of true believers in the early centuries of the Christian Era; it pertained then and pertains now to the nature and kind of being that God is.<br><br>It was the doctrine, adapted from Gnosticism, that changed Christianity from the religion in which men worshipped a personal God, in whose image man is made, into the religion in which men worshipped a spirit essence called the Trinity. This new God, no longer a personal Father, no longer a personage of tabernacle, became an incomprehensible three-in-one spirit essence that filled the immensity of space.<br><br>The adoption of this false doctrine about God effectively destroyed the true worship among men and ushered in the age of universal apostasy. The dominant church then became a political power, ruling autocratically over kingdoms and empires as well as over her own congregations. Salvation, as was then supposed, was administered by the church through the seven sacraments.<br><h2><b>The Second Greatest Heresy</b></h2><br>Nearly a millennium and a half later, during the sixteenth century, as the Reformation grew out of the Renaissance, as a means of breaking the hold of the dominant church, the great Christian reformers lit a new doctrinal fire. That fire, burning wildly over the dry and arid prairies of religious autocracy, is what really prepared the way for the restoration of the gospel in modern times.<br><br>It was nonetheless the doctrinal fire--the burning, flaming, heretical fire--that became the second greatest heresy of Christendom, because it effectively destroyed the efficacy and power of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ by whom salvation comes.<br><br>The first great heresy, sweeping like a prairie fire through the struggling branches of a newly born Christianity, destroyed the worship of the true God. And the second, a heresy originating in the same courts of darkness, destroyed that very atonement of God's only Son.<br><br>This second heresy--and it is the delusion and mania that prevails to this day in the great evangelical body of Protestantism--is the doctrine that we are justified by faith alone, without the works of the law. It is the doctrine that we are saved by grace alone, without works. It is the doctrine that we may be born again simply by confessing the Lord Jesus with our lips while we continue to live in our sins.<br><br>We have all listened to sermons by the great revivalists and self-appointed prophets of the various radio and television ministries. Whatever the subjects of their sermons may be, they always end with an invitation and a plea for people to come forward and confess the Lord Jesus and receive the cleansing power of his blood.<br><br>Television broadcasts of these sermons always show arenas or coliseums or stadiums filled with people, scores and hundreds and thousands of whom go forward to make their confessions, to become born-again Christians, to be saved with all they suppose this includes.<br><br>While driving along a highway in my car, I was listening to the radio sermon of one of these evangelists who was preaching of salvation by grace alone. He said all anyone had to do to be saved was to believe in Christ and perform an affirmative act of confession.<br><br>Among other things he said: "If you are traveling in a car, simply reach forth your hand and touch your car radio, thus making contact with me, and then say, 'Lord Jesus, I believe,' and you will be saved."<br><br>Unfortunately, I did not accept his generous invitation to gain instant salvation; and so I suppose my opportunity is lost forever!<br><br>Interwoven with this concept is the doctrine that the elect of God are predestined to be saved regardless of any act on their part, which, as I suppose, is part of the reason a Lutheran minister once said to me: "I was saved two thousand years ago, and there is nothing I can do about it one way or the other now," meaning that he thought he was saved by the blood of Christ shed on Calvary, without any works or effort on his part.<br><h2><b>The Example of Martin Luther</b></h2><br>Here is an account of how Martin Luther himself came to believe the doctrine of justification by faith alone; it is an ideal illustration of why this doctrine has such wide appeal.<br><br>A friendly biographer tells us: Luther "was much concerned about his personal salvation and given to gloomy reflections over his sinful condition," so much so that "he fell dangerously ill, and was seized with a fit of despair." Also:<br><br><i>No one surpassed him in prayer, fasting, night watches, self-mortification. He was . . . a model of sanctity. But . . . he found no peace and rest in all his pious exercises. . . . He saw sin everywhere. . . . He could not trust in God as a reconciled Father, as a God of love and mercy, but trembled before him, as a God of wrath, as a consuming fire. . . . It was sin as an all-pervading power and vitiating principle, sin as a corruption of nature, sin as an alienation from God and hostility to God that weighed on his mind like an incubus and brought him to the brink of despair.</i><br><br>While in this state, he gained<br><br><i>the conviction that the sinner is justified by faith alone, without the works of the law. . . . This experience acted like a new revelation on Luther. It shed light upon the whole Bible and made it to him a book of life and comfort. He felt relieved of the terrible load of guilt by an act of free grace. He was led out of the dark prison house of self-inflicted penance into the daylight and fresh air of God's redeeming love. Justification broke the fetters of legalistic slavery, and filled him with the joy and peace of the state of adoption; it opened to him the very gates of heaven.</i>[Philip Schaff,<i>History of the Christian Church,</i>vol. 7, pp. 111, 116–17, 122–24]<br><br>So says Luther's biographer.<br><br>It should be perfectly clear to all of us that Luther's break with Catholicism was part of the divine program; it came as an Elias preparing the way for the Restoration. But this does not in any sense put a stamp of divine approval on the doctrine he devised to justify the break in his own mind.<br><h2><b>A Modern-Day Example</b></h2><br>I received a letter from a returned missionary whom I shall call Elder Carnalus Luciferno, for no one in his right mind would have such a name, and my correspondent was certainly out of his mind.<br><br>His letter told me of his own conversion, of his service as a zone leader in the mission field, and of making many converts. But after returning home, as he expressed it, "I returned to my old Gentile ways."<br><br>After thus ceasing to be a true Saint, and becoming a genuine Gentile, he met some representatives of another church who taught him that we are saved by grace, without works, simply by believing in the Lord Jesus.<br><br>Thereupon he was saved, and his letter, which he sent to many people, was an invitation to these others to believe in Christ and be saved as he was saved.<br><br>Later I said to his mission president, "Tell me about Elder Carnalus Luciferno."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "Elder Carnalus Luciferno was a good missionary who made many converts. But since returning home he has been excommunicated."<br><br>"Oh," I said. "What was his problem?"<br><br>The mission president replied, "Before he joined the Church, he was a homosexual, and we understood that since his release he has reverted to his old ways."<br><h2><b>The Strait and Narrow Way</b></h2><br>Now, let us reason together on this matter of being saved without the need to do the works of righteousness. Did you ever wonder why our missionaries convert one of a city and two of a family while the preachers of this doctrine of salvation by grace alone gain millions of converts?<br><br>Does it seem strange to you that we wear out our lives in bringing one soul unto Christ, that we may have joy with him in the kingdom of the Father, while our evangelist colleagues cannot even count their converts so great is their number?<br><br>Why are those who come to hear the message of the Restoration numbered in the hundreds<i>and</i>thousands, rather than in the hundreds<i>of</i>thousands?<br><br>May I suggest that the difference is between the strait and narrow way, which few find, and the broad way, "that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat" (Matthew 7:13–14).<br><br>All men must have and do have some way of worship--call it what you will--be it Christianity or Communism or Buddhism or atheism, or the wandering ways of Islam. I repeat: All men must and do worship; this inclination is given them by their Creator as a natural gift and endowment. The Light of Christ is shed forth upon all mankind; all men have a conscience and know by instinct the difference between good and evil; it is inherent in the human personality to seek and worship a divine being of some sort.<br><br>As we are aware, since the Fall all men have become carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature; they have become worldly; and their inclination is to live after the manner of the flesh and satisfy their lusts and appetites.<br><br>Accordingly, anytime men can devise a system of worship that will let them continue to live after the manner of the world, to live in their carnal and fallen state, and at the same time one which will satisfy their innate and instinctive desires to worship, such, to them, is a marvelous achievement.<br><h2><b>Salvation by Grace</b></h2><br>Now, there is a true doctrine of salvation by grace--a salvation by grace alone and without works, as the scriptures say. To understand this doctrine we must define our terms as they are defined in holy writ.<br><br><i>1. What is salvation?</i>It is both immortality and eternal life. It is an inheritance in the highest heaven of the celestial world. It consists of the fullness of the glory of the Father and is reserved for those for whom the family unity continues in eternity. Those who are saved become as God is and live as he lives.<br><br><i>2. What is the plan of salvation?</i>It is the system ordained by the Father to enable his spirit children to advance and progress and become like him. It consists of three great and eternal verities--the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement--without any of which there could be no salvation.<br><br><i>3. What is the grace of God?</i>It is his mercy, his love, and his condescension--all manifest for the benefit and blessing of his children, all operating to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.<br><br>We rejoice in the heavenly condescension that enabled Mary to become "the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh" (1 Nephi 11:18).<br><br>We bask in the eternal love that sent the Only Begotten into the world "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).<br><br>We are profoundly grateful for that mercy which endureth forever and through which salvation is offered to erring mortals.<br><br><i>4. Does salvation come by grace, or grace alone, by grace without works?</i>It surely does, without any question in all its parts, types, kinds, and degrees.<br><br>We are saved by grace, without works; it is a gift of God. How else could it come?<br><br>In his goodness and grace the great God ordained and established the plan of salvation. No works on our part were required.<br><br>In his goodness and grace he created this earth and all that is on it, with man as the crowning creature of his creating--without which creation his spirit children could not obtain immortality and eternal life. No works on our part were required.<br><br>In his goodness and grace he provided for the Fall of man, thus bringing mortality and death and a probationary estate into being--without all of which there would be no immortality and eternal life. And again no works on our part were required.<br><br>In his goodness and grace--and this above all--he gave his Only Begotten Son to ransom man and all life from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the Fall of Adam.<br><br>He sent his Son to redeem mankind, to atone for the sins of the world, "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). And again all this comes to us as a free gift and without works.<br><br>There is nothing any man could do to create himself. This was the work of the Lord God.<br><br>Nor did we have any part in the Fall of man, without which there could be no salvation. The Lord provided the way, and Adam and Eve put the system into operation.<br><br>And finally, there neither has been, nor is, nor ever can be any way nor means by which man alone can, or any power he possesses, redeem himself.<br><br>We cannot resurrect ourselves anymore than we can create ourselves. We cannot create a heavenly abode for the Saints, nor make provision for the continuation of the family unit in eternity, nor bring salvation and exaltation into being. All these things are ordained and established by that God who is the Father of us all. And they all came into being and are made available to us, as free gifts, without works, because of the infinite goodness and grace of Him whose children we are.<br><br>Truly, there is no way to overstate the goodness and grandeurs and glories of the grace of God which bringeth salvation. Such wondrous love, such unending mercy, such infinite compassion and condescension--all these can come only from the Eternal God who lives in eternal life and who desires all of his children to live as he lives and be inheritors of eternal life.<br><h2><b>Teaching in the Early Church</b></h2><br>Knowing these things, as did Paul and our fellow apostles of old, let us put ourselves in their position. What words shall we choose, to offer to the world the blessings of a freely given atoning sacrifice?<br><br>On the one hand, we are preaching to Jews who, in their lost and fallen state, have rejected their Messiah and who believe that they are saved by the works and performances of the Mosaic law.<br><br>On the other and, we are preaching to pagans--Romans, Greeks, those in every nation--who know nothing whatever about the Messianic word, or of the need for a Redeemer, or of the working out of the infinite and eternal atonement. They worship idols, the forces of nature, the heavenly bodies, or whatever suits their fancy. As with the Jews, they assume that this or that sacrifice or appeasing act will please the Deity of their choice and some vague and unspecified blessings will result.<br><br>Can either the Jews or the pagans be left to assume that the works they do will save them? Or must they forget their little groveling acts of petty worship, gain faith in Christ, and rely on the cleansing power of his blood for salvation?<br><br>They must be taught faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and to forsake their traditions and performances. Surely we must tell them they cannot be saved by the works they are doing, for man cannot save himself. Instead they must turn to Christ and rely on his merits and mercy and grace.<br><h2><b>Teaching by Abinadi</b></h2><br>Abinadi struggled with this same problem in his contentions with the priests and people of Noah. They had the law of Moses, with its various rites and performances, but they knew nothing of the Atoning One. And so Abinadi asked, "Doth salvation come by the law of Moses? What say ye? And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law of Moses" (Mosiah 12:31).<br><br>After teaching them some of the great truths of salvation, Abinadi answered his own question: "Salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses" (Mosiah 13:28). Salvation is not in works--not even in those revealed of God--but in Christ and his atonement.<br><h2><b>Modern-day Teaching</b></h2><br>Now let us suppose a modern-day case. Suppose we have the scriptures, the gospel, the priesthood, the Church, the ordinances, the organization, even the keys of the kingdom--everything that now is down to the last jot and tittle--and yet there is no atonement of Christ. What then? Can we be saved? Will all our good works save us? Will we be rewarded for all our righteousness?<br><br>Most assuredly we will not. We are not saved by works alone, no matter how good; we are saved because God sent his Son to shed his blood in Gethsemane and on Calvary that all through him might ransomed be. We are saved by the blood of Christ.<br><br>To paraphrase Abinadi: "Salvation doth not come by the Church alone: and were it not for the atonement, given by the grace of God as a free gift, all men must unavoidably perish, and this notwithstanding the Church and all that appertains to it."<br><br>Let us now come to the matter of whether we must do something to gain the blessings of the atonement in our lives. And we find the answer written in words of fire and emblazoned across the whole heavens; we hear a voice speaking with the sound of ten thousand trumpets; the very heavens and the earth are moved out of their place so powerful is the word that goes forth. It is the message that neither men, nor angels, nor the Gods themselves can proclaim with an undue emphasis.<br><br>This is the word: Man cannot be saved by grace alone; as the Lord lives, he must keep the commandments; he must work the works of righteousness; he must work out his salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord; he must have faith like the ancients--the faith that brings with it gifts and signs and miracles.<br><h2><b>"Ye Must Press Forward"</b></h2><br>Does it suffice to believe and be baptized without more? The answer is, No, in every language and tongue. Rather, after belief, after repentance, after baptism,<br><br><i>Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, . . . this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20–21]<br><br>John, the beloved apostle, promises the Saints eternal life with the Father on this condition,<br><br><i>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</i>[1 John 1:7]<br><br>The blood of Christ was shed as a free gift of wondrous grace, but the Saints are cleansed by the blood after they keep the commandments.<br><br>Nowhere has this ever been taught better than in these words of the risen Lord to his Nephite brethren:<br><br><i>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do;</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i>[3 Nephi 27:19–22]<br><br>Men must be doers of the word, not hearers only; they must do the very works that Christ did; and those who have true and saving faith in him accomplish this very end.<br><h2><b>Our Day's Need: Correct Interpretation</b></h2><br>In our day, among other Christians at least, we are not faced with the problems of our predecessors. They had to show that any works then being performed were of no avail without the atonement, that salvation was in Christ and his spilt blood, and that all men must come unto him to be saved.<br><br>Our need in today's world, in which Christians assume there was an atonement, is to interpret the scriptures properly and to call upon men to keep the commandments so as to become worthy of the cleansing power of the blood of the Lamb.<br><br>Hear, then, the word of the Lord Jesus:<br><br><i>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</i>[Matthew 7:21]<br><br>And it is the will of the Father--as a thousand scriptures attest--that all men everywhere must endure to the end, must keep the commandments, must work out their salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord, or they can in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>How well Nephi said,<br><br><i>Believe in Christ, and . . . be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</i>[2 Nephi 25:23]<br><h2><b>Gospel Call to Righteousness</b></h2><br>Salvation by grace alone and without works, as it is taught in large segments of Christendom today, is akin to what Lucifer proposed in preexistence--that he would save all mankind and one soul should not be lost. He would save them without agency, without works, without any act on their part.<br><br>As with the proposal of Lucifer in the preexistence to save all mankind, so with the doctrine of salvation by grace alone, without works, as it is taught in modern Christendom--both concepts are false. There is no salvation in either of them. They both come from the same source; they are not of God.<br><br>We believe and proclaim that it is life eternal to know the only wise and true God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Let men worship whomsoever they will, but there is no salvation in worshipping any God but the true God.<br><br>We believe and proclaim that salvation is in Christ, in his gospel, in his atoning sacrifice. We are bold to say it comes by the goodness and grace of the Father and the Son. No people on earth praise the Lord with greater faith and fervor than we do because of th is goodness and grace.<br><br>As the Lord's agents, as his servants, as ambassadors of Christ--sent by him, sent to speak in his place instead, sent to say what he would say if he personally were here--we testify that no man, as long as the earth shall stand, or the heavens endure, or God continues as God, no man shall ever be saved in the kingdom of God, in the celestial kingdom of heaven, without doing the works of righteousness.<br><br>As far as man is concerned, the great and eternal plan of salvation is:<br><br>1. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; faith in him as the Son of God; faith in him as the Savior and Redeemer who shed his blood for us in Gethsemane and on Calvary;<br><br>2. Repentance of all our sins--thus forsaking the world and its carnal course; thus turning from the broad way that leads to destruction; thus preparing for the spiritual rebirth into the kingdom of God;<br><br>3. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; baptism under the hands of a legal administrator who has power to bind on earth and seal in heaven--thus planting our feet firmly on the strait and narrow path leading to eternal life;<br><br>4. Receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost--thus enabling us to be baptized with fire; to have sin and evil burned out of our souls as though by fire; to be sanctified so as to stand pure and spotless before the Lord at the last day; and<br><br>5. Enduring to the end in righteousness, keeping the commandments, and living by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.<br><br>Thus saith the Lord:<br><br><i>He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:23]<br><br>As God is true, and Christ is the Savior, and the Holy Ghost is their minister and witness, such is the plan of salvation, and there neither is nor ever shall be any other.<br><br>Let those in the world think and act as they please; let us, the Saints of God who know better, together with all who are willing to live by the higher standard of the gospel, praise the Lord for his goodness and grace and do so by keeping his commandments, thereby becoming heirs of eternal salvation.<br><br><i>Glory to God on high!</i><br><i>Let heav'n and earth reply;</i><br><i>Praise ye his name.</i><br><i>His love and grace adore,</i><br><i>Who all our sorrows bore;</i><br><i>Sing aloud evermore,</i><br><i>Worthy the Lamb!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>no. 44]<br><br>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R. McConkie was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 January 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>d Hope: Walking on the Water - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is a story of a minister showing a painting of Christ to a child. Anxious to reassure him, the minister softly explained, "Of course, it's not really Jesus. It's just an artist's conception of him."<br><br>The child looked for a moment and then said, "Well, it sure looks like him to me."<br><h2><b>Learning as Remembering</b></h2><br>We who are no longer children have forgotten some of the glorious things we once knew. According to Jung's concept of racial memory, when we allow ourselves that fleeting glimpse into our subconscious self, we remember more than we know. Plato talks of all learning as remembering.<br><br>Madeleine L'Engle has said: "Peter was able to walk on the water until he remembered he didn't know how" (<i>Walking on Water</i>[New York: Bantam Books 1982], p. 19).<br><br>Peter's success hinged on his remembering it was through spiritual laws and not his own that he had power. In the frequently painful path from childhood to godhood, what temptations do we encounter that so divert our direction and cast clouds over our memory?<br><br>I have often heard, "When I was a child I believed everything was possible. I believed I could grow up to become anything I imagined. But then I grew up! There was anxiety in my home. I had self-defeating experiences in high school. My mission was more difficult than I expected. Now I'm often confused, depressed, and afraid." Perhaps you've heard those kinds of comments yourselves.<br><br>Not only have we forgotten the glorious things we once knew, but we have also forgotten we were asked to endure some trying things--we who are children of Christ through adoption and the crucifixion. We too are to learn obedience by the things which we suffer.<br><br>I recently read the experience of a physician of another faith who was discharged from military service. He reported an alarming change in his civilian patients after being away from them for some time. He said:<br><br><i>Upon my return from the Army, I noticed a change in my previous patients' troubles. I found that a high percentage do not need medicine but better [minds]. They are not sick in their bodies so much as they are sick in their [thinking] and emotions. They are all mixed up with fear, ... inferior feelings, guilt, and resentment. I found that in treating them I needed to be about as much a psychiatrist as [an internist] and then I discovered that not even those therapies helped me fully to do my job. I became aware that in many cases the basic trouble with people was spiritual.</i>[Norman Vincent Peale,<i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i>(Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1965), p. 148]<br><br>No one was more aware then this physician that medical science is needful, but as he pointed out, fear controls us when faith is not exercised.<br><h2><b>Hope Leads to Faith</b></h2><br>May I share a quote with you from one I admire, who, by exercising hopefulness amidst adversity, developed a remarkable faith. Eleanor Roosevelt said, "I have won the attention of posterity not because I had new theories about the world, but because [I] never reflected the mood of pessimism and disillusionment. Faith gathers up life, pulls it together and gives it direction. And so I walk by faith and not by sight" (Eleanor Roosevelt,<i>Family Circle</i>, January 1984, pp. 31, 34). Despite the pain and sorrow and disappointments of her life, she succeeded through optimism which led to hope which led to faith.<br><br>We all want this hopeful view for ourselves, and yet we continue to embark on rather hopeless journeys.<br><br>In Alma 22:16, Aaron said, "If thou wilt bow down before God, ... and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the<i>hope</i>thou desirest." "<i>Faith</i>is things which are hoped for and not seen" (Ether 12:6; emphasis added).<br><br>Spiritual powers are based on spiritual laws. The Savior told us that this power, the power that allows Him to show unto us great miracles, greater things than have ever been seen or heard, comes as a direct gift from God. And we can show Him that we do desire it. Jesus said:<br><br><i>Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost</i>[including its great power]<i>because they believe in me; and thou</i>seest that they believe in me<i>because thou hearest them, and they pray unto me.</i>[3 Nephi 19:22; emphasis added]<br><br>He knows we believe in Him because He hears us. Prayer is proof of our faith.<br><h2><b>Miracles of Faith</b></h2><br>I have prayed for guidance regarding a personal experience I might share with you, and again and again I have felt impressed to share with you the following. I pray you will hear the message that is intended.<br><br>A few years ago I was having some serious medical problems. I scheduled myself into a hospital for some routine presurgery testing. I'm not sure I even told Jeff I was going in for the tests. To begin, they injected an iodine dye into my vein prior to taking X-rays, and I had a severe allergic reaction. I went into anaphylactic shock. All my bodily functions stopped. Three doctors and two nurses worked frantically to revive me. At one point during this struggle I came to enough to hear one of the nurses read my pulse which was slower then my father-in-law's had been when he went into a coma and died.<br><br>I knew I was dying, and I knew I needed someone with absolute faith. I called out for my husband and fell unconscious again.<br><br>It dawned on them that they should have called him anyway, but they simply had been preoccupied with my condition. A nurse ran to a phone to call him. All she said to him was, "We are doing all we can for your wife, and now she wants you."<br><br>In less time than it takes to get to the hospital, he arrived and bolted into the emergency room rather than wait outside as someone had suggested. With his usual confidence (which I have silently watched develop as his relationship with the Lord has deepened), he sort of shoved three doctors and two nurses aside and announced, "I don't know whether any of you are LDS, but I am going to give my wife a blessing." Midway through that blessing I opened my eyes, saw his face, and thought I had never seen anything so beautiful. And I told him so. (Later he told me this was the only evidence he had found of any brain damage.)<br><br>I add my personal witness that prayer, including priesthood prayer, is the proof of our faith. And the proof is rewarded by the Holy Ghost (and holy power) which Nephi said "will show unto you<i>all</i>things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:5). There are miracles of faith, and we should have faith in the miraculous.<br><br>When Jesus called Peter to come to Him across the water, Peter, for one brief, glorious moment, forgot he did not know how and strode with ease across the sea. This is how we are meant to be. May we be so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R.

<h1>ess: A Robe, a Ring, and a Fatted Calf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Recently I was invited by President Bishop of the Missionary Training Center to address the nearly two thousand missionaries in residence there. I accepted because I always assume it is impossible to give a poor talk at the MTC. They will take notes and make scriptural cross-references if you read them the telephone directory. Plus I love to hear them sing. So I went.<br><h2><b>The Missionary</b></h2><br>Following prayers, hymns, announcements and introductions, I gave them a rousing forty-minute reading of the telephone directory, proving that indeed one<i>can</i>give a poor talk to these missionaries. But, generous Christians that they are, several came up following my remarks to visit briefly and discuss my message. (Actually most of them either wanted tickets to a basketball game or to complain about the parking ticket "hold" that Financial Services had put on their temple recommends.) I visited with many of them and the minutes stretched into many minutes and then finally into nearly an hour. During that time I noticed one young elder hanging around the outer rim of the circle as all the other missionaries came and went.<br><br>Finally the traffic thinned out, and he stepped forward. "Do you remember me?" he asked.<br><br>"No," I said, "I'm sorry I don't. Tell me your name."<br><br>He replied, "My name is Elder ___________." His eyes searched mine for recognition, but I just didn't know who this young man was.<br><br>Summoning his courage for the ultimate revelation he said, "Hinckley Hall--A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense." Then I knew who he was. That little coded phrase may not ring any bells for you, but it meant something to him and he knew it meant something to me.<br><br>On September 7, 1982, I stood in this exact spot and gave the only angry public spanking I have ever given a group of BYU students. The title of my remarks for that back-to-school message was "A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense." I spoke of an offense, a felony--falsifying government documents--which had been committed in Hinckley Hall the April before and which had been widely covered by the press. Five months had passed but I was still hurting. Time had not soothed me.<br><br>I spoke of that incident publicly--without mentioning the names of the participants--because I care about matters of morality and honor and personal virtue at BYU. I wanted it clear then (and now, if anyone is still wondering) that the behavior of every student at Brigham Young University matters very much to me and to what this school stands for. So I said my piece and, for all intents and purposes, forgot about it.<br><br>But, as you might guess, it was not easy for the students involved. Not only were there the burdens of university and Church actions, but the civil laws made an indelible stroke across the record of some of these young lives. There were tears and courts and sentences and probations. Legally it had been about as much of a nightmare as a college freshman could have foreseen. Obviously it was<i>more</i>of a nightmare than they could have foreseen because the sorrow and remorse over their "prank"--I put the word in quotation marks--was deep and rending.<br><br>I recall that very unsavory experience for you this morning simply to put a happy ending on one young man's very difficult experience. His father wrote me later and said how much courage it had taken for him to come up and talk with me at the MTC, but he said his son wanted me to know of his effort to make things right. It had not been easy for him to get a mission call. Not only were there all the court-imposed sanctions and Church restrictions, but there was the terrible personal burden of guilt. But he wanted to serve a mission both because it was the right thing to do and because it was a way for him to say to the Church, the government, the university and all who cared about him, "I'm back. I made a serious mistake but I'm back. I am making up lost ground. I've still got a chance."<br><h2><b>The Prayer in My Heart</b></h2><br>As you know, there are other painful stories about transgressions and heartache on this campus, stories involving very serious but usually less public mistakes. The prayer in my heart this morning is to help some of you, any of you, even one of you, have a similarly happy ending to your story, a story which you may feel is pocked and blemished beyond repair for some past mistake you have made. In short, I wish to speak to you of the redeeming love of Christ and why His gospel is indeed the "good news." Because of Him we can rise above past problems, blot them out, watch them die if we are willing to have it so.<br><br>I am not sure what your most painful memories might be. I'm certain there are lots of problems we could all list. Some may be sins among the most serious God Himself has listed. Others may be less serious disappointments, including a poor start in school, or a difficult relationship with your family, or personal pain with a friend. Whatever the list, it's bound to be long when we add up all the dumb things we've done. And my greatest fear is that you will not believe in other chances, that you will not understand repentance, that on some days you will not believe in any future at all.<br><h2><b>Macbeth's Guilt</b></h2><br>In what may well be literature's most extreme and chilling observation of such debilitating, unassuaged guilt, we watch Macbeth--cousin of the king, masterful, strong, honored, and honorable--descend through a horrible series of bloody deeds by which his very soul is increasingly "tortured by an agony which [knows no] ... repose" (A. C. Bradley,<i>Shakespearean Tragedy</i>, [New York: Fawcett, 1967], p. 276). Shapes of terror appear before his eyes, and the sounds of hell clamor in his ears.<br><br>His guilty heart and tormented conscience rend his days and terrify his nights so incessantly that he says to his physician:<br><br><i>Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,</i><br><i>Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,</i><br><i>Raze out the written troubles of the brain,</i><br><i>And with some sweet oblivious antidote</i><br><i>Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff</i><br><i>Which weighs upon the heart?</i><br><br>The doctor shakes his head over such diseases of the soul, and says:<br><br><i>Therein the patient</i><br><i>Must minister to himself.</i><br>[5.3.40–47]<br><br>But the anguish continues unabated until Macbeth says on the day he will die:<br><br><i>Out, out, brief candle!</i><br><i>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</i><br><i>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</i><br><i>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</i><br><i>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</i><br><i>Signifying nothing.</i>[5.5.23–28]<br><br>Macbeth's murders are sins too strong for the kind of transgression you and I might discuss at BYU. But I believe the despair of his final hopelessness can be applied at least in part to our own circumstances. Unless we believe in repentance and restoration, unless we believe there can be a way back from our mistakes--whether those sins be sexual or social or civil or academic, whether they be great or small--unless we believe we can start over on solid ground with our past put behind us and genuine hope for the future--in short, if we cannot believe in the compassion of Christ and His redemptive love, then I think we in our own way are as hopeless as Macbeth and our view of life just as depressing. We do become shadows, feeble players on a perverse stage, in a tale told by an idiot. And unfortunately, in such a burdened state, we are the idiots.<br><h2><b>The Miracle of Forgiveness</b></h2><br>As he began to write of what he would call the "miracle of forgiveness," President Kimball said:<br><br><i>I had made up my mind that I would never write a book</i>[but]<i>... when I come in contact almost daily with broken homes, delinquent children, corrupt governments, and apostate groups, and realize that all these problems are the result of sin, I want to shout with Alma: "O ... that I might go forth ... with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people." (Alma 29:1.)</i><br><br><i>Hence this book indicates the seriousness of breaking God's commandments; shows that sin can bring only sorrow, remorse, disappointment, and anguish; and warns that the small indiscretions evolve into larger ones and finally into major transgressions which bring heavy penalties ....</i><br><br>[But] having come to recognize their deep sin, many have tended to surrender hope, not having a clear knowledge of the scriptures and of the redeeming power of Christ.<br><br>[So I also]<i>write to make the joyous affirmation that man can be literally transformed by his own repentance and by God's forgiveness....</i><br><br><i>It is my humble hope that ...</i>[those]<i>who are suffering the baleful effects of sin may be helped to find the way from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope, and from spiritual death to eternal life.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, Preface,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>p. x–xii; emphasis added]<br><br>That is what I want for you this year, this new year and new semester, at BYU. Without ever minimizing the seriousness of some of our mistakes, I want to give to you today the message that we can be washed and pronounced clean if we will but honor the Lamb of God. From relatively innocent mistakes or disadvantages in life to the most serious of spiritual sins, the gospel of Jesus Christ gives us a way back. We must believe in movement "from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope."<br><h2><b>Alma's Return</b></h2><br>What if Alma had not come back? He had made serious mistakes, more serious perhaps than we know. He is described as "a very wicked and an idolatrous man," one who sought to "destroy the church" and who delighted in "rebelling against God" (Mosiah 27:8, 10, 11). He was, in short, "the very vilest of sinners" (Mosiah 28:4). The strongest denunciation comes from his own lips when he said to his son Helaman,<br><br><i>I had rebelled against my God....</i><br><br><i>... I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction . ... So great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</i>[Alma 36:13–14]<br><br>He may not have been Macbeth, but that is a frightening description of a man's standing before God. But he came back. Not without anguish and suffering and fear, not without "wandering through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death." But he paid the full price and came back on the strength of Christ's love. And every life thereafter, both in the Book of Mormon itself and in our generation, has been enriched because of the life Alma then lived.<br><br>What if he had not had the courage to make amends, however severe, and had remained at the far end of a road he should never have taken? What if, having found himself in such a mess he had despairingly thrown his hands in the air and said, "Out, brief candle. I am a poor player upon a stage. My life is a tale told by an idiot. It has been full of sound and fury, and now it signifies nothing"?<br><h2><b>Peter's Strength</b></h2><br>Or what if a mistake or two had so crippled Peter that he had not come back, stronger than ever, after the crucifixion and resurrection of the Master? A few years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of Peter's struggle. After recounting the events of Jesus' ordeal in accusations, mock trials, and imprisonment, and Peter's remorseful acquiescence to it, he said:<br><br><i>As I have read this account my heart goes out to Peter. So many of us are so much like him. We pledge our loyalty; we affirm our determination to be of good courage; we declare, sometimes even publicly, that come what may we will do the right thing, that we will stand for the right cause, that we will be true to ourselves and to others.</i><br><br><i>Then the pressures begin to build. Sometimes these are social pressures. Sometimes they are personal appetites. Sometimes they are false ambitions. There is a weakening of the will. There is a softening of discipline. There is capitulation. And then there is remorse, self-accusation, and bitter tears of regret.</i><br><br>Well, if Peter's story were to have ended there, with him cursing and swearing and saying, "I know not the man," surely his would be among the most pathetic in all scripture.<br><br>But Peter came back.<br><br>He squared his shoulders and stiffened his resolve and made up for lost ground. He took command of a frightened little band of Church members. He preached such a moving sermon on the day of Pentecost that three thousand in the audience applied for baptism. Days later five thousand heard him and were baptized. With John, he healed the lame man at the gate of the temple. Faith in Peter's faith brought the sick into the streets on their beds of affliction "that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them" (Acts 5:15). He fearlessly spoke for his brethren when they were arraigned before the Sanhedrin and when they were cast into prison. He entertained angels and received the vision that led to carrying the gospel to the Gentiles. He became in every sense the rock Christ promised he would be. Of such a life President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I pray that you may draw comfort and resolution from the example of Peter who, though he had walked daily with Jesus, in an hour of extremity denied both the Lord and the testimony which he carried in his own heart. But he rose above this, and became a mighty defender and a powerful advocate. So too, there is a way for you to turn about and ...</i>[build]<i>the kingdom of God.</i>["And Peter Went Out and Wept Bitterly,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, pp. 65–67]<br><h2><b>Help Is Needed</b></h2><br>Of course, one of the added tragedies in transgression is that even if<i>we</i>make the effort to change, to try again, to come back, others often insist upon leaving the old labels with us.<br><br>I grew up in the same town with a boy who had no father and precious few of the other blessings of life. The young men in our community found it easy to tease and taunt and bully him. And in the process of it all he made some mistakes, though I cannot believe his mistakes were more serious than those of his Latter-day Saint friends who made life so miserable for him. He began to drink and smoke, and the gospel principles which had never meant much to him now meant even less. He had been cast in a role by LDS friends who should have known better and he began to play the part perfectly. Soon he drank even more, went to school even less, and went to Church not at all. Then one day he was gone. Some said that they thought he had joined the army.<br><br>That was about 1959 or so. Fifteen or sixteen years later he came home. At least he tried to come home. He had found the significance of the gospel in his life. He had married a wonderful girl, and they had a beautiful family. But he discovered something upon his return. He had changed, but some of his old friends hadn't--and they were unwilling to let him escape his past.<br><br>This was hard for him and hard for his family. They bought a little home and started a small business, but they struggled both personally and professionally and finally moved away. For reasons that don't need to be detailed here, the story goes on to a very unhappy ending. He died a year ago at age 44. That's too young to die these days, and it's certainly too young to die away from home.<br><br>When a battered, weary swimmer tries valiantly to get back to shore, after having fought strong winds and rough waves which he should never have challenged in the first place, those of us who might have had better judgment, or perhaps just better luck, ought not to row out to his side, beat him with our oars, and shove his head back underwater. That's not what boats were made for. But some of us do that to each other.<br><br>In general conference a few years ago Elder David B. Haight told us that--<br><br><i>Arturo Toscanini, the late, famous conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, received a brief, crumpled letter from a lonely sheepherder in the remote mountain area of Wyoming:</i><br><br><i>"Mr. Conductor: I have only two possessions--a radio and an old violin. The batteries in my radio are getting low and will soon die. My violin is so out of tune I can't use it. Please help me. Next Sunday when you begin your concert, sound a loud 'A' so I can tune my 'A' string; then I can tune the other strings. When my radio batteries are dead, I'll have my violin.</i><br><br><i>At the beginning of his next nationwide radio concert from Carnegie Hall, Toscanini announced: "For a dear friend and listener back in the mountains of Wyoming the orchestra will now sound an 'A.'" The musicians all joined together in a perfect "A."</i><br><br>[That]<i>lonely sheepherder only needed one note, just a little help to get back in tune; ... he needed someone who cared to assist him with</i>[just]<i>one string;</i>[after that]<i>the others would be easy.</i>["People to People,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1981, p. 54]<br><h2><b>William Wines Phelps's Way Back</b></h2><br>In the early years of the Church the Prophet Joseph Smith had no more faithful aide than William Wines Phelps. Brother Phelps, a former newspaper editor, had joined the Church in Kirtland and was of such assistance to those early leaders that they sent him as one of the first Latter-day Saints to the New Jerusalem--Jackson County, Missouri. There he was called by the Lord to the stake presidency of that "center stake of Zion."<br><br>But then troubles developed. First they were largely ecclesiastical aberrations but later there were financial improprieties. Things became so serious that the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that if Phelps did not repent, he would be "removed out of [his] place" (<i>HC</i>2:511). He did not repent and was excommunicated on March 10, 1838.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph and others immediately tried to love Phelps back into the fold, but he would have nothing of it. Then in the fall of that violent year W. W. Phelps, along with others, signed a deadly, damaging affidavit against the Prophet and other leaders of the Church. The result was quite simply that Joseph Smith was sentenced to be publicly executed on the town square in Far West, Missouri, Friday morning, November 2, 1838. Through the monumental courage of General Alexander Doniphan, the Prophet was miraculously spared the execution Phelps and others had precipitated, but he was not spared spending five months--November through April--in several Missouri prisons, the most noted of which was the pit known ironically as Liberty Jail.<br><br>I do not need to recount for you the suffering of the Saints through that period. The anguish of those not captive was in many ways more severe than those imprisoned. The persecution intensified until the Saints sought yet again to find another refuge from the storm. With Joseph in chains, praying for their safety and giving some direction by letter, they made their way toward Commerce, Illinois, a malaria swamp on the Mississippi River where they would try once more to build the city of Zion. And much of this travail, this torment and heartache, was due to men of their own brotherhood like W. W. Phelps.<br><br>But we're speaking today of happy endings. Two very difficult years later, with great anguish and remorse of conscience, Phelps wrote to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo.<br><br><i>Brother Joseph: ... I am as the prodigal son....</i><br><br><i>I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed....</i>[I]<i>ask my old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me, yea, it is bigger and better than all Babylon....</i><br><br><i>I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me. ... I have done wrong and I am sorry. ... I ask forgiveness. ... I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.</i><br><br>In an instant the Prophet wrote back. I know of no private document or personal response in the life of Joseph Smith--or anyone else, for that matter--which so powerfully demonstrates the magnificence of his soul. There is a lesson here for every one of us who claims to be a disciple of Christ.<br><br>He wrote:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Phelps: ... You may in some measure realize what my feelings ... were when we read your letter....</i><br><br><i>We have suffered much in consequence of your behavior--the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us ....</i><br><br><i>However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God's dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal.</i><br><br><i>"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</i><br><br><i>For friends at first, are friends again at last."</i><br><br><i>Yours as ever,</i><br><br><i>Joseph Smith, Jun.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:141–42, 162–64]<br><br>It only adds to the poignance of this particular prodigal's return that exactly four years later--almost to the day--it would be W.W. Phelps selected to preach Joseph Smith's funeral sermon in that terribly tense and emotional circumstance. Furthermore it would be W. W. Phelps who would memorialize the martyred prophet with his hymn of adoration, "Praise to the Man."<br><br>Having been the foolish swimmer pulled back to safety by the very man he had sought to destroy, Phelps must have had unique appreciation for the stature of the Prophet when he penned:<br><br><i>Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.</i><br><i>Ever and ever the keys he will hold.</i><br><i>Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,</i><br><i>Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.</i><br>["Praise to the Man,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 147]<br><br>I requested that we sing a verse of that hymn this morning. Next time you sing it, remember what it meant to W. W. Phelps to be given another chance.<br><h2><b>The Prodigal Son</b></h2><br>Perhaps the most encouraging and compassionate parable in all of Holy Writ is the story of the prodigal son. I close with Mary Lyman Henrie's poetic expression of it entitled "To Any Who Have Watched for a Son's Returning."<br><br><i>He watched his son gather all the goods</i><br><i>that were his lot,</i><br><i>anxious to be gone from tending flocks,</i><br><i>the dullness of the fields.</i><br><br><i>He stood by the olive tree gate long</i><br><i>after the caravan disappeared</i><br><i>where the road climbs the hills</i><br><i>on the far side of the valley,</i><br><i>into infinity.</i><br><br><i>Through changing seasons he spent the light</i><br><i>in a great chair, facing the far country,</i><br><i>and that speck of road on the horizon.</i><br><br><i>Mocking friends: "He will not come."</i><br><i>Whispering servants: "The old man</i><br><i>has lost his senses."</i><br><i>A chiding son: "You should not have let him go."</i><br><i>A grieving wife: "You need rest and sleep."</i><br><br><i>She covered his drooping shoulders,</i><br><i>his callused knees, when east winds blew chill, until that day ...</i><br><i>A form familiar, even at infinity,</i><br><i>in shreds, alone, stumbling over pebbles.</i><br><br><i>"When he was a great way off,</i><br><i>His father saw him,</i><br><i>and had compassion, and ran,</i><br><i>and fell on his neck, and kissed him."</i>(Luke 15:20)<br>[<i>Ensign,</i>March 1983, p. 63]<br><br>God bless us to help each other come back home, where we will, in the presence of our Father, find waiting a robe, a ring, and a fatted calf, I pray in the name of Him who made it possible, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 31 January 1984.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is a humbling experience for me to stand before you in this capacity. To me this is a second language that I am speaking to you. I sincerely hope and pray that the Spirit of the Lord be with us tonight so that we can communicate.<br><h2><b>Tarry Ye Here</b></h2><br>As I listened to this beautiful song, I remembered the great pain and agony, the ordeal of this holy man, the Savior Jesus Christ. After the Last Supper he led eleven apostles to the foot of the Mount of Olives, and from the eleven Jesus took three apostles, Peter, James, and John, to the midst of the grove of the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>As he was departing he expressed his great concern to these three apostles, saying, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me" (Matthew 26:38). And he left these three brethren. That was a time when even the Savior of the world needed the divine fellowship of his friends, Peter, James, and John. He went to the midst of the grove, fell on his knees, and prayed fervently and earnestly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39). Yes, he prayed earnestly for you and me. And when he came back, the apostles were sleeping. They didn't know what a great occasion it was, what Jesus had to go through. That was a time the divine fellowship was needed by the Savior Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>How Exquisite You Know Not</b></h2><br>He went back again and he prayed, "O my father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done" (Matthew 26:42). In the Book of Mark it is recorded, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:3). It was a time of great pain, ordeal, and suffering, and Jesus himself recorded through the Prophet Joseph in Doctrine and Covenants 19:15:<br><br><i>How sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent . . . ;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:15–16, 18–19]<br><br>Oh, what agony and sorrow he went through for you and me! "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 2:44). Brother James E. Talmage explained,<br><br><i>It was not physical pain, nor mental anguish alone, that caused Him to suffer such torture as to produce an extrusion of blood from every pore; but a spiritual agony of soul such as only God was capable of experiencing.</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>pp. 613–14]<br><br>What pain! What suffering!<br><h2><b>Jesus of Nazareth Is the Only Name</b></h2><br>Mankind cannot comprehend the pain and suffering endured for you and me. And Jesus went on the cross and died for you and me.<br><br>This is the center of our great gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is the only "name under heaven given among men," as Peter expressed, "whereby we might be saved" (Acts 4:12). There is none other. My brothers and sisters, how much we don't know about him!<br><br>How much pain we don't know! How much suffering we don't know! How much agony we don't know! How much fear we don't know! How much trembling we don't know!<br><br>I stand before you this night and humbly bear you my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior of the world. And I bear my witness that the same Jesus appeared to the boy Joseph and that after the resurrection he appeared on this American continent to visit the Nephites. The prophet-disciple Nephi recorded the following where Jesus himself testified that he is the Savior of the world:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 11:14]<br><h2><b>Beautiful Savior</b></h2><br>I want to read from the beautiful passage that these brothers sang so well:<br><br><i>Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight</i><br><i>And all the stars in heav'n above;</i><br><i>Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer</i><br><i>And brings to all the world his love.</i><br><br><i>Fair are the meadows, Fairer the woodlands,</i><br><i>Robed in flowers of blooming spring;</i><br><i>Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,</i><br><i>He makes the sorrowing spirit sing.</i><br><br><i>Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations!</i><br><i>Son of God and Son of man!</i><br><i>Glory and honor, praise, adoration,</i><br><i>Now and forevermore be thine.</i><br><i>Now and forevermore be thine</i><br><i>Amen.</i><br>["Beautiful Savior,"<i>Sing with Me</i>, B-6]<br><br>What a beautiful, praising song we heard!<br><h2><b>The Power of Listening Ears</b></h2><br>May we cultivate the power of listening ears to feel his love, and may we cultivate the power of listening ears especially for the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we will come close to the Savior, so that we will know that truly he died for you and me. As someone expressed so beautifully, "Listening to the prompting of the Holy Spirit is the dimension of love." Listening is the art of the eternal quest, and I believe, my brothers and sisters, if we cultivate that power in our daily lives, we will come close to the Savior. I bear you my witness that I know Jesus is the Christ; I know it because I know he is the Savior of the world. May we cultivate that spiritual sensitivity to the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we can feel and know his love constantly.<br><h2><b>Thy Will Be Done</b></h2><br>I want to express, my brothers and sisters, that I have learned that we cannot compare or comprehend with our mortal minds the suffering, the agonies, and the pain our Savior went through in the Garden of Gethsemane. However, in the walks of our daily lives, we may face our own Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>It may be losing your eternal companion, or it may be losing your mom and dad. A friend may betray you or come to dislike you, or you may have a traffic accident. You may become deaf or handicapped. I don't know what trials we may face in our daily lives, but may we learn that beautiful lesson given to us by our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that, when we face trials and temptations, we will not blame our Lord, we will not blame God, but may we say humbly to ourselves, "Thy will be done."<br><br>May we also cultivate that faith to say to our Heavenly Father, "Thy will be done." We will not blame anybody, we will not blame our birthright, we will not blame the situations we face. May we really cultivate that power to say to our Heavenly Father, "O Lord, thy will be done."<br><h2><b>Your Friend, Mick</b></h2><br>I want to share a beautiful story about one who faced his own Garden of Gethsemane--one of your friends, Mick. He served a mission in Japan. After he returned, he earned a B.A. in political science at this great university. And he served as president of your Cougar Club. He married and had two sons.<br><br>He was active in sports and was very talented in every way when he was in school. When he had almost graduated from law school, he went to work as a clerk for a prestigious law firm in Nebraska. At their summer office garden party a tragedy occurred. The party was in a well-to-do neighborhood, and the houses bordered a man-made lake. Many people were swimming and boating on the lake. Mick decided to go for a swim and dove into what proved to be a shallow spot. He lost consciousness and someone was administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when the paramedics arrived his neck was broken, and his whole body was paralyzed. He could not move any part of his body below his neck. He required special equipment just to fill his lungs with air.<br><br>Someone asked how much he had had to drink. A friend replied, "Oh, he hadn't been drinking. He's a Mormon."<br><br>His doctor said he did not expect him to survive such an injury. He told the family he would be lucky to make it through the first night. Now, five years later, Mick Boyle has made it through much more. He has overcome tremendous odds, has survived emotional and physical pain and suffering.<br><h2><b>He Never Ever Complained</b></h2><br>Determined to graduate, Mick resumed studying in his hospital bed in the intensive care unit at the University of Utah Medical Center only three weeks after the accident. He studied eight to ten hours each day. His fellow law school students at BYU brought tapes of lectures, notes, and textbooks to him every day. He also studied from a flip-chart, and he simply had to wait until someone came by that was nice enough to help him find the proper pages. He went through that kind of a condition.<br><br>In the spring of 1978, Mick graduated from the J. Reuben Clark Law School with members of his own class. Shortly thereafter he passed the Utah Bar Examination and became a licensed practicing attorney. He went right to work at the Legal Center for the Handicapped in Salt Lake City. In eighteen months he handled approximately 80 cases, always representing handicapped individuals in need of legal assistance.<br><br>To add to his turmoil and pain, his wife decided he was not to be her eternal companion, took the two babies, and left. That was a great shock to Mick, but he never ever complained. He said to the Lord, "Thy will be done." He insisted on serving the Lord. Then last spring the Lord answered his prayers. His former nurse came one day and knocked on his door and they became congenial friends. One day, Shirley expressed so beautifully, "I want to be your eternal companion." What a beautiful story!<br><br>Two weeks ago I asked Shirley to bear her testimony in stake conference. She gave a most beautiful testimony. There was not a dry eye in that conference. My brothers and sisters, Mick continued on. Someone asked him, "Don't you ever get depressed?"<br><br>He answered, "Oh, sure, some days I can get very depressed. However, I know there is a lot of work to be done, not only for others, but also helping myself to get well, and I must prepare to meet my Savior." Brothers and sisters, don't you think this is our goal, to prepare ourselves for the day to come?<br><br>Mick works hard at getting well. He has faith and keeps a positive attitude about his situation all the time. He exercises every day and maintains contact with the doctors. He has recently made a most astonishing improvement and breakthrough.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, how much we can learn from this kind of story! Time has always been important to Mick. Since his accident he has wasted no time, and he has accomplished more than ever. Brothers and sisters, are you blind, are you deaf, are you paralyzed, are you unloved by someone, or are you diseased spiritually or emotionally or physically? May we learn the great principle--to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ because he died for you and me, and he is our Master, he is our God, and he is the Anchor of our souls. May we cultivate the power of his great love so that we can be close to him, to say to the Lord, "Lord, I humbly express myself. May I serve thee and glorify thy name forevermore."<br><h2><b>A Young Boy Lost His Father</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, I want to tell you another story that happened in Japan right after the war. A young boy lost a father and lost practically everything in his life because of the war. This young boy naturally hated Americans, was prejudiced against them because of his lack of understanding. As he grew up, this young boy learned that a handful of Japanese leaders took the initiative to start the war, and he understood the true situation.<br><br>Things were difficult--not enough food or clothing for him or his family. His mother always tried to help, to teach, and to clothe the family. After he graduated from junior high school, this young boy had a chance to go to senior high school. One day he heard a conversation between his mother and brother and found out the financial difficulties of his home. The next morning, though his brother said that he could go to senior high school, this young man decided, "My brother, I will not go; I will work and help the family."<br><h2><b>Save My Life</b></h2><br>He found a job in a tiny shop which produced a bean curd (we call it tofu in Japan) and attended school part-time at night. He would get up in the morning at 4:30, work until 6:00 p.m., go to school until 11:00 p.m., and not get home until 11:30 p.m. He followed this demanding schedule for about one year, but it became too much and he found himself in the hospital one day suffering from exhaustion. His condition was very critical, and he sensed that. Without knowing of Jesus Christ or God or even how to pray, he prayed, "O God, if thou art there, save my life. If thou wilt save me, I shall repay thee someday. I will serve thee."<br><br>This was the simple prayer of this young boy. He was able to leave the hospital after two months. In order to recuperate he stayed with an uncle in the northern part of Japan.<br><h2><b>A Few More Doors</b></h2><br>At about the same time there were two young men, one from Pocatello, Idaho, and one from Salt Lake City, who went to San Francisco and crossed the big pond, the Pacific. It took them almost a month. There were no jumbo planes in those days. After a few months of training and laboring in Tokyo, they went to the northern part of Japan to a very cold place, not a dry cold like here, but high humidity--it was very wet there.<br><br>It was a P-day, but the senior companion from Idaho, Elder Delmont C. Law, a great man, asked his companion, R. Gordon Porter, if they could go knock on doors. They had had no success whatsoever for days, weeks, and months. Then finally, on this P-day, they decided to keep trying, and after breakfast they took off. They knocked, knocked, and knocked on doors that day. When evening came, bringing with it more cold and rain, they decided they should go home. Then the Spirit prompted them again, especially the senior companion from Pocatello, Idaho, who said to his companion, "Companion, can we do a few more doors?" They again agreed and then went on.<br><h2><b>My Stitches from the War Were Gone</b></h2><br>In that same vicinity lived the young man who had just left the hospital and was recuperating in his uncle's home. He was waiting for something without knowing what. In a dark and cold room in that uncle's home, the missionaries found this young man. When he saw these foreigners, he said to them, "I don't like you Americans. Please go home."<br><br>That was the first reply of the young boy, but the missionary from Pocatello, Idaho, replied, "We have a message for you. Can't you even spend five minutes?" That was a very strong statement, and the young boy couldn't refuse them and welcomed them inside. These missionaries taught him the most beautiful story, and this young boy accepted the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that day. He was baptized two weeks later and grew in the gospel. My brothers and sisters, that young boy is now standing before you.<br><br>On that day I almost missed the glorious everlasting gospel that your forefathers and mothers preserved, this great legacy, great heritage, glorious truth, even the teachings of Jesus Christ. I accepted the beauties of that day. I glanced at the beauties of the panorama of this great gospel of love and this legacy. To me, my wounds, my pain, my suffering, my patches, and my stitches from the war were gone because of the gospel of the Lord, our Savior, even Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>You Too May Touch</b></h2><br>I stand before you and bear you my witness that this is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know that Joseph saw God the Father and Jesus Christ and this is a glorious gospel. I pray and I seek that the glorious blessings, the choicest blessings, the bounteous blessings, of our Heavenly Father will be with you. May we see, comprehend, envision, and understand your legacy in this great gospel that you have that you, too, may touch the lives of other people.<br><br>I leave you my witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I love this Church. I love you beautiful people. I love my Heavenly Father. I love the Lord Jesus Christ. Without him we are meaningless. In him and by him and through him and by the grace of his pure love, once again may we return to our Heavenly Father's presence.<br><h2><b>Serve Our Master</b></h2><br>I know that you have that burning desire in your hearts and that beautiful sparkle of divinity within your bosom, that legacy you inherited from your forefathers and mothers to bless the lives of many others. May your light so shine to the world after you graduate from this great institution; may you be the light to the world, the salt of the earth--and surely you must be the savor of the salt.<br><br>I know that is our beautiful destiny, to glorify the Lord's name and to testify of his holy mission. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to stand before you here. (I prepared my talk in a script, but I decided not to use it tonight.) I pray tonight that you may feel the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of our Heavenly Father, and of the Holy Ghost, so that you may go and be determined to serve our Master in the most beautiful way.<br><h2><b>I Love You with All My Heart</b></h2><br>I thank my wife. She is my companion and she is my friend. She is my girlfriend. She is my eternal mate, my eternal counselor and friend. Please, you young husbands, sometimes go out without the children and buy a Big Mac! Take time to be thoughtful. Take time to be kind, and take time to go to the temple together. Take time to hold hands and to pray. And take time to climb the mountain--after the snow melts, of course--and to sit upon the rock and say to your eternal mate, "I love you with all my heart." And go to Utah Lake, but be careful this year; we have lots of water there. Walk the shore of that beautiful lake and say again, "I love you." Those of you still looking for your eternal mate, don't rush, but hurry. The Spirit will guide you, and you will find a beautiful companion.<br><br>I leave you my solemn witness and testimony that this is the work of the Lord, and Jesus is the Christ. Joseph was a prophet and Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. He said one time, "With all the love I have and possess, I love the Saints and I bless the Saints." May we listen to his great counsel, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Yoshihiko Kikuchi was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 February 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Life and Life Hath Immortality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today is Valentine's Day. . . .<br><br>A wonderful holiday devoted to thoughts of love, tucked into the middle of a winter month to warm the heart and revitalize the spirit of men and women.<br><br>I asked Pat Holland if she had ever received a special valentine from President Holland she would share, and I found that she was born just two days after Valentine's Day, and so he called her his February Sixteenth Valentine. She told me that, when she was about to turn forty, she had all the attendant feelings of reluctance to let go of the twenties and thirties that most women feel until her sweetheart gave her a Lladró Cinderella and said, "You will always be my Cinderella of magical enchantment."<br><br>Thank you, Pat. You are enchanting to us too.<br><h2><b>Love is Life</b></h2><br>I'm glad Valentine's Day is here right in the middle of this foggy February, with all its sweet sentiments, lovely pink and red hearts, and lacy decorated cards. It seems to come when we are most in need of this time to both give and receive some life-renewing, gentle, warming thoughts of love and living.<br><br>"Love," Emily Dickinson wrote, "is life, and life hath immortality" (Emily Dickinson, "Love VIII"). Though no one ever really knows exactly what is in the poet's mind, there is a special thought suggested here that is universally recognized as truth. Life without love has a peculiar, haunting quality of resignation and stagnation about it. But love is a force which makes life volatile, and the contagion of it sweeps like wildfire from heart to heart. Where love is, life begets life and love begets love, and in all its compounding there is born a quality of immortality.<br><br>For example, think of the very touching scene in the musical<i>Carnival</i>in which Lili--the leading lady--is found high upon the diver's platform. She is very discouraged with life and feels so alone that she has determined to jump to her death.<br><br>The puppeteer sees her up there. He goes behind the puppet-show stand and opens the curtains and begins to talk to her through his puppets. He talks her down from the dangerous height and charms her over to his stand through the puppets. She talks to them and pours out her lonely heart. "No one loves me," she says. And the puppets say, "But, Lili, I love you, I love you. I love you, and I love you." At last Paul comes out and says, "And I love you, Lili."<br><br>And into this poignant setting comes the lovely melody, "Love makes the world go round. Love makes the world go round and round and round." Round and round, generative into immortality.<br><h2><b>A Tender Love Story</b></h2><br>Let me share with you one of my favorite and true love stories. I happened into the story very late in its development. One night I went with my husband to a company dinner party. I sat next to an older man who was there with his wife. She had suffered a stroke, and so consequently he would lean over to cut her meat and help her with her food. His manner was tender and very solicitous. As he finished the meal, he turned toward me with a sigh. I said to him, "You are so good to your wife."<br><br>His reply: "Why shouldn't I be? I love her."<br><br>Then he told me about how they met and about their courtship and their life together. "The first time I saw her," he said, "was at a party in Canada. She was giving a reading. She had long golden curls and wore a beautiful white eyelet dress with a pretty blue satin sash. I was so taken by her that I told my mother that that was the woman I was going to marry. She laughingly indulged me. I went on my mission, and when I came home she was engaged to another. I was asked to take a special assignment by the bishop, and when I protested he told me that if I would always put the work of the Lord first, I would find that the Lord would always take care of me. I made the long trek to Salt Lake City. When I came home, she had broken her engagement. We started to date and then we married."<br><br>His wife rarely accompanied him in public after that dinner. It wasn't long until her condition worsened, and she was completely bedridden and virtually unable to speak. He was a General Authority and went out on his regular conference assignments to visit and counsel the Saints. It was his practice to come home and tell her all about the conference. One day as he finished, he teased: "If you are not going to speak back to me, then I am not going to tell about my experiences. You must not love me any more." Tears welled up in her eyes, and with great effort she rallied enough strength to form the words, "I do love you." It was laborious and extremely slow, but with great effort she got the words out. He determined he would never again treat their love lightly, for the love they knew transcended even the crippling hindrance of her physical impairment.<br><br>At the funeral of this very special woman, Zina Card Brown, every speaker commented on her love both for her sweetheart, President Hugh B. Brown, and for others. Elder Marvin J. Ashton declared: "Some of us are where we are because of her." President Marion G. Romney said: "Wherever she was, she was a loving lady." President N. Eldon Tanner declared that President Brown was successful because of her love. President Kimball said that the love of President and Sister Brown was such that they would soon be together everlastingly. Her love pulled them toward immortality--a beginning of eternity.<br><h2><b>The Doctor of Lennox</b></h2><br>A. J. Cronin wrote about another kind of love when he told of the doctor of Lennox as the most unforgettable character he had ever met. He describes him as "a simple soul who had no wish to dominate an empire, but set out instead to conquer circumstances--and himself."<br><br>Mr. Cronin first knew this doctor as a boy, "small, insignificant, and poor," who hung on to a select band of adventurous youths in the town of Levenford in Scotland by the skin of his teeth--barely accepted by them.<br><br>The boy was lame--so lame that he had to wear a boot with a sole six inches thick. The minister's son called him "Dot and Carry" for the way he limped along as he ran. That was shortened to "Carry."<br><br>Carry was shy, with a smiling, continuing cheerfulness, and this the boys mocked as they ran away from him. Carry's clothes were patched and mended by his mother, "a gaunt little widow of a drunken loafer," who supported herself and her son by scrubbing out shops. Carry supplemented the family income by getting up at five o'clock every morning to deliver milk, and it often made him late for school. The headmaster was more sadistic than sympathetic, and he would embarrass the lad unmercifully--and such public embarrassments brought out Carry's stuttering.<br><br>His mother had set her heart on her son's becoming a minister, and so it was that Carry--who would have preferred the out-of-doors in the woods and the moors with the wild things--found himself studying for the ministry. He who had an unusual knack of healing was at last licensed to "cure souls" according to the kirk of Scotland.<br><br>But his first public sermon was a disaster. His carefully prepared sermon died as the terrible stammer took hold of him. His poor mother mercifully was taken by an apoplectic seizure, and after the funeral Carry disappeared from Levenford.<br><br>Carry drifted to teaching in a wretched school in the mining district. Next he surfaced as a student of medicine at the age of thirty. After his medical training he disappeared again.<br><br>At length Mr. Cronin and another of his boyhood friends--now a member of Parliament and a professor of anatomy--went to the Highlands for a holiday of fishing in the little town of Lennox.<br><br>Let me quote now from Mr. Cronin's article:<br><br><i>The food at our inn was vile and the landlady a scrawny shrew. It was something of a satisfaction when, two days after our arrival, she slipped on the taproom floor and damaged her kneecap. Perfunctorily, we two renegades from the healing art offered our assistance. But the dame would have none of us. No one would suit her but her own village doctor, of whose skill and notable achievements she drew such an enthusiastic picture that my friend glanced at me and smiled.</i><br><br><i>An hour later the practitioner arrived, black bag in hand, with all the quick assurance of a busy man. In no time he had silenced the patient with a reassuring word and reduced the dislocation with a sure, deft touch. Only then did he turn toward us. . . . It was Carry. But not the shy, shabby, stammering Carry of old. He had the quietly confident air of a man established and secure. In a flash of recognition he greeted us warmly, and pressed us to come to supper at his home. Meanwhile, he had an urgent case to attend.</i><br><br>The two men went to his home with an "odd expectancy." They found Carry had a wife "fresh and pretty as her own countryside." There were children also, two girls and a little boy.<br><br><i>Downstairs Carry joined us with two other guests. Now, at his own table, he was a man poised and serene, holding his place as host with quiet dignity. His friends, both men of substance, treated him with deference. Less from what he said than what was said by others, we gathered the facts. His practice was wide and scattered. His patients were country folk, canny, silent, hard to know. Yet somehow he had won them. Now as he went through the village the women would run to him, babes in arms, to consult him in the roadway. Such times he never bothered about fees. More than enough came his way, and at New Year there was always a string of presents on his doorstep, a brace of ducks, a goose, a clutch of new-laid eggs, in handsome settlement for some quite forgotten service.</i><br><br>But there were other tales--of midnight vigils when in some humble home the battle for human life was waged: a child, choking with diphtheria; a plowman stricken with pneumonia; a shepherd's wife in painful labor--all to be sustained, comforted, exhorted, brought back haltingly, their hands in his, from the shadows.<br><br><i>The doctor was a force now, permeating the whole countryside, wise and gentle, blending the best of science and nature, unsparing, undemanding, loving this work he had been born to do. Conscious of the place that he had won in the affections of the people, a man who had refused defeat and won through to victory at last.</i>[A. J. Cronin, "The Doctor of Lennox,"<i>Reader's Digest Twentieth-Anniversary Anthology,</i>1941]<br><br>Love was life for Carry. His love literally meant life to others and for him a renewed life.<br><h2><b>Giving and Receiving Love</b></h2><br>There is something in the love that President Brown offered to his wife and she gave back to him that is very like the love the doctor of Lennox offered the people of his Scottish town and the love they gave back to him. Both first gave and then received love.<br><br>It is this love of which the scriptures speak. It is the eternal life-giving force, which permeates the universe and governs the heavens and the earth. It makes the weak strong and lifts people over and through the great boulders of difficulties which fall in our paths from time to time.<br><br>During the last week of his earthly ministry, the Lord Jesus Christ was approached for the third time by the Pharisees in an attempt to confound him. One of them--a lawyer--asked:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:36–40]<br><h2><b>Love One Another</b></h2><br>This is the same teaching that has been given in each dispensation. Over and over again in every period of time, the Lord has repeated this core instruction to his children. Sometimes he says, "If you do not have love, then it doesn't matter what else you know or do." At other times he says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." But always he stresses that the very heart of the gospel is to love God and man. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35).<br><br>After spending a lifetime studying and writing about men and events, Will Durant, the famous historian, was ninety-two when he was asked by a reporter what he could say that would distill more than two thousand years of history into one simple sentence.<br><br>The message Mr. Durant chose was "Love one another. My final lesson of history is the same as that of Jesus."<br><br>Durant added with a laugh, "You may think that's a lot of lollipop but just try it. Love is the most practical thing in the world. If you take an attitude of love toward everybody you meet, you'll eventually get along" (Pam Proctor, "Durants on History from the Ages, with Love,"<i>Parade,</i>6 August 1978, p. 12).<br><br>It is interesting to read the references to love in the scriptures and to find that the Lord explains that to love God is simply to do good and kind things to his children. The way the Lord explains how to love another is actively to do good to all.<br><br>Could it mean then that you should seek those new students right here at BYU "who hunger and thirst" for friendship? A smile? A cheery hello? Catching up and walking to class with another student who happens to be going your way?<br><br>Could there be those here who have less than desirable circumstances in their lives as they struggle to obtain their education? Could you reach out to them? Could you take the time to really know each other in your family home evening groups, know them individually, their wants, and needs, and goals? Could you be responsive to them?<br><br>Could the prison of which Christ speaks be walls of one's own making that would crumble with your kind words or listening ears?<br><br>Could a thoughtful note be sent to those who make the grounds beautiful, have facilities clean and ready for meetings--security, Food Services, or those who are employed by Personnel? Could a word about your eagerness to learn be conveyed to your teachers? Perhaps it could mean the difference between routine or royal presentations.<br><br>If you would give love, you must be appreciative, long-suffering, patient, kind, humble.<br><br>And what are the qualities you need if you receive love? Openness, receptivity, vulnerability, and humility.<br><br>Are they practical? Can we really incorporate all of the laws of love given by Jesus in today's world? It's a question often asked. The answer is an individual commitment of faith and love. These commandments are practical day-to-day guides to our behavior if we will determine to make our own actions conform to them.<br><h2><b>Love Unlooses Great Powers</b></h2><br>Really loving people hasn't been tried very often in the world of international relations, and it's rare even in the world of national affairs. But at least one very notable experience comes to mind. Gandhi was the man who led India to her independence. Many have seen the film recently made of his life.<br><br>Remember how he began to realize that turning the other cheek and doing good for hateful deeds would unloose great powers for his people? One distraught Moslem man came to him in his suffering. His son had been killed by the Hindus; in retaliation he took the life of a small Hindu boy. Heavyhearted, he sought relief from Gandhi. And Gandhi told him he could find comfort if he would find an orphaned Hindu boy and raise him as his own . . . only he was to raise him as a Hindu--not as a Moslem. There is a sacrificing in love--a sacrificing that brings immortality. Gandhi suffered a great deal, but ultimately millions of people were granted more freedom. Only the assassin's bullet cut his life short. One wonders what he might have contributed further to sacrifice and vulnerability in the development of the new nation had he lived.<br><h2><b>Love and Serve His Children</b></h2><br>One evening, as I conversed with President Harold B. Lee, I said to him, "President Lee, you seem different someway."<br><br>He smiled and said, "You know what it is, don't you?" I shook my head and said that I really didn't know. Then he shared with me this remarkable experience, saying:<br><br>"After I became the President of the Church, I thought a great deal about what the Lord wanted me to do. One night, while I was sleeping, President McKay came to me in a dream. He pointed his finger and looked at me with those piercing eyes of his, as only President McKay could do, and he said, 'If you would serve the Lord, you must love and serve his children.' I awakened with a compelling desire to learn all I could about love that I might serve the Lord."<br><br>He went on to say, "After I had read everything the scriptures had to say about love, I began to put into practice all that I had gleaned from my study. That's what you can feel. It is my newfound ability to truly love and serve his children."<br><br>I watched President Lee a little more closely that night and noted that not one person who came to the table to shake his hand left without receiving a special word of encouragement or an extra question that indicated the concern of the Prophet. No one went away without seeing his smile or hearing his words of love.<br><br>I have thought of his wonderful example many times as the years have come and gone. President Lee is not with us now, but the spirit of that love which he exemplified still lives in my memory. He has helped me to understand what Orson Pratt meant when he said, "The Children of Zion love in proportion to the heavenly knowledge which they have received; for love keeps pace with knowledge, and as the one increases so does the other; and when knowledge is perfected, love will be perfected also" ("Celestial Marriage,"<i>The Seer,</i>October 1853, p. 156). We see this process, also, in the life of our beloved Prophet Spencer W. Kimball. Love was part of his life long before he became the President of the Church.<br><h2><b>"I Love People"</b></h2><br>A stake president in Logan, Utah, kept a guest book, and after he passed away, that book was given to his son. When the son thumbed through the pages, he was very impressed with the signatures that were there. Most of the General Authorities had signed the book. One entry he saw was:<br><br><i>Name: Spencer W. Kimball</i><br><br><i>Date: 1954</i><br><br><i>Position or title: Apostle</i><br><br><i>Hobby: "I love people."</i><br><br>He thumbed through many more pages, and then he saw an almost identical entry ten years later:<br><br><i>Name: Spencer W. Kimball</i><br><br><i>Date: 1964</i><br><br><i>Position: Apostle</i><br><br><i>Hobby: "I love people."</i><br><br>We all know President Kimball is a man of love. He thinks of love as a way to overcome even unknown offenses. Such an incident occurred with one of his neighbors who would go out and talk to President Kimball whenever he saw him in the yard. Then one day the neighbor's wife said, "You mustn't do that. The only time President Kimball is alone is when he is in the yard, and then you go over and impose yourself upon him."<br><br>After that the neighbor stayed in and just watched President Kimball through the window. A few weeks passed before President Kimball rang the doorbell of the neighbor and handed him a casserole.<br><br>"What's this for?" the neighbor asked.<br><br>"I don't know," replied President Kimball. "I've come to make amends for whatever I've done to offend you. You never come and talk to me any more, so I decided I must have done something wrong."<br><br>It is President Kimball who has lovingly explained to us that the Lord whispers to our hearts to go and do, and in this way he answers the fervent prayers of others. President Kimball says the Lord has chosen this method of answering prayers because he knows it is the way we will learn most effectively to give love.<br><h2><b>Compassionate Service</b></h2><br>I feel certain that such was the case cited by President S. Dilworth Young in his memorable address entitled, "By Love, Serve One Another."<br><br>"Once," President Young said, "when I was responsible for an invalid [it was his first wife], a good woman announced, 'I am coming to your house every Friday night from six until ten. You can count on it, so plan to go at six and find relief for those four hours.' How blessed she was to me! How good! She blessed both me and the invalid by new cheer, new smiles, new ideas."<br><br>Another example came to me in my office by way of a letter from the Medford Oregon Stake, which I will quote:<br><br><i>I always thought I knew what compassionate service was. I've heard enough about it, and I've been involved in it myself from time to time. I even introduced young girls to it and watched with pleasure how it changed their lives. I never thought it was . . . a big deal when I was asked to help taking in meals, tending children, doing something to help. I often felt guilty reporting any compassionate service hours because it seemed as if I had done so little, and usually I received happiness from it.</i><br><br><i>Fifteen months ago I was stricken with a muscle degenerating disease, and I have spent eleven and a half months as a hospital patient. Now compassionate service means so much to me. Oh, believe me, it's no little thing . . . for the "little" things that people do for others are generally mountainous to the receiver. Compassionate service means love to me now.</i><br><br><i>It is the hug and kiss from the tender heart of one who hasn't seen you for some time, who truly misses you. It's the one who can't control her tears when she sees you in pain. Compassionate service is the love of one who senses your need for companionship, so she sits quietly and holds your hand until you fall asleep. It's the one who telephones on her lunch hour just to say, " I love you, and I'm praying for you." Oh, yes, and it's the one who brings you a bulletin from church each week because she knows how lonesome you are for those brothers and sisters you love.</i><br><br><i>Compassionate service that used to be such a small thing now is one of the biggest things in my day. Having someone stay with me each day for a period of time often makes the sisters feel guilty if I don't have something for them to do. You see, they don't have any idea how much just being with them means to me. I know they put off duties, sometimes even urgent ones, just to listen when I need to talk. They come to see me faithfully and bring so much cheerfulness into the room that it's impossible to be discouraged. Their compassionate service includes "little" things like being alert enough to help me move my legs when it's an obvious struggle, without making me ask for help. That saves me some of my self-respect. It's also using a tissue to dry my tears and then pretending not to even notice the tears. Again, that often helps me keep my self-respect. Then on other occasions, it comes in the gentle persuasion that lets me cry and get it all out.</i><br><br><i>See what small, insignificant things make up compassionate service? Small and insignificant? Only to the loving one on the giving end. I speak from experience when I say there's nothing small about the love that accompanies compassionate service to the receiver.</i><br><br>The compassionate service which is rendered is the evidence of things not seen. It means that we actually believe in the teachings of Jesus. Since its beginning, Relief Society has tried to carry out the sacred charge to do the work that Jesus did, and so the Relief Society story is a story of love with a myriad of instances of organized compassionate service throughout the wards and branches, stakes and districts of the Church.<br><br>I was recently made aware of two visiting teachers who did all of the grocery shopping for an invalid sister for over a year. Then when she needed to have her blood pressure taken daily, they assumed the responsibility willingly.<br><br>In another ward the Relief Society sisters were organized to supplement the time that the husband was out of the home and unable to care for his wife, a native of Thailand, whose English language skills were very limited. She had a disease that attacked every organ of her body. The sisters learned to use the respirator. They bathed her, combed her hair, brushed her teeth, and cleaned her house and prepared her meals as well. I heard this woman cry words of gratitude for the love and patience of those who served her.<br><h2><b>A Force for Good</b></h2><br>But often the love of Relief Society sisters goes beyond the fundamental caring for the individual, as it does when young Relief Society sisters trained here at BYU become a force for good throughout the world. I have seen former student Relief Society officers and teachers in positions of leadership and service throughout the Church--here in the center stakes of Zion and in some far away corners of the earth.<br><br>In these leadership roles they are carrying out the great traditions of our sisterhood. They are living the motto of Relief Society, "Charity never faileth." In reality they are tending to the needs of those they serve.<br><br>After the first year of the Relief Society's existence, Eliza R. Snow, the secretary, wrote: "We hope the ladies of the society will feel encouraged to renew their exertions, knowing that the blessings of the poor are resting upon them. We feel assured from what has passed under our personal observation, that many during the inclemency of the winter were not only relieved, but preserved from famishing through their instrumentality. More has been accomplished than our most sanguine anticipations predicted, and through the assistance and blessings of God, what may we not hope for the future?" (<i>Times and Seasons</i>4:287).<br><br>We now are in that future of which they spoke. The work of love in that one little band of women is being carried forth in ten thousand bands of women in 82 countries. Like those sisters before, they are teaching the concepts of love and of charity and urging individuals to give love.<br><br>They are organizing long-term programs of assistance to each other as need arises and giving sustenance to neighbors, and they are teaching the life-giving concepts.<br><br>Early in my administration, a Relief Society group from one of the BYU wards came to my office and presented me with a long scroll on which were listed the names of those who had completed the New Testament, the adult scripture reading course for that year. That Relief Society unit had determined that they would not only commit themselves to completing the Church reading assignment; they would live it and make it a part of their lives. They wept as they told me that one girl who wanted very much to participate was blind, and so each member of their Relief Society unit took a turn reading the scriptures to her so that she could participate in the project.<br><br>Another girl became ill, and so they all helped her keep up with her class assignments so that she could do that and read the scriptures as well.<br><br>They identified a second list and said so many problems came up that this group was not able to finish the scripture reading by the date they had set, but they said, "You can be assured that they will complete it and that they are living what they are learning."<br><h2><b>The Love Which Jesus Taught Us</b></h2><br>There is great value in combining the efforts of Relief Society members to go beyond theory into life-enriching experiences.<br><br>The love which makes the world have life is the love which Jesus taught us. It creates life in marriages. Life in families. Life in neighborhoods, communities, nations, and the world. We must love the Lord, trust in his word, love and trust in immortality.<br><br>The little things we do for each other brings tenderness and joy into our day-to-day lives. They make life worth living.<br><br>The loving things we do for those who have spitefully used us bring even more love into our lives. They stop the perpetuation of hate and add to the component of good. The power of love is generative.<br><br>I think my young son understood this when he was only three.<br><br>One morning I stepped to our back door to see the children off to school. Our little three-year-old son followed the children to the edge of the yard and watched them as they cut across the grass of a newly moved-in neighbor. Enraged, the neighbor called out, "Don't you kids ever cut across my lawn; don't you dare step one foot on it again." He couldn't see me, but I could surely hear him, and so could every other mother that was out to see her child off to school.<br><br>As sweetly as three-year-olds can talk, ours turned to this angry neighbor and said, "You can step on our lawn if you want to." The next day that neighbor came out with a big smile and a darling teddy bear, and gave it to our little son. There was never again a problem over that lawn.<br><br>Receive love. Let others step on our lawn. Open ourselves to receive another.<br><h2><b>Give Us the Perfect Way</b></h2><br>Perhaps you will remember the story of Corrie ten Boom, a fifty-year-old spinster who became a militant heroine of the anti-Nazi underground during World War II. The book is called<i>The Hiding Place.</i>It describes "an extraordinary adventure in Christian courage." Certainly I found it to be just that.<br><br>I would like to share with you two examples of how love worked in her life to help her do good when she had been extremely ill used.<br><br>The first time was when she was a young woman in Holland. She was very much in love and had thought her love was returned. But then one day the young man came to her door with another young woman. He wanted to introduce Corrie to his fiancée. The family rallied around to help her face this crisis. After the young couple left, Corrie fled to her bedroom where she lay sobbing. Then she writes:<br><br><i>Later, I heard father's footsteps coming up the stairs. For a moment I was a little girl again waiting for him to tuck the blankets tight. But this was a hurt that no blanket could shut out, and suddenly I was afraid of what father would say. . . . Of course he did not say the false, idle words.</i><br><br><i>"Corrie," he began instead, "Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain.</i><br><br><i>"There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill the love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or, Corrie, we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel. . . . Whenever we cannot love in the old, human way, Corrie, God can give us the perfect way."</i><br><br>Later, after the terrifying experiences of a wartime Nazi concentration camp, she found herself face to face with one of the S.S. guards.<br><br><i>It was at a church service in Munich. He was the man who had stood guard at the shower room door in the processing center at Ravensbruck. He was the first of our actual jailers that I had seen since that time.</i><br><br>And suddenly it was all there--the roomful of mocking men, the heaps of clothing, her sister Betsie's pain-blanched face.<br><br><i>He came up to me as the church was emptying, beaming and bowing. "How grateful I am for your message, Fraulien," he said. "To think that as you say, he has washed my sins away!"</i><br><br><i>His hand was thrust out to shake mine. And I, who had preached so often to the people in Bloemendaal the need to forgive, kept my hand at my side.</i><br><br><i>Even as the angry, vengeful thoughts boiled through me, I saw the sin of them. Jesus Christ had died for this man; was I going to ask for more? "Jesus," I prayed, "forgive me and help me to forgive him."</i><br><br><i>I tried to smile, I struggled to raise my hand. I could not. I felt nothing, not the slightest spark of warmth or charity. And so again I breathed a silent prayer. "Jesus, I cannot forgive him. Give me your forgiveness."</i><br><br><i>As I took his hand, the most incredible thing happened. From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand a current seemed to pass from me to him, while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me.</i><br><br><i>And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world's healing hinges, but on his. When he tells us to love our enemies, he gives, along with the command, love itself.</i>[Corrie ten Boom,<i>The Hiding Place</i>(Old Tappan, N.J.: Fleming H. Reveil Co., 1972), pp. 44-45, 238]<br><h2><b>Her Thoughtful Ways</b></h2><br>I've known great love in my marriage, with my children, and as the president of the Relief Society, and I grew up in a loving family who looked forward to the occasional visits of one of my mother's older cousins whom we called Aunt Lillian. She had been a teacher in the public school system for more than thirty years. We were entranced as we listened to her tell of the problems she had as a teacher with disruptive students and of those in the school system who made a great impact for good upon the life she lived alone.<br><br>One day she invited me to her apartment to help her entertain the young daughter of a schoolteacher friend. Everything was meticulously prepared for us--the food she served and all of her surroundings. Her thoughtful ways evidenced a life-style of noble living. I was deeply impressed with the love she showed both of us that day, and it continued year after year for me.<br><br>When she was seventy years old, she bought her first car, a beautiful, brand-new blue Plymouth, and she took driving lessons. When she got her license, she decided to drive to California to visit her sister and invited me to go along to keep her company. I was then about twelve years old. I was so excited. I'd only been to Wyoming and felt that if I went to California, I'd become a world traveler. However, because she was such an inexperienced driver, I saw very little other than the road and other cars and was frightened most of the time. But we arrived safely and enjoyed our time with the family members I hadn't known before.<br><br>She always gave so much of herself to make me happy. This giving continued on through my growing years and even when I married. Doug and I decided to name our second daughter after her. Her love was showered upon me and upon all my children. At Christmastime she would bring them lovely gifts. She knew the value of good books and beautiful flowers and people. She often tended my children and gave them a love for these things. All those years I was the recipient of her love. And the day came when I was able to have her with us, do for her, and ease some of her lonely hours. I received so much--more love and enrichment to my life because of her.<br><br>That, you see, is what love is. It is the investiture, the immersing ourselves in the lives of others and watching that change us and our surroundings.<br><br>Because of her I know that love is the life-giving force which renews the spirit of men and women and brings a new life to the world, a life that brings a longing for immortality.<br><br>She helped me understand the French scientist, Teilhard de Chardin, who is quoted as saying: "Someday, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity, we will harness for God the energies of love: and then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire." How wondrous!<br><br>On this day of love may each one of us think of love as the great and powerful force that it is. May we take his teachings about love very literally and work at mastering the skill of giving and receiving love. Love is the force by which<i>we</i>can renew the world. "Love is life, and life hath immortality." I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, whose love is wondrous. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Barbara B. Smith was president of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 14 February 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> Ye Shall Find - Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. It is a delight to stand in your company and feel of your marvelous spirit again. I appreciate President Holland's thoughtful obituary. I couldn't help but think of an experience I had some years ago in traveling through an old Boston cemetery. Back in those days they used to place on tombstones little inscriptions called epitaphs. I remember that, as I walked through the cemetery, I was greeted by one headstone that simply said, "Here lies John Yeast; pardon me for not rising." Not far away was one with this inscription: "Here lies my beloved husband, Tom Morgan. May he rest in peace 'til we meet again." There is another not far away like unto it: "I placed my wife beneath this stone for her repose and for my own." I always enjoyed this one: "Here lies Solomon Pease. Pease is not here, only the pod. Pease shelled out and went home to God." Way to the back of the cemetery is one that makes you think: "Here lies John Koncupott, may God be as good to him as he would be if he were God and God were John Koncupott." In Arizona there is a tombstone that reads, "Here lies Les Moore, he took four slugs from a forty-four, no less, no more." I think one of the classic tombstones of all time is the one that simply read, "I told you I was sick."<br><br>Well, I come as your friend, and I am delighted to be here. I always speak here with some fear and trembling because Latter-day Saints have a habit of keeping you very humble.<br><br>A few weeks ago I attended stake conference (I won't mention where because you are all related to somebody), and while I was there, the stake president wondered if I would make a stop in with the Primary. I am always delighted to do that. Children are delightful, as you know; they don't really care who you are. As we made our way back to the Primary conference, startling some of the workers as we entered, I struggled to get into one of those little chairs. The Primary coordinator called the meeting to order. We sang some Primary songs that you are all familiar with; then she invited a little four-year-old girl to come up to pray. I'll never forget that prayer. She kind of wobbled up as little girls do, and the Primary worker turned her around and placed her hands on the little girl's shoulders and whispered to her, "Would you like me to help you pray?"<br><br>The little girl said, "I can do it myself." She folded her little arms, and this is what she said: "Dear Heavenly Father, please bless President Kimball and all of his impossibles." The stake president leaned over to me and said, "I guess we know where you fit." Well, thank God for little children.<br><br>As I drove down here this morning, little patches of fog occurred, and I couldn't help but think, as I came onto this campus, how grateful I am for the light and the knowledge and the direction we have. It doesn't matter what the fog of life is; here you learn to perceive the truth and understand it.<br><br>I couldn't help but think of one other little experience. Maybe you know the story about the Navy commander who sailed his ship out into the harbor one foggy morning. As they were heading out to sea, his signalman came and said, "We're on collision course with a light."<br><br>The commander then directed the signalman to send the following message, "On collision course. Move ten degrees right."<br><br>The signal came back, "Confirmed. We are on collision course. You move ten degrees right."<br><br>The Navy commander with his rank was a little incensed. He sent back this message, "I am a full Navy commander. You move tend degrees right."<br><br>The message came back, "I am a signalman second class. You move ten degrees right."<br><br>Finally the commander sent this message, "I am in a battleship. You move ten degrees right."<br><br>The signal came back that said, "I am in a lighthouse. You move ten degrees right." I have always felt that this great university is truly a lighthouse unto the world, and I salute you and compliment you here.<br><br>I have an opportunity as an officer of the Church to travel much of the world. It is exciting, it is interesting, and it is challenging. Quite frequently, as we go to and fro--and once in a while even in the ranks of our own people--you will hear the comment, "Boy, the world is sure going to the dogs." Think about that for a minute. I couldn't help but pull from my notebook this little statement by an unknown author:<br><br><i>My granddad, viewing this earth's worn cogs,</i><br><i>Said, "Things are going to the dogs."</i><br><i>His granddad in his house of logs</i><br><i>Said, "Things are certainly going to the dogs."</i><br><br><i>His granddad in the Flemish bogs</i><br><i>Said, "Things are going to the dogs."</i><br><i>His granddad in the old skin togs</i><br><i>Said, "Things are going to the dogs."</i><br><br><i>There is one thing that I have to state:</i><br><i>The dogs have had a good long wait.</i><br><h2><b>A Wonderful Time to Be Alive</b></h2><br>I am here as one of the witnesses of our Lord to declare that that time has not yet arrived. I think that you have a great future. I want to assure you that, with all the ups and downs in the world today, what you are doing here in preparation for life is essential. I am one of your great fans who is cheering you on as you make necessary and marvelous preparation.<br><br>I have often thought, as I have watched young people like you everywhere in the Church, what a wonderful time it is to be alive and to know what an impact you are having. Can you think of a better time to be alive? If you could select a particular generation right now, if you had the choice to choose the time in which you would be a young adult or a more mature adult, which era would you choose? Think about it. Would you go back to some of the generations that we represent? I was a teenager and a young adult in the forties. Would that thrill you? You think the world looks bleak today? You should have seen it in the forties.<br><br>I want to talk to you a little bit about that, not so much about the forties but about what you are, where you are, and the future that lies before you. Quite often General Authorities of the Church are sought after for counsel and direction by young people everywhere, both in and out of the Church. If you and I had an opportunity for a few moments to sit one-on-one--and I would like that, I really would--here are four things I think I might share with you as you contemplate your present circumstances and think about the future.<br><h2><b>Heavenly Offspring</b></h2><br>The first point I think I might want to discuss with you would be the fact that you are literally an offspring of heavenly parents--you really are!--and you came into mortality to succeed. There isn't a failure among you. Failure is simply an outgrowth of lack of confidence or understanding. I am here as your friend to testify that you have brilliance and divinity within you. It is being tested. It always has been and always will be. Could I just suggest that, as you plan for the future, you consider very seriously what the Lord has already instilled in you? A lot of young people say, "I'm not sure what I want to do in life." This is, of course, a time to ponder that and experiment a little bit. The Lord has already told you in part.<br><br>Let me ask you a few questions. What are your desires? What are you good at? What comes usually quite easily for you? What do you enjoy doing most? What spiritual gifts do you have? Tonight sometime before you retire, would you do yourself a little favor? Read and reread section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It won't take you long, and there you will gain tremendous insight as to the point I am trying to make. For the Lord has blessed you indeed, spiritually, with gifts that are unique and different from those of any other person in the world. You came with blessings earned and talents developed before you entered mortality.<br><br>If we had a classroom arrangement this morning and I asked each one of you to name ten things that you would like to accomplish by your fortieth birthday (I know forty seems like time and all eternity away, but it really isn't), I would be intensely interested in what you would list. In that list you would be telling me the things that you like to do and would be good at. Quite frequently parents will have a tendency to train up a child to take over his or her profession. That may be well and good, and maybe that is what you would like to do, but ponder carefully what unique talents and abilities you have.<br><br>I grew up as a little boy wanting to be an athlete. That was all I could think about. I ate, drank, and slept it. I had a wonderful father who was a businessman. He was in the grocery business. By the time I was a teenager, he had developed a little chain of grocery stores, and he was training his boys to have employment, to have a skill to offer to the world. My older brother didn't want it. He wanted to be a teacher. My younger brother wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be an athlete. I had a father who was wise enough not to pressure or force each boy into a given slot. He said, "I have developed these stores so that you would always have a skill. If you don't want it, I will sell all the stores." And he did, that quick. Each boy went on to pursue his own profession, but we have been trained in something we can fall back on.<br><br>What a wonderful parent to think of the unique needs of his sons rather than merely fulfilling his desire! Ponder these things; seek the counsel of your parents, wise bishops, leaders, and friends in whom you have trust.<br><h2><b>Patriarchal Blessings</b></h2><br>Point number two, if you don't already have it, secure your patriarchal blessing. Do it with spiritual orientation and understanding and preparation. I always like to think of a patriarchal blessing as your personal scripture because the Lord is revealing to you and me those things that are potentially good and great in our lives, and it can all be fulfilled if we meet certain qualifications and conditions.<br><br>At the risk of embarrassing me a little bit, could I tell you a personal story? When I was a young teenager wanting to pursue the athletic field, I was moving along with relative ease with some accomplishment. The time came when I signed a professional contract. Unfortunately world conditions were much more serious than they are now. The rest of the world was engaged in a conflict, and then the enemy struck us. It became necessary in that year to lower the draft age to eighteen. I turned eighteen the very month they lowered it. Now how is that for timing? They had a big drawing in Washington to see which number would go first. Do I have to tell you whose number they picked? And instead of going into the field of my great desire, I ended up going into the military. I wasn't a bad boy, but I left a little bit to be desired, I'm sure, in the hearts of my parents.<br><br>My dad, upon learning that I was to be in that first eighteen-year-old draft, called me to his side and said, "Paul, you haven't yet received your patriarchal blessing. Would you do that?" He gave me a little spiritual preparation, and, being typical at that age, I said, "Yeah, I'll go do it." I went and got the necessary recommends and on the appointed day made preparation to go down to have the blessing. My dad made one other suggestion. He said, "Maybe you would like to fast and pray about it before you go." Well, to fast one meal in those days for me was monumental, and somehow I got through one meal, prayed a little bit about certain concerns I had regarding the future, and then drove down to the stake center.<br><br>Old Brother George Wride, Los Angeles stake patriarch, was there to receive me. He was in his eighties, white haired, and kind of wobbly. Now, do you know what an eighty-year-old man looks like to a teenager? I thought I was being blessed by Abraham. He came out of the office to get my recommend, and he wasn't too surefooted. I thought, "Boy, this will be something."<br><br>He took my recommend, ushered me into the office, had me sit down, and pulled up a chair so that we were pretty close to each other. I think he had one foot in that office and the other foot in heaven. Then he gave me a very thorough interview, and after about twenty minutes (I'd never seen him before except at a distance. I'm not sure he knew who I was other than another teenage boy coming through the ranks), he stood up, came around behind me, and put his hands on my head. He called me by name, declared my lineage, and then he paused. I'll never forget that. He said, "Now concerning the future. Thou shalt experience combat. Angels shall intercede in thy behalf and protect thee all the days of thy life, and thou shalt live to testify to all the nations of the world that Jesus is the Christ." He continued to tell me some very personal things, and I ask that you pardon me for not sharing them here. All of it was in concert with the desires of my heart that I had expressed as I knelt as a teenager to pray to God.<br><br>Well, I went home after that, and even I was impressed. You know how parents are, kind of anxious about what happens to their kids. When I walked in the door, my dad said, "What did he say? What did he say?" I said, "I don't know; he had angels flying around." Two weeks later, my blessing came in the mail. My father, as a young man just married, taught at this institution when it was at the lower campus. He taught typing, shorthand, and penmanship. At age 64, the year he died, he could type 125 words per minute on a conventional typewriter. The blessing came in the mail, and unbeknownst to me he had gone out and purchased a waterproof wallet. He sat down at the typewriter: "Tap, tap, tap," and there was a new copy of my blessing. He put it in the wallet, handed it to me, and said, "Now, take it with you and read it."<br><br>I'm embarrassed to tell you. I went off to war, and, during ten months of training in the United States, I didn't even open it. Then I was shipped to Hawaii and had three months of jungle training. Then one morning at 4:00 a.m. they came unannounced to load us up on troopships, and out we went with a great mass of ships to a destination we didn't know at that time.<br><br>Three weeks later we were out in a harbor where the Navy was pounding the beach. You've seen enough movies on that to understand a little about it. The night before the invasion we were issued live ammunition. Now all of a sudden the previous year's training came into focus. We didn't go below the deck that night because we were all a little frightened, wondering what would happen. I had just had my nineteenth birthday. The next morning I was assigned to the seventh boat team, the seventh wave, as we called it. We started to load into the landing craft at about 0500, and 0600 in the morning was to be H-hour on that D-day.<br><br>I don't know if you understand the challenges of getting into one of those boats. It was interesting. The deck where we were standing was four stories above the water, and the water that morning was pretty rough. We were experiencing forty-foot swells. We were trying to get into what was called a landing craft vehicle--personnel (LCVP) that held about thirty infantrymen. The boat was out about thirty or forty feet from the ship itself, rising and dropping about thirty or forty feet. When you came down on one of those cargo nets, you had to drop precisely as the boat came up because you didn't want to miss (keep in mind each of us had a twenty-pound pack, a ten-pound rifle, a five-pound helmet, and thirty-five pounds of ammunition). If you missed the boat, the harbor was about four hundred feet deep, and you wouldn't come up very readily. And so it made a whole lot of difference in how we got down into one of those crafts on a cargo net, with all those characters above us stepping on our fingers as we went down.<br><br>From the time we arrived in the harbor until just a few seconds before H-hour, the Navy was pounding the beach. The noise from the shells was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk when we were sitting next to one another. It was deafening. Pretty soon we started to click off our watches, five minutes before H-hour, four, three, two, one. Exactly as the second hand passed the mark, the Navy just ceased firing. There was total silence out there, thousands of men and nobody making a sound.<br><br>Then a flare goes off, and the first boat team starts in. They have about 2,000 yards to shore. Well, the first boat team goes, and when they are about 1,200 yards from shore the whole beach opens up. I don't know how anybody could stay alive. And one craft after the other is hit, scattering American soldiers in the water. The second flare goes off, and the next boat goes in. The same thing happens to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. Nobody's getting ashore. It makes you ponder and wonder.<br><br>Now it comes time for the seventh wave, and that is mine. The flare goes off, and in goes the boat team. It is kind of eerie sitting there watching that boat go up and down, and you can see the palm trees getting a little bigger. Your heart is pounding, and all of a sudden the whole shoreline opens up, zeroing in on you. Now it is H-hour plus one, and the tide is starting to come out. It exposes a large coral reef, and our LCVP can't get over it. The boat sticks on the coral reef.<br><br>The Navy crew gets excited. They drop the front of the boat and say, "Get out of here; you're drawing fire!" We jump into the water. The water is chest high. You have to hold your rifle over your head. If the muzzle drops in the water, the salt water will make it blow up on you when you fire. Did you ever try to run in water up to your chest when you were loaded down? You don't move very fast. And the enemy starts to pick you up. You are pushing aside with the butt of your rifle the dead and wounded bodies of the friends and associates you have been training with. The coral is so sharp it cuts the boots off your feet, and your feet are starting to bleed like mincemeat. You are trying to get ashore.<br><br>I was one of the first ashore that morning, and I dug my first foxhole with my fingernails. Just as I crawled into that mucky hole an ambu gun opened up. It shoots about seven hundred rounds a minute. A round went down my right arm and took off my identification bracelet. I rolled over and started to talk to my Heavenly Father, and he answered me. I have never been the same since.<br><br>As we secured the beach that morning, I reached into my pocket and took out that wallet my father had prepared and read what the Lord had said, "Angels shall intercede in thy behalf and protect thee all the days of thy life, and thou shalt live many years and testify to the people of the world that Jesus is the Christ." Imagine that being given to a nineteen-year-old out there!<br><br>Get your blessings, young people. Ponder them. They are not all perfectly clear. It is exciting for me now, at this stage of my life, to read into mine what the Lord said when I was a teenager and to see the fulfillment of those promises and blessings.<br><br>Take the time to couple the desires, the interests, the blessings, and the talents you have with what the Lord is telling you in your blessing. They go hand in hand--they really do.<br><h2><b>Seek Counsel</b></h2><br>The third point I think I would want to talk to you about is--and I wish we had a lot of time to talk about it--seek the counsel and advice of those you respect and honor and love and appreciate, whatever your goal or aspirations are in life. I think it is one of the most untapped resources available to young people in the world today.<br><br>I'm not here to suggest for a minute what you ought to do. I don't know. But I feel that we could talk and sift a little bit and get some kind of meaningful direction. Maybe you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, an architect, a designer. Who knows? You do, and the Lord does. I would certainly seek out the counsel of those, both members and nonmembers, who could give me the kind of direction and understanding I needed.<br><br>When I attended the university some years ago, I noticed the national pastime before me: young people shifting their majors. Good grief! The average college student when I was in college shifted his major four times in four years. Does that tell you anything? Why not take the time before you get here to see honestly what direction you want to go? How many times I have sat in counsel with a man who went into engineering when he really wanted to be a doctor? Or how about a man who thought he wanted to be a ballplayer until the pro sport became a part of his life and wasn't what he thought it was? Now is the time to sift and seek. Maybe what you have in mind is exactly what you ought to do. I don't know.<br><br>Occasionally I represent the Church in kind of a fun assignment. I play in a lot of golf tournaments as kind of a public relations thing. I was down in North Carolina a few years ago playing in a tournament with some of the prestigious athletes of our country, and I happened to be for a time with a fellow by the name of Willie Mays, former outfielder for the San Francisco and New York Giants, a Hall of Famer, a great, great guy. I pitched against Willie Mays as he broke into baseball and I was passing from the scene. If you ever want a lesson in humility, he can teach it. We were talking about old times and how the game had changed. Keep in mind that he was one of the greatest right-handed hitters the game has ever produced. I said to him while we were conversing, "Willie, may I ask you a question?"<br><br>He said, "Certainly."<br><br>I said, "How many Little Leaguers, Babe Ruthers, college, and high school athletes wanting to be ballplayers have come to you personally, have sought you out personally, for what counsel and advice you would give on the art of hitting?"<br><br>He answered, "Nobody."<br><br>And I sat there and said, "What!"<br><br>Here is one of the greatest athletes of all time. You have fifteen million boys trying to break into the major leagues where there are only eight hundred openings, and they haven't even sought the counsel of one of the greatest authorities in the world! Can you imagine how many young men in this Church have had the desire to fulfill a full-time mission and probably never wrote to LeGrand Richards while he was alive to ask, "Just tell me three things, sir, I ought to do to prepare for that great experience"?<br><br>Can you imagine living in the day of Shakespeare, wanting to be a writer and not going to get his counsel? Can you imagine wanting to be an artist and living down the street from Michelangelo and not inquiring? Can you imagine these things? I've noticed that truly great people always have time for you. Little people never do. I don't mean little in stature, I mean little in character and desire to help. Seek the wise counsel and advice in your field, both spiritual and academic, that can help you.<br><h2><b>Seek Heavenly Father</b></h2><br>Fourth, and finally, and probably the most important, cultivate a personal relationship with your Heavenly Father. Seek him in counsel and direction, confirm and verify. Our Heavenly Father has sent you and me here to learn basically how one day to be like him. That is primarily the purpose of mortality. God isn't going to do all our homework for us; that is why we are here. A lot of young people come and say, "Well, Brother Dunn, I pray, and I don't get any answers."<br><br>Then my question is, "How do you pray?" Maybe you are the way my little girls were some years ago. They would want me to do their homework while they watched TV, and a wise father would never do that. He probably would say something like this, "You go study it out. You go do the problems and bring it to me, and I'll tell you if it is right or not." That is paraphrasing, I guess, the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>I don't know who you ought to marry. There are probably ten or fifteen men out there, ladies, who could qualify, or, men, the same for you with the ladies. But the Lord expects you to do a little homework, dating, investigating, and then bring personalities to him.<br><br>I don't know what you ought to do in this life. I'm not sure the Lord would care. It could be any one of ten things, but he expects you and me to think about it and ponder it and study it and experiment with it. Develop a personal relationship with your Heavenly Father and confirm it with him.<br><br>Well, you are marvelous. What a delight to spend some time in your company! I want you to know, as you face the future, that the Lord hasn't left you alone. There are those of us who are in your midst who really know these things to be true. God bless you young people. I love you, I respect you, and I honor you. I pray for your success as you project now into the future. May you know I know these things to be true as I bear witness of our Heavenly Father that he lives, and Jesus the Christ, my Savior, for whom I thank God. I say these things humbly and gratefully as I bear my witness now, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1>anion, the Holy Ghost - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This night I look into the faces of the greatest group of youth assembled in one place on the earth. I plead that our eternal spirits, yours and mine, may be entwined with the Holy Ghost this night in such a way that what I say this hour may be understood through the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Using the Spirit</b></h2><br>You have a tool more helpful than any Apple Macintosh, IBM PC, or Wang computer ever designed. This tool is more exact and more explicit than any book, video, or cassette tape you could read, watch, or listen to. This great tool is the utilization of the Holy Ghost in your life. The Spirit! The Spirit! The Spirit! I would suspect that if there is a lesson that you are to learn at this magnificent institution it is the value of utilizing the Holy Ghost in your life.<br><br>Often we hear, "When I am older I will change," or "Time will take care of everything." Nonsense. It is not time that creates change; it is the Spirit that alters circumstances. Each of us has observed remarkable positive behavioral changes in others--and sometimes in ourselves. When these occur, each comes as a blessing from the Spirit. He is the author of positive change!<br><h2><b>Zion's Camp</b></h2><br>Being a student in college is a great deal like being with Joseph Smith on the historic march of 1834 known as Zion's Camp. A band of people in the Independence, Missouri, area had joined together and demanded that the Saints, those early courageous members, leave Jackson County. There were a number of reasons why the Saints were told to leave. Most of the charges, however, were just trumped-up allegations. Edward Partridge and Charles Allen were tarred and feathered. The store of Gilbert and Whitney was partially demolished, and the printing office in the home of William Phelps was destroyed. Later on, many of our early members had their homes destroyed, and a number of them were beaten with stones and clubs. Word of these atrocities had reached Kirtland, Ohio, and the Prophet sporadically. He did not know all that was going on, but he knew that the situation was serious.<br><br>For several more months the problems continued, with a disorganized exodus from Jackson County fully under way by November 1833. Missouri officials had refused to assist the Saints. Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight arrived in Kirtland on 22 February 1834, bringing the devastating news of the Missouri disaster. Shortly after, Joseph Smith organized Zion's Camp.<br><br>On 1 May 1834 Joseph Smith and part of the party left for Missouri. It was a thousand-mile trek. Men were tossed together during those months in trying circumstances where all that was good or evil in their characters came to the surface. They were under incredible stress.<br><h2><b>Our Nature is Revealed</b></h2><br>As challenges come to us during periods of stress or pressure, such as times of war, natural disaster, the death of a loved one, academic pressure, athletic contests, or even missions, our nature is revealed to be either noble or not. Zion's Camp served that purpose also. Now, listen carefully; your college experience serves the same purpose. A time of testing and refining is what these months and years are for you.<br><br>Shortly after Zion's Camp, Joseph Smith acknowledged that several of the men had been angry with him when he told them that the group would not cross the river into Jackson County after the long march. After all of those plans, after all of that time, they were not permitted to do what they expected they were going to do. The Prophet said, "But let me tell you, God did not want you to fight." He could not organize his kingdom with twelve men to open the gospel door to nations of the earth, with seventy men under their direction, unless he took them from a body of men who would offer their lives, and who had made as great a sacrifice as had Abraham or Moses. It was a time for him to determine who could endure and lead and serve.<br><br>During the month following Zion's Camp, two new quorums were established: the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Quorum of the Seventy. Most of the men in these two quorums had sacrificed by marching west in the army of Israel that came to western Missouri in 1834. They had proven their mettle just as we must. Brigham Young stated, "I would not exchange the knowledge I have received this season for the whole of Geauga County; for the property and mines of the earth are not to be compared to the worth of knowledge" (<i>JD</i>2:10). That is where he received his graduate degree, not knowing that it would be his responsibility under similar circumstances to lead the Saints westward to the Great Basin kingdom.<br><br>The practical training and instruction that the participants of Zion's Camp experienced were not considered by many as valuable as the spiritual benefits they received. The same is true with college--the greatest value of your college experience should be the enhancement of your spiritual growth.<br><br>Some participants defined Zion's Camp as a failure. For so many others, however, it was the most rewarding, testimony-building, and exciting experience in their lives. Men had died on that trek of malaria and other diseases. There had been bickering and fighting. There had been a great need for cooperation, and sometimes cooperation was not there. But after they had walked those thousand miles, Joseph knew those who would help establish the kingdom during an even more difficult period.<br><h2><b>Make the Holy Ghost your Constant Companion</b></h2><br>The way you can maximize this period in your life is through the Spirit. The logical question you might ask, brothers and sisters, is "How, Elder Pinnock?" There are eight steps as you become proficient in making the Holy Ghost truly your constant companion.<br><h2><b>Understanding the Spirit</b></h2><br>First, seek for an understanding of and an acquaintance with the Spirit. The primitive Church had been going for a number of years when the apostle Paul wrote the Saints at Corinth. He said, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant" (1 Corinthians 12:1). He knew that if the Church was to grow, if they were going to be able to endure, if they were going to understand the heart of the Christian message, it would be through the Holy Spirit.<br><br>He went on to say,<br><br><i>No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</i>[1 Corinthians 12:3–5]<br><br>For the rest of your lives you will be living in wards where one bishop will be serving and then another will be called. Some of you have already had more than one stake president here at Brigham Young University. Some of you have returned from serving in the mission field with perhaps two mission presidents. You have seen already that there is a difference in administration, but the Spirit is the same. Thank goodness that we do tolerate differences in administrations.<br><br><i>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</i><br><br><i>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</i><br><br><i>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</i><br><br><i>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</i><br><br><i>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</i>[1 Corinthians 12:7–11]<br><br>You can read Doctrine and Covenants 46:10–26 and Moroni 10:8–18. But I would pray, brothers and sisters, that each of you, as you become biologists, historians, business people, nurses, and teachers, that you will also become experts in understanding and using the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>Commitment Leads to Surrender</b></h2><br>Second, give commitment, which leads to surrender. After you acquire this working knowledge that all of you have comes that great step of commitment.<br><br>In January of 1961 we were expecting our second child. We already had a son, so we hoped for a daughter. My wife Anne went to the doctor and he became concerned because he could not hear a regular heartbeat and sometimes not a heartbeat at all. As my wife went into labor and we went to the hospital, I waited a particularly long time before the doctor asked me to come and speak with him.<br><br>The cord had been wrapped around our daughter's neck. She had not had an ample supply of blood for a number of hours, perhaps for several days. He gave no promise that she would be normal. I left feeling lonely, frightened, and concerned, with tears streaming down my face. I drove home at three in the morning praying that if our Heavenly Father would let her be normal, all that we had and all that we ever would be would be the Father's.<br><br>I also had an unforgettable spiritual experience when I was seventeen years old the night I received my patriarchal blessing. Several marvelous experiences in the mission field also had turned me toward the Lord, but that night I knew everything was our Heavenly Father's. We named and blessed the daughter of that daughter today.<br><br>Somehow in our lives, brothers and sisters, we must commit ourselves to building the kingdom where suddenly wealth, position, and status do not matter. What matters is that we are part of this great work and have surrendered ourselves to Him.<br><br>In 3 Nephi we read,<br><br><i>And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</i>[3 Nephi 9:20]<br><br>I would like to think that in all of the places in all of the world, that from this geographic location, the Spirit would be felt most of the time. We have no place in all of the world where there is such a concentration of members of the kingdom. Oh, the power that you would have if you could commit yourselves in that way.<br><br>Some of you might say, "Not now. Perhaps later because I have so much to do while I am young." I say to you now that the surrender that comes from commitment will lead to more excitement, finer friends, and will assure you of a magnificent future. "Not my will, but thine be done" (Luke 22:42). Now the Spirit, which is already yours, can function within you. Incidentally, when we discover how commitment and surrender to the Spirit intensify our capability, we find it imperative to commit ourselves worthy elsewhere in our lives. Suddenly in a natural, organized way, we structure our priorities differently than we ever did before. It comes after we have given ourselves to the master.<br><h2><b>Live Righteously</b></h2><br>Of course that leads to the third step: live righteously regardless of how difficult it has been in the past. After surrendering to the Spirit, you will find self-control and peace beyond that which you have ever known.<br><br>A number of you, incidentally, have not asked about our first grandchild. Shame on you! As I look into the face of that little spirit so soon from God, I understand more than ever before how our Heavenly Father and our earthly parents look at you, praying that you will remain pure and good and growing.<br><br>While living under the influence of the Spirit, we discover a built-in reward system that is manifest in many ways. A young woman working at Morton Thiokol, just west of Brigham City, found her eternal mate in an interesting way. A nonmember had moved there from Ohio, met her at work, and had asked her out. She accepted and they went on a date. When she would not cooperate with his sexual advances, he became upset and took her home. The following Monday at work he was joking with other men in his department about how she would not cooperate with him, and how straight she had been. A recently returned missionary who worked there listened to the ribald conversation. Later he went back to the man and asked for the name of the uncooperative date. He told him. She was exactly what he had been looking for. Apparently things went quite well. Four and a half months later they knelt across the altar and were married forever.<br><br>The Savior said of the Holy Spirit, "And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8).<br><h2><b>Be Consistent</b></h2><br>Fourth, be consistent in your righteousness. Remember, you must consider the little things in life just as you must consider the larger issues. Little problems in our behavior can rob us of the Spirit just as serious sins can.<br><br>A coed at a university about fifty miles north of here (I am not going to mention the name of that school) decided that a drink or two would not hurt her. I wish she could have listened to a conversation to which I listened relating to her. Some outstanding young men, fellow students of hers, mentioned they could not take her out because they had seen her bend her elbow drinking a beer or two. Those young men did not consider her as a potential eternal partner because of a little flaw that robbed her of her eternal appeal.<br><br>In another situation a young man was observed cheating on a test by a girl he was dating. This beautiful young lady began declining his dates, and then his plans were shattered when she stopped dating him entirely--all because she worried that if he would cheat there, he would cheat elsewhere.<br><br>One of my best friends in high school was a young man named Paul. Often after a basketball game he would have a beer or two, sometimes a six-pack, while I would have a shake or soft drink. "Some 3.2 beer can never hurt you," he would rationalize. Then one night after a beer or two he hit a gas pump in his sports car in North Salt Lake going 115 miles per hour. It took the police twenty minutes to put him in a sack. That's what we call a closed-casket funeral.<br><br>I would suspect, brothers and sisters, that when we analyze and understand the commandments we have been given, we will plead for more. Joseph Smith called commandments blessings. I think that is a marvelous definition.<br><br>One of the greatest coaches of them all, Vince Lombardi, taught that in every football game there are only five or six plays that make the difference between who wins and who loses. It is the combination of the little things that makes the difference. He demanded that his players give it all they had on each play so that when the critical play came along they would make the most of it. How valuable is each hour, day, week, and month you spend at this great institution. Please remember the little things do count!<br><br>A fellow student in college made it a goal to study just one hour longer each day than most of us were studying. His academic excellence has made him internationally known as a linguist, and he is a professor today at a leading institution. One extra hour a day in his life made the difference.<br><h2><b>Restitution</b></h2><br>Fifth, as we deal with the Spirit, let us remember restitution. Where mistakes have been made, correct them wherever and whenever possible. Jesus said, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (Matthew 5:44).<br><br>In the book<i>The One Hundred,</i>Michael Hart names Jesus the third most influential person that had ever lived. I could not believe his demeaning analysis until I came across these words justifying his position:<br><br><i>Now, these ideas which were not a part of the Judaism of Jesus' day, nor of most other religions are surely among the most remarkable and original ethical ideas ever presented. If they were widely followed, I would have had no hesitation in placing Jesus Christ first in this book. But the truth is that they are not widely followed. In fact, they are not even generally accepted. Most Christians consider the injunction to "love your enemy" as, at most, an ideal which might be realized in some perfect world. Jesus' most distinctive teaching, therefore, remains and intriguing, but basically untried suggestion.</i>[Michael Hart,<i>The One Hundred</i>(New York: A &amp;amp; W Publishing Co., 1978), p. 47]<br><br>But we, as Latter-day Saints, must live his teachings. Our reward is the Spirit and eternal joy. We are those who must forgive. We are those who must love our enemies. We are seeing more enemies perhaps today than we have seen in decades. Movies are being made demeaning our most holy practices. People who know better are telling lies. Now is the time to love our enemies.<br><br>A number of years ago a basketball player from the Midwest played for Utah State University. He was a nonmember. He was disrespectful, dishonest, and often unkind to most of the people he met. His teammates reported that, as the team traveled to Salt Lake City, Provo, and Albuquerque, he would steal items in the dressing room, stores, or restaurants. He would steal almost anything he could get his hands on. He had little, if any, respect for the young women he dated. He would take from them their self-respect, as easily as he would steal items from store owners.<br><br>After he had used his eligibility, he returned to the Midwest and went into correctional work. After being gone for several years, he returned to Logan. "What does he want now?" several that remembered him asked. He went into the stores in Cache County, paying the merchants for what he had stolen. He called the women he had dated, and when he could find them he apologized for what he had done to them and with them. He did the same in other cities where he had played basketball.<br><br>After doing what he could do to make right his wrongs, he returned to Chicago. Soon an obituary told of his untimely death. What motivated that great change? What brought him in tune with life and morality? Apparently he had been touched by the Spirit.<br><br>We must practice restitution whenever we possibly can. I know sometimes it is not possible. We all have done things we need to change, restore, and alter if we can.<br><h2><b>Build Others</b></h2><br>Sixth, build others. Enhance the happiness level of those nearby. Some people bring happiness<i>wherever</i>they go. Others bring happiness<i>whenever</i>they go. We simply cannot have the Spirit when we are at crossed swords with those we know. The Master summarized so much of what matters by saying, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12). The Golden Rule must be the foundation of our behavior.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is with us when we are righteously at peace with our brothers and sisters. God, our Father, pleads with us to take care of each other. If you are dating someone who leaves you at the door less pure, more frustrated, and not feeling as good about yourself as you felt before you met that person, then already you know you are not to continue that relationship. The Holy Ghost cannot dwell in an unclean environment.<br><h2><b>Take Charge</b></h2><br>Seventh, take charge of your life. Ask, expend energy, work, and become "doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22). Being doers of Christian service is one of the reasons that we are strong beyond our numbers. But I am disturbed with the fact that a number of our young people believe that much of life is accidental. There is nothing accidental in spirituality and righteousness. And that I can promise you.<br><br>Part of the very foundation of the restoration scripturally is that motivating verse in James which tells us, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally" (James 1:5). We must ask, then the Spirit gives!<br><br>The Spirit will teach us all things (see John 14:26) if we ask!<br><br>The Spirit will show us things to come (see John 16:13) if we ask!<br><br>The Spirit will guide us to all truth (see John 16:13) if we ask!<br><br>Each of us must work out our own destiny with the Spirit as our strength and guide.<br><br>It was William Faulkner who said, "I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal . . . not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul and spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance" (Speech upon receiving the Nobel Prize, December 10, 1950).<br><h2><b>Rely on the Spirit</b></h2><br>Eighth, have the courage to rely upon the Spirit. Several years ago a boy was electrocuted while retrieving his brother's kite which had become impaled on a tree. The young man had climbed a 25-foot metal ladder and accidentally grabbed a power line. He fell to the ground lifeless, a hole blasted through his leg where the electricity had escaped. Two young men, defying all of the concerns and pressures of society, ran to the body. They had not yet served missions, but were soon to receive the Melchizedek priesthood. They placed their hands upon the head of the boy, called the others who were not witnesses to the event to kneel around in prayer, and they uttered a blessing. The Spirit was called upon and their faith utilized. Other blessings were given I'm sure. Within a week he was attending school again, slightly scarred with pink tissue, but alive as a reminder of two young men's courage. Those two young men are here tonight.<br><br>While speaking to a group of single adults at Christmastime a year ago, I reminded them that if they were working in an environment that was not conducive to their spiritual well-being, perhaps they should resign. Afterwards, a young man the age of many of you came up to talk to me. He expressed concern that he was called upon to do some things that he didn't feel comfortable doing. Jobs were almost impossible to get, he explained, and the work he was doing paid well. I reminded him that it was his decision whether to stay or resign. "Call upon the Spirit," I advised. The next week he called me. Reminding me who he was, he said, "I did it. I quit my job. I am frightened, but I know I did the right thing." Within two weeks he reported back that he had a job where now he was comfortable, and he appreciated the promptings of the Spirit.<br><h2><b>It Takes Courage</b></h2><br>There is a monument at Gettysburg to honor the memory of a color-bearer who became isolated from his regiment after a charge during the Civil War. The regiment retreated, but the color-bearer and several men held their ground. The major sent a message through to the boy, "Bring the colors back to the regiment."<br><br>The boy replied, "Bring the regiment back to the colors."<br><br>Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe that your detractors are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men to win them. Courage comes freely when we call upon the Spirit.<br><br>Several years ago the BYU Motion Picture Studio produced a movie titled<i>Where Jesus Walked.</i>It was about the Master and about Jerusalem. It concluded with these words, "Two thousand years have come and gone since Jesus, the Savior of all mankind, consecrated this land by his presence."<br><br>We love each of you. Are you consecrating the land upon which you walk by your presence? You can make a difference with the Holy Spirit as your companion wherever you go!<br><br>May each of us rely more securely upon the Spirit than we have ever done before. These things of which I have spoken are true, I testify to you in the worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hugh W. Pinnock was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 March 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>u Sell? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is reported that the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "I have a greater sense of humility when addressing [young men and women] than in standing before kings and queens." He felt this way, I suspect, because he knew perfectly who they were and what they could become. I share Joseph's feelings, especially today, for I see before me representatives of a rising generation with almost limitless possibilities.<br><br>I therefore pray humbly that I might be aided by the Holy Spirit in delivering a prepared message somewhat related to the process of becoming. It would be nice if I could present original material, including fresh thoughts and novel ideas. Such a luxury is not mine to enjoy. Many have treated the subject which I have in mind, and many have showered you with similar counsel. Mark Twain said, "What a good thing Adam had--when he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before." Perhaps, however, my approach and my personal experiences will compensate for the inevitable redundancy.<br><h2><b>Beet Field Lesson</b></h2><br>Soon after my eighteenth birthday I was invited by my bishop (who happened to be my father) to work on the ward welfare farm. The assignment was to thin beets in the company of other priesthood holders. I was a master of this slavelike labor; I have a lame back to prove it. I could do an acre in one day if I started before sunup and ended long after sundown (providing I cared little about standing erect for several days).<br><br>I worked diligently up one row and down another, hoping to finish the task early. One of the older workers was my stake president, a banker by profession. It pleased me to see him digging in the soil and sweating under the hot sun. It was the first time I had seen this very proper and fastidious priesthood leader dressed in anything other than a dark suit, white shirt, and tie. I must admit that I enjoyed watching him get dirt on his hands. In fact, I was so carried away by this pleasure (heaven forgive me!) that I sped up the soiling by deliberately kicking up clouds of dust in his direction as I moved by.<br><br>On one move past President Roland Tietjen, he called my name and invited me to engage in conversation. I stopped, laid down my hoe, and sat on the soft ground. He asked, "Carlos, how old are you?"<br><br>I replied, "Eighteen."<br><br>"Do you know how old I am?" he continued.<br><br>"Oh, about seventy" was my quick and foolish answer. (I missed the mark by many years!) Laughing without, and I suppose crying within, he said, "My time on earth is running out--yours is just beginning. Carlos, would you sell to me the next ten years of your life?" I thought to myself, what's wrong with this money changer? Can't he forget money and buying and selling for just one morning?<br><br>He was able to discern my thoughts and to note my discomfort. He quickly added, "I know that it is impossible for you to transfer to me part of your life. However, if it were possible, would you sell?"<br><br>With little hesitation I blurted out, "No, I would not."<br><br>"Suppose I offered you $100,000 for those years," he pressed. Again, I declined his offer, saying that I had things to do in the years ahead.<br><br>During the next ten years, my visits with President Tietjen were few and scattered. On each occasion he would refer back to the question asked in the beet field. He would say, "Will you take $90,000 for the remaining nine years? Eighty thousand for the next eight?" And on it went until ten years were gone.<br><br>It didn't take me the full decade to appreciate the profound lesson which my wonderful Church leader was trying to teach. He caused me to treasure those formative and crucial years between eighteen and twenty-eight. He also motivated me to make plans and to initiate actions that would enable me to claim the most of my opportunities.<br><h2><b>Would You Sell?</b></h2><br>As I look into your faces, I wonder what price or value you place upon the next ten years of your lives. Would you be willing to exchange a few of your years for money?<br><br>No, you cannot package a part of your life and transfer it to another. But you can, if you are not careful, squander the prospects of the immediate future. Just as Esau despised his birthright and sold it for a "morsel of meat," so may you through neglect and myopic living forfeit all that the decade ahead has to offer (<i>see</i>Genesis 25:29–34; Hebrews 12:16–17).<br><br>There is a profound scripture in the Book of Mormon wherein reference is made to those who have been "called with a holy calling." It is stated that these holy callings were given to selected people "on account of their faith," good works, wise choices, and their reliance upon the Spirit of God. Others, according to the record, rejected the Spirit of God "on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren" (Alma 13:3–4).<br><br>Your privileges, opportunities, holy callings, and dreams can be snatched from your grasp by those twin thieves called "blindness of mind" and "hardness of heart." They prey upon all members of Adam's family, particularly the young--for these robbers know that the path of youth is slippery and full of risks.<br><br>Permit me, therefore, to suggest six specific ways of protecting yourselves and safeguarding your possibilities.<br><h2><b>Avoid Blindness of Mind</b></h2><br><h3><b><i>Set Goals</i></b></h3><br>First, you must avoid blindness of mind by setting goals. A person who sets realistic, attainable, yet challenging goals paints on the corridors of his mind a picture of what he can do and can become. This picture serves as a catalyst to every action taken in the direction of reaching established objectives. It beckons one to move forward--not backward--and it pulls from the goal-striver the finest performance.<br><br>Without goals, how does one keep score? How does one know if he is winning or losing the game? What purpose would there be to the game of football if the goal line were erased or the crossbars in the end zone removed? Who would want to play basketball if the hoops and nets were taken down? What incentive would there be to dribble, pass, and screen if there were no means of making a goal?<br><br>The same applies to the game of life. Goals lend purpose and direction to our living. They excite imagination and stir interest, and they generate a strength of anticipation which can rally all the powers of one's soul. One man said:<br><br><i>Apathy can be overcome only by enthusiasm, and enthusiasm can be aroused by only two things: (1) an ideal (purpose or goal) that takes the imagination by storm; (2) a definite intelligible plan for carrying that ideal into practice.</i>[Ward Cantrell]<br><br>God has an avowed purpose. It is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Moreover, he has a plan for the accomplishment of his stated goal, and we refer to that plan as the gospel of Jesus Christ. Added to all of this, note deity's goal-striving determination described in this scripture:<br><br><i>For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 3:2]<br><br>I have long contended that the person who sets goals and who strives to attain such is the master of his own fate. On the other hand, the person without goals becomes the pawn of time, circumstance, and every wind of influence. President Kimball had this in mind when he said, "I am convinced that unless we set goals, we move no place" (Regional Representatives' Seminar Address, April 3, 1975).<br><br>It is written, "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18). The same may be said of those who fail to set goals and who close their minds to a vision of the future. So I urge you to avoid blindness of mind by setting goals under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Fix them in your heart--visualize them in your mind--develop a plan of action--move forward without diffidence. Let one success lead you on to another. And slowly but surely you will become all and more than what you dreamed possible.<br><h3><b><i>Follow Righteous Models</i></b></h3><br>Second, you must avoid blindness of mind by following models of righteousness. Several years ago, in a general conference, President Kimball quoted these words of Walter MacPeek:<br><br>[<i>Young men</i>]<i>need lots of heroes like Lincoln and Washington. But they also need to have some heroes close by. They need to know some man of towering strength and basic integrity, personally. They need to meet them on the street, to hike and camp with them, to see them in close-to-home, everyday, down-to-earth situations; to feel close enough to them to ask questions and to talk things over man-to-man with them.</i>[<i>Ensign</i>May 1976, p. 47]<br><br>The same could be said of young women. All of us, it seems, need the strength and encouragement which only a role model can provide.<br><br>There are times when the road ahead becomes blurred in one's mind. Perhaps the goal is too far out of sight, or the obstacles over which one must jump block vision and give rise to the feeling, "I can't do it." At times like this a hero can ride to the rescue. His appearance on the scene assures us in these implied words: "He did it! And if he can do it, I can too!"<br><br>You must be very cautious in the selection of a role model. You will want to pick someone who can be trusted--not someone with feet of clay. You will want to follow someone who walks the straight path--not someone who will lead you down strange roads.<br><br>When I think of modeling, I think of that great chief Captain Moroni. It was said of him:<br><br><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts</i>[<i>and minds</i>]<i>of the children of men.</i>[Alma 48:17]<br><br>I worry when I read the results of university polls, such as the one conducted at Brown University a few years ago. Under the caption "In Search of Heroes" it was reported that politicians (some good and some not so good) and a daredevil stuntman outscored the Savior of mankind.<br><br>How very fortunate you are to be on this campus where reliable role models are found in abundance! Many members of the BYU faculty have achieved high honors in their professional fields without compromising standards or surrendering a particle of faith. Their examples are inspiring, uplifting, and worthy of emulation.<br><br>I marvel at the wisdom Helaman displayed in naming his sons. As he bestowed the names Nephi and Lehi, he instructed:<br><br><i>I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</i>[Helaman 5:6–7]<br><br>Yes, I urge you to avoid blindness of mind by following models of righteousness. Conduct this modeling with the words of the Savior in mind: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><h3><b><i>Cultivate Gifts Within</i></b></h3><br>Third, you must avoid blindness of mind by discovering and cultivating the gifts within. Paul advised Timothy, "Neglect not the gift that is in thee" (1 Timothy 4:14). The Apostle may have said this in reference to priesthood conferral and blessings. I personally believe, however, that there is a broader application.<br><br>Unless I am mistaken, one of the purposes of this university, and of other universities, is to help students discover their talents, interests, and special abilities. Such discoveries may come easily and early; others may surface painfully and much later. But the search must go on. Eventually, one's potential contributions take focus, and the cultivation of the gifts becomes serious.<br><br>Precious time and energy can be wasted if in the probing for gifts, one is not perfectly honest with himself. There is the maxim which warns: "You can't lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse. If you<i>do</i>think you look funny on a horse, then postpone the charge" (Speigel's Laws of Management). I would add, sell the horse and seek to lead out in some other way.<br><br>I suspect that many of you have wondered where you were when the gifts were distributed. Perhaps you even feel that you were completely overlooked. At times I have envied the gifts made apparent in the lives of others. I have wondered why I haven't received more of an endowment. But as I have studied this subject and my knowledge of gifts has increased, I have repented of past feelings, for I know that "to every man [and woman] is given a gift by the Spirit of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:1). I also know that every man and woman has his or her own gift of God (see 1 Corinthians 7:7). Furthermore, I know that some may be given an abundance of gifts (see D&amp;amp;C 46:29).<br><br>We find in holy writ more than a casual invitation to obtain spiritual gifts. We are told to desire spiritual gifts, seek earnestly the best gifts, lay hold upon every good gift, and to apply ourselves to our own special gift (<i>see</i>1 Corinthians 14:1; D&amp;amp;C 46:8; Moroni 10:30; D&amp;amp;C 8:4).<br><br>Gifts are not cast freely into the wind. They must be sought, they must be cultivated, they must be used to benefit others--for that is the condition upon which they are granted. Always bear in mind that they are reserved for those who love God and keep his commandments.<br><br>Is it possible that a gift lies dormant within you? Perhaps you haven't mined deeply enough within the recesses of your soul to discover the "gold" that resides there. Maybe you haven't heeded sufficiently the subtle intimations of the Spirit which provide clues to special and inner powers.<br><br>When a man ignores the spiritual dimension of his soul, he binds himself with the weaknesses of the flesh. But when he recognizes the divine spark within and allows that spark to be kindled by heavenly fires, almost limitless powers are unleashed. Moses did not become the great deliverer until spiritual powers were ignited within him; Joseph Smith, the young farm boy, did not become the prophet of the Restoration until he sought light and truth; and we will never rise to saintly heights until we seek gifts that will magnify our physical, mental, and spiritual capacities.<br><h2><b>Avoid Hardness of Heart</b></h2><br><h3><b><i>Obey Commandments</i></b></h3><br>Fourth, you must avoid hardness of heart by obeying God's commandments. A great man said on this campus:<br><br><i>We are too inclined to think of law as something . . . hemming us in. We sometimes think of law as the opposite of liberty. But that is a false conception. . . . God does not contradict Himself. He did not create man and then, as an afterthought, impose upon him a set of arbitrary, irritating, restrictive rules. He made man free--and then gave him the Commandments to keep him free.</i><br><br><i>We cannot break the Ten Commandments. We can only break ourselves against them--or else, by keeping them, rise through them to the fullness of freedom under God. God means us to be free. With divine daring, He gave us the power of choice.</i>[Cecil B. DeMille, "The Greater Understanding," BYU Commencement Address, 31 May 1957]<br><br>I regard each law and each commandment as an expression of God's divine love. He loved us enough to provide some "thou shalts" and some "thou shalt nots." And on occasion he has simply challenged us to exercise judgment and to use wisdom. All is done by a loving Father in Heaven who warns and forewarns his children (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 89:4).<br><br>With every commandment there are two certainties: (1) a promised blessing to the obedient; (2) a curse or forfeiture of blessing to the disobedient (<i>see</i>Deuteronomy 11:26–28). It is certain and simple. The choice is left to us.<br><br>You who are laying the foundations of future vocations or professions need to retain in memory the promise predicated upon your faithfulness, for the Lord has declared, "I . . . am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10). You can perform beyond your natural abilities; you can accelerate your learning--providing you live in accord with God's commandments.<br><br>In recent months a satanic attack has been launched against the young men and women of this Church. The leaders of this attack are largely apostates who seek to make people miserable like unto themselves. They mock sacred covenants and saving ordinances. They sit in spacious buildings, puffed up in the pride of the world and would have the young and vulnerable believe that their worldly wisdom is superior to revealed religion.<br><br>Beware of such vipers, such faith pickpockets. They pretend to distill upon you corrective truths, when in reality they are stirring up "mists of darkness" which serve only to blind eyes, harden hearts, and lead precious souls away from the true and living God (see 1 Nephi 12:17). If there is virtue in such opposition, I find it very hard to identify. It could be related to this inspired thought:<br><br><i>A ship, like a human being, moves best when it is slightly athwart the wind, when it has to keep its sails tight and attend its course. Ships, like men, do poorly when the wind is directly behind, pushing them sloppily on their way, so that no care is required in steering or in the management of sails; the wind seems favorable, for it blows in the direction one is heading, but actually it is destructive because it induces a relaxation in tension and skill. What is needed is a wind slightly opposed to the ship, for then tension can be maintained, and juices can flow and ideas can germinate, for ships, like men, respond to challenge.</i>[James A. Michener,<i>Chesapeake</i>(New York: Fawcett Crest, 1978), p. 566]<br><br>I would have you remember that sin, ignorance, and error have a hardening influence upon the inner man--the heart--whereas obedience, knowledge, and truth liberate the soul and enable it to reach heights of greatness. Truly the righteous are favored of God (see 1 Nephi 17:35). I would say look to God, keep his commandments, and live.<br><h3><b><i>Obey Parents And Leaders</i></b></h3><br>Fifth, you must avoid hardness of heart by obeying parents and those priesthood leaders who have more than a casual interest in you. Since ancient times this requirement has appeared in the books: "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12).<br><br>A more recent statement reads, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. . . . (which is the first commandment with promise)" (Ephesians 6:1–2). Please note the words "in the Lord." I interpret this to mean that a son or daughter is obligated to sustain and obey parents only in righteousness. Unrighteous dominion in parent-child relationships, I feel, is as reprehensible as it is in husband-wife relationships. One really does not sustain another when goodness is compromised.<br><br>Permit me to illustrate this point. A young man of faith practiced diligently and became a champion swimmer. He excelled to the point that scholarship offers from many universities were extended. One by one he turned them down. His father asked, "Son, why won't you accept one of these free-ride scholarships?"<br><br>"I can't," the boy answered. "I'm going on a mission. It would not be honest for me to accept one and then drop it before the year is gone."<br><br>Angrily the father shouted, "How foolish can you be? You are throwing away an opportunity of a lifetime!"<br><br>"I am sorry, Dad," the boy added respectfully, "but I take seriously what the Lord said about his coming again. And, when he does come, I don't want to be found in the swimming pool practicing the backstroke."<br><br>I don't' mean to give the impression that parental advice is usually wrong and misdirected. This is not the case. Generally parents will give you counsel that is reliable. It is sparked by genuine love and given with your best interests in mind.<br><br>The same applies to the direction given by Church leaders. They too, have an investment in your well-being. Their role is to serve as shepherds to the flock--whether they be fathers of wards, heads of quorums, or teachers in the home.<br><br>Perhaps we should view the obeying of parents as a preparatory duty. Did not Paul state:<br><br><i>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</i>[Hebrews 12:9]<br><br>Love of parents is akin to love of God. Obedience to parents, in the Lord, will soften hearts and make one more receptive to the will of God.<br><h3><b><i>Obey Eternal Rhythm</i></b></h3><br>Sixth, and finally, you must avoid hardness of heart by obeying the eternal rhythm. By this I mean that there is an orderly sequence of events in this life which must not be altered. The poet put it this way:<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]<br><br>I would add: a time to serve a mission, a time to marry, a time to explore fields of learning, and a time to specialize. Your professors would have me say: a time to study, a time to play, a time to attend class, and a time to be in the library.<br><br>President Kimball has addressed this subject. His words are:<br><br><i>One can have all the blessings if he is in control and takes the experiences in proper turn: first some limited social get-acquainted contacts, then his mission, then his courting, then his temple marriage and his schooling and his family, then his life's work. In any other sequence he could run into difficulty.</i>["The Marriage Decision,"<i>Ensign</i>, February 1975, p. 4]<br><br>Perhaps you are familiar with this splendid and thought-provoking account:<br><br><i>I remembered one morning when I discovered a cocoon in the bark of a tree, just as the butterfly was making a hole in its case and preparing to come out. I waited a while, but it was too long appearing and I was impatient. I bent over it and breathed on it to warm it. I warmed it as quickly as I could and the miracle began to happen before my eyes, faster than life. The case opened, the butterfly started slowly crawling out and I shall never forget my horror when I saw how its wings were folded back and crumpled; the wretched butterfly tried with its whole trembling body to unfold them. Bending over it, I tried to help it with my breath. In vain. It needed to be hatched out patiently and the unfolding of the wings should be a gradual process in the sun. Now it was too late. My breath had forced the butterfly to appear, all crumpled, before its time. It struggled desperately and, a few seconds later, died in the palm of my hand.</i><br><br><i>That little body is, I do believe, the greatest weight I have on my conscience. For I realize today that it is a mortal sin to violate the great laws of nature. We should not hurry, we should not be impatient, but we should confidently obey the eternal rhythm.</i>[Nikos Kazantzakis,<i>Zorba the Greek</i>(New York: Ginn and Company, 1953), p. 120–21]<br><h2><b>Concluding Words</b></h2><br>Earlier in this presentation I shared with you a beet field conversation which I had with my stake president years ago. You will recall that I rejected his offer of $100,000 for ten years of my life. Those years between eighteen and twenty-eight came and went like a dream in the night. Have you any idea what I would have lost had I been willing and able to sell?<br><br>* Two years of military service in World War II--a precious time of testing.<br><br>* Nearly three years in the Palestine and Syria Mission--an experience of eternal worth.<br><br>* Four years at the University of Utah--a precious learning and grooming time.<br><br>* My first year of teaching in the public schools--a time when gifts and interest reached a peak.<br><br>* And cradled within all of this is marriage to my childhood sweetheart and the birth of a daughter and a son.<br><br>Can you place a monetary value upon these formative years? No! They are priceless.<br><br>How much do the next ten years mean to you? Though my time is running out and yours is only beginning, I will not offer to buy that which is yours. I do, however, warn you in the spirit of helpfulness to guard against the wasting and squandering, and the forfeiture of your privileges. I have suggested that you must fight vigorously against two evil conditions, "blindness of mind" and "hardness of heart." This can be done, as I have proposed, by setting goals, following models of righteousness, discovering and cultivating the gifts within, obeying God's commandments, obeying parents and Church leaders, and obeying the eternal rhythm.<br><br>In the words of a hymn:<br><br><i>Time flies on wings of lightning;</i><br><i>We cannot call it back;</i><br><i>It comes, then passes forward</i><br><i>Along its onward track;</i><br><br><i>And if we are not mindful,</i><br><i>The chance will fade away;</i><br><i>For life is quick in passing.</i><br><i>'Tis as a single day.</i><br>[R.B. Baird,<i>Hymns,</i>no. 73]<br><br>May you go forward with staunch faith and firm resolve, and do all that is necessary to avoid those "sad words of tongue or pen . . . 'It might have been'" (John Greenleaf Whittier,<i>Maud Muller,</i>1856). For this I pray in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E. Asay was a member of the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 March 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>: Ongoing Guidance Is Needed for All - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to speak on a subject tonight that I think involves each of us. It's that of guidance--ongoing guidance, that is needed by every single person. It is not a subject that is for entertaining. It is not light; it is a heavy doctrine, you might say, to be given to you, a mature audience.<br><br>We have constant decisions and judgments to make, and as we are totally independent from the world, we are totally dependent upon our Father in Heaven. It should be enough for each of us to be told, "If you will have meditating study of the scriptures in a prayerful manner all of your life, you will be guided in all of your small decisions and all of your large decisions." But it seems to me that we need more than just the admonition to do such. We need to find out what the prophets of old have taught us and adhere to their counsel.<br><h2><b>We Need Constant Direction</b></h2><br>As my wife was driving home with our daughter Lycia one Sunday evening, the lights went out. The power went off in the streets and the homes. As they were driving to our home, they noticed they only had the light from the car. Obviously the garage door wouldn't open and so as they wandered through the heavy blackness to find the front door, they noticed the depressing or heavy effect of the atmosphere. As they entered the house they noticed that without light you could not study, you couldn't nourish your mind. You were inhibited even though you had candles and flashlights. You were inhibited in doing many things that you would customarily do. They also noted that as the time went on, some three hours, that the house became very chilled because of the cold winds that came through the sliding glass doors. As they had this experience, the realization apparently came to them that the light we require is very essential. Our need and dependency for light in this world is crucial. Oh, how we could realize that the light we need in our spiritual life is even more crucial and more necessary because each of us has decisions constantly, decisions we must make which affect us from an eternal standpoint. We need ongoing, constant direction in order to effectuate the will of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Guidance comes through revelation and revelation has always characterized the true Church of Jesus Christ. That is to say, revelation to the prophet, to each leader, to each person. Our claim to revelation upsets all other religions. We do not criticize them or print pamphlets against them, even though many do in opposition to us. We claim divine revelation to a living prophet and to twelve apostles. This in essence says to other churches that we are right and they are wrong. Although, I repeat, we do not criticize them.<br><h2><b>Freedom of Worship</b></h2><br>Freedom of worship is in fact a freedom. I was happy to note recently that the Catholic church believes that a man may worship how, where, or what he may. For example, in the Vatican Council II on 7 December 1965, the pope and his council of 2,378 men issued their declaration on religious liberty. I would like to share with you just a portion of that doctrine that they wrote, which is inspired. Such a doctrine allows us to worship our God according to the dictates of our conscience. It is titled<i>On the Right of the Person and Communities to Social and Civil Liberty in Religious Matters.</i><br><br><i>The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in associations with others. The Council further declares that the right to religious freedom is based on the very dignity of the human person as known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civil right.</i><br><br><i>Also included in the right to religious freedom is the right of religious groups not to be prevented from freely demonstrating the special value of their teaching for the organization of society and the inspiration of all human activity. Finally, rooted in the social nature of man and in the very nature of religion is the right of men, prompted by their own religious sense, freely to hold meetings or establish educational, cultural, charitable and social organizations.</i>[O.P. Flannery, ed.,<i>Vatican Council II, The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents</i>(Collegeville, Minn.: The Liturgical Press, 1975), pp. 799–800, 803, 812]<br><br>It is nice to know that other churches do believe that man has a right to worship how, where, or what he may.<br><br>With regard to freedom also and allowing other men to worship as they wish, when I had a stake conference not too long ago in the state of Kentucky, I picked up an article from the<i>Western Recorder</i>as published by the Baptist church. This particular publication is for the knowledge of their members and such a statement would not likely be made public by them. It is titled "Why Are Mormons Ahead of Baptists?"<br><br><i>Mormons are putting Baptists to shame in zeal and growth. ... They have spread to 83 countries and are growing faster than any other religious group. ...</i><br><br><i>... Mormons had a gain of 93% to Southern Baptists' gain of 35% in South America and 98% gain in Mexico to our growth of 9%. ...</i><br><br><i>... How could God bless any group who exalts a mere man named Joseph Smith to the same level as Jesus Christ ... ?</i>[This we have never done. This we will never do. They misunderstand.]<i>Human efforts and not divine sanction must account for Mormon success. ...</i><br><br><i>Two other reasons account more for the faster rate of growth of Mormons than Baptists. These are certainty of doctrine and depth of commitment. ... Wherever people believe strongly and highly prize what they believe, they share it with enthusiasm. ...</i><br><br><i>... The Mormon missionary force numbers about 30,000 at home and abroad with most of these serving without pay.</i><br><br><i>In contrast Southern Baptists in 1980 had slightly over 6,000 career missionaries and the budgets of the two Southern Baptist mission boards exceeded $100,000,000. ...</i><br><br><i>Southern Baptists and Mormons are both involved in Bold Mission Thrust. With Baptists it's mostly a slogan, with Mormons it is a reality.</i>["Why are Mormons Ahead of Baptists?"<i>Western Recorder,</i>24 March 1982]<br><br>It is heartening to see them recognize the growth and the strength of this Church.<br><h2><b>How Does Revelation Come?</b></h2><br>Elder Howard W. Hunter stated to the General Authorities the following:<br><br><i>Some have attempted to explain the origin and operation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints without acknowledging the principle of revelation. That is like trying to explain the operation of a vehicle without mentioning the fact that the vehicle has an engine. To attempt to account for the rise and progress of this Church on any basis other than revelation will prove to be naïve. Anyone, however learned, who attempts to tell our history and omits the detail of revelation in the narration will not be giving a truthful nor accurate account. The spirit will not ratify such a history.</i>[Address delivered at General Authorities' training seminar, 30 November 1983]<br><br>Elder Hunter also said, "How does revelation come?" This is a question we must ask ourselves now. How does it come? He suggests that it comes in three ways. He suggests a voice, the actual visit of an angel, or manifestations of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Now, with respect to a voice, let me read to you D&amp;amp;C 130:14–15:<br><br><i>I was praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man</i>[says the Prophet Joseph]<i>, when I heard a voice repeat the following:</i><br><br><i>Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man.</i><br><br>So he heard a voice.<br><br>Number two, then, would be the actual visit of an angel. President Wilford Woodruff said:<br><br><i>I have had the administration of angels in my day and time, though I never prayed for an angel. I have had, in several instances, the administration of holy messengers.</i>[Wilford Woodruff,<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), p. 286]<br><br>In section 110, verse 11, we read, "After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared." Later, in verse 12, "Elias appeared." In verse 13, "Elijah the prophet ... stood before us." Those are a few illustrations of the actual visits of angels.<br><br>Point number three, then, is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost. In D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3, we read,<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i><br><br>And in Enos we read: "And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: ..."(Enos 10).<br><br>Joseph Fielding Smith spoke to the Seminaries and Institutes at BYU in 1958 and said that number three is more everlasting than number two. That is to say, the manifestations of the Holy Ghost are more everlasting than the actual visit of an angel. I quote his words:<br><br><i>The impression on the soul that comes from the Holy Ghost are far more significant than a vision. It is where the spirit speaks to spirit and the imprint upon the soul is far more difficult to erase.</i><br><h2><b>It Isn't Logical, But I Know</b></h2><br>I recall vividly when I was presiding over a mission some years ago in Central and South America. I was interviewing a sister by the name of Sister Rodgers. As we were speaking in warm conversation, she looked at me and she said, "President, I just found out with whom I am going to the temple to be sealed."<br><br>I smiled and I said, "Sister Rodgers, is it logical, while you dedicate all of your time, your efforts, and all of your thoughts to the service of the Lord in the mission field, that the Lord would tell you<i>here</i>who you are going to marry?"<br><br>She said, "No, it isn't logical, but I know."<br><br>At the instant she said that there came to my mind, as clearly as can be, a face and a name.<br><br>I said, "Sister Rodgers, I believe you. What's more, I know who it is."<br><br>She looked at me in a very surprised manner and she said, "You do?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, the face just flashed before my mind, and I know his name. Sister Rodgers, in this mission we have five countries. He is one of the missionaries." I hadn't mentioned his name. "And I don't recall your even working in the same country with him. So I don't understand how you would know him."<br><br>She said, "President, I haven't worked in the same country or the same city, but I was at one zone conference and I saw him at a distance and the Lord told me he was to be my eternal companion."<br><br>I said, "And his name is ------."<br><br>And she said, "Yes."<br><br>She smiled and shed some tears. We spoke on for a few minutes and then she told me about another experience she had had with someone in the field. Again, the impression clearly came to my mind of his face and his name, and I said, "I know who he is, also. It was------."<br><br>She said, "Yes."<br><br>You can imagine the warm rapport we felt between the two of us, knowing that the Lord was blessing us, knowing that he is interested in every single missionary. That is to say, every single missionary whether he is in the field or out of the field.<br><br>I was pleased to note, in the not too distant future, even though she lived in California and he lived in Idaho, that I received an invitation to the temple marriage, because they met at BYU. I have visited them since. They live in Boise, Idaho. They have a beautiful, happy home, in which I have dined. They have four beautiful children. He's the bishop of the ward and a practicing lawyer.<br><br>Can you imagine the anchor they have because of that divine guidance they received from the Lord? It is the anchor to their marital life for eternity, knowing the Lord's will had been manifested to them as to who they were to marry. Such guidance is so essential to us all of the time.<br><h2><b>Enlightened by the Spirit</b></h2><br>Follow me, if you will, through these scriptures which may help us to understand more of what we may expect as we profit from the experience of others. In 1 Kings 19:11–13 we read about the time when a voice (again, sometimes guidance comes through a voice) came to Elijah. He said,<br><br><i>Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind and earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:</i><br><br><i>And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</i><br><br><i>And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</i><br><br>This is one illustration of the voice.<br><br>Remember Enos, when a voice came to his mind:<br><br><i>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i><br><br><i>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed. ...</i><br><br><i>And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence.</i>[Enos 4, 5, 10]<br><br>We find another illustration of how guidance comes from the Spirit in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 6:<br><br><i>Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind</i>[now, sometimes he does that and we don't recognize it.]<i>; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth; ...</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart</i>[Don't we all do that regularly? Don't we cry unto him in our heart, wanting some guidance of some type?],<i>that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br>Now listen to his answer.<br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:15, 22–23]<br><br>It was a feeling. Sometimes it's a voice, and sometimes it's a feeling. And, in section 8:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2]<br><br>We just have to develop ourselves to be perceptive, to recognize his influence upon us. In section 9:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8]<br><br>And in 3 Nephi 17:3:<br><br><i>Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand.</i><br><h2><b>Hearing the Voice of the Savior</b></h2><br>So we ponder, that we might understand. In section 18 of the Doctrine and Covenants are some of the most beautiful of all the scriptures. Sometime when you're home, would you mind reading section 18, putting your name in place of that of Oliver Cowdery in some of these verses? For example, I'll read from verse 2 and some of these other verses, supposing that it's you and me.<br><br><i>Behold, I have manifested unto you, by my Spirit in many instances, that the things which you have written</i>[that is to say, the Book of Mormon]<i>are true; wherefore you know that they are true.</i><br><br><i>And if you know that they are true, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that you rely upon the things which are written;</i><br><br><i>For in them are all things written concerning the foundation of my church, my gospel and my rock. ...</i><br><br><i>And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it.</i><br><br><i>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;</i><br><br><i>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:2–4. 33–36]<br><br>So we learn here that revelation and guidance come in the form of the Book of Mormon. As we read the Book of Mormon or the holy scriptures, we are literally hearing the voice of the Savior.<br><h2><b>The Scriptures Give Us Guidance</b></h2><br>What guidance does the Book of Mormon and the scriptures give to us? We can think of quite a few instances. If you would like to know about the law of revelation, see D&amp;amp;C 98:23–22; 44:1–4, 46:11–13, 48:14–16; secrecy in government, 2 Nephi 31:2–3, Mosiah 29:25–26, 33–34, Ether 8–16; the law of religious liberty, Alma 30:6–11, Joshua 24:15, Moses 6:33; civic responsibilities, Mosiah 29, Ether 2:10–12, D&amp;amp;C 134, 135; and the Atonement, 2 Nephi 2, Alma 34, 42.<br><br>We just need to open the magnificent topical guide or index and realize that each one of us is an expert in all doctrines of the Church. We must have a desire to put forth effort. We fast, pray, thirst, search the scriptures (we don't nibble--we feast), we meditate, and yearn with faith.<br><h2><b>Grow into the Principle</b></h2><br>What is faith? I think you are all aware of the definition given by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the<i>Lectures on Faith:</i><br><br><i>Faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen, and the principle of action in all intelligent beings. ...</i><br><br><i>How do you convey to the understanding more clearly that faith is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things? By it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God; and without it there is no power and without power there could be no creation nor existence!</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>1:9, Q &amp;amp; A 1:24]<br><br>Also, in<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>we read what I consider a most interesting aspect concerning growth.<br><br><i>The Spirit of Revelation is in connection with these blessings. A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 151]<br><h2><b>Listening for Guidance</b></h2><br>Some of you may have read in the history of the Church the experience that was held by one of the General Authorities named John Wells. He was in the Presiding Bishopric of the Church and lived between 1864 and 1941. His son Arthur was killed suddenly. In the diary of Bishop Wells's daughter, Clarice Wells Crook, we find this account:<br><br><i>On October 15. 1915, my brother Arthur Thorpe Wells, 20 years old, was working as a conductor on the Emigration Canyon Railway. ... Arthur was a handsome, intelligent, and happy six-footer. ... In the course of his duty, he flagged an on-coming train to the siding and signaled his motorman to proceed. No one saw the accident but when Arthur did not signal his return to the train, the motorman stopped the train and they found Arthur lying on the tracks, for the train had run over him.</i><br><br><i>This incident to the oldest son and brother saddened the family, especially the mother, who could not content herself, not knowing how it happened.</i><br><br><i>On October 30, fifteen days later, Arthur came to mother in a dream or a vision and explained some of the things that she wanted to know. He said that when his spirit left his body, he went immediately to the Presiding Bishop's Office to tell father, who was busy talking to a woman and he told his mother who the woman was and what they were talking about. This was confirmed later by his desk calendar. He then went to tell his mother, who was baking pies and singing a certain song. He said that he was unhappy to leave all of his loved ones. He was lonesome and felt a little strange because he was not so well acquainted there. He was told that he would soon find happiness.</i><br><br><i>Mother was a little concerned because he didn't look happy and so she was blessed with another visit from Arthur. He told her that now he had been assigned work in the Priesthood Quorum and was very busy working with his grandparents and relatives. He told her not to worry about him anymore, because this was the last time that he would be permitted to come back to see her. This was a great comfort to all the family.</i><br><br>What do we learn from this? Apparently his mother had placed herself in a meditative mood so she could receive the visitation of her son, but apparently his father, who was a General Authority, was so busy in the affairs of the Church he didn't take time to listen. We have to meditate; we have to take time to listen in order to have the guidance we require from on high.<br><h2><b>Call upon the Lord</b></h2><br>We should strive to be pure in our thoughts and actions as the Prophet Joseph said.<br><br><i>The Lord cannot always be known by the thunder of His voice, by the display of His glory or by the manifestation of His power, and those that are the most anxious to see these things, are the least prepared to meet them, and were the Lord to manifest His powers as He did to the children of Israel, such characters would be the first to say, "Let not the Lord speak any more, lest we His people die."</i><br><br><i>We would say to the brethren, seek to know God in your closets, call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of Mormon, and pray over, and for your families, your cattle, your flocks, your herds, your corn, and all things that you possess; ask the blessing of God upon all your labors, and everything that you engage in. Be virtuous and pure; be men of integrity and truth; keep the commandments of God; and then you will be able more perfectly to understand the difference between right and wrong--between the things of God and the things of men; and your path will be like that of the just, which shineth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 247]<br><h2><b>Search the Scriptures</b></h2><br>In<i>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</i>regarding the guidance that comes from prophets and scripture, we read:<br><br><i>All through the scriptures every weakness and strength of man has been portrayed. ... One would surely be blind who could not learn to live life properly by such reading. The Lord said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). And it was this same Lord and master in whose life we find every quality of goodness: godliness, strength, controls, perfection. And how can students study this great story without capturing some of it in their lives?</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 133]<br><br>Speaking about how to interpret the scriptures, Joseph Smith said the following:<br><br><i>What is the rule of interpretation? Just no interpretation at all. Understand it precisely as it reads. I have a key by which I understand the scriptures. I enquire, what was the question which drew out the answer, or cause Jesus to utter the parable? ... To ascertain its meaning, we must dig up the root and ascertain what it was that drew the saying out of Jesus.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 276–277]<br><br>He also says, "... and he who reads it [scriptures] oftenest will like it best" (<i>Teachings</i>, p. 56).<br><br>And in<i>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</i>we read,<br><br>Scripture study is a family responsibility.<i>Scripture study as individuals and as a family is most fundamental to learning the gospel. Daily reading of the scriptures and discussing them together has long been suggested as a powerful tool against ignorance and the temptations of Satan. This practice will produce great happiness and will help family members love the Lord and his goodness. ... Home is where we become experts and scholars in gospel righteousness.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 129]<br><br>Just remember the scriptures do not guide you to be a pessimist or a cynic.<br><h2><b>We Can Destroy Ourselves by Cynicism</b></h2><br>David Rieseman of Harvard University has warned that Americans are approaching the point where the prevailing ethic is "You're a fool to obey the rules" ("The Sense of Morality,"<i>The Royal Bank Letter</i>65, no. 1 [Jan.–Feb. 1984], p. 2). The modern negative view is "look out for Number One" or "me first." The<i>Royal Bank Letter</i>states, "We can destroy ourselves just as effectively by cynicism and disillusion as by bombs. The cynics evince a mistrust of human nature" ("The Sense of Morality," p. 2).<br><br>The dictionary definition of cynicism is "one who is skeptical of the morals, values, and motives of others." There are two schools of thought. The cynical one is that man is inherently corrupt and evil. The other one is that man is inherently good.<br><br>This newsletter continues:<br><br><i>The rules that tell us we must not cheat, lie to, steal from, or otherwise despoil our neighbor form the barricades of our survival.</i>["The Sense of Morality," p. 2]<br><br>The guidance of the scriptures is uplifting, positive, and edifying. This "me first" philosophy has a loosening effect on our social cohesion.<br><br>In most western countries, only three of the transgressions listed in the Ten Commandments are against the law. What right does man have, for example, to change one of God's commandments and say in essence, "Thou shalt not commit adultery (except among consenting adults)"? Nevertheless, the world chooses to change divine commands.<br><br>What is the Lord's guidance? Let me read you a beautiful scripture.<br><br><i>Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 108:7]<br><br>Can you imagine having a cynical, pessimistic God in heaven, or one who would have his prophets write of that type of thing?<br><h2><b>We Must Be Teachable</b></h2><br>We are children of God, we were born only to succeed and to be happy. This happiness could and should entail obstacles and challenges to overcome. We are heirs to all our Father has. Imagine, all he has he wishes to give to us.<br><br>The scriptures guide us to be obedient, self-reliant, self-disciplined, and totally subservient to the Lord. We must be teachable, which is the opposite of being proud.<br><br>We have some great experiences as General Authorities. We don't feel worthy to have them; we wish everyone could have them. For example, one of the most delightful experiences of the Spirit, wherein we feel the guidance of our Heavenly Father, is every time we create a new stake or change a stake presidency. We know beforehand that the Lord has already picked the man and we have to find out through the spiritual guidance of the Holy Ghost who the man is that he has already chosen.<br><br>Some of us who have the blessing of working in Latin American countries have the opportunity to create new stakes frequently. You are worried, nervous, and tremble all of the time, knowing that you must pick the man that the Lord wants to preside over that stake. The Lord is so wise and we have such limited knowledge. He seems to tell us in a different way every time, so the nervousness and the trembling go on.<br><br>Sometimes you know the instant the man walks into the room. Sometimes you know before you even commence your interviews. And sometimes you don't know until the very last second when you are offering the final prayer to receive his approval. Sometimes in the prayer you've entirely forgotten the name of the one you had chosen and the name of another man comes visibly before your mind. You then express it and feel his influence upon you.<br><br>I remember last week in Mexico City vividly. I had the pleasure of dividing a stake and forming the new Pachuca stake on the outskirts of the city. I remember all the men with whom we interviewed, and felt that it should be Brother so and so. The man who was chosen was right next in line, nearly equal to that man. But as to which one of these two or four was the very difficult question to answer. But, again, the Lord told us in his unique way who that man should be. Can you imagine the feeling of satisfaction you get to know that it seems to meet with his approval as unworthy as you are to be his instrument?<br><h2><b>You Will Always Be Guided</b></h2><br>The guidance of the Lord is omnipresent. It is always here. If you think you have a small question, if you think have a big question or a large decision to make, you will always be guided if you follow these simple rules. Remember that when you study the scriptures you are hearing his word and if you study in a meditative, prayerful manner on an ongoing basis, and nourish your spirit, he will guide you in whatever decision you have to make. Then you don't fight against the world. It just seems like you have a wind at your back, blowing you on in the right direction in order to achieve his will.<br><br>As the years go by, you look back in retrospect and say, "I remember now what happened when I was seventeen. Then I had this experience when I was twenty. I had another when I was twenty-five and this one when I was thirty. Now I realize the Lord had me have all those prior experiences just so this one today could come to me. I didn't realize it, but he was guiding me all of the time." If you haven't said that yet, you will, because he is guiding you. Every one of you as his son or daughter is valuable and precious in his eyes. He loves you with a love that we can't comprehend.<br><br>I would like to close by bearing my solemn witness to you, knowing that as sections 72 and 104 state, we are accountable before God for the things we say and do. I testify with clarity of thought that I know he lives. I know Jesus Christ directs the affairs of his Church and kingdom. I know the prophet Joseph did in truth see the Father and Son and heard the voice of each. This is his Church and kingdom, and when he comes, he will come here to his leadership of his Church.<br><br>I bear witness that anyone who has a problem can overcome it, irrespective of what it is, because you are never alone. There isn't anything one man or one woman can't do with the help of our Father in Heaven. There is nothing impossible. Your potential is without limits and we should have high goals in order to achieve the levels that he would have us achieve.<br><br>I pray for a special blessing of the Lord to be with you that each of you may understand the crucial nature of living now. Can you name any one period of time in the history of this earth more important, glorious, and happier than now? There is only one other time and that is when Jesus himself for thirty-three or -four years graced this earth. Otherwise, this is the greatest time to live. The greatest event to happen since the resurrection was the first vision when Joseph saw the Father and the Son.<br><br>I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, our living Savior. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ted E.

<br>
In 1971 the eminent historian Arnold Toynbee wrote a book titled<i>Surviving the Future</i>. He expresses concern about the inequality of man's scientific and technological advances compared with his spiritual progress. He refers to this inequality as a "morality gap." He is convinced that this gap has been growing wider and that technology has been making cumulative progress while morality has been stagnating.<br><br>Dr. Toynbee observes:<br><br><i>Science has never superseded religion, and it is my expectation that it never will supersede it. ... Science has shown no signs that it is going to be able to cope with man's most serious problems. It has not been able to do anything to cure man of his sinfulness and his sense of insecurity, or to avert the painfulness of failure and the dread of death. Above all, it has not helped him to break out of the prison of his inborn self-centeredness into communion ... with some reality that is greater, more important, more valuable, and more lasting than the individual himself.</i>[Quoted by Karl Menninger,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?</i>(N.Y.: Hawthorn Books, Inc., 1973), p. 227]<br><br>He is convinced that man's basic problem is selfishness.<br><h2><b>The Root of Man's Problems</b></h2><br>Two years after Toynbee's work was published, Dr. Karl Menninger, the famous psychiatrist, wrote his popular book,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?</i>His motivation for writing the book was the alarm he felt because a growing number of clergymen were becoming discouraged in their ministries. "One distraction of the modern clergy," he wrote, "is the multiplication of methods for dealing with troubled people: psychoanalysis and other psychotherapies" (Menninger,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?</i>p. 224). He also acknowledges basic selfishness as the root of man's problems, and is concerned that "neither the clergy nor the behavioral scientists, including psychiatrists, have made it an issue" (Menninger,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?</i>pp. 227–28).<br><br>What I hear both these men saying is that science and technology are moving ahead of religion and yet the sciences cannot solve our most serious problem--the human problem--which is rooted in man himself.<br><br>Menninger argues that there is a solution--man must change. But the people who can help, the clergy and social scientists, are ignoring the core issue. He further affirms:<br><br><i>The popular leaning is away from notions of guilt and morality. ... Disease and treatment have been the watchwords of the day and little is said about selfishness or guilt or the "morality gap." And certainly no one talks about sin!...</i><br><br><i>... Clergymen have a golden opportunity to prevent some of the accumulated misapprehensions, guilt, aggressive action, and other roots of later mental suffering and mental disease.</i><br><br><i>How? Preach! Tell it like it is. Say it from the pulpit. Cry it from the housetops.</i><br><br><i>What shall we cry?</i><br><br><i>Cry comfort, cry repentance, cry hope. Because recognition of our part in the world of transgression is the only remaining hope.</i>[Menninger,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?</i>p. 288]<br><br>Doesn't this challenge remind you of the words of Alma, that great missionary, who had so joyfully experienced that marvelous redeeming love of the Savior when he had repented of his sins?<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1-2?lang=eng#primary">Alma 29:1–2</a>]<br><br>In order for us to appreciate the unique gift of repentance and the plan of redemption, let us review the circumstances which created such a need.<br><h2><b>Consequences of Disobedience</b></h2><br>As the descendants of our first parents in the flesh, Adam and Eve, we have inherited the consequences of their disobediences to God's law. One consequence was spiritual death, which meant that Adam and Eve and their posterity would be banished from the presence of God, to die as to the things of the spirit. They also became mortal when partaking of the forbidden fruit, subjected to physical deterioration, weakness, and, finally, physical death.<br><br>By themselves, Adam and Eve were powerless to rectify the situation. The tempter's beguiling influence had caused sin and death to impede man's eternal progression. Lest they partake of the tree of life and live forever in their sins, the Lord God mercifully placed cherubim and the flaming sword to guard the tree so that Adam and Eve would be given a period of mortal probation, providing them with the opportunity to repent and be reconciled with God.<br><h2><b>To Satisfy the Demands</b></h2><br>By covenant, in the premortal existence, Jehovah, the First Begotten of the Father, demonstrating the highest expression of love for our Father and his brother and sisters, offered himself as the Redeemer of fallen man. He did so willingly, as a divine sacrifice, to satisfy the demands of the broken law. Adam should have paid such a penalty but was unable to do so. It required a god--an infinite sacrifice by one who was entirely guiltless--whose motives were pure and free from desires for personal aggrandizement, one whose only motive was to glory the Father.<br><br>The heavens resounded with joy and thanksgiving. We were there. We enthusiastically sustained Jehovah, our Savior. We learned that, although mortality would be a severe trial, the means would be provided to see us through to our eternal destiny. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the glad tidings, the plan of salvation which enables us to return to our Heavenly Father purified and redeemed.<br><br>After having the plan of salvation revealed to him in a mighty vision, Joseph the Prophet declared:<br><br><i>This is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us--</i><br><br><i>That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.40-41?lang=eng#p39">D&amp;amp;C 76:40–41</a>]<br><br>To be redeemed from physical death, Jesus provided immortality through the resurrection of the body. Just as the fall of Adam was universal in nature, affecting all mankind, so is the Resurrection. All mankind is entitled to be resurrected. Justice demands it. We had nothing to do with the act which subjected us to mortal death, and we alone are incapable of overcoming death. We therefore should not be penalized for it.<br><h2><b>Redemption from the Effects of Sin</b></h2><br>Deliverance from spiritual death is another matter. Not only was satisfaction to be made for the transgression of Adam, but a redemption was also provided from the effects of men's individual sins. Spiritual rebirth is extended to us as an act of mercy by a loving Father. He has placed certain conditions upon those who would qualify. As Father Lehi taught,<br><br><i>Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.6?lang=eng#p5">1 Nephi 10:6</a>]<br><br><i>Behold he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7?lang=eng#p6">2 Nephi 2:7</a>]<br><br>Alma also persuasively taught the plan of redemption to his errant missionary son Corianton in Alma 42:<br><br><i>And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also. ...</i><br><br><i>Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man. ...</i><br><br><i>But there is ... a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed. ...</i><br><br><i>But ... mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</i><br><br><i>For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.15,18,22-24?lang=eng#p14">Alma 42:15, 18, 22–24</a>]<br><h2><b>Christ's Suffering</b></h2><br>Let us consider for a moment the incredible price paid by our Savior. It is beyond our mental capacity to understand it completely. We come closer to comprehending it through the Spirit. President John Taylor insightfully shares with us his perception of Christ's suffering. Perhaps we can gain some feeling for it.<br><br><i>Groaning beneath this concentrated load, this intense, incomprehensible pressure, this terrible exaction of Divine justice, from which feeble humanity shrank, and through the agony thus experienced sweating great drops of blood, He was led to exclaim, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." ... His mind surcharged with agony and pain, lonely and apparently helpless and forsaken, in his agony the blood oozed from His pores. Thus rejected by His own, attacked by the powers of darkness, and seemingly forsaken by His God, on the cross He bowed beneath the accumulated load, and cried out in anguish, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" When death approached to relieve Him from His horrible position, a ray of hope appeared through the abyss of darkness with which He had been surrounded, and in a spasm of relief, seeing the bright future beyond, He said, "It is finished! Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." As a God, He descended below all things; ... as a man, He grappled with all the circumstances incident to His sufferings in the world. ... He struggled with and overcame the powers of men and devils, of earth and hell combined; and aided by this superior power of the Godhead, He vanquished death, hell and the grave, and arose triumphant as the Son of God, the very eternal Father, the Messiah, the Prince of peace, the Redeemer, the Savior of the world.</i>[John Taylor,<i>Mediation and Atonement</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Publishing Co., 1892), pp. 150–51]<br><br>Is it any wonder that the Father proclaimed, "This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17?lang=eng#p16">Matthew 3:17</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.7?lang=eng#p6">3 Nephi 11:7</a>)? Can such an offering be taken lightly? B. H. Roberts answers:<br><br><i>The severity of the atonement should impress men with the fact that we live in a world of stern realities; that human actions draw with them tremendous consequences that may not be easily set aside if the actions in which they have their origin are wrong.</i><br><br><i>Moral laws have their penalties and physical laws have their consequences; ... Violations of moral law are attended by shame and suffering. Suffering is the consequence or the penalty of violating divine moral law; and the penalty must be paid either by the one sinning or by another who shall suffer vicariously for him and make satisfaction to the law.</i><br><br><i>Man, when he sins by breaking the laws of God . . commits a crime against divine law ... against the majesty of God; and thereby dishonors him.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>The Truth, the Way, and the Life</i>, unpublished manuscript, chapter 43]<br><br>To many Church members, salvation is an escape from a penalty of sin rather than deliverance from sinfulness. Salvation is more than forgiveness from past sins only. Christ, in his mercy, extends his healing power to purge our desire to sin and to purify us from carnal and sensual appetites, so that the very thought of sin may be abhorrent to us.<br><h2><b>"A Mighty Change in Our Hearts"</b></h2><br>An example of this is recorded in the fifth chapter of Mosiah. When the people of Benjamin heard his powerful discourse on the plan of redemption and were converted, they testified that the Lord "has wrought a mighty change ... in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng#p1">Mosiah 5:2</a>).<br><br>Faith unto repentance is God's supernal gift. It is spiritual manna. It fills us with hope and anticipation of deliverance because we are weak and subject to the enticements of the flesh. We do not overcome all our bad habits and gain mastery of the flesh and the sophistries of Satan with simple effort and halfhearted attempts. We must learn the process of faith unto repentance, which leads to forgiveness, if we are to have peace in our hearts.<br><br>Elder Orson F. Whitney reminds us:<br><br><i>Repentance is not that superficial sorrow felt by the wrongdoer when "caught in the act"--a sorrow not for sin, but for sin's detection. Chagrin is not repentance. Mortification and shame alone bring no change of heart toward right feeling and right living. Even remorse is not all there is to repentance. In highest meaning and fullest measure, repentance is equivalent to reformation; the beginning of the reformatory process being a resolve to "sin no more."</i>[Roy W. Doxey,<i>Latter-day Prophets and the Doctrine and Covenants</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1964). II: 257]<br><br>Elder Nephi Jensen adds:<br><br><i>Faith unto repentance is the great eternal saving principle. Faith unto repentance cleanses the mind, purifies the heart, chastens the affections, nerves the will with resolute strength to conquer evil, and ennobles and perfects character.</i>[Nephi Jensen,<i>The World's Greatest Need</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1950), p. 63]<br><h2><b>Three Essential Steps</b></h2><br>We have learned various formulas for repentance. But repentance is more than words just to be given lip service. Repentance is an arduous journey from darkness to light. There are at least three essential steps we must follow once we have acknowledged our guilt and desire forgiveness. The first is godly sorrow, the second is confession to proper authority, and the third is the making of a new covenant.<br><h3><b><i>Godly Sorrow</i></b></h3><br>When we truly repent, we experience godly sorrow. We are brought down to the depths of humility. We realize that we cannot cure ourselves; we must have divine help. Then do we reach up to our Lord for deliverance. As President Kimball observes:<br><br><i>When a true consciousness of guilt finally settles down upon the one who has sinned and he feels the heaviness of it--its throttling force and crushing power--only then can the sinner begin to realize how powerless he is on his own to rid himself of his transgressions.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft Inc., 1969), p. 339]<br><br>The Apostle Paul, who testified as a living witness of the grace of God, admonished the Corinthian Saints:<br><br><i>Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.1?lang=eng#primary">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>]<br><br>I love that phrase, "perfecting holiness in the fear of God"--"fear" meaning our profound love and admiration for God.<br><br>Paul had chastised them in a previous epistle; and they were sorry. He explained to them that there are varying degrees of sorrow.<br><br><i>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner,...</i><br><br><i>For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation ... but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.9-10?lang=eng#p8">2 Corinthians 7:9–10</a>]<br><br>When one has reached such a degree of humility that he realizes his complete dependency upon God, his soul is filled with love. He experiences communion with God and begins to feel a sanctifying power purging the soul. Only a consummate love for God can cleanse the mind, purify the heart, and deliver the soul from sinful disposition.<br><br>The road back is steep and difficult. The purging experience brings anguish of soul while justice exacts its measure. Pride and self-justification become part of the struggle between the spirit and the flesh. Satan does not give up easily. He knows that sin is bondage and he tries to convince us that we cannot fight the battle and win. He knows that sin enslaves the sinner by making him love sinful things. He knows that the only power that can take the love of sinful practice out of our hearts is complete and sincere repentance by one who loves the Lord--one whose faith in God will sustain him.<br><br>Typically the anguish of the transgressor is not limited to himself alone, neither is the sustaining power of prayer and faith. Parents, husbands, wives, and family all suffer and rejoice together.<br><br>May I share an experience which has touched my heart. Some years ago a young priesthood leader committed a serious moral transgression. A Church court was held and it was determined that it was necessary for him to be excommunicated. It was a severe blow to him and devastating for his family. The months that followed were hard to bear; the adjustment was overwhelming. His wife and family and parents shared in the humiliation. Many sleepless nights followed. Doubts, frustrations, and petitions to a merciful Heavenly Father occupied their waking hours.<br><br>For one full year, every Sunday, the man's loving father drove forty miles to the home of his son, where he conducted a father's personal interview. The spirit of love and compassion prevailed during these meetings. It was a time for encouragement, not condemnation; a time for instruction, the sharing of scripture and teachings of the living prophets; and a time for constant reassurance that he knew his son would have the courage to persevere.<br><br>Many fasts and much petitioning and special blessings by priesthood leaders provided his wife and family the strength to support and sustain him during his travail. At one time the young father had such a promising future in his occupation and in Church leadership. Now suddenly, his whole world had changed and he had to bear new, almost insurmountable burdens. Even with all his family support the young man knew that he personally had to walk the path of repentance.<br><br>One night, after many months had passed since the court action, he had a dream. He found that he was in the company of the priesthood leaders of his stake and each was building a tower made of bricks. The young man was proud of his skill in laying brick and he was pleased that he could build his tower faster and higher than his brethren.<br><br>Suddenly the tower began to reel and crumble. Vividly and frighteningly, he felt the excruciating pain of the bricks falling on top of him. Frantically he struggled. How could he be rescued in time? He was fighting for air. Just as he was losing consciousness, his brethren pulled him from the rubble. He was saved.<br><br>He felt relieved and grateful and terribly ashamed. He said, "Brethren, I have been a fake. I have been building a tower with inferior materials and inferior workmanship. I was driven by the desire to build faster and higher than anyone and now I've failed."<br><br>He inquired of his brethren, "Can I start again? Is it possible for me to build another tower" They said, "Yes, you can build another tower, but you'll have to scrape each brick clean. You must be certain that next time you build solidly and carefully and follow true construction principles."<br><br>He started from this dream in a cold sweat. It had been a portentous experience. He awakened his wife and told her of his dream. It was a time of deep emotion. This was the turning point. With strong resolve, he committed himself to a course of total repentance.<br><br>This story was told to the presiding brethren of the priesthood court some years later, when it had convened to consider his rebaptism. He bore his testimony of the mercy of God and the healing power of Christ. He had vividly experienced godly sorrow. He felt the Lord had accepted his offering. He now bore witness to the presiding brethren that he had truly repented of his sins, was willing to take upon him the name of Christ, and would serve him in righteousness. He expressed deep appreciation for the love of his wife, parents, and family, who stood beside him and sustained him through his ordeal.<br><br>Those who have traveled such a road would counsel us not to take repentance lightly. We must not gamble with the attitude that any time we want to be forgiven, we'll just turn it over to the Lord and let him handle it for us. Only those who have experienced godly sorrow know what is required to work repentance unto salvation.<br><h3><b><i>Confession To Proper Authority</i></b></h3><br>The next step in the process is appropriate confession. We must confess to the proper authority, who acts in behalf of the Church. The Lord has revealed a judicial process, founded upon love and equity, which meets the demands of justice but is tempered with mercy.<br><br>The question may be asked, "Why is confession necessary?"<br><br>First of all, the Lord commands it (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.20?lang=eng#p19">D&amp;amp;C 19:20</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42-43?lang=eng#p41">58:42–43</a>). Second, the offender cannot live with a lie in his heart and have peace of mind and enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The confession must be complete. It is like going to the dentist to have a tooth filled. All of the decay must be removed. If any remains, the infection will fester and you must repeat the procedure until it is done right.<br><br>To whom should confession be made? President Stephen L. Richards explains:<br><br><i>[First,] to the Lord, of course, whose law has been violated. [Second,] to the aggrieved person or persons, as an essential in making due retribution if that is necessary. [Third,] to the Lord's representative, his appointed judge in Israel, under whose ecclesiastical jurisdiction the offender lives and holds membership in the Kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Is the offender justified in by-passing his immediate Church authority and judge, and going to those who do not know him so well to make his confession? Almost universally, I think the answer should be No, for the local tribunals are in position to know the individual, his history [and circumstances]. ... [I]t is the order of the Church for confessions to be made to the Bishop.</i>[Conference Report, 3 April 1954, pp. 11–12]<br><br>To be a bishop is a most humbling experience. The bishop is given certain keys significant to his calling as a judge in Israel. He holds a sacred trust to keep, in utmost confidence, information which is divulged to him. Under no circumstance must that trust be violated. If he were to do so, he would be guilty before God.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, if any of you are carrying in your heart serious sins which have not been confessed to your bishop, may I implore you--do not let another day pass without contacting him. It is difficult to face up to this responsibility, but why carry such a heavy burden a day longer than is necessary? I have had so many experiences with people who have lived with a tortured soul for years, hoping that time would solve the problem or not wanting to come to grips with the problem.<br><br>I received a call one day from a sweet sister who asked, "Bishop, is it possible to be forgiven of adultery?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, under proper conditions of repentance."<br><br>She said, "I have not had a peaceful night's sleep for 15 years." Such a pity for her to have so many years of unhappiness!<br><br>Call your bishop on the telephone and say, "Bishop, I have a problem." He understands that language. He will sit down with love and compassion and explain to you what is necessary for you to do.<br><br>There are some people who feel there are other alternatives to confession. They would like to go from first base to third base and skip second, feeling that perhaps they could substitute service in the Church rather than have to confess. Others have increased their financial contributions to the Church, thinking that this would suffice. I don't know of any exceptions--one cannot gain true peace of mind without going to the official representative of the Lord and placing the matter in his hands for judgment.<br><h3><b><i>Making A New Covenant</i></b></h3><br>The third step is to make a new covenant with the Lord. We say, "Heavenly Father, if thou wilt forgive me and give me another chance, I will love thee with all my heart. I will take upon me the name of thy Son and covenant with thee to keep thy commandments and serve thee until the end." He has promised that, if we have fully repented, he will remember our sins no more (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42?lang=eng#p41">D&amp;amp;C 58:42</a>).<br><br>One who has felt his redeeming love must, like Alma, labor without ceasing to bring souls unto repentance, "that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.24?lang=eng#p23">Alma 36:24</a>).<br><br>The prophet Joseph Smith said, "The nearer we get to our Heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 241).<br><br>Besides sharing the glad tidings of the gospel, we should look for opportunities to render true Christian service. Develop a sensitive awareness for the poor and the needy. Cheer up the discouraged. Strengthen the weak. Share of your resources without expecting recognition and reward. For with what measure we have received the love of God, should we not share with those in need?<br><br>Each of us needs to repent. Each of us has old habits to break and new ones to form. No one of us has completely mastered the flesh.<br><h2><b>The Saving Power of Christ</b></h2><br>Now, all serious sins are not moral transgressions. Some people are held captive by the sin of hatred, or that of bitterness or an unforgiving heart; some have stolen, lied, and cheated. Each leaves an open wound. It will remain unhealed unless we come to terms with the Divine Healer through sincere repentance. For those who may refuse his invitation of redemption, it will be for them as if Christ had not atoned for their sins.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I came to appreciate the saving power of Christ, his great atonement, when I gained some comprehension of the heavy price which he paid for you and for me and for all sons and daughters of God who will come unto him. I gained an appreciation for my value as a human being by realizing what it cost him to purchase my salvation. "Hereby perceive we the love of God," said John, "because he laid down his life for us" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.16?lang=eng#p15">1 John 3:16</a>).<br><br>B. H. Roberts explained:<br><br><i>When the plan of redemption is contemplated with reference to what it cost the Christ, ... then we must set a higher value even upon physical life hereafter, for it was in order to bring to pass the resurrection of man to physical life and to make that life immortal that Christ suffered and died.</i><br><br><i>New glory must [also] attach hereafter to spiritual life, perpetual union between soul of man and soul of God. ... We must have a deeper reverence for the love of God and the love of Christ for man and higher regard for man himself, since God so loved him; for it was to give a manifestation of that love that the Christ suffered and died.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>The Truth, the Way, and the Life</i>]<br><br>A few years ago, Sister Clarke and I visited the Garden Tomb in Jerusalem. We had a wonderful spiritual confirmation of that hallowed ground upon which we stood. This is the most famous burial site in all the world, significant because it was the sepulcher in which the mortal body of Jesus was laid. But it is remembered and revered as absolutely unique, because this tomb is empty. Its occupant is risen. He arose victorious over death and sits in majesty with his Eternal Father. And, because he has risen, so shall we.<br><br>As we approach Eastertime, we stand in humble reverence as we witness the reality of his resurrection. We declare in words of soberness and certainty that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, the only name under heaven by which mankind may be saved. We testify that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, that no one can come unto the Father except through him.<br><br>I testify that he is the Divine Healer of men's troubled souls. I testify that he knows us and that he loves us and he is ever ready to extend his arm of mercy to you and me. I know that my Redeemer lives, and I bear this witness, solemnly and humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1>lity of Fear - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, I would like to share with you today some thoughts on the futility of fear.<br><br>Anciently the Lord spoke to Isaac, saying, "Fear not, for I am with thee" (Genesis 26:24). The admonition to "fear not" was clear and direct and meaningful. The promise that "I am with thee" was equally plain and direct and powerful.<br><h2><b>Freedom from Fear Is Essential</b></h2><br>Down through the ages the same admonition, the same assurance, has been extended to every living soul who is willing to qualify. And yet fear is prevalent throughout the earth. It stifles initiative, saps strength, and reduces efficiency. It weakens faith, brings doubts, and begets mistrust. Indeed, it tends to impede the very business of being. How negative, frustrating, and futile is fear.<br><br>Let us consider together then the futility of fear, so that we may overcome it and exclude it from our lives as much as possible. Then shall our efforts yield their full potential, and out minds will be unshackled and enlightened with eternal truth. Indeed, one of the four essential human freedoms listed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a message to Congress, is "Freedom from Fear" (January 6, 1941).<br><br>As we embark together on this brief voyage of discovery, I trust that we will grasp the helm of faith to guide us through some troubled waters. Emily Bronte's immortal words are apt.<br><br><i>No coward soul is mine,</i><br><i>No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:</i><br><i>I see Heaven's glories shine,</i><br><i>And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.</i><br>[<i>Last Lines,</i>1846]<br><br>How shall we then arm ourselves from fear?<br><h2><b>Ten Aspects of Fear</b></h2><br>Just like people, fear comes in all shapes and sizes. There are those who fear people; others fear things. Many fear the future, and some fear the past. Where do you fit in? I will present ten aspects of the futility of fear, and I trust that this sharing will be beneficial, uplifting, and arming.<br><br><b>First,</b>there is fear of God. Among all of the possible fears, this is the only one that is valid. However, it is not fear in the normal sense of lack of courage, but rather love, respect, and reverence. Indeed, fear of God in this sense can dispel all other fears. Two examples are the assurance and admonition to the Israelites, "the Lord is with us: fear them not" (Numbers 14:9), and Apostle Paul's rhetorical question, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31), meaning "who can prevail against us?" (JST Romans 8:31).<br><br>Fear, or love, of God also brings many other blessings besides courage. "It shall be well with them that fear God" (Ecclesiastes 8:12), for he is "gracious unto those who fear" him (D&amp;amp;C 76:5). Yes, fear, or love, of God releases us, frees us, just as acceptance of truth does, for "the truth shall make [us] free" (John 8:32).<br><br><b>Second</b>, there is fear of man. There are those who fear physical domination by others. The Psalmist gave good counsel that we should "not fear what flesh can do unto [us]" (Psalms 56:4). Solomon also gave the wise saying that "fear of man bringeth a snare" (Proverbs 29:25). It is hard for a child to realize this when someone sets upon him. Experience teaches that it is futile to be afraid, for fear attracts the attention of the bully and the derision of those who mock.<br><br>The Lord, through Moses, declared with firmness to the Israelites:<br><br><i>When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</i>[Deuteronomy 20:1]<br><br>To return good for evil not only overcomes fear, but also overcomes enmity. I remember when we had an unfriendly neighbor some years ago. He would play the radio very loudly and generally try to be objectionable--so much as to generate fear. I am glad I was prompted to retain a positive, cheerful demeanor which overcame fear and eventually broke down the barrier, for "perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).<br><br><b>Third,</b>much more prevalent than physical fear, is the fear of criticism, rejection, and verbal opposition. Again, the scriptures are replete with counsel and admonition. In latter-day revelation to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, the Lord said, in relation to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript of the Book of Mormon, "You should not have feared man more than God" (D&amp;amp;C 3:7).<br><br>Saul was rejected as king because, as he confessed to Samuel, "I feared the people, and obeyed their voice" (1 Samuel 15:24). Will you transgress the commandments of the Lord because you fear what others will say if you don't follow them in the ways of the world? "Fear ye not the reproach of men," the Lord counseled through Isaiah (Isaiah 51:7). In more recent times he has chided those who "will not open their mouths [to share the gospel] ... because of the fear of man" (D&amp;amp;C 60:2).<br><br>When we have something to tell others which will benefit them, protect them, or enlighten them, we should not hold back. There are so many people who are confused and discouraged, and who want a better way of life. How grateful they are when someone takes the time to share their happiness and purpose in life. Will you seek to share even more? You are a great power for good, providing your righteous potential is harnessed by service.<br><br>While I served as mission president in Scotland from 1975 to 1978, the Church received considerable opposition and criticism. On one occasion, three ministers made derogatory public statements in a particular city. I wrote an open letter to the local newspaper announcing that we would be holding a public meeting in that city to dispel some of the misunderstandings which were being voiced around. It was a wonderful meeting. We first showed the fine Church film "Meet the Mormons," and then I spoke to the large group concerning our beliefs and way of life. When we opened the meeting for questions, a number of people who were not members of the Church stood and said kind things about the Church and the Latter-day Saints they knew. Positive results ensued and the work moved forward.<br><br>What if we had feared the criticism? I remember receiving a telephone call from a missionary who was obviously a little fearful. He said, "President, what shall we do? We have a man from the local church who follows us wherever we go and tries to stop us from knocking on the doors."<br><br>The young missionary was surprised at my response. "Good," I said. "You will have much success there, for the adversary is getting worried." I told him of the experience of the early missionaries to the British Isles, just before the first baptisms took place in Preston. Elder Heber C. Kimball, grandfather of our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball, recorded it as follows:<br><br><i>By this time the adversary of souls began to rage, and he felt determined to destroy us before we had fully established the kingdom of God in that land, and the next morning I witnessed a scene of satanic power and influence which I shall never forget.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), p. 143]<br><br>After my wife and I were baptized in January 1951, many of our neighbors shunned us, sometimes crossing the street so they would not meet us face-to-face. This did not affect our attitude, however, and we would greet them normally. It was not long before they would come to us and say, "We have a child who is ill, would you pray for her?" or "I have a problem. Would you please give me some counsel and advice?"<br><br>There is never any need to fear opposition, criticism, or persecution, for we know what will be the outcome. The Lord's work goes forward even more strongly, for<br><br><i>the works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught. ...</i><br><br><i>Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 3:1, 3]<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>there are some who fear events, such as examinations and tests, interviews and journeys. These are all challenges which we need to shoulder. Fear usually brings failure. The Savior warned of "men's hearts failing them for fear" (Luke 21:26). Eleanor Roosevelt said, "You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face" (<i>You Learn by Living</i>, 1960).<br><br>There is an excellent example of this when Elisha's servant discovered that the Syrian army had surrounded the city of Dothan, wherein they dwelt. Fearfully, he said to the prophet, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?"<br><br>Elisha answered him firmly: "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:15–16). Well could he say this, for "Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:17).<br><br>One lesson we have to learn is that fear is the beginning of defeat. On the other hand, courage is the beginning of success. We gain courage by the realization that we have a lot going for us. We derive strength from the knowledge that the Lord is with us. To Abraham he declared, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield" (Genesis 15:1). This is exactly what we need in this tempting, permissive world--a shield to protect us from the "fiery darts of the wicked" (D&amp;amp;C 27:17).<br><br>One great event that some people fear is referred to as "the end of the world." We know that at the second coming of Jesus Christ it will be the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5, D&amp;amp;C 110:14)--dread being a synonym for fear. We can make it a great day for us, though, rather than a dreadful day. How? By qualifying, by complying, by following the Lord. It is futile to be afraid when we could be "looking forth for the great day of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 45:39).<br><br>As a young boy, not quite thirteen years of age, in September 1939, it was natural to have some momentary fear when I heard that war had been declared. Some of the children even speculated about the end of the world coming in those dark days that followed, when the invasion of England seemed imminent, and bombs were falling all around. We were not really afraid, however, for we had faith in God. We prayed and worked for deliverance, and miraculously it came.<br><br>Another futile fear that I dispelled some years later was the fear of heights. We were building our new chapel in Nottingham, England, with all the members helping. My specialty was laying floor tile and placing acoustic ceiling tile, mainly in the corridors and classrooms. There was a call for someone to fix some ceiling tiles at the very apex of the chapel ceiling. I don't know the height, but as I started to climb the ladder, it seemed like scaling Mount Everest. On reaching the top I had to measure exactly, then descend the ladder, cut the tiles to shape and size, climb once again and fit them in place. Certainly, the best way to overcome fear of heights is to "do it," as President Kimball has challenged. In fact, he has said, "Give me another mountain."<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>another event which strikes fear and apprehension into the hearts of many, is death. The prophet Mormon speaks of "that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked" (Mormon 6:7). This particular fear arises from misunderstanding of the purpose of life and lack of knowledge of the plan of our Eternal Father. It is vital to come to an understanding that death is not the end, but a new beginning, a necessary stage in our eternal progression. Fear of death accomplishes nothing if we are righteous, for "death is swallowed up in victory. ... victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:54, 57).<br><br>David, the shepherd/psalmist, gave us those magnificent words of comfort:<br><br><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i>[Psalms 23:4]<br><br>Speaking of death in this way gives the Lord's perspective, whereas talking fearfully of death creates fear and uneasiness.<br><br>Some years ago, a dear young friend of ours, Pat, was stricken with cancer. She was not afraid of death, but was concerned about her small children. She did not want to leave them while they were so young. Her great faith and courage were rewarded and she was granted a few vital years to care for her family before she peacefully passed away.<br><br>I think of another very dear friend, Joan, our closest friend in the Church, who was tragically killed by a car as she crossed a pedestrian walkway in Salt Lake City. She certainly did not fear death, for she was fully prepared. Everything was in order, in her personal life and in her personal papers. She was ready to meet the Lord.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b>we will consider other fears of the unknown. These may be experienced in a number of ways: fear of the dark, fear of change, fear of the future. Such fear can be overcome by faith, as the Lord showed as he rebuked the winds and the sea. "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" he challenged his disciples (Matthew 8:26).<br><br>The Lord's disciples succumbed to this type of fear on several occasions. When they saw Jesus walking on the water, he comforted them, saying, "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). Again, when he appeared to them after his resurrection, they were "terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit." He developed faith within them as he asked them to "handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:37, 39).<br><br>Reassurance from others is an important step toward faith. For example, there is the comfort given by parents to children afraid of the dark, or by a wife to a husband about to change his place of work. I remember during my Royal Air Force service in India and Burma, during World War II, one of our colleagues was always imagining a twisted stick to be a snake. We had to reassure him on numerous occasions to allay his fears. As Theseus remarked in Shakespeare's<i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>: "Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear!" (act 5, scene 1).<br><br>Again, concerning the future, is it unknown? The Lord has told us much about the future through his prophets. "Fear not," he has counseled, "let your hearts be comforted" (D&amp;amp;C 98:1). "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><br>The pattern of the scriptures is first a commandment, then a promise. Providing we live our lives in harmony with the commandments of God, there is no place for fear regarding the consequences. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I have a strong testimony of this--for while we have not sought for worldly possessions, we have always had sufficient for our needs since we put our hands to the gospel plough.<br><br><b>Seventh,</b>we have fear of responsibility. I remember just after I joined the Church, a great feeling of confidence came over me. I felt that since I had chosen the Lord's side, he was on my side. Several remarkable things happened, of which I will recount but two.<br><br>Although I had never had the courage to stand on my feet and speak in debate, either at high school or college, I found myself asking my branch president if I might give a talk in sacrament meeting. I still have the notes of that very first talk. It was on faith and works.<br><br>A few months after my baptism, a golden opportunity presented itself at my place of work, where I was a management trainee. Again I had that strong feeling of self-assurance, and I received my first promotion, which set my feet on the management ladder. I found that through my Church membership and the faith it engendered, I overcame the fear of taking responsibility.<br><br>I have always loved reading the Apostle Paul's epistles to Timothy and particularly cherish this advice: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7). I have learned to rely on the Comforter, even the Holy Ghost, to give me the feeling of peace and confidence, and to bring things to my remembrance.<br><br>Said the Savior: "Whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 10:55). How true that is, for in his Church the gift of the Holy Ghost is available to all. We can have the promptings of impending danger, as I have had on several occasions. We can have the discerning of places we should not go and things we should not do. It is futile to fear when the Holy Ghost is with you and the Lord himself is "on your right hand and on your left" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).<br><br>What of marriage responsibility? Are there some who delay marriage for fear of the responsibility? When my wife and I were married, we had the magnificent sum of twenty English pounds between us. Although young, we felt ready for the challenges and responsibilities that we knew lay ahead. What a glorious experience it has been for almost forty years now to shoulder responsibility and struggle together in building a happy home and a wonderful family of ten precious children.<br><br>From time to time I meet members of the Church who do not feel able to take responsibility as an officer or a teacher in the Church. I tell them of my experience in England. Literally within days of baptism I was called to head the youth program in the Nottingham branch. This was completely new to me and I felt inadequate, but I knew the Lord needed me. There were less than 7,000 members in the whole of the British Isles where there are now 40 stakes. We all had to be "anxiously engaged" in the work of saving souls, building the kingdom, and establishing Zion. So it is with all of us. It is futile to fear responsibility when we have been called to serve "by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority" (Articles of Faith 1:5).<br><br><b>Eighth</b>is fear of loneliness. Linked with this is the fear of being in a small minority. This type of fear often results in compromise of principles and giving in to the demands of others for fear of being lonely, or being the odd one out. In latter-day revelation, the Lord has given comfort and assurance to those in this situation.<br><br><i>Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:34]<br><br>Fear of loneliness includes fear of not having anyone to talk to, or being without help in time of need. These fears can be conquered by reaching out and giving service to others, becoming outward-looking instead of inward-looking. In order to have a friend, we must be a friend.<br><br>I think of dear Sister Amy Gent, who I was privileged to visit for fifteen years as a branch president, home teacher, and friend. The first time I visited her, she was eighty-seven years of age, and I was later honored to speak at the funeral of this wonderful lady who stepped from this life at age one hundred and two. Widowed twice, she was the only member of the Church in her extended family. Was she lonely? Never!<br><br>She read the scriptures every day and once asked me to take her some missionary tracts, which I thought were to vary her reading. I gave them to her, saying, "You will enjoy reading these, Sister Gent."<br><br>"Oh, they are not for me," she replied. "I visit an old lady and I want to share the gospel with her!"<br><br>Reaching out, helping, serving--this is the way we overcome the fear of loneliness.<br><br>A few weeks ago, a brother complained to me, "When I was away on business recently, in another part of the country, I went to church and no one spoke to me. I felt very lonely, especially as I was so far from home."<br><br>I paused and then asked, "How many people did you speak to?" At first he was a little annoyed, feeling I had not empathized, but then he smiled and said, "You're right, I did hold back instead of reaching out."<br><br><b>Ninth,</b>fear of the past haunts those who have transgressed and have not yet gained forgiveness and remission. It holds them back, but this should be but a temporary phase. As President Kimball has counseled:<br><br><i>To cure spiritual diseases which throttle us and plague our lives, the Lord has given us a sure cure--repentance.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), preface]<br><br>Furthermore, the Lord has given us a wonderful formula to enable us to remove fear and guilt:<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43]<br><br>Once we confess, we need have no more fear about being found out. What a tremendous burden is lifted, which otherwise would weigh us down interminably. Confession is the first major step in the process of repentance. Sincere repentance is many-faceted; it is more than confession. There must needs be a forsaking and turning away from transgression in all its sordid forms.<br><br>Then we can look forward to and, indeed, claim fulfillment of the promise of the Lord, that he will not only forgive, but remember our sins no more. What a contrast to the lot of those of whom Isaiah speaks:<br><br><i>Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? And who knoweth us?</i>[Isaiah 29:15]<br><br>On a number of occasions I have had the happy assignment to meet with those who have prepared to come back into the fullness of gospel blessings. What a great day it is for them. Fear of the past has fled and they are starting out anew. It is good to be able to say to them, "Today is the first day of the rest of your lives."<br><br>We need to spring-clean our lives, sweep out each nook and cranny and under the carpet. In the world of industry and commerce, which used to be my environment, regular inventory is taken. At these times, decisions are made to eliminate certain items from the inventory and to mark other items down in value.<br><br>We should take inventory in our lives, as did Scrooge, and cast out the dross so that we become unencumbered and free from fear of the past.<br><br>When recommendations are being considered for appointment to public office, investigation of the personal life and affairs of the nominee is becoming more frequent. Whether we have aspirations for success in the political, business, academic, or other spheres of activity, we should endeavor to keep ourselves "unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). In order not to fear the past, try not to do anything in the present that you will regret in the future.<br><br><b>Tenth</b>, and finally, there is fear of failure. There are those who will not even attempt to do something because they lack the self-assurance that they could accomplish it. I was raised with the old adage ringing in my ears, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." There is no disgrace in failure, and in any case, we have never failed until we give up. The four-minute mile eluded athletes for many years, but after trying again and again, Dr. Roger Bannister finally achieved it. Since then, athletes from many lands have broken this seeming barrier.<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner remarked on one occasion, "One of the evils of the world today is not failure, but low aim." Just as we should not fear to fail, neither should we fear to aim high. There was no question of failure in the mind of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, when, in the dark days of 1842, he penned the words, "Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!" (D&amp;amp;C 128:22).<br><h2><b>Take Courage!</b></h2><br>I say to you: Courage, young people! These are great times and there are great things to be accomplished. Develop your talents; do not hide them under a bushel. Prepare prayerfully, increase in faith and you will never have need to fear. We declare with the poet, Longfellow:<br><br><i>Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,</i><br><i>Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,</i><br><i>Our faith triumphant o'er our fears</i><br><i>Are all with thee--are all with thee!</i><br>[The Building of the Ship, 1849]<br><br>God bless and guide you, protect and inspire you. I testify to you of my love for the Lord Jesus Christ and bear especial witness of him as the risen Lord. I know truly that he is the Savior of the world. This is the living Church of the living Christ, and he speaks through a living prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Derek A.

<h1>t Love Him - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to thank the choir for their beautiful musical number "Let the Mountains Shout for Joy." They couldn't have chosen a song that I would have enjoyed more.<br><br>You see, I collect mountains. I treasure them. I think it began by being raised at the foot of Timpanogos on the Wasatch side (that is where you can see the sleeping princess). I love that mountain and everywhere I have gone I have found a mountain to love. We lived in Salt Lake City by Twin Peaks, and in Preston, Idaho, by Little Mountain, that for no reason just sprang up in the middle of a valley. Now we look out of our dining room and kitchen windows in Ogden to Ben Lomond Peak. Ben Lomond, I understand, was the prototype used in Paramount Pictures for their logo. It is a beautiful mountain.<br><br>Now let me tell you why I love them so. They have built my self-esteem, ever since I came across a little poem by Helen Lowrie Marshall. It is entitled "Greater the Soul."<br><br><i>I looked upon a mountain high</i><br><i>in grandeur rising to the sky.</i><br><i>And then I contemplated me,</i><br><i>how very small I seemed to be.</i><br><i>Yet, in this fragile frame of mind</i><br><i>God chose to house a soul divine.</i><br><i>Not in that glorious, sun-crowned peak,</i><br><i>but in this body, frail and weak.</i><br><i>God chose to give to you and me</i><br><i>the promise of eternity.</i><br><i>A child of His can such be small?</i><br><i>A soul is surely Heaven-tall.</i><br><i>No, the mountain stands that I might see</i><br><i>how greater is the soul of me.</i><br>[Helen Lowrie Marshall,<i>The Gift of Wonder</i>]<br><br>Will you think of that every time you go outside the buildings on this beautiful campus, framed by these wonderful mountains, and think of how much more worth you are than that gorgeous sight?<br><h2><b>Young People</b></h2><br>Well, I look about you and you look like a convention of the teenagers that have graced our home while we have been raising our eight children, sharing with us hundreds of gallons of ice cream and great barrels of carmel popcorn. On one occasion, when I was downtown, I called home and a young man answered the phone. I asked for each of my children in turn and he said, "None of them are here right now."<br><br>I said, "Oh? Who is this?"<br><br>He said, "This is Brent."<br><br>"What are you doing, Brent?"<br><br>"Oh, Bill and I are just sitting here having some chocolate ice cream and watching television."<br><br>It is always open house at our place, and they know it. I thanked him kindly and told him to keep taking messages, and if anyone needed me I would be home soon.<br><br>I have been trying to tell myself that you are just like those kids that I have laughed with and loved over the years and that I didn't really need to agonize like I have been doing over coming here to talk to you. But you see, I realize now that you are older and wiser and that most of you are students at this great university where the motto is "enter to learn and go forth to serve."<br><br>You advertise that the world is your campus, and I know that to be true. Wherever we go and see the Mormons meeting and greeting each other, someone is bound to say, "Rise and shout, the Cougars are out!" or "Did you hear about the BYU game?" Or you ask couples where they met and find that they were students together at BYU, and you know what a successful job BYU is doing. They are sending them out to serve, and what a great and wonderful contribution they are making everywhere in the world.<br><h2><b>Love the Lord</b></h2><br>I thought very carefully about what it is that I should say to you and would help you to be more prepared for your present and your future responsibilities. My message is very simple. It is to love the Lord.<br><br>In Corinthians it says, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). Be among them that love him! I just hope and pray that all those happy surprises promised for the obedient will be yours forever.<br><br>I want you to know that there is a generation of young people who are sending down tendrils of testimonies that are growing strong and taking root. All over the world we see them, and we know that the future is in good hands. But you must realize how few you are, compared to the rest of the world, and how very needed each one of you is in spreading this marvelous gospel.<br><br>I want you to appreciate the great miracle it is that we have the knowledge available to us today. It isn't just happenstance. I wish I had time to relate all of the stories we have that are examples of this. We feast at a table that we didn't even help to prepare.<br><br>For example, the prophet Mormon was only ten years old when he was given his first assignment. All the time he was performing his labors of abridging the records of this wonderful Book of Mormon, he knew that it wasn't for his people. He knew they wouldn't listen. They had proven it to him so many times that he gave up directing them as leader of the army, then repented, went back, and helped them again because he loved them. But he knew it wasn't for them that he labored. He saw<i>us</i>down the corridors of time and did all that he did and served all his life that we might have this great knowledge.<br><br>Then his son Moroni, who wandered in the world alone for twenty years, finished the record, secured it, and put it in the stone box in the Hill Cumorah to be found 1400 years later by Joseph Smith as he was directed by our Father in Heaven.<br><h2><b>Don't Take It for Granted</b></h2><br>When you think of all the effort that was given so we might have a knowledge of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, can you wonder that when Joseph Smith, a teenage lad, went to take those plates from the box, Moroni stopped him and said, "No, not yet"? Then, for at least four more years, Moroni helped to teach and prepare Joseph before he let those precious records go into his hands. Because of his trials, Joseph Smith made the statement, "If I had not actually got into this work and been called of God, I would back out. But I cannot back out: I have no doubt of the truth" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 286).<br><br>Don't ever take it for granted. Don't ever just put it aside and think that it is something you will learn about later. Many of you are returned missionaries, and I'll bet you can recite exactly what happened on the day you received your call. I know what happened in our house every time a mission call was received. You wait eagerly for your letter from a prophet of God. You immediately call the family and tell them where you are going to serve and what your instructions are. Can you imagine such a scene as having that letter arrive at a home and the missionary picking it up and tossing it on the table, or putting it on the bookshelf, or leaving it in a drawer, and saying, "Well, I'll read that some day and find out what my instructions are"? But we do this often with the scriptures, and they are our mission call, they are our books of instructions.<br><h2><b>Where's the Manufacturer's Guide?</b></h2><br>Not long ago I had the great privilege of visiting with my daughter as she moved into a new home, the home that had been built just for them. They were putting things away and as they started to use the new equipment, they found things didn't work just the way they were supposed to. The first time they tried to use the oven it nearly fell out of the wall. They said, "Where is that manufacturer's guide?" From that, my son-in-law found how to secure the oven to the wall and how to connect the power and make it useful.<br><br>A little while later the dishwasher flooded. They said, "Where is that manufacturer's guide?" We found it and learned that the packing hadn't been taken out of the dishwasher before it was run. Over and over we found ourselves needing these guidebooks.<br><br>I had the special assignment of putting things away in the laundry and sewing room because that is my personal domain. Every time I visit, it is my privilege to reign supreme over that room and the mending. I intended to be a cookie grandma, but that is not the way it turned out. My daughter says, "Mother, I'll fix the food; you just thread the needle." As I was putting things away, I said to her, "Where do you want me to put this little book of instructions for your sewing machine?"<br><br>She said, "Very close! Every time something disturbs the tension we have to read it and see how to adjust it again." She was expounding wisdom that even she didn't realize.<br><br>You who have spent Christmas Eve putting tab A into slot B and trying to connect angle C to D, know how important a manufacturer's guide can be. Wouldn't you think that if it is so critical for such things as dishwashers, ovens, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, and toys, that it would be even more important for the greatest creation of all?<br><br>In Psalms it says, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? . . . For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour" (Psalms 8:4, 5). That includes you girls too, you know, because it says in Genesis "So God created man in his own image . . . ; male and female created he them. . . . And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Genesis 1:27, 31).<br><h2><b>Our Book of Instructions</b></h2><br>Oh yes, you have a manufacturer's guide. He wouldn't send us, the greatest creation of all, without a book of instructions. We have in our possession those instructions that can give us all the answers for our day. Appreciate the knowledge that you have available to you. I say to you the answers are there. Whatever your problems are, you can find the answer in the manufacturer's guide written by the creator of us all, who knows us best and understands our problems.<br><br>I heard Elder Paul Dunn challenge the students of Weber State College at one time to make a periodic comparison between their scriptures and their textbooks. Some of you know that you have to have a new textbook for the same class by the time next semester comes because either theory has changed or man's meager knowledge has increased. Elder Dunn knew wherewith he spoke because his college chemistry book says the atom cannot be split. I also know about change because my college chemistry book says uranium is a useless metal. We laugh at this now, but uranium had no use at that time.<br><br>Have the scriptures changed? No, they are constant. They can be counted on. They have weathered the test of time. They have the revealed word of God and the truth for our day or for any day.<br><h2><b>Problems Make Us Grow</b></h2><br>This morning in our Relief Society lesson the teacher said, "Do any of you have problems?" We all chuckled and laughed. She asked, "Are there any of you who do<i>not</i>have problems? If there are some who have no problems, I really feel sorry for you, because it is the problems that make us grow." It is part of the plan. It is the reason we came. We voted for it. Not only did we vote for the plan, but the scriptures tell us in Job that we shouted for joy (Job 38:7). So we feel sorry for you if you don't have some problems. But somewhere we all agreed to come and face the very problems we are facing today.<br><br>So what are your problems? You are here as students. What might you find as an answer? The Lord says "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all they getting get understanding" (Proverbs 4:7).<br><br>Are you looking for a way to make a living? Of course you are. What does he say, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). Are you looking for a mate? Of course you are. Do you know what he says about that? He says, "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life" (Proverbs 4:23). If you are making a hard decision he says, "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers" (2 Corinthians 6:14). Is there a lesson in that for you? Are you tempted? Read the story of Joseph sold into Egypt by his brothers. His father thought he was dead; his mother was dead. He was a seventeen-year-old boy, with nobody to give him support, no one to see what he was doing. Yet when Potiphar's wife tempted him, he said, standing firm and true, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9).<br><h2><b>God Is Our Refuge and Strength</b></h2><br>In times of calamity is there hope? Is there help? Oh, how I clung to certain words when our second daughter died! How much it meant to me to read "be still and know that I am God" or "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16, Psalms 46:1). Do you feel your own inadequacies sometimes? I do, and then I think of 2 Timothy:<br><br><i>Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</i><br><br><i>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</i>[2 Timothy 1:6, 7]<br><br>Oh, there is great comfort in that for every assignment that comes our way. Do you worry about peer pressure? Are there those who are trying to convince you to do something that you know you shouldn't do? It's getting difficult these days to decide how not to hurt a friend who invites you over to show a movie on a VCR and you find it is something you really didn't want to take into your heart and mind.<br><br>Think of the story of Elisha, whose servant awoke one morning and found that they had been surrounded by all kinds of chariots, horses, and armies. He said, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?" Elisha answered, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:15, 16). And the poor servant, seeing only the two of them, didn't understand. So Elisha prayed that his eyes might be opened, and the servant saw Elisha surrounded by hoards of chariots of fire and armies to battle for them.<br><br>If you only knew how many people on the other side are cheering for you, if you knew in a hard moment how many are over there saying, "Come on, you can do it, you can do it," you would know that there are so many more with you than with your enemy or those who would lead you astray.<br><br>If you would just read the scriptures. I could go on and on. If you think your prayers aren't being answered, read the story of Daniel. Daniel pled with the Lord and finally the Lord said,<br><br><i>Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard.</i>[Daniel 10:12]<br><br>Your words are heard. All of our words are heard by a loving Father in Heaven who wants to helps us and who will do so if we will but let him. But if we put our letter of instructions in the drawer or over on the table and don't get into it to find the answers, he can't give us the answers. I plead with you that you will take these into your hearts, into your hands, and into your heads--that into these wonderful books you will enter to learn and go forth to serve.<br><h2><b>An Average Day in America</b></h2><br>I wish that all were well in Zion and that I could just tell you how wonderful the young people are across the world in the Church. But I picked up an article called "On an Average Day in America" in an airline magazine. Besides telling how many hot dogs are sold in the O'Hare Airport and how many gallons of mustard go on them, it gives some more important statistics.<br><br>On an average day in America<br><br><i>--5,962 couples will wed and before the sun sets 2,986 will divorce</i><br><br><i>--2,740 teenage girls will get pregnant</i><br><br><i>--someone is raped every 8 minutes, murdered every 27 minutes, robbed every 78 seconds</i><br><br><i>--a car is stolen every 33 seconds</i><br><br><i>--3,231 women will have an abortion</i><br><br>[<i>American Way,</i>July 1980, p. 64–67]<br><br>Can you begin to see the need? Oh, how our Father in Heaven is counting on you! There is a great responsibility that goes with the privilege and blessedness of having received the added knowledge that is ours.<br><h2><b>"I Don't Want You to Move"</b></h2><br>Who's responsibility is it? Well, I've told and retold a little story about one of our sons, but I think it illustrates a point so I will tell it to you. Our youngest son has lived all of his life in one house. It isn't a grand mansion, but it has been a good home. He never intends to leave it or live anywhere else. He always expected to go on a mission, but he said, "I'll go and then I'll come back." He went around to the neighbors and said, "I don't want you to move, and I don't want you to move, and don't you dare let them sell the house. I'm the youngest and if they move into a condominium, I'll be devastated and have to come home."<br><br>We said, "What if we're called on a mission?"<br><br>He thought it over very seriously and replied, "I think we had better take turns. I'll go and you take care of it and when I get back you can go."<br><br>We said, "What if we're still here when you bring a bride home?"<br><br>He said, "I've thought about that. I'm considering remodeling the garage into an apartment for you."<br><br>Well, his father had had a heart attack and no one else was home but just Scott. One day, as things were looking pretty bad, I appealed to this next owner of the property and said, "You know we need to do the lawn, the shrubs, and a little painting." And he couldn't have been less interested in anything. I mean he had important things to do. I think right then he was recording the Beach Boys and Fresh Aire tapes.<br><br>Well, I thought it was time for one of those "reprove with sharpness and then show forth an increase of love lest they esteem thee to be thine enemy" (someone called them "woodshed") talks. I daresay each of you has had a few of them. I said, "If you really do intend to live here the rest of your life, then you of all people should be concerned about the kind of repair it's kept in, because, before you know it, it will be yours with all of its accumulated problems. Not ours, but yours."<br><br>A little minor miracle happened. The shrubs were trimmed, the lawn was not only cut but crosscut. I didn't know that it could look like green velvet if you went in two directions. He began to take great interest in calling it "the best yard on the block." It became almost that. With his effort we even got a little painting done.<br><h2><b>It Is Your World</b></h2><br>Why do I tell you this? Because I think every one of you is in exactly the same position, only it is your world. Young people, you had better see to its repair! Before you know it, it will be yours, with all its accumulated problems. If you intend to spend the rest of your life in it, and raise your family in it, then you had better see to its repair.<br><br>Where could you begin? I think of the statement by President Kimball who was speaking to youth some years ago and said:<br><br><i>What a glorious day in which to live! O Youth of a noble birthright, the world is at your feet! You were born at this time to have dominion tomorrow over the earth and all things therein. What a priceless heritage. But there are detours and you could miss the way. You can grovel in the earth or you can climb to the skies. In this life's university you can fail or you can graduate with high honors. All depends on you and your attitudes and determinations.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>13 February 1960, p. 4]<br><br>What kind of a world is it you want? I think you had better decide and decide to do something about it, because until you see it as your problem, it is not going to change. Listen to these words of your BYU president, Jeffrey Holland. He feels it is incongruous that we live today in a society in<br><br><i>Which a whale or porpoise or snail darter or lousewort, along with any bird or blade of grass in a national park,</i>[<i>is</i>]<i>entitled to greater legal protection than a five-month-old fetus.</i>[<i>"Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall:</i>A Look at the<i>Me Decade," 1979 Devotional Speeches of the Year,</i>p. 47]<br><br>The world will be influenced by what you learn, by what you think, by what you do. You have a great message to carry and a great responsibility to share it with others.<br><h2><b>They Are Everyone's Problems</b></h2><br>My sister Jennie Carlile is a seasoned counselor at Provo High School. Coming into this area, I asked her, "What do young people here need to hear?"<br><br>She answered, "I wish we could teach our students to accept the responsibilities and consequences of their own actions."<br><br>Are these just others' problems that I have talked about on an average day in America? I had two calls last month from Utah County in my office; one of them pleading for help because their Laurel president had just overdosed on drugs and was in the hospital. The leader said, "We have an epidemic down here. What can we do to help them?"<br><br>The other caller said that three in their Young Women's program were pregnant out of wedlock. No, these are not just someone else's problems. They are your problems, and my problems, and the problems of everybody who wants to turn the world around.<br><br>Someone asked President Elaine Cannon, "How bad does the world have to get before the Lord will cleanse it again?"<br><br>She said, "That is not the question. The question is 'How<i>good</i>do we have to get?'" We are the Lord's chosen people. We are charged with raising a generation worthy to receive the Savior when he comes. Will you be part of that generation? Will you help to bring about that great event?<br><br>As we look to the scriptures, we have the word of our maker. He says:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.</i><br><br><i>Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time--for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.</i><br><br><i>For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.</i><br><br><i>For the great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 43:23, 27–30]<br><h2><b>Get Ready for That Day</b></h2><br>Do you remember the story in 3 Nephi where the Savior appeared on this continent? Oh, I love the Book of Mormon and I love those who prepared it for putting a little line at the bottom that gives us the chronology of the time. It starts at 600 years before Christ. Then it is 500, 400, 300, 75, and 33, and then Samuel the Lamanite, standing on the walls of the city, says, "Oh, get ready for the day. It is only five years until the Savior will be here. Put your lives in order and prepare to receive him when he comes."<br><br>The five years passed and nothing happened. So the ruler of the day said, "Oh, those foolish people who listened to Samuel the Lamanite. If they don't put away that belief, they will lose their lives on the morrow." Another Nephi, who was their leader at the time, pled with the Lord and cried unto him that they shouldn't be destroyed for their obedience. Finally, through his pleadings came the voice of the Savior saying, "Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world" (3 Nephi 1:13).<br><br>The sign was that the sun would go down but the light would remain; a day and a night and a day as bright as day. When the sign came, many believed and repented and put their lives in order. They knew by that sign that the Savior had been born. Yet thirty-three years later the world was so wicked that it was cleansed with trials and tribulations such as the world had never seen before. Those who were left, the more righteous of them (2,500 of them, as the scriptures tell us;<i>see</i>3 Nephi 17:25), found their way to the temple, heard the voice of God introducing the Savior, and saw him as he descended and came among them.<br><br>This was no passing vision. This was no dream. He stayed with them and taught them. We have that beautiful story of how he called the children and blessed them one by one. As angels surrounded them with fire, he said, "Behold your little ones" (3 Nephi 17:23). After this magnificent event there was peace on the earth for 200 years because all those who had seen, all those they told, and all those<i>they</i>told, for that many generations, believed in Jesus Christ. Oh, how many times do we read that pride came in and destroyed the people again.<br><br>We don't know what the chronology of our time is. No one has marked down on our calendars just how long it will be again. But you have to take your cue from a dynamic prophet of God who has told us to lengthen our stride, increase our faith, extend our reach, and "do it." Someone asked President Kimball, "What is it we need to do?" and he said, "You all know what it is you need to do. The problem is doing it."<br><br>He has given us our cue. He is the one who tells us we are in the Saturday night of time. Is there a moment to lose? Is there time to take things for granted? Is there time to let the dust accumulate without reading our instructions, finding out what it is we are supposed to be doing and then doing it? The time is urgent.<br><h2><b>You Are Called in This Day</b></h2><br>I plead with you to take it seriously, to accept the responsibility of your own actions, and to make a difference in the lives of others. I love the story of Queen Esther in the Old Testament. What a very difficult thing she had to do. It would have cost her life if she went before the king unbidden. But Esther's cousin Mordecai said to her, "Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" (Esther 4:14).<br><br>If I could call you each by first name, I would say, "Liz and Nicki and Jan and Betty, or Robert, John, Bill or Todd, who knoweth but<i>thou</i>are brought to the kingdom for such a time as this?" You have already proven that you have all the qualities of excellence that are needed to succeed by being reserved this long to come forth at this time.<br><br>Don't waste it after waiting so long for your turn. You aren't called to cross the plains. You aren't called to seek the Holy Grail. You are called to stand firm in a world that needs you badly and to stem the tide of sin and error that is in the world today. Those are the words President Kimball said to us as we were called to the Young Women presidency.<br><br>You are called in this day and age to stem the tide of sin and error in the world today. Oh, how much there is to do. How few are the laborers in the vineyard. How we need every single one that will hear.<br><br>As I talk about those things that are happening around us, I want to make one thing very clear to you. If some of those mistakes that I have mentioned have been made by you, please do not think for one minute that I am here to condemn you. One of my other favorite stories is of the Savior, who said to the accusers of the adultress, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." Each one went away with his stone unthrown, carrying the weight of his own iniquities, "and Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:7, 11).<br><h2><b>It Is Never Too Late</b></h2><br>All of us carry the burdens of some mistakes that we have made. But Enos and Alma and Saul, oh, so many of the prophets, have told us about the joy that can come from turning a life around. It is never too late to turn a life around. It is always worth the effort. It is always worth the pain.<br><br>Let me tell you one little story of a man in Haiti named Alexander Moura. He recorded it for us, so I don't think he would mind my sharing it with you. This man found a little pamphlet of the Joseph Smith story. He picked it up and read it, and he said that he was electrified. He knew it was true. He can't understand why anyone wouldn't know by reading it that it was true. He had tried everything he knew to find meaning in his life, including voodooism, and nothing had helped. But he knew the truth of that little story.<br><br>He wrote to the address on the pamphlet and asked for more information. It was a long time coming, but eventually he received some additional literature and a Book of Mormon. He declares that he never closed his eyes from the time he began to read to the time that he finished it. Now try that for a challenge. He had no need to put the test of Moroni 10:4 to work. He knew from the very first words of 1 Nephi that this was the word of God.<br><br>At that point he climbed on an airplane and went to Florida to ask for baptism, with his cigarettes still in his pocket. You see, he hadn't heard about that yet. No one had told him about the Word of Wisdom. As the mission president explained the Word of Wisdom, tithing, and a lot of other things that become stumbling blocks for some other people, he gently moved the wastebasket over and Brother Moura dropped the cigarettes in and never smoked again.<br><br>We asked him if this was difficult--a silly question, because this was a man who had smoked four to six packs a day for years and years and years. He averaged about twenty-six cups of coffee in a day, six or seven before he could get to his store and function. He was a frequent drinker of liquor. He answered that he had tried to quit before, many times, but he would get so ill he couldn't get to the store. There wasn't any way he could stop. He would try and try, then give it up and go back. But he testifies that with the help of the Lord he never had another craving.<br><br>He knows that a miracle happened in his behalf. Just last fall Elder Thomas S. Monson dedicated the land of Haiti, and with Alexander Moura were 155 members of the Church. All from that small beginning. That land has many branches now and people are hearing this great voice of gladness, the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Our Responsibility</b></h2><br>It is the hope of the world. It is the great need of the world. And whose responsibility is it to carry it? It is everyone's who has received it. The scripture says, "it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor" (D&amp;amp;C 88:81). It is our responsibility.<br><br>As I think about the people who need to turn their lives around, I wonder why it is that they don't apply the things they learn on Sunday to what they do on Saturday night. So often they don't. We ask groups of bishops, young people, parents, leaders, and we get some interesting answers.<br><br>A group of young people from Southern Utah thought about the question and the very one that you would have chosen, the football hero, decided he would be spokesman for the group. He said, "We're going to. We all picture ourselves as good, active members of the Church, but we just have to try the ways of the world a little first."<br><br>Oh, what dangerous words those are. Why are they so dangerous? Because the Spirit withdraws if we aren't doing the things we are supposed to do. It is our greatest protection and help in time of need, but it withdraws because it can't dwell in us if we are in the wrong place and are doing the wrong things. And another thing, who knows when we might run out of time? We don't know the chronicle of our days. It may be later that we think. Also, the way of the world is too often the road to heartbreak.<br><br>How much better if we could prevent the road to heartbreak, even though there is always hope of turning a life around. It is like the old sage says, that we are "too soon old and too late smart." I echo again my daughter's words. She referred them to her sewing machine; I refer them to you and the scriptures. "Keep the book of instructions very close. Every time someone disturbs the tension we have to read and find out how to adjust it again."<br><br>You can do that. You can adjust the tension in your lives by keeping the books of instructions very close. And if you think that you are worth it, you will keep the commandments. I am quite sure that it's when we don't understand who we are or what we are or how important we are that we make the mistakes we do.<br><h2><b>You are Something!</b></h2><br>If you need proof of your worth, consider these five things.<br><br>First, God is our Father. We are his children. We have in us the spark of divinity that comes from a Father that is divine.<br><br>Second, we are made in his image. We are created to be like him. We, male and female, have been created in the image of divinity.<br><br>The third one is our choice in the premortal existence. We did something right. We chose the right way! We are here with a mortal body, and that proves we did something right.<br><br>We must have done something wonderful to merit what we have. There was a missionary in Brazil that finally came to a realization of how favored and blessed he was. He wrote home and said, "Wow, I must really be something to have been born in this time when the gospel is on the earth, to have been born into my home with my parents and brothers and sisters, to have been called to the best mission in the world, and to have had my companions, my mission president, my converts, and to meet these people." You are something! Count your blessings.<br><br>The fourth one is the plan of salvation--that wonderful plan that was made for us to become like our Father in Heaven. We had come to a point where we couldn't progress any farther. So this great plan for us to come here and be proven was brought to pass. "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).<br><br>I didn't realize that everyone didn't know that when I first left home. I was in Georgia and a girl asked me to tell her about the Mormon church and what I liked about it and what I believed. I told her the obvious things about the Word of Wisdom, tithing, and going to church on Sunday. She threw her hands in the air and exclaimed, "Merciful heavens! I want to be religious and hear a good sermon on Sunday, but I'm certainly not going to let it interfere with my life."<br><br>She didn't know about the plan of salvation--that life is a part of eternity, as much as any part before we came or after we leave. It is all one round whole of the plan of salvation.<br><br>The fifth one, if you need a feeling of self-worth, is to remember that you had an elder brother, Jesus Christ, who lived and died for you. We had Christmas early this year. On 23 October we sat on Shepherd's Hill, looking across at Bethlehem where the Savior was born, and listen to Elder Mark E. Peterson give that last great address about the life of the Savior. I had a testimony before I went there. It didn't take that to tell me that he lives and loves us. But to walk the ground where he had been and to feel the spirit of the country and the conditions that are there now, and were there then, gave me an added appreciation for all that has gone before.<br><br>Ever since I came to know that my mistakes added to the weight of the Savior's agony in Gethsemane on that night, I have had a deep appreciation for what happened there. To be there, to feel it and to see it, made me love him all the more. He really did die for us. His suffering wasn't so much on the cross as it was in Gethsemane. He took upon him all those mistakes that you and I have made. What a tragedy it would be if that sacrifice where in vain. The only way we can make it valid is by doing all we can, by repenting, putting our lives in order, and making that sacrifice worth it for him and for us.<br><h2><b>We Love and Are Loved by Him</b></h2><br>I know that the Savior lives and loves us. I know that our Father in Heaven knows every one of us by our first names. He is not remote. Joseph Smith told us at one time, "If you were to see [God] today, you would see him like a man in form" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 345). And later, Brigham Young said, "If the veil were rent today and the great God who holds this world in its orbit and who upholds all worlds and all things by his power was to make Himself visible,--I say, if you were to see Him today, you would see Him like a man in form--like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man" (<i>JD</i>, 8:30).<br><br>We have a wonderful line of communication. He has given us that great opportunity to talk with him through prayer. He has sent us with a book of instructions, a manufacturer's guide. He knows us better than any one. Will you reach into it? Will you put it into your hearts and your hands? Will you go forth to serve? Will you be heir to and qualified for all those blessings that he has promised the obedient? "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>My only message tonight is be among them that love him. Appreciate what is yours. Count your blessings. Take it to others that they too might share in this wonderful gospel that is ours. I testify to you that he lives and loves us and that he guides our every action if we will but allow it. Truly, "The King of Love Our Shepherd Is," as the choir will sing to conclude this meeting.<br><br>I thank you for this opportunity. It is wonderful to be with you and see so many youth gathered in one place. You are dear to my heart and have become more so through my experiences of having served with Sister Cannon and Sister Darger in the presidency of the Young Women. We are thrilled that someone as concerned about you as Sister Ardeth Kapp is called to be the new president. We rejoice with her in the opportunity that is hers to go forth and see the wonderful youth of the Church. And we rejoice for them to have the blessings of her labors and her love.<br><br>I pledge with you that the Lord will bless you, whatever your problems are, if you will allow it, if you will get into the scriptures and make them a daily habit. Whatever your problems are, the answers are there. There is peace there, and acceptance, comfort, growth, power, the way to happiness, and the way to eternal life. May you find them all, I pray earnestly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Norma B.

<h1>g and Getting - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Throughout our years at the university, and for a considerable time thereafter, my wife and I lived in a congested area near downtown Salt Lake City. After graduating from law school, I was fortunate in obtaining a job at the state capitol. Church callings and the proximity of our home to my office caused us to be in no hurry to leave our small apartment, even had our financial situation allowed us to. One of the economies which my wife allowed me to practice was walking to work. The distance was not too great and the Capitol Hill climb kept me fit.<br><br>One brilliant, warm day, I had come home for lunch. As I was returning to work I noticed a small boy sitting on the curb at the foot of the hill. I knew him by sight as a neighbor who lived in a large apartment house next door to us. His parents were divorced. His mother worked and often left him alone in the afternoon to look after himself. As I was in no hurry to begin my ascent, I stopped to talk with him for a moment.<br><br>"What are you doing?" I said.<br><br>"Waiting for my brother."<br><br>"Where is he?" I asked as I contemplated the hot climb up the hill. His answer brought me immediately to attention.<br><br>"He's in school."<br><br>"Don't you know that school isn't out until 3:30?" I gently asked.<br><br>He shuffled his toe in the dirt of the street and looked at me with what I am now positive was condescension. "Sure," he said, "but I don't want to miss him."<br><br>"Maybe the kid had a point," I thought as I climbed the hill. And I have pondered his statement many times since that day.<br><br>Of course he did. Whatever his reason for wanting his brother--whether for love or loneliness or just to deliver a family message--it was of sufficient importance for him to wait on the curb at the side of a hot street all afternoon. He was not going to miss his brother, whatever the discomfort or whatever the cost. He had nothing more important to do.<br><h2><b>Giving and Getting</b></h2><br>It is difficult to sit in the sun on a street corner when all the world is hell-bent on seeking shade. But, as with many other things, it is where you sit that counts--or where you stand--or what you stand for. And with some things there is nothing more important to do than pay the price; even though it entails inconvenience or sacrifice.<br><br>Before getting much older, my young friend would find no shortage of those who would tell him he paid too much to see his brother that hot afternoon.<br><br>"Don't be dumb," they would say.<br><br>"You could have watched television until just before school let out."<br><br>Or they would say, "You should have stayed in the shade at home, instead of sitting on that dusty old curb."<br><br>"Be smart," they would say. "Don't give more than you have to, just to see your brother."<br><br>But did he give too much? Was he just a naïve little boy? Can we learn something from him? To simplify the subject, let me suggest that the real question on that street corner was how much to give in exchange for his brother's company that hot afternoon.<br><br>This question perhaps can be best understood by subdividing it into two:<br><br>How much was he<i>required</i>to give and how much could he give? It is a paradox that, when we speak of how much<i>must</i>be given, we usually speak of getting. Only when we talk in terms of how much<i>can</i>be given, are we really speaking of giving.<br><br>Most of us were born with an egotistical streak. It is common in children. As we grow up we try to become less self-seeking and more interested in the welfare of others. But many labor mightily to obtain or retain as much as they can while giving up as little as possible in every giving and getting transaction. I suppose everyone has played Monopoly with such a person. It is sobering to realize that life is a never-ending series of such transactions, dozens each day, and that the sum total of all these seemingly insignificant things constitutes our mortal probation.<br><h2><b>A Time of Waiting</b></h2><br>I remember what it is like to attend a university. I don't think I would voluntarily trade places with any of you, even if I could be young again. I remember the pain. I remember staying up all night to prepare for an examination. I vividly recall homework and homesickness, grades and graduation. I remember part-time jobs that never paid enough and roommates that borrowed things. I remember worrying about what to do and what to be (which, by the way, I believe are the same thing). I remember the relief when the books closed for the last time, and the diplomas were finally awarded. I remember thinking that at last I could get on with the real business of living.<br><br>The university was for me as it is for you, a time of waiting--and therein lies a danger. Everything a student does seems pointed to the future. Students are transients. Their hearts are often elsewhere. Summer jobs, lectures, credits--all of these promise a time when prosperity and peace will finally reign--when they can come home after work to a real home and do what they want; when one well-paying job will allow enjoyment of the important things like marriage or family or church service.<br><br>C. S. Lewis once said,<br><br><i>Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead.</i>[<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(Time Incorporated, 1963), p. 49]<br><br>The prophet Jacob put it another way. He spoke of the necessity of understanding "things as they really are, and of things as they really will be." He described the Jews as searching for things that they could not understand and being blinded because of "looking beyond the mark" (Jacob 4:13–14).<br><h2><b>The Real Test Is Today, Not Tomorrow</b></h2><br>So it is that college students, and others as well, often look beyond the mark. They live in inexpensive apartments. They economize on their grocery bills. They walk to school or work. They take out loans they do not know how to repay. They live on hand-me-downs and food baskets from their parents. They look for bargains. They accept student rates at theaters and take vacations that don't cost much. They settle for less in order to have more some day. Because much of what they live for lies in the future, young people sometimes forget that the real test is never tomorrow but it is always today.<br><br>Students are usually in a hurry to get on with life. Some remind me of a missionary I had in the mission field. He once penned an unforgettable line: "President," he wrote, "do you know any quick way to memorize the discussions? If you do, send it to me right away."<br><br>Because students are anxious to begin living, they tend to look for shortcuts. They sometimes merely endure difficult courses. They have been known to avoid hard teachers and to read long books in outline form. Students have often been known to cram for examinations, and burn the midnight oil. All of this is done in expectation of better things to come. Sadly, those who burn the candle at both ends are usually more concerned with getting than with giving.<br><br>Because there is never enough time, students sometimes develop an attitude which will severely interfere with their spiritual progress, not only as students but throughout their lives as well. They try to get by. The question becomes "How much must I give to get the grade?" not "How can I master the subject?" or "How can I get out of school?" not "What can I learn here?"<br><h2><b>No Such Things as a Free Lunch</b></h2><br>In another related area, students are besieged with offers for free things--free karate lessons, free records and tapes, incredible returns on investments. The bookstore is filled with books having titles such as<i>How to Make a Killing in Real Estate, How to Avoid Probate, How to Make a Million Dollars, How to Sell Anything to Anyone, Shortcuts to Effective Public Speaking, 10 Days to a Better Personality, Calculus Made Easy.</i><br><br>It is easy to forget Euclid's warning that there is no royal road to geometry or the well-known comment that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Little by little, often imperceptibly, our minds become conditioned to getting the things we want with as little effort as possible. We guard our giving, that we may have more time for getting. Many seek grades without effort, athletic attainment without training, musical excellence without practice. They try to lose weight without dieting and want to be free without being responsible. Others become more concerned with finding the right person than they are with<i>being</i>the right person.<br><br>It is not that these things are illegal or immoral, but they do have one thing in common. They all represent, at least in part, an attempt to acquire something of real worth without paying adequate consideration for it. And it is a short leap from these attitudes to others which are more serious. As minds become conditioned to getting things without effort, or with as little effort as possible, it is easy to rationalize that it is a clever thing to secure advantage without paying the price.<br><br>For example, how many automobiles are not insured as required by law? How many own tapes or video cassettes which have been copied in violation of copyright laws? How many don't tell the full truth when they buy or sell bicycles, stereos, used cars or other things? How many think that radar detectors should be standard equipment on every automobile? How many court unmerited popularity by telling off-color stories? How many seek artificial sensual stimulation as a substitute for righteous joy? How many of us are anxious to have success without sacrifice? It can't be done, you know.<br><h2><b>Be More Concerned with Giving Than with Gain</b></h2><br>In this regard, there is an interesting story in the scriptures. On one occasion, late in life, King David offended the Lord. He sinned greatly and asked the Lord to remove his iniquity, acknowledging that he had done a foolish thing. To punish David, the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel and 70,000 men died. David complained to the Lord and said, "I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these [meaning the people], what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house" (2 Samuel 24:17).<br><br>That same day the prophet Gad came to David and said that the Lord would remove the plague if David would build an altar on the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite and offer an acceptable sacrifice there. David was anxious to lift the Lord's curse. He quickly went to Araunah's place of business, and then the scripture details this most interesting account:<br><br><i>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</i><br><br><i>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</i><br><br><i>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</i><br><br><i>All these things did Araunah ...</i>[offer]<i>unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.</i><br><br>Here David could have made a fatal mistake. He could have been more concerned with gain than with giving. But he wisely said unto Araunah,<br><br><i>Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price:</i>neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.<i>So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver</i>[which was no small sum in those days].<br><br><i>And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</i>[2 Samuel 24:20–25; emphasis added]<br><br>Why was David concerned about personally paying for the offering the prophet commanded him to make? Was it because he knew there is always a cost when real sacrifice is made? Should it be of concern to us if we fail to pay honest measure for that which we receive? Can we hope to learn a language if we are unwilling to make an effort? Is it possible to be forgiven without honestly repenting? Should we seek a witness before the trial of our faith? I believe all of these attitudes which many of us have shared at one time or another may jeopardize our salvation. Let me tell you why.<br><h2><b>Satan Offered Salvation without Risk</b></h2><br>The scriptures tell us that Satan once came before God in the premortal existence with a plan to redeem all mankind and not lose one soul. You all remember the story. In exchange for what he offered, the son of the morning wanted honor (<i>see</i>Moses 4:1) and the power of God (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 29:36, Moses 4:3). Because we had free agency there, as we do now, Satan induced one third of all of the spirit children of God to turn away from the plan proposed by Jesus Christ and to fight for his proposal (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 29:36, Abraham 3:28). When his scheme was rejected, Satan rebelled and sought to destroy the very agency he had to use to gain approval of his plan (<i>see</i>Moses 4:3).<br><br>But how did he manage to draw one third of us away from God? I believe that it was simply by saying that there were unnecessary hazards in Christ's plan, and that the power of God was sufficient to save all men without effort and without the keeping of commandments. It was an attractive package. Many were deceived. In effect, they were offered salvation without risk. It wasn't that our spirit brothers and sisters didn't value free agency. They were undoubtedly taught about it and its importance. Probably they were committed to the concept, but because they were aware of the risks and were aware of their own weaknesses, they were unwilling to go to earth without a guaranteed round trip ticket. They valued the presence of God more than agency and lost both because they looked beyond the mark and could not see that it was impossible to have one without the other.<br><br>In a sense they wanted the mortal experience and a token probation. After punishment with a few stripes, they wanted to be returned again to that place they loved so much. But they were afraid of the real risk of mortality--of the discipline and the cost. They knew full well that there was death and evil inherent in the flesh (see 2 Nephi 2:29). They knew that many would find it difficult to walk by faith and would stumble and succumb to temptation (see Moses 5:7–8). They knew that without temptation they could not become agents unto themselves (see D&amp;amp;C 29:39).<br><br>That price was unacceptable to many who did not want to leave home. They began to cast about for an easier way and, when it was offered, they accepted it. I have learned that the easy way to anything is almost always suspect.<br><h2><b>It Is a Blessing to Earn What We Receive</b></h2><br>After Adam's transgression, the Lord told him that the ground would be cursed for his sake (<i>see</i>Moses 4:23). It is interesting to me that one definition of the word<i>sake</i>is benefit. Thus, cursed was the ground for Adam's benefit. And by the sweat of his brow he was to earn his bread (<i>see</i>Moses 4:25). Work, then, was not to be a curse and earning things was to be a benefit.<br><br>This is still true today, notwithstanding the fact that much time and effort go into trying to beat the system. Work is still the ruling principle in the lives of the Latter-day Saints. We should not seek to acquire things without effort. Only that which is truly earned is ever really ours. It is a blessing to earn what we receive, and this applies to spiritual things as well.<br><br>I heard a sweet lady speak in church not long ago. She spoke of a difficult marriage and a husband who was unwilling to live the gospel. She spoke of abuse and emotional disorders. She spoke of trouble and debt. Real physical illness resulted from trying to hold her marriage together. My heart went out to her. Then she said, "But finally I asked my dear bishop what to do and he told me to get a divorce, so I did."<br><br>She said, "dear." She meant "poor." Shame on a bishop who would tell a woman to get a divorce. The effect of doing that was to deprive the woman of the opportunity of paying the price for her own inspiration or revelation. Certainly she was entitled to it. But as with all other valuable things, there is a price attached. I do not know whether the bishop told her the right thing or not. But I do believe that there are no shortcuts to inspiration. The price is always praying and studying the matter in your mind. Often there is fasting and patient waiting. No earthly power can change all of that. I fear that the woman was trying to find the will of the Lord for her without paying the price. That simply cannot be done. Yet how many of us say to our bishops, "Tell me what to do"?<br><h2><b>"When You Find the Answer, Let Me Know"</b></h2><br>On one occasion I was with President Marion G. Romney. He spoke to a large gathering of young people. Afterwards, a returned missionary came up to shake his hand. As he did, he said, "President Romney, when I was a missionary I had a question that no one knew the answer to. Let me take advantage of your time for a moment and ask you." He then asked a rather complicated question, the answer to which could have been found in the scriptures.<br><br>President Romney listened attentively for a few moments and then replied, "That is a very good question. When you find the answer, let me know, will you please?" As we left the hall he commented to me, obviously referring to the young man and his question, "My father taught me as a boy that when I wanted a drink I should go to where the spring flowed out of the ground and not downstream where the cattle had been muddying the water. He'll be better off if he finds the answer for himself."<br><br>But how easy it is to find someone else with the answers to our questions. How many want to know the mysteries of God without studying the scriptures? How many ask the Lord to do things which they should do for themselves? They forget there is no spiritual attainment without effort. The attitudes we sometimes develop in the world can be spiritually fatal if applied to such things as repentance or eternal marriage or keeping the commandments. Think of the consequences, for example, of asking, "Must I serve a mission?" compared to asking, "Can I serve a mission?"<br><h2><b>Several Reasons to Earn What We Get</b></h2><br>As I have thought about the subject, it seems that there are several reasons why the Lord wants us to earn what we get in this life.<br><br>First, if we get things without effort, we often fail to make the hard choices we were sent here to make. We may fail to exercise our agency and thereby be deprived of important blessings. We are then out of harmony with the Lord and lose the blessings and trials (for many trials are blessings) which he intended would be a part of our own particular probation. As an illustration, what would Cain have done to come up with an acceptable offering to the Lord, if he had not killed Abel? Could not introspection and prayer and an honest, humble sacrifice have made an eternal difference in his life?<br><br>Second, if we acquire things with little or no effort, we often develop an exaggerated view of our own ability and our own importance. If we think we are better than we really are, then we are in danger of not being sufficiently humble to be able to enter the Kingdom of God.<br><br>Third, when we get something for nothing, we often feel that others do the same. Then we become critical, feeling that patronage, nepotism, luck, influence, or favoritism have allowed them to acquire what they have. Jealousy and envy then easily enter our lives.<br><br>Fourth, when we get something for nothing, we often develop a delusion of being especially blessed by the Lord. This can discourage hard work on other projects and may bring great disappointment when similar slack efforts do not result in corresponding large rewards.<br><br>Fifth, when we get something for nothing, it is often at the expense of someone else's loss. If the whole truth were known, offense might be taken. I do not want to be included among those about whom the Savior said, "Woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea" (Luke 17:1–2).<br><br>Last of all, things cheaply purchased are seldom appreciated. Attitudes which cause us to look for bargains in some areas of life will carry over (because as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he) into more important things. We may then come to seek testimony without study and spiritual power without cost, and the greatest blessings of life may be cheapened or lost altogether as a result.<br><br>There is an important lesson here for Latter-day Saints. Somehow, some way, sooner or later, whether we want it that way or not, there are some experiences that all men must have. There are some truths that all must learn. There is a relationship between what we give and what we get. Shortcuts are often hazardous to the important things, both in this life and the life to come. There are no spiritual shortcuts to anything. We must learn that peace of mind has its price and that there can be no exaltation without effort.<br><h2><b>The Satisfaction of Giving Lasts Longer</b></h2><br>I spoke about a young boy sitting on a street corner. I said it often depends on where you sit or where you stand with reference to the important issues, whether you get a reward or not. You may be interested to know where I stand as a humble servant of the Lord with reference to getting and giving. I am deeply conscious of my own weaknesses in this area. Yet, as I have seen the dangers and struggled with personal self-interest, I have found that the satisfaction of giving lasts much longer than the sweetness of getting. Like Abraham, I have found "greater happiness and peace and rest for me" (Abraham 1:2) when I render honest sacrifice and pay fair and adequate consideration for what I get.<br><br>Therefore:<br><br>1. I have resolved never to ask the Church or anyone else to do for me what I should do for myself. Where possible, I prefer to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.<br><br>2. When I pray, I always try to pray "Thy will be done, not mine." President Tanner once said that too many of us merely take a shopping list to the Lord when we pray. I try not to do that unless it is absolutely necessary.<br><br>3. As a lawyer, before being called as a General Authority, I never accepted a case which would cause me to bend the law or ignore the facts; or which would give my client a benefit he didn't deserve. I still recoil from those who suggest such things and do not traffic with men and women who shade the truth for personal gain.<br><br>4. I am thankful that my eternal companion also believes in giving honest measure for what she gets. In fact, she gives more, and I appreciate that. It seems to me that a "something for nothing" attitude is inconsistent with eternal marriage.<br><br>5. I have never consciously misrepresented my income to the government, and have always paid taxes on that which I have earned. I have little sympathy with some vocal groups who look for ways to avoid this obligation. It seems to me that they want all of the benefits of democracy without paying for them.<br><br>6. Likewise, I have never misrepresented my income to my bishop. I have always tried to pay just a little bit more tithing than I owed. I avoid thinking in terms of net or gross income and believe that gifts or profits from sale of my property are included in my increase. I recognize that all that I have comes from the Lord. I would willingly give up a new sports car or boat or a vacation, just for the privilege of paying tithing. I have done this all of my life and I have no regrets.<br><br>7. I believe in the "second mile." I have come to know that the first mile doesn't count for much and the one freely given counts for everything.<br><br>8. I have learned to distrust praise and to seek honest humility, which I define to be a true and correct estimate of what I really am in the sight of God. No more and no less.<br><br>9. I never sign up for sweepstakes, prizes, giveaways, free offers or chances of a lifetime. As I wait in airports around the world, there are sometimes slot machines there to help passengers pass the time. I never put any money in them, even spare change. I am actually afraid I will win something.<br><br>10. I ask myself often, "What would Christ do?" and then try to do it. As the answer to that question comes, it almost always involves giving, not getting.<br><h2><b>There is No Exaltation without Effort</b></h2><br>As children we all learned the stories of the "Goose That Laid the Golden Egg," of "Jack and the Magic Beans," of "The Three Wishes," and "King Midas," whose touch turned everything to gold. But it was Paul who said,<br><br><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man, I put away childish things.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:11]<br><br>I suppose that most of us have dreamed of inheriting a million dollars, or making a killing in a business venture, or even just being free of the work-a-day world in order to do what we want. But it is unworthy of a Latter-day Saint to spend his time trying to achieve these or other things without effort. The real reason for our mortal probation is to confront challenges, not escape them. It is to learn to give, not to learn to get. In earth life, as in the university life, we cannot complain about not getting passing grades if we are unwilling to take the test. There are no shortcuts to the plan of salvation. There is no exaltation without effort. We have nothing more important to do than to fully, honestly, and completely obey the laws upon which blessings are predicated. Make no mistake about it, we will reap what we sow (see Galatians 6:7).<br><br>It has always interested me that the broad way seems pleasant enough at first, while the narrow strait way initially does not. It has nothing to commend it to the advertisers of the world. It is difficult to sell. It is a toll road. The tariff is work, discipline, service, and love for others. It is paying the price for everything we get, then giving it away. Once entered into, however, those who travel the straight road are never the same. What at first seemed unpleasant will turn out to be the sweetest and most desirable road of all. It is what we give ourselves to that brings meaning and purpose into our lives--not what we get or gain. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>F.

<h1> the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it really is a great privilege to be here at Brigham Young University, a great school. School brings back some good memories. It also brings back some other memories: books, labs, exams, teachers, professors, and long study hours.<br><br>It reminds me of the story of the young man who was determined to improve his grades in zoology. He had studied all night long for the final zoology exam. When he arrived at the class the next morning he saw, to his surprise, ten birds sitting on ten perches with hoods covering their whole bodies except for their legs. Then, to his amazement, the teacher said, "The exam will not consist of all those things you studied, but of your walking up to these birds, looking at their legs, and identifying their genus and species."<br><br>As this young student thought about it, he became angrier and angrier. He walked up to the birds and looked at their legs. They all looked the same to him. The more he thought about the fact that he had spent hours and hours studying, the angrier he became.<br><br>He finally walked over to the teacher's desk, slammed down his test and said, "This is the most ridiculous exam I have ever heard of. I will not take it," and stomped toward the door. Just before he reached the door, because the class was quite large, the professor called out, "What is your name?" The young man thought a moment, turned around, pulled up both pant legs, and said, "You guess, buddy, you guess!"<br><br>Well, brothers and sisters, I really am pleased to be here at BYU. There's no other school on all the earth quite like this one. You're a magnificent generation of young people. The Lord is raising you up to fulfill his purposes. To try to thwart those purposes, Satan has increased his ambassadors a hundredfold to counteract the good that is being done and will be done by your generation.<br><h2><b>The "Big Ones"</b></h2><br>As you young men and women are at the threshold of some of life's key decisions, I have in mind this morning to provide you with some suggestions about facing those great decisions. I might say that those decisions are the "big ones"--the ones that really count. Decisions like discovering yourself and your potential, going on a mission, decisions concerning school and your career, your future employment, finding a mate and marrying in the temple.<br><br>In order to make these suggestions to you, I would like to relate four true experiences that bear directly on these key decisions you are in the process of making or will soon have to make. Listen carefully. Silently pray to be taught. There may be something the Lord will say to you in your heart as a result of what is spoken here this morning.<br><br>How do you discover yourself? What is your potential? The mind of man is limitless. You are a son or daughter of God. We were all made in the image of our Father.<br><h2><b>Discover Your True Potential</b></h2><br>Some years ago a young man I'll call Raymond was in the seventh grade. He was a little taller than the other boys and was doing quite well in basketball and track. However, as the year progressed, the coach of the team began saying to him, "Raymond, stay seated. You're no ball player. You're too clumsy!" The next game, "No, we don't need you. You stay right there. You can't run. You can't shoot the ball. You're not fast enough." This process continued for a number of months.<br><br>So the inevitable happened, because of that continual negative conditioning, and Raymond finally believed what he was being told about himself. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. He believed it so much that in coming years he did his best to avoid gym altogether. He did not play basketball with the other young men anymore at Church or at school. He set aside running. He avoided sports and went through high school minimizing interaction of any kind in sports. The negative conditioning even followed him into his first year of college. Some athletics were required, but again he minimized his involvement to the smallest degree possible.<br><br>A year later he found himself on a mission in a distant land. In this particular country the buses that the missionaries used did not stop to let the people get on or off. One had to learn to do that on the run.<br><br>One afternoon, as Raymond and his companion looked down the street, being a block or two from the bus stop, they saw the bus coming. One of them said, "Run, Elder, run, or we'll miss our next appointment." To Raymond's great surprise, he beat his companion to the bus stop. Again, that afternoon, Raymond purposely arranged a few runs for the bus. He beat his companion each time.<br><br>He was shocked, amazed, and almost unbelieving, because he knew that his companion had received a number of awards for being the fastest runner in all of northern Arizona. Raymond was overcome. Could it be so? They ran again. He won.<br><br>All of a sudden the terrible realization came that he had wasted all those years. He could have excelled in athletics but he had believed what someone else had sown in his mind. He then began questioning himself about every other attitude he had in which he might have been deceived concerning belief in self.<br><h2><b>As a Man Thinketh, So Is He</b></h2><br>Have you ever done that? Are you in that process now? Has someone convinced you that you are not good at music or mathematics or that you'll always be overweight? Each of us definitely had different gifts given to us. But I'm convinced that many of us are severely limited by the beliefs we have about our own self.<br><br>Solomon said, "For as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). And the Lord said, "And then, behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your faith shall it be done unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 11:17). You cannot rise higher than your own beliefs and thoughts about yourself. Jesus said, "If thou canst believe,<i>all things are possible to him that believeth"</i>(Mark 9:23); emphasis added).<br><br>One of the greatest processes you are in now is to discover yourself, to find those gifts and capacities God has given you. He has given you great talents, the smallest part of which you have just begun to utilize. Trust the Lord to assist you in unlocking the door to those gifts. Some of us have created imaginary limits in our own mind. There is literally a genius locked up inside each of us. Don't ever let anyone convince you of the contrary!<br><br>The young man in this true story found himself in the mission field. Didn't the Lord teach us that whosoever sought his own life would lose it, and he that lost his life in the service of others would find it? Discover yourself! If you have not yet gone, go on a mission. You will find yourself.<br><br><i>And now this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men.</i><br><br><i>Take upon you mine ordination, even that of an elder, to preach faith and repentance and remission of sins, according to my word, and the reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 36:4; 53:3]<br><br>Yes, that discovery of self will be a great blessing to you in making those major decisions--whether it be going on a mission, selecting a career, finding a suitable marriage partner, or raising a family.<br><br>All of you, to some degree, are facing a situation in which you encounter some difficult challenges in school. This is the first time many of you have been away from home for any period of time. You may be facing difficult examinations and struggling to meet your expectations and those of your professors.<br><br>When some think of school, they think rather humorously of the fellow who said, "Tenth grade was the best grade I ever went to. I spent three of the best years of my life there." Or there's the fellow that said, "The closest some of you at school have ever come to honor is, 'Yes, your Honor,' 'No, your Honor.'"<br><h2><b>Be Not Ashamed of the Truth</b></h2><br>May I tell you about an experience another young man faced in school? He was eighteen years of age and I'll call him Raymond also. This young man found himself in a speech class at a university. He received a scholarship from high school and was anxious to maintain a good grade point average. This somewhat directed him to this supposedly easy class. It wasn't until the last day had passed for being able to transfer to some other class that the teacher said, "Student's, you will be pleased to know that in the last twenty-five years of my teaching I've only given five A's."<br><br>Raymond's heart sank. He tried transferring from the class but was unable to do so. Through the months he received B's, B-'s, and once in awhile, a B+, but never an A. He was disheartened. Thirty days from the conclusion of the term the teacher stood up and said to the class, "You each have one last talk to give. It will determine half of your grade. You must (1) select an extremely controversial subject, (2) talk for twenty-five minutes, (3) make an actual defense of the subject the best you can, (4) be prepared to receive a purposeful attack upon you and your subject after you have finished, (5) receive a written critique afterwards from each student in the class."<br><br>A great hush came over the class, mostly from self-doubt and fear. Some thought of talking on communism versus democracy, racial issues, birth control--anything that would be controversial.<br><br>Numbers were drawn to determine who would speak first. Raymond drew number nine. As the days went by and he saw the grueling experience each speaker went through, great fear mounted in his heart about what he should do.<br><br>He prayed about a topic, as I'm sure you all do concerning your school assignments. He could not seem to settle on anything. He was now two days away from the day he was to give his speech and had nothing in writing. The impression seemed to be constantly the same, "If you're looking for a controversial subject, choose the Book of Mormon. That's controversial enough."<br><br>Raymond was fearful, however, because he knew he was the only member of the Church in the class. He also knew that the teacher was an active member of a protestant church. She had clearly made it known, throughout the entire semester as she taught passages from the Bible, that the Bible was the only revelation from God to man.<br><br>Raymond struggled with himself. He feared that the whole idea might backfire on him. But he finally decided to do it anyway. As a priest he had served a stake mission the previous summer and knew the old missionary lesson depicting the Bible and Book of Mormon as scripture to the Old and New worlds.<br><br>The day of his presentation he announced his subject as the Book of Mormon. A hush fell over the class. He began teaching semi-historically and semi-academically, with the thought to not offend. However, about halfway through, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he thought, "I can't just tell them historically about this book. I don't care what they think of me, or what happens to my grade. These folks are going to get it. The Book of Mormon is true. They ought to all know it."<br><br>He ended up teaching the lesson pretty much as it was written to be given to investigators, bearing his testimony frequently, and even concluding in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br>He then waited for the attack. To his astonishment, not a word was spoken by the students. The teacher tried prompting and persuading them to attack. They would not. No one would. Not one word was spoken. Finally, in frustration, the teacher said, "Be seated, Raymond."<br><br>The written student reviews were all positive. Four or five wrote, "You have almost convinced me of the truth of what you have spoken." One individual who was particularly critical of the other students' presentations wrote, "I really would like to know more about your church."<br><br>What great faith it took for this young man to proceed and to teach what he knew was right in the face of almost sure ridicule. You might be interested to know that to his delight, Raymond received an A in that class. The Lord truly blesses any one of us that keeps the commandments and is not afraid to bear witness of him as he has commanded all of us "to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in" (Mosiah 18:9).<br><h2><b>Seek Counsel from the Lord</b></h2><br>Didn't Paul speak with the Spirit saying, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (Romans 1:16).<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i>[Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>Remember my young friends, "To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). Remember that counsel, in all your learning.<br><br>You may have faced, or you will face, the world just as this young man did. How much faith will you have? Remember to never be embarrassed, but to go forward and testify of that which you believe. These decisions, these big ones--marriage, mission, school, careers--will be more easily made if you pray with faith and truly trust in the Lord. Seek counsel from the Almighty.<br><br>Don't act as a novice pretending to know it all. One novice, a tourist from the East camping in the mountains of the West, humorously said to a seasoned guide (a mountain man), "Is it true that a grizzly bear won't attack you if you're carrying a lantern?" The man thought a moment and said, "Well, sonny, it depends on how fast you're carrying it!"<br><br>I think some of us, in making decisions, lay our plans out like a tourist in the forest, or like another tourist who followed the counsel for a surefire way to catch a porcupine: (1) get up in a tree with a large steel tub; (2) when the porcupine comes by, drop the tub over the porcupine; (3) this provides something to sit upon to plan the next move.<br><br>We can surely do better than that, brothers and sisters, in doing our planning in these critical decisions about life. May I give you another illustration that relates to the decisions of employment--one of the big ones.<br><h2><b>Keep the Commandments</b></h2><br>Let me tell about another young man that I'll also call Raymond. Even though this incident happened in his teen years, it applies to any one of us, even as adults, in teaching us to rely on the Lord.<br><br>When he was eleven, Raymond obtained a paper route and really began to prosper. He was still delivering papers at age sixteen. One day, the manager of the newspaper, an inactive adult member of the Church, came in and said, "Raymond, you have been so loyal and done so well in selling subscriptions that I'm going to appoint you assistant manager of circulation of this newspaper. In your duties you'll supervise the other paper boys and teach them how to sell subscriptions. After school, after finishing your route, you'll be able to come to the office to work two or three hours. You'll be able to do some homework while you're waiting to answer complaints on the phone. All in all, it will be a great job for you. And by the way, your pay will be tripled."<br><br>The young man was delighted. He wanted to go on a mission and was saving money from his route to prepare for that day. This job would simply accelerate the process. He counted his blessings for the ideal job at a time when many teenagers had no work.<br><br>He said to himself, over and over again, "My, the Lord blesses one who keeps the commandments." He wanted to glorify the Lord in that he had always paid his tithing, kept the Sabbath day holy, and honored his priesthood. He also felt he was being blessed for resisting the pressure to study on Sunday.<br><br>A successful year and a half went by and one Saturday, George, the newspaper manager, came to him and said, "You know, Raymond, one week from now we're going to begin delivering the Sunday paper. You will not only have your Sunday route to deliver early in the morning, but you'll have to stay in the office from about 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon. You'll also receive a thirty percent increase in pay."<br><br>Raymond's countenance immediately fell. The manager quickly added, "I know you're a Mormon, and you may, by chance, be thinking of not doing this extra job beyond your route. If you don't take the job, you'll not only lose the opportunity to earn more money on Sunday, but you'll also lose your paper route and be fired from your weekday job as well. There are many of my other paper boys who would give their right arm to have your job."<br><br>As Raymond went home on his bicycle that day, he was very despondent. He prayed over and over, "How could this be, Heavenly Father? I have kept the commandments. I've tried to do what is right. I'm trying to go on a mission. Now I may lose my job. Shall I work this added job on Sunday or not?"<br><br>He very emotionally explained the problem to his father, who gave him the correct answer when he said, "I don't know the answer, but I know someone who does," meaning the Lord. In a great teaching moment he put the burden back on Raymond.<br><br>Raymond struggled with the problem. He talked to his bishop. He told him about the same thing his father had told him. He learned that there were sacrament meetings being held in the other wards in the afternoon that he could attend if he decided to work. He prayed and struggled with the problem two full days.<br><br>Tuesday, when asked for a decision by George, the manager, Raymond said with great emotion, "I love my job and my route, but I cannot work on Sunday, thereby missing all of my meetings and working throughout the Sabbath day. It's not right!"<br><br>George said emphatically and angrily, "You're fired! Come in Saturday to pick up your last check! Did you hear me? You're fired! There are scores of young men who would be glad to have a job like this. You're a very ungrateful young man!" And he stomped out of the office.<br><br>The next three or four days were hard for Raymond. The manager hardly spoke to him. He really wondered if he had decided correctly. He thought to himself, "There are many who have to work on Sunday because of their employment. Shouldn't I?" But the answer seemed to be the same: "There may be some who have to work on Sunday, but you don't have to and should not."<br><br>Saturday morning finally arrived and Raymond went in to pick up his last check. As he walked into the office somewhat downtrodden, George was waiting for him. He grabbed the boy by the arm and took him to a nearby room, perhaps for privacy, and said, "Raymond, please forgive me. I was wrong. I ought not to have tried to make you break the commandments of the Lord. I have found another young man of another faith who is willing to do the extra work on Sunday. You can keep your job. Will you?"<br><br>With a heart full of thankfulness, Raymond answered, "Yes." The manager then added, "You'll find the extra thirty percent I was going to pay you for the extra work on Sunday included in your paycheck this week, and also in your future paychecks, as long as you continue working for me."<br><br>What great joy Raymond felt in his heart as he went home that afternoon, saying again and again to himself, "It is worth it to keep the commandments of the Lord. The Lord will always provide for his own." What joy Raymond felt a year later to see his manager in the congregation when he gave his final talk preparatory to leaving for his mission.<br><br>What greater joy, a few months ago, after twenty-six years, to find Raymond talking with George on the phone, learning that he's active, faithful, strong in the Church, and is a high priest group leader in his ward in another state.<br><h2><b>The Lord Will Inspire You</b></h2><br>Yes, the Lord commanded us to "seek ye a living like unto men" (D&amp;amp;C 54:9). But also to be in the world but not be of it. Be careful that you never compromise the principles that you believe in. Remember this counsel: always trust in the Lord.<br><br>The Lord will inspire you in the selection of employment as long as it is an honest employment. You will be blessed by the sweat of your brow as you earn your keep. Remember, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</i><br><br><i>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.</i>[Exodus 20:9–10]<br><br>The decisions concerning employment, missions, marriage, and careers truly are difficult ones, but if a man will look to the Lord, he truly will cause all things to "work together for your good" (D&amp;amp;C 90:24). Decisions will be correct and for your eternal welfare.<br><h2><b>The Power of Faith</b></h2><br>Let me tell you of one last example of another young man. We'll also call him Raymond. I think the family of this young man exemplifies the love, confidence, and trust that must exist in family relationships.<br><br>Raymond found himself quite ill as he was serving his mission in a distant land. He had many digestive problems and the mission president was considering sending him home due to his poor health. To compound his problems, one day, while out walking, he found himself with a severe pain in his left foot. He couldn't even walk to the discussion he and his companion had planned. They went to the doctor who said, "It's just arthritis caused by the damp weather. If you'll stay off your foot for two or three days the pain will pass."<br><br>The young man did so. He also had a priesthood blessing, but nothing happened. He was a district leader at the time, and his district had just begun to baptize in a city where there had not been baptisms for some time. He could not understand how the Lord could allow him to remain down for those days when his district was just beginning to have success.<br><br>A week went by, two weeks, three weeks, a month in bed. He was still incapacitated with no change in the pain in his foot. Finally, he was taken to the mission home in the capital city where more suitable medical facilities were found.<br><br>An X-ray was taken. One of the bones in his foot had been fractured or broken and had then grown back together incorrectly. The doctors talked of either breaking the bone again or giving him some special electrical treatments that were supposed to fuse the bone correctly, but it would take another month. He was down again, going for treatments twice a day. The treatments didn't make any difference. This problem, on top of his other medical problems, had him somewhat discouraged, and again the consideration came to send him home.<br><br>One morning, after nearly three months, he stepped out of bed to find absolutely no pain in his foot. He stepped on the foot gently, then stamped on it, then ran with his companion for a mile that morning, totally healed. With great joy he returned immediately to the field to work.<br><br>Two more weeks went by. A letter arrived from home that said, "Dear son," and then followed a paragraph or two of chastisement for not having told his family about his ailments in the mission field. They indicated that they had learned of his problems from another missionary, a friend of his, who had written home. In great love they wrote, "We have begun a fast and constant prayer for you as a family. We also have placed your name on the temple prayer list and hope that it might be of help to you."<br><br>As he tearfully read the letter and examined his journal, he found that the day that he had risen from his bed healed was the very day the letter had been written, the very day his family began praying and exercising faith for their distant son.<br><br>How could that be, across 7,000 miles? I suppose no man knows, but the reality of the power of faith cannot be denied. Remember the counsel--trust in the Lord.<br><h2><b>Your Faith Combined with Theirs</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, think of the great love your parents have for you and the sacrifices they have made for you which reach not just across 7,000 miles but across the eternities. Stay close to your families. Counsel with your parents and your brothers and sisters. Your faith combined with their faith will see you through any problem. They can help you tremendously with these major decisions, the big ones you face in life.<br><br>The Lord said, "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12). The ties that draw you close to your family ought to be continually strengthened. How ungrateful some of us are. How little we know of the sacrifices of our parents for us.<br><br>How many of you know, for example, how many times your mother was up with you when you were a child with all the sleepless nights, how many times she wiped your tears, bandaged your knees, taught you of God, and cheered you up, even when she was discouraged and her heart was broken.<br><br>What do you know of your father who worked to sustain your family when he didn't feel like it, when he didn't want to, when he was discouraged and down--but he daily, monthly, yearly, went to work anyway. How much time and effort has it taken to raise you to the point you are at this time? How many thousands of hours, sleepless nights, fasting, and prayers have they invested in you for you to reach this point in your maturity (<i>see</i>2 Nephi 4:5–7)?<br><br>How wise you would be to write them and express your love to them regularly. They hang on every word that comes from you of whom they are so proud. Allow them to be part of your life. Let them assist you in those key decisions. If those relationships are not now in order, find a way to put them in order.<br><h2><b>The Measure of Man</b></h2><br>Many of you now look forward to another major decision, that of selecting a mate. Know that the Lord will also bless you in that major decision. After marriage, the children will come. They will teach the parents. I remember something that happened in my own family some months ago. While teaching illustrated Book of Mormon stories to my son, Jared, age 5, I made quite a point of the fact that Nephi had gone back into the city to get the brass plates. I rather innocently asked Jared, after finishing that instruction, "Why do you think that Nephi, then, had to go back to Jerusalem to get the plates?"<br><br>He thought a minute and said, "Well, I suppose, Dad, that when they were going into the desert they didn't have anything else to eat on."<br><br>Know that it is a commandment to marry and have a family. The Lord said, "It [is] not good that the man should be alone" (Moses 3:18). He also commanded that:<br><br><i>Marriage is ordained of God unto man. ... and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;</i><br><br><i>And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49:15–17]<br><br>I know some of you single sisters are worried about marriage and whether or not you'll ever be married. I heard one sister say with a smile, "The reason that fellow on the great white horse has not come for me is that he surely must have been killed in the war in heaven."<br><br>Sisters, you know the promises of the Lord to you if you prove faithful, that the day will come, here or otherwise, when you will be married, that you will not lose any blessing that you would have otherwise had, had you been married. Be faithful, be patient.<br><br>I realize there are some of you who are already married and facing real struggles. That's good for your marriage if taken in the right spirit. Stay close to one another. Work out your difficulties. It will make your marriage even stronger. With a smile may I say that one young man was really good at laying down the law to his wife. The problem was that she was better at making amendments!<br><br>Another young couple was unwisely buying on credit and was in the process of having some real economic struggles. They couldn't decide where to put their new baby as they didn't have enough money to buy a baby crib. So they decided they'd have to put the new arrival in the box the color TV came in.<br><h2><b>Act in Faith and Trust in the Lord</b></h2><br>Seriously, brothers and sisters, life is a struggle. Major decisions face all of you. But they are solvable and you will pass through them successfully if you rely on the Lord.<br><br>In summary, we see in all these examples the illustrations of young people like you who have acted in faith and have trusted in the Lord. The Lord really is the answer to it all. He is the one who will inspire you to go on a mission if you will seek him. He will inspire you in the selection of your career, your employment, your mate for time and all eternity. He's the one who will unleash your potential as an individual and teach you from the heavens who you are and what you ought to do.<br><br>In conclusion, may I make these few suggestions that will help you stay close to and trust in the Lord:<br><br>1. Pray to him, continually seeking revelation throughout the day (see 2 Nephi 9:52).<br><br>2. Read his scriptures daily, even if for only a few minutes. They will teach you of the world to come and give you direction in this world (see Helaman 3:27–30).<br><br>3. Exercise faith, keep the things of the Spirit as the first priority in your life, then all else will be appropriately added (see Jacob 2:18).<br><br>4. Seek to do his will--not your own--humbling yourself and repenting or changing your life as needed (<i>see</i>Helaman 10:45).<br><br>5. Love others, serve them, feed the Lord's flock (see John 21:15–17).<br><br>6. Keep the commandments with exactness (see Alma 57:21).<br><br>Remember, the Lord will truly prosper those who keep his commandments. He said:<br><br><i>And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i>[1 Nephi 17:3]<br><br>I bear testimony of the fact that if you keep the commandments, he nourishes you, strengthens you, and provides you means for accomplishing all things necessary to faithfully finish your divine mission here on earth. May the Lord bless you, this special generation, while you are making these great decisions, the big ones, yes, and also the little ones, throughout all your lives. Rely on the only sure power for doing it all correctly. Invite his spirit to be with you. He will see you through and return you to your celestial home. May we all look to the Lord (see 1 Nephi 15:3; 18:16), and trust in the Lord, as we ought to, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gene R.

<h1>ere the Spirit of the Lord Is, There Is Liberty&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I think that my biography would not be complete if I didn't share the following with you. "One American, who was called to work with European organizations, was asked to define 'a European.' After some thought, the light came, and he gave this portrait: A European is someone who has the capacity of an Englishmen, the sobriety of an Irishman, the modesty of a Frenchman, the liberality of a Luxembourg-man, the prudery of a Dane, the humor of a German, the generosity of a Dutchman--briefly, it is a Belgian!" Never deny your origin!<br><br>It is always quite a challenge to address such a demanding audience as this; therefore, I will speak about a demanding subject that requires all of our attention these days: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/3.17?lang=eng#16">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>).<br><h2><b>In the Name of Liberty</b></h2><br>Since the beginning of the world, many have talked, written, suffered, cried, and died for liberty. Artists paint it, sculptors sculpt it, philosophers describe it, dictators and tyrants suppress it, and prophets teach it. It is used to defend good as well as evil, and, in the name of liberty, people are condemned or saved. Let's listen to a short extract from a dialogue between a philosopher and an empress.<br><br>When the philosopher Diderot proposed his ideas for governmental reform, the Empress Catherine of Russia responded: "Ah, my dear friend, you write upon paper, the smooth surface of which presents no obstacle to your pen. But I, poor Empress that I am, must write on the skins of my subjects, which are sensitive and ticklish to an extraordinary degree" (quoted in R. H. Murray,<i>Studies in English and Political Thinkers of the 19th Century,</i>1:157).<br><br>You, as students, are the heirs of a nation where, thanks to an inspired constitution, you can enjoy this freedom of learning true education. One of the first private colleges established in Iowa in 1843 defined the objectives of teaching: "True education is the level reached by the man who raises his spiritual as well as his intellectual faculties; it is not the abundance of facts with which he is filling his mind" (Daniel Boorstin,<i>Histoire des Américains</i>)<i>.</i><br><h2><b>Be Agents unto Yourselves</b></h2><br>BYU is the very emblem of this liberty. Here you are taught that<br><br><i>All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men, neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.34-35?lang=eng#p33">D&amp;amp;C 29:34–35</a>]<br><br>A few days ago--6 June to be precise--many free men celebrated the anniversary of D day, 6 June 1944, on the beaches of Normandy. This was the beginning of deliverance for those who didn't enjoy freedom for many years and who could not be agents unto themselves. You are heirs. Your fathers or grandfathers fought for you. I was on the other side of the ocean in occupied Belgium, and I am an heir also of the sacrifice of their lives. I was waiting for that freedom to come closer and closer every day, until 3 September 1944, in the city of Audenaerde, when we saw our liberators for the first time. My purpose today is to testify to the importance for you, the future generation, to prepare and continue to be agents unto yourselves and to act with the Spirit of the Lord to defend your liberties. May I quote from some of those who believed in freedom and liberty.<br><br>Descartes, a seventeenth-century French philosopher, said, "Divine grace and natural knowledge, far from diminishing my liberty, increase it and fortify it."<br><br>Charles Péguy, who was killed on the battle field in France in 1914, said, "Liberty is the daughter of God, consubstantial to God. It is the mystery of mysteries, the keystone of the universe, the first of the eternal forces in which man is participating in the essence of a creating God."<br><br>Silone Ignazio, a twentieth-century Italian writer, said, "The man who is thinking with his mind is a free man. The man who is fighting for what he believes is just, is a free man. One does not beg his liberty to the others. Liberty must be taken."<br><br>Henri Bergson, a twentieth-century French philosopher, said, "Liberty is a fact and among the facts that we verify, there is none as obvious."<br><br>And from a prophet we read:<br><br><i>Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children--and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.</i><br><br><i>And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--</i><br><br><i>For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.</i><br><br><i>And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, and all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.</i><br><br><i>And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.10-16?lang=eng#p9">Alma 46:10–16</a>]<br><br>Did Moroni try to define liberty? No, it was not necessary. He knew that liberty is a result of being a follower of Christ, a disciple. That is true liberty. And he knew that to defend it, you need to act, to be an agent unto yourself.<br><h2><b>It Is a State of Mind</b></h2><br>Listen now to the voice of a modern defender of liberty who describes how your ideals can be preserved and how to be your own defender of your faith.<br><br>Paraphrasing General Douglas MacArthur:<br><br>Youth is not a certain time of life--it is a state of mind, a result of the will, a quality of the imagination, and emotional intensity, a victory of courage against shyness and of the taste of adventure against comfort. One does not become old because he lived a certain number of years; one becomes old because one has deserted his ideal. Years wrinkle the skin; to renounce ideals wrinkles the soul. The preoccupations, the doubts, the fears, and the despairs are the enemies that slowly bend us toward the earth and have us become dust before death. You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt, as young as your trust in yourself, as young as your hope, as old as your lowness of spirit. You will stay young as long as you will be receptive, receptive to what is nice, good, and great--receptive to the message of nature, man, and the infinite. If one day your heart is bitten by pessimism and tormented by cynicism, may God have pity on your soul, and the soul of an old man. (See Douglas MacArthur,<i>A Soldier Speaks; Public Papers and Speeches of General of the Army,</i>ed. Vorin E. Whan [New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Publishers, 1965], p. 313.)<br><br>Do we hear the message? Do we understand it?<br><h2><b>Defend Your Freedom</b></h2><br>A democracy, a country of freedom, a free university--they are institutions requiring men and women to be agents unto themselves to defend their freedom. As Martin Luther King said, "History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."<br><br>When a democracy, a state, or a university collapses, it is because the individuals and families are dropping their arms. What are the usual symptoms? First, there is a feeling of fear, then resignation, then we get used to the worst. "To get used to" is a horrible phrase, to say the least--to get used to violence, to degradation, to mediocrity, to oppressions, to humiliation. Too often today, when people are confronted with these threatening situations, they begin to ask themselves if they should try to "understand" the enemy and its representations. We see that as soon as they do, they are condemned to death themselves. You don't try to understand dictature, terrorism, abortion, homosexuality, crime, or cancer. You need to fight it. History is a great teacher if we are willing to learn. Anarchy and false freedom to believe that permissiveness is a right are always leading directly to the dictation of sin, to the submissiveness of our spirits, to the slavery of our bodies.<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner said the following concerning the defense of the freedom of families:<br><br><i>If there is pornography or obscenity in bookstores, on television or radio, or in places of entertainment, if there are those who would make more easily available to the young and inexperienced alcohol and its attendant evils, including drunken driving, highway fatalities, broken homes, and if we are threatened with the passage of laws which violate the commandments of God, it is our duty and responsibility as individuals to speak out, to organize, and to protect ourselves and our community against such encroachments. We have seen how people react to the high price of food. It is far more important that we react effectively against the immorality and evil in our communities which threaten the morals and the very lives of our children....</i><br><br><i>People who argue that they have constitutional rights and want to use what they call their free agency to accomplish unrighteous ends abuse the idea of free agency and deprive others of their constitutional rights. While many of our problems are caused by those who are deliberately trying to further their own selfish and devilish interests, there is also a vocal, misled minority which is responsible for other problems as they exist in our country and in our communities. We must be equally vocal and firm in our efforts to maintain the quality of our surroundings, where we can enjoy family solidarity, which is the strength of any nation. We must take a firm stand against the concerted efforts in many areas to destroy the family unit.</i>[<i>Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God,</i>comp. LaRue Sneff (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 88–89]<br><br>And now the teachings from the scriptures:<br><br>"Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free; entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord comes" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.86?lang=eng#p85">D&amp;amp;C 88:86</a>).<br><br>"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/gal/5.1?lang=eng#primary">Galatians 5:1</a>).<br><br>"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/3.17?lang=eng#p16">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>).<br><br>Our responsibility as youth and as students is to stand firm for what we believe and to live according to our faith in the Lord, the light of the world.<br><br><i>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i><br><br><i>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</i><br><br><i>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</i><br><br><i>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.12,31-36?lang=eng#p11">John 8:12, 31–36</a>]<br><h2><b>A Follower of Righteousness Remains Free</b></h2><br>What was the strength of Jesus? He was a teacher, he was a leader, he was the Son of God and taught "as one having authority, and not as the scribes" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.29?lang=eng#p28">Matthew 7:29</a>).<br><br>What could be our strength? "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#p26">3 Nephi 27:27</a>). We need to be teachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the gospel of his Father, to be examples, leaders of righteousness, to be called because of our covenant to serve him. "Children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7?lang=eng#p6">Mosiah 5:7</a>).<br><br>A teacher or leader who is a follower of righteousness remains free. What is righteousness? First, to know the difference between right and wrong. Second, once you know it, to do what is right. The mind must analyze before the will decides. To be righteous, then, is to act. However, before you act, there must be a decision. Before a decision--a choice between right and wrong, between God or Satan, light or darkness, freedom or slavery--knowledge is necessary, and that is why we are here.<br><br>And, once again, the process refers to Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16?lang=eng#p15">Moroni 7:16</a>]<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3</a>]<br><h2><b>The Responsibility of Freedom</b></h2><br>The beginning of freedom or righteousness starts with the first article of faith: "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost."<br><br>Declaration of principle or declaration of faith--what is your declaration? The attributes and responsibilities follow.<br><br><i>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light.</i><br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth</i><br><br><i>Light and truth forsake that evil one.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.28,31,36-37?lang=eng#p27">D&amp;amp;C 93:28, 31, 36–37</a>]<br><br>To know how to be free, which is the control of one's life, is to be an agent unto ourselves, unto righteousness.<br><br>You are the future leaders of your families, your church, and your nation. You will be the leading generation and your heirs will follow your steps if you will preserve your great heritage of liberty.<br><br><i>If there is righteousness in the heart</i><br><i>There will be beauty in the character.</i><br><i>If there is beauty in the character</i><br><i>There will be harmony in the home.</i><br><i>If there is harmony in the home</i><br><i>There will be order in the nation.</i><br><i>If there is order in the nation</i><br><i>There will be peace in the world.</i><br>[Chinese proverb quoted in<i>Ensign,</i>June 1976]<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.

<h1>Your Free Agency - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Lately I have been reading some of the discourses of the prophets and the Church presidents and I have found some interesting thoughts, which, in my opinion, are applicable at the present time.<br><br>In October conference of 1867 George A. Smith said:<br><br><i>It is very desirable that all of our brethren who are not acquainted with the English language should learn it. We do not wish to blot out the original languages that they may have spoken, but we want them all--men and women, old and young--to learn the English language so perfectly that they will be able to thoroughly understand for themselves the teachings and instructions and the published works of the Church, as well as the laws of the country. And while we preach to all classes--all the boys and girls under ninety--to go to school and educate themselves in the various useful branches, we do not want our brethren who do not speak the English language to think that they are neglected or without the pale of this call. We hope the bishops and teachers will make every reasonable exertion to stir up the minds of the brethren and sisters who do not thoroughly understand English to the importance of this particular item of counsel.</i>[<i>JD</i>, 12:138]<br><br>Then I read what President Brigham Young said in April 1852:<br><br><i>I have asked the Board of Regents to cast out from their system of education, the present orthography and written form of our language, that when my children are taught the graphic sign for A, it may always represent that individual sound only. But as it now is, the child is perplexed that the sign A should have one sound in</i>mate<i>, a second sound in</i>father<i>, a third sound in</i>fall<i>, a fourth sound in</i>man,<i>and a fifth sound in</i>many,<i>and in other combinations, soundings different from these, while, in others, A is not sounded at all. I say, let it have one sound all the time.</i>[<i>JD</i>, 1:70]<br><br>And so, I am trying very fervently to follow the counsel of President George A. Smith, and even though the records of the Church show that some attempts have been made to do as Brigham Young requested, you don't know how much I do wish they had been more successful in that endeavor, since I come from a country where the alphabetical letters have one pronunciation only.<br><br>That's enough about the problems with the language--or, I should say, my problems with the language. Let us go on to what I would like to discuss with you today.<br><h2><b>A Good Moral</b></h2><br>There's a story told to the children in Argentina that will serve to introduce the theme I wish to present. It goes like this:<br><br>A pack of dogs was gathered on a street corner. The dogs were telling each other the woes and troubles they had suffered in their lives. There was a large number of them and the conversation became very loud. Suddenly the most observant one let out a loud cry, "The dog-catcher!" Immediately animals scattered in every direction as fast as they could go. About one or two blocks away one of them stopped and asked, "Why am I running? I'm a cat."<br><br>It's a story for children, but it has a good moral, don't you think?<br><br>Many times we act like that cat of that group that are swept along with the current, as the style may be, and, because of what others do, we lose our individuality and don't exercise one of the greatest gifts God has given to man, that of making choices--the gift of free agency, or standing on one's own feet.<br><br>We all have our free agency and we will each be responsible before our Heavenly Father for what we gain from it, since our exaltation depends on it.<br><br>Let us see if with the help of some good examples, some reasoning, and a few passages and comments from the scriptures, we can stop for a few moments and ask ourselves, "Why am I running?" and analyze the use we are making of our free agency.<br><h2><b>We Are Constantly Faced with Decisions</b></h2><br>Concerning the misuse of free agency, I have observed many times that the error is not necessarily what others do to limit our free agency, but rather our lack of making the correct decisions; it is the lack of courage to exercise this agency.<br><br>From the time the power of reasoning first begins in the early stages of the journey through life, men are continually faced with decisions, with the constant challenge of choosing, of determining which of two roads to take--the right one leading to progress and happiness or the wrong one leading to frustration and unhappiness. Man determines his own destiny by the decisions and choices he makes, which is definitely an eternal law. Our success or our failure, our peace of mind or our anxiety, all depend upon the choices we make day by day.<br><br>Certainly Samuel the Lamanite expressed emphatically and clearly that same concept:<br><br><i>And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</i><br><br><i>He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</i>[Helaman 14:30–31]<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff emphasized the responsibility that each individual assumes when he exercises his right of free agency:<br><br><i>This agency has always been the heritage of man under the rule and government of God. He possessed it in the heaven of heavens before the world was, and the Lord maintained and defended it there against the aggression of Lucifer and those that took sides with him, to the overthrow of Lucifer and one-third part of the heavenly hosts. By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do in the body.</i>[<i>Millennial Star</i>51:642]<br><br>President David O. McKay said, "So fundamental in man's eternal progress is his inherent right to choose, that the Lord would defend it even at the price of war" (<i>CR,</i>April 1942, p. 73). The reason is that without this gift the responsibilities of men having to answer for their own acts would be totally invalid. No one can be judged for acts committed under circumstances and conditions which deprive the individual from exercising completely his ability to choose, in determining the direction to follow.<br><br>President John Taylor explained this idea in the following manner:<br><br><i>If man be not a moral agent, he cannot be responsible for the present position of the world; and it would be unjust in God to punish him for acts that were not his and for circumstances over which he had no control.</i>[Daniel H. Ludlow, ed.,<i>Latter-day Prophets Speak</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1977), p. 157]<br><br>So free agency then makes it possible to exercise justice to the fullest extent, and this results in what James E. Talmage explains:<br><br><i>Man's accountability for his individual acts is as complete as is his agency to elect for himself. The ultimate result of good deeds is happiness, the consequence of evil is misery; these follow in every man's life by inviolable laws. There is a plan of judgment divinely foreordained, by which every man will be called to answer for his deeds; and not for deeds alone but for his words also and even for the thoughts of his heart.</i>[<i>The Articles of Faith,</i>12th ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924), p. 55]<br><h2><b>Through Our Choices We Determine Our Future</b></h2><br>We need to remember when we make decisions that as we sow, so shall we reap. We cannot be idlers and expect to reap the same fruits as those who labor. We cannot sow seeds of the slothful and of less effort and expect to receive the blessings of dedication and diligent effort.<br><br>By our daily decisions we determine whether we will live according to God's commandments or whether we will just follow along with, as Paul said, "commandments of men, that turn from the truth" (Titus 1:14).<br><br>Each day of our life, through the choices we make, we determine whether we will augment the building of our eternal dwelling with Heavenly Father or whether we want to slide along on a path which deprives us of the blessings of life eternal.<br><br>As everyone knows, frequently it is easier to go along with the current than to row upstream toward the mountain. However, once recognizing the importance of free agency, we come to the conclusion that self-discipline is fundamentally important in the task of making decisions.<br><br>We often see examples of how free agency is inhibited. For instance, sometimes we slip backward, instead of going forward, by letting others make decisions for us. We follow the decisions and goals of others and do not appreciate the blessings of free agency.<br><h2><b>We Have All the Time There Is</b></h2><br>Let us consider first those who go along with commonly used phrases, those who use them without reasoning through their meaning--phrases which become popular, and in many cases determine one's manner of action.<br><br>Let's talk a few minutes about those who say, "There is not time for anything," and see if they are not a typical example of those who unthinkingly leave it to others to make their decisions for them.<br><br>There is a true paradox with regard to time. Many persons declare daily that they do not have sufficient time. Nevertheless, each one has all that there is. Others say that time flies when actually it moves at a set rate. Or they speak of saving time, but time cannot be saved, lost, or borrowed.<br><br>How many times have you heard someone say that they want to make up for lost time? Once time has passed it cannot be replaced. Still others say, "The time just goes." The truth is that we are the ones who go, and time remains the same.<br><br>In my past professional work I recall many times, when there were deadlines to be met, hearing, "Time is against me." The fact is that time is on our side the very minute we have it organized. You have heard it said, "There is not sufficient time." We have all the time that there is; it all depends on how we distribute it.<br><br>All of these erroneous ideas lead to wrong actions, and if we think about that for a moment, we realize they are commonly used--in some cases we ourselves use them unthinkingly. What we need to ask ourselves is this: "Is the problem with the time or is it with myself?"<br><br>There is no question about time being the most scarce commodity, so unless we manage it wisely, there is nothing else to manage. Unless we use our head and are not fooled by these meaningless phrases, we will be caught in the current with those who do not make decisions, but allow others to make them for them; we will not be standing on our own feet.<br><br>President Kimball explained this idea in the following manner:<br><br><i>Waste is unjustified, and especially the waste of time--limited as that commodity is in our days of probation. One must live, not only exist; he must do, not merely be; he must grow, not just vegetate.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 359]<br><br>So we see that the solution is not to complain or join with those who declare "There is not time." The solution is to act and use time wisely, following the words of Paul to the Ephesians:<br><br><i>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</i><br><br><i>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</i>[Ephesians 5:15–17]<br><h2><b>Procrastinators</b></h2><br>Now let us look at another interesting situation, putting off doing things that should be done.<br><br>Try to imagine this scene: It is almost midnight and the report, the research paper, or whatever other type of assignment that has been sitting on your desk for two weeks or more, is due tomorrow. You've had a hard day of work and study and are tired, but you also know that if your report or paper is not in on time you could lose credit or get a low grade.<br><br>You look at the desk and start to wonder in your mind why you put off doing the report for so long in the first place. You knew it had to be done--that was well understood--and now you feel guilty and uncomfortable for having procrastinated.<br><br>What is procrastination? In simple terms it is postponing unnecessarily, and in an irrational way, something that one knows should be done.<br><br>Why do people procrastinate? Many reasons can be given, but it all boils down to the protection of a vulnerable feeling of self-esteem. Individuals who do this can be classified in the following categories:<br><br><b>Test Avoiders.</b>These are people who fear they will fail in their attempts to reach their own standards, standards which demand outstanding effort each time. By waiting until it is too late to do a great job, they justify the situation by convincing themselves, "I didn't have sufficient time."<br><br>I believe that here we could apply the scripture which we find in Doctrine and Covenants 67:3:<br><br><i>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</i><br><br><b>Rebels.</b>These are the people who believe that if they follow in someone else's footsteps they are being controlled or dominated. For them, to procrastinate becomes a way of retaining a feeling of power and control. In this case the words of President Brigham Young are applicable, since the answer for those who act in this manner is found in the spirit of his words:<br><br><i>In rendering . . . strict obedience, are we made slaves? No, it is the only way on the face of the earth for you and me to become free, and we shall become the slaves of our own passions, and of the wicked one, and servants to the devil, if we take any other course, and we shall be eventually cast into hell with the devils. Now to say that I do not enjoy the volition of my own will just as much when I pray as I would to swear, is a false principle, it is false ground to take. You take the man who swears, and he has no more freedom, and acts no more on his own will than the man who prays; and the man who yields strict obedience to the requirements of Heaven, acts upon the volition of his own will and exercises his freedom just as much as when he was a slave to passion; and I think it is much better and more honorable for us, whether children or adults, youthful, middle-aged or old, it is better to live by and better to die by, to have our hearts pure, and to yield strict obedience to the principles of life which the Lord has revealed, than be a slave to sin and wickedness.</i>[<i>JD</i>, 18:246]<br><br><b>Myopics.</b>Some people procrastinate because they believe that certain jobs, obligations, or assignments are not rewarding, or that they demand too much sacrifice. So they decide to put their efforts in other directions that appear to be more worthwhile or necessary. They seek immediate rewards rather than rewards obtained in the long run, though they are more valuable.<br><br>The words we find in Doctrine and Covenants 78 show the promised blessings for those who live with their vision toward eternity:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i><br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded you, saith your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman, who prepareth all things before he taketh you;</i><br><br><i>For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man his portion.</i><br><br><i>And he that is a faithful and wise steward shall inherit all things. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17–22]<br><br><b>Revengers.</b>Procrastination can take the form of anger toward someone, a professor, a boss, or an assignment one does not like. The scriptures give us a solution to this case as we read in Ecclesiastes 7:9, "Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools."<br><br><b>Self-Defeaters.</b>Some people become so depressed that they postpone working toward goals because they have a fear of being successful, then that procrastination guarantees that they don't attain the success they fear.<br><br>If people who behave in this manner would apply the words of the Savior to their lives, it would totally change their attitude. "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you" (D&amp;amp;C 68:6).<br><h2><b>Excuses for Not Acting</b></h2><br>If you will analyze the before-mentioned cases, you will notice that without fail each one of them condenses down to fear of doing the job as an excuse for not acting, or to an irrational assumption such as, "I'll be able to get that work done the night before it is due."<br><br>The solution is simple (the Prophet has said it), "Do it now."<br><h2><b>Slaves to Customs</b></h2><br>There is another false concept, an idea frequently implanted in the minds of many persons, not necessarily placed there by themselves, but by others and by customs. I refer to the tendency to do certain things because everyone else does them.<br><br>Even though this seems to be a simple matter, I will try to illustrate it with a story. I once knew a man who attained a high position in a company. He portrayed the image of a very successful man with a great personality and of being an independent person. Each day he would go to his office with a briefcase (and sometimes he carried two briefcases). One day his wife asked him, "Tell me, why do you carry that briefcase to work and back each day?"<br><br>He replied, "The executive vice president of the company is a very important person, and the paperwork which he manages is also important, don't you agree?"<br><br>The wife agreed and then inquired, "How many times do you open the briefcase and use the papers?"<br><br>"The truth is, very few times," he responded.<br><br>His wife continued with another question. "Well then, if the briefcase gives you a feeling of importance which you enjoy, wouldn't it be better and easier to carry an empty one?"<br><br>It was a logical suggestion, but then she added, "But if you carry it only for status, let me remind you that at the hour you leave the office, the only person who sees you is the caretaker."<br><br>We often become slaves to routines, we act conforming to custom or as the surrounding conditions dictate. Just because most of the people do it does not mean that it is right. The important issue in determining our salvation is to be certain and know with a clear conscience what the motives are that move us to actions, and what the thoughts are that we hold within us and which later lead to actions.<br><h2><b>Agency Regarding Our Minds</b></h2><br>We exercise our agency in our thinking process just as much as we use our agency in our actions. President McKay expressed it in this way:<br><br><i>Each one of us is the architect of his own fate; and he is unfortunate indeed who will try to build himself without the inspiration of God, without realizing that</i>he grows from within,<i>not from without.</i>["True End of Life,"<i>Instructor</i>, January 1964, p.1]<br><br>If we do not learn to grow from within and make effective use of our agency regarding our thoughts, our actions will lack direction; they will lack significant meaning, since what we wish to accomplish will not be clearly defined in our mind, and our mind will not be trained in setting goals, desires, and objectives.<br><h2><b>Opposition</b></h2><br>There is also another of Satan's snares which lures many people, another of the common phrases used as justification for not acting, for not getting the job done, for not exercising fully the right of free agency. How many people do you know that say (with a type of defeat and resignation), "The opposition is strong, and I'm only human."<br><br>What does this mean? How can anyone justify himself with such reasoning to fail or to not act positively? How can anyone think of the opposition as a limiting factor or condition in exercising our free agency?<br><br>In 2 Nephi 2:11–12, Lehi, speaking to Jacob, said:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation.</i><br><br>The trials, the opposition, the conditions which some would define as unfavorable, will ever be with us throughout this life of probation. It is a principle which has been with us from the first; therefore we must not complain--we must not lament or fail to act positively when we are confronted with one of these situations in our lives.<br><br>There are those who believe that because we are human, that is justification for our weaknesses. This is to deny the wisdom and justice of God, since that is implicitly saying or thinking that he has sent us here to earth on the preconceived condition that we would fail, yielding inevitably to the temptations of Satan. This is one form of succumbing to tradition and customs to which the scriptures refer when they say that they make us lose the vision of the eternal truths of the gospel.<br><br>Let us see what the Prophet Joseph Smith said in regard to this point.<br><br><i>He commenced his observations by remarking that the kindness of our Heavenly Father called for our heartfelt gratitude. He then observed that Satan was generally blamed for the evils which we did, but if he was the cause of all our wickedness, men could not be condemned. The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all was voluntary. Those who resisted the Spirit of God, would be liable to be led into temptation, and then the association of heaven would be withdrawn from those who refused to be made partakers of such great glory. God would not exert any compulsory means, and the devil could not; and such ideas as were entertained [on these subjects] by many were absurd.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 187]<br><br>There are various other examples which we could analyze. However, we will consider only one more aspect of free agency.<br><h2><b>Proceed with Vigor</b></h2><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–29]<br><br>I believe that these verses clearly indicated the attitude which we should develop as we confront each task or undertaking--an attitude of proceeding with enthusiasm, vigor and good will. In that quotation from the Savior we find several word phrases such as<i>compelled in all things, anxiously engaged, own free will, the power is in them,</i>and<i>do good,</i>each one being a message in itself, but all of them together motivating us to use our talents and our free agency willingly.<br><br>In those words the Savior indicated that we should serve willingly because of a desire to do so which we have developed, rather than doing the job dutifully because we are obligated.<br><br>In order to find the joy of living in accordance with the Savior's will, there should be a sincere desire to please him, doing it correctly, since this will bring us peace of mind and a rewarding feeling which cannot be obtained in any other way.<br><br><i>Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:23]<br><br>And so we have reviewed several concepts which I am sure are well known by you, but at times forgotten--the purpose being to pause in the midst of our daily careers and meditate on the great blessing that free agency is in our lives.<br><h2><b>Be Found on the Lord's Side</b></h2><br>It is my desire that in our daily struggle to make decisions, we will always be found on the Lord's side. As President George Albert Smith expressed it,<br><br><i>There are two influences ever present in the world. One is constructive and elevating and comes from our Heavenly Father; the other is destructive and debasing and comes from Lucifer. We have our agency and make our own choice in life subject to these unseen powers. There is a division line well defined that separates the Lord's territory from Lucifer's. If we live on the Lord's side of the line Lucifer cannot come there to influence us, but if we cross the line into his territory we are in his power. By keeping the commandments of the Lord we are safe on His side of the line, but if we disobey His teachings we voluntarily cross into the zone of temptation and invite the destruction that is ever present there. Knowing this, how anxious we should always be to live on the Lord's side of the line.</i>[George Albert Smith, "Our M.I.A.,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>May 1935, 38:278]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the purpose of this life is to prove ourselves, to allow us the opportunity of choosing and to gain a dwelling place in the mansions of our Father. I testify to you that this will be our reward if we have the faith, the determination, and the deep desire to follow the words of the Lord to Enoch, "Choose ye this day, to serve the Lord God who made you" (Moses 6:33).<br><br>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Angel Abrea was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 June 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>lking - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a wonderful opportunity to address BYU students in this setting, but it is also very intimidating. I am aware of the competition for your time, and I sense a great responsibility to make the time we spend together this morning very worthwhile.<br><br>I am not quite certain why I have been asked to occupy this position. I know this is the month that the General Authorities take their vacations, but there are about a thousand or so of my colleagues who could do this much better. I have concluded that someone confused me with one of the more famous Durrants. I am not Stewart, George, Devin, Bill, Snoz or any other of the Durrants you may have heard of. I am simply an obscure engineering professor who loves BYU and the association of wonderful students and faculty. I am both flattered and humbled to have received this invitation. I have earnestly sought the influence of the Spirit, for I know, as do you, that this hour can only be meaningful if we share that bond.<br><br>My wife, Gayle, and I are both alumni of this great university. I was a Stover Rover and she lived in Merrill Hall. We met in the Cannon Center and courted over breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Neither of us had a car, and we walked the ramp hand in hand through rain, sunshine, sleet, and snow. We went to the library, but frequently distracted each other from our studies. I have observed that many of you can relate to that.<br><br>I mention these things so you may know I have a deep kinship with BYU students. I sense many of your dreams, your frustrations and anxieties. I know the joy of acing an exam and the deep loneliness that one can often experience among twenty-five thousand of the "friendliest students in the world." BYU is a special place and this is a uniquely significant period in your lives. These paths you now follow will not be trod again. Your experiences here will provide an anchor for the rest of your existence, mortal and immortal. Because of the brevity of this experience, you cannot afford too many detours. Nor can you afford to carry excess baggage of any sort: emotional, physical, or spiritual. It is with these and similar thoughts uppermost in my mind that I have prepared this talk. Because of the setting, my remarks are directed toward the spiritual, but experience has taught me that it is hard to get the other aspects of life in order if the spiritual is suffering.<br><h2><b>Poised at the Edge of the World</b></h2><br>Some time ago I saw an imposing photograph. It was a picture of a mountain climber in a spectacular mountain setting. There were rugged mountains in every direction, rising thousands of feet above the valleys. In this particular photograph the climber was standing at the very edge of a high and very sheer cliff. As I viewed the picture, it had an emotional impact on me. I do not like heights. Anything over about ten feet makes my head swim. Yet this particular hiker could apparently tolerate thousands of feet, standing there with his toes nearly over the edge. I presume many of you have seen similar pictures. I am certain that the climber I describe had a great sense of excitement, poised as he was at the edge of the world. I am just as certain that his thrill was accompanied by an acute sense of the potential danger of his circumstances--staring death, so to speak, in the face.<br><br>With this visual image in mind, I have entitled my remarks,<i>Cliff Walking.</i><br><h2><b>An Analogy</b></h2><br>Each generation of missionaries has certain characteristics which distinguish it from the others. During my missionary days, a quarter of a century ago, I and my companions in the Hawaiian islands were noted for our straw hats, our underarm saddlebags and our I.P. books. I do not wish to comment further on the hats and the saddlebag--your imaginations will have to do. It is the I.P. book to which I call your attention.<br><br>I.P. books were little black six-ring binders that missionaries filled with gospel-oriented poems, proverbs, and favorite quotations. Some missionaries would spend hours collecting and swapping their little treasures. I remember one of my contemporaries even mimeographed thirty or forty pages of his I.P. book and distributed them among the rest of us with a solemnity befitting miniature gold plates.<br><br>I should mention that I.P. stood for Instant Preparation--suggesting that if one had a well-organized volume, he or she was instantly prepared for any request to speak or to teach, regardless of the shortness of the notice. All you had to do was let your I.P. book fall open and begin to read--elaborating as seemed appropriate. While I have never, then or since, had the courage, or perhaps the foolhardiness, to try that approach, I still recall some of the little ditties that found their way into my I.P. book, rather abbreviated as it was. One was a poem regarding people who like to venture near to the edges of cliffs.<br><br>Not wanting to offend you with missionary poetry, I didn't take the time to locate my crumbling I.P. book. At least it was crumbling the last time I saw it. It may be ashes by now. Suffice it to say that the poem to which I refer suggested there are two ways society might protect those who would like to walk along the edges of cliffs from peril of their chosen path: either by placing a fence at the top or providing an ambulance down below--the first to prevent a fall, the second to assuage the effects thereof.<br><br>Obviously, the fence is the better solution. But the trouble with fences is that the thrill of the experience, at least for the more daring, is unquestionably lost.<br><br>You no doubt have perceived by now that there is an analogy between the cliff in the little poem and the temptations that we endure in this life. Like the view from the cliff, which draws the hiker ever nearer to the edge, Satan's fables entice us ever neared to the brink of his carefully prepared abyss.<br><h2><b>Our Wayward Spiritual Brother</b></h2><br>When one mentions Satan, I often sense that many of us subconsciously say, "Oh yes, ho hum, him again. That wayward spiritual brother of mine--bit of a rascal at times. But nothing I can't handle!"<br><br>But Satan is not just a bothersome imp. He is the one who disrupted the peace and tranquility of our home on high, when in a bold and evil move he sought to wrest the power and glory from our Father and take it to himself. Having yielded to his own unmitigated ego, he not only wanted the praise and adulation of the rest of us, he wanted the throne of God! From Isaiah we read:<br><br><i>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground. ...</i><br><br><i>For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascent into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. ...</i><br><br><i>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.</i>[Isaiah 14:12–14]<br><br>When his evil plan was rejected, he flew into a blind and jealous rage. He brought the bitterness of hell into our celestial home. The ensuing conflict has been referred to in the scriptures as a war. "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels" (Revelation 12:7)--not an argument, not a skirmish, but a war--suggesting an all-out conflict of momentous proportions. You and I were to be the pawns, as far as Satan was concerned, in his great conquest. Oh yes, he promised us eternal life, guaranteed--a real<i>no cut</i>contract. That should have placated us! But our happiness was not his goal. We were to be his stepping-stones to the throne. From the very outset, Lucifer, who despised his elder brother, Jehovah, tried to bend the circumstances for his own benefit. Is it any wonder that the Prophet Joseph Smith stated that Satan "was a liar from the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 93:25)?<br><h2><b>They Have Turned Their Hate upon Humanity</b></h2><br>But you and I were not about to become pawns in this evil scheme. Our brother, Michael, standing at the side of Jehovah, rallied us to the cause that eventually held the day, and which led to one-third of our spiritual brothers and sisters being expelled from the presence of God forever. We all know the story, but we fail so often to appreciate the bitterness and the hatred of our lost relatives. Having been cast away from the presence of God and Jehovah, unable ever to obtain their primary goal of the throne of God, Lucifer and his hoard have turned their hate upon their other lost opportunity--humanity. Being unable to obtain bodies, they have vowed to destroy you and me and, by so doing, rob God of his kingdom. Satan's goal is thus shared by his "angels." There is no compromise, no proposed point of truce, no 38th parallel, for those of you old enough to remember the Korean War. There is only the persistent, unrelenting drive born of intense hate. Hate as deep and as abiding as is the contrasting love of Christ, for Satan desires "that all men might be miserable like unto himself" (2 Nephi 2:27). He is the chief antagonist of every righteous cause.<br><h2><b>The Hawaiian Sham Battle</b></h2><br>Having been born in Hawaii, I have often enjoyed reading histories of those great islands and the people who lived there. One of the things that I have often found intriguing about the ancient Hawaiian men and their form of battle was the method they used to train for spear warfare.<br><br>The Hawaiian warriors used, among other weapons, a long spear made from very hard wood. They did not have metal from which to make tips; otherwise, they were about the size and weight of the javelin used in track and field events. As preparatory exercises for war, the men would engage in sham battles. Now, while a sham battle was, as the name implies, a mock or pretend combat, it could become training of a very deadly sort. After dividing the warriors into two groups, arrayed on opposite sides of an open meadow, the sham battle began with each group hurling their spears at the other. The object of the game was not just to keep from getting killed, but rather, after having hurled one's spear at the "enemy," to catch the incoming spears barehanded and return them as well. For, you see, once you had thrown your spear, you were unarmed. You rearmed yourself by catching another as it came toward you.<br><br>You can well imagine the scene that such a melee would produce. King Kamehameha was observed in one such battle to catch three spears in his right hand, fend off a fourth with the spear in his left hand and sidestep a fifth, all in one continuous motion.<br><h2><b>Our Fight Against Satan Is No Sham Battle</b></h2><br>Now I bring up the Hawaiian sham battle because it is helpful in drawing parallels with our fight against Satan. But there are some differences--important differences. The sham battle was a game, of sorts. You could be severely injured, or even killed, but that was not the object, nor the intent of the game.<br><br>On the other hand, the spears of the adversary are not thrown with any thought that they may be harmlessly caught or skillfully dodged. Satan is not engaged in a sham battle where he expects his efforts to be thwarted. He carefully plans, with great wealth of knowledge, the formation of each battle, having little interest in the evenly and fairly dispersed combatants. No, not Satan--his cunning and perverse plans are intended to home in his fiery darts with swift accuracy, separating us, as Nephi warned, from the iron rod (see 1 Nephi 15:23–24). You and I may think the War in Heaven is over, but, as far as Satan is concerned, that was merely the initial battle. He continues with a hate-driven vengeance that you and I, filled with the Spirit of Christ, cannot even begin to envision. He has devised schemes without number to gain men's souls.<br><br>Satan first sought out Adam and Eve in the Garden; he has not rested one moment since. He was there to combat with exhibitions of evil sorcery the attempts of Moses to gain the freedom of the children of Israel. He was there to tempt Christ during his forty-day fast, trying to thwart the Atonement. "Worship me," he cried to Jesus, after proffering all the kingdom of the earth (see Matthew 4:9). He was there in the woods were Joseph Smith sought the Lord in humble prayer, pressing down upon the young lad until he thought himself nearly destroyed. He haunted the early missionaries of this dispensation at almost every turn. Of those times, Heber C. Kimball recounts the following experience from his mission to the British Isles:<br><br><i>About daybreak, Elder Isaac Russell... , who slept with Elder Richards in Wilford Street, came up to the third story, where Elder Hyde and myself were sleeping, and called out, "Brother Kimball, I want you should get up and pray for me that I may be delivered from the evil spirits that are tormenting me to such a degree that I feel I cannot live long, unless I obtain relief."</i><br><br><i>I had been sleeping on the back of the bed. I immediately arose, slipped off at the foot of the bed, and passed round to where he was. Elder Hyde threw his feet out, and sat up in the bed, and we laid hands on him, I being mouth, and prayed that the Lord would have mercy on him, and rebuked the devil.</i><br><br><i>While thus engaged, I was struck with great force by some invisible power, and fell senseless to the floor. The first thing I recollected was being supported by Elders Hyde and Richards, who were praying for me. ...</i><br><br><i>Elders Hyde and Richards then assisted me to get on the bed, but my agony was so great I could not endure it, and I arose, bowed my knees and prayed. I then arose and sat up on the bed, when a vision was opened to our minds, and we could distinctly see the evil spirits, who foamed and gnashed their teeth at us. We gazed upon them about an hour and a half. ... We were not looking towards the window, but towards the wall. Space appeared before us, and we saw the devils coming in legions, with their leaders, who came within a few feet of us. They came towards us like armies rushing to battle. They appeared to be men of full stature, possessing every form of feature of men in the flesh, who were angry and desperate; and I shall never forget the vindictive malignity depicted on their countenances as they looked me in the eye; and any attempt to paint the scene which then presented itself, or portray their malice and enmity, would be vain. I perspired exceedingly, my clothes becoming as wet as if I had been taken out of the river. I felt excessive pain, and was in the greatest distress for some time. I cannot even look back on the scene without feelings of horror; yet by it I learned the power of the adversary, his enmity against the servants of God, and got some understanding of the invisible world. We distinctly heard those spirits talk and express their wrath and hellish designs against us. However, the Lord delivered us from them and blessed us exceedingly that day.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), p. 143–145]<br><h2><b>Eternal Opposition</b></h2><br>When Satan was cast down, becoming the father of all lies, he was denied a body forever. He and his angels are sons of perdition and are in eternal opposition to all righteousness. They spend their existence tempting, enticing and encouraging you and me to leave the path of truth and walk in darkness. There is no compromise. They are the opposition to God's plan. Through their efforts, our loyalty to Jesus Christ is tested and tried. Elder McConkie has said of Satan, "[He] opposes every good thing with evil, and is the arch foe of every upright person" (<i>MD,</i>p. 25), and Peter advised, "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8).<br><br>Overcoming the perverse enticings of Satan is an essential part of our progression and advancement. It is a very personal battle that we wage with Satan. No one can fight it for us. We can, however, strengthen and buoy each other. That is the purpose of families. It is also one reason for the programs of the Church.<br><h2><b>Teetering at the Edge</b></h2><br>Now, returning to the cliff-walking attitude I referred to earlier, it seems that as you and I thread our way through life's little meanderings, we become confronted with Satan's detours, those opportunities to peer over the cliff. Being curious, or bold, or foolhardy, we often come perilously close to the edge; so often that we see just how far we can get from the iron rod without really letting go of our grasp--perhaps just keeping a finger still upon the rod. Then, if one of Satan's darts strikes too near the target, we slip over the edge with hardly a murmur. It was thrilling, though, while it lasted, teetering there on the brink, knowing we were so close to peril, but confident, oh, so confident, that we had things in control.<br><br>Satan doesn't care what he uses to get us--liquor, tobacco, drugs, desires for unearned wealth, dishonesty, lust. He is clever enough to use whatever is at hand. I read recently of a young man who was taunted by his friends until, teetering at the edge, he relented and became a participant in drug usage. His habit increased until the time he became involved in theft to support it. From there it was only a small step to armed robbery, a shooting, and a dead druggist. He'll never know, because of the drug-induced stupor, whether or not he was the one who fired the fatal shot, but it was he who was convicted and sentenced to a ninety-year term. All because he couldn't say no, when he knew he should, to his so-called friends.<br><br>I have a friend who, as a young man, couldn't say no to a drink of alcohol. For him it was a special kind of poison. He became an alcoholic. It had disastrous consequences for his family, as you can well imagine, and he struggled for years to overcome his illness. Happily, he did so, and along the way he has found time to help others. On the other hand, he lost years with his young family that he can never regain. And sadder yet, he suffered an estrangement from the Church which still lingers. From all indications it appears that his past drinking has robbed him of an eternal family.<br><br>In a different vein, I recall a young couple who were having difficulty behaving themselves alone on dates. They became concerned with their actions and worried that they might become increasingly involved to the point that they would lose all they held dear. After talking things over, they decided they needed to begin each date with a prayer. That was a good plan, but their dates continued to end up with just the two of them in some secluded spot. Walking on the edge of the cliff, as it were, they repeatedly fell into the same behavior for which they had prayed for strength to overcome. The peril-filled thrill of petting had great attraction than did the calm plans made in the less secluded light of day. It was obvious that if they were going to stop flirting with danger, they would have to take steps to change their pattern of being alone. Yet it seems so human that, having once walked to the edge of the cliff, they returned so readily.<br><br>The story had an almost happy ending. One of them finally realized that they lacked the determination to modify their behavior. She terminated their dating altogether, thus narrowly escaping the final slip into the abyss.<br><h2><b>Are Our Fences in a State of Disrepair?</b></h2><br>It really doesn't matter what the temptation is. It suits the adversary just fine, so long as it gets the job done. In ten years as a bishop and high councilor, I have participated in some thirty or more Church courts. I can testify to you that not once--no not once--had the brother or sister, whose membership was on trial, stayed comfortably back from the edge of the cliff. Their fences, if indeed they ever built them, were in a state of disrepair. With weakened safeguards, and minds full of fantasy, they danced to Satan's tune until they stumbled over the edge.<br><br>I have wept with friends, neighbors, and relatives as they have lost their membership in the kingdom of God. Without exception, they have permitted Satan to enter their lives and, with his clever enticings and self-serving justifications, lead them carefully to the brink of disaster, where, with just the slightest nudge, the deed was done--lives destroyed, families shattered, and blessings forfeited.<br><br>Brinkmanship may be a political weapon of the adroit statesman, but it is more dangerous than a two-edged sword when our position in the kingdom of God is at stake.<br><br>I remember one sister who had great potential, but she was less than satisfied with her husband. How often do Church leaders hear about less than satisfactory spouses? This sister's frustration was not without grounds. She didn't have a temple marriage, and her husband was not active in the Church. They had lovely children, and she said she wanted an eternal family. And I believe she did. But she had a wandering eye, and an enterprising acquaintance was more than happy to oblige her discontent. He was willing to be everything she wanted, or so he professed. And then the fairy tale began.<br><br>He convinced her of the wonderful father he would be to her children--never mind that he had already failed one marriage, irreparably wounding his own offspring.<br><br>He would walk the temple grounds with her, talking about the celestial marriage that she deserved--never mind that he was unworthy to hold a temple recommend.<br><br>And the tales continued, right from the temple grounds to the motel room where, having got what he wanted, "... nothing now remained to do, but begin the game anew," to steal a line from A. E. Housman.<br><br>The result was predictable. No amount of warning could change the course of events. How we humans love to pretend, to chase dreams.<br><br>She abandoned her family, letting her husband sue for divorce, to follow her newfound lover. But then he decided he really didn't want another marriage after all, and she was left with broken promises and more shattered dreams. The only winner? Of course, Lucifer. His winnings? One family destroyed, a half-dozen lives shattered.<br><h2><b>We Are Not Abandoned</b></h2><br>We are here, you and I, to be tried, tested and proven worthy to reenter our Father in Heaven's kingdom. We are here, as was Christ, to overcome temptation and claim our crowns on high. Although we may have forgotten all, we are not abandoned. We have the guidance of scripture, the counsel of living prophets and other inspired leaders, and, for those baptized under the hands of the priesthood of God, the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The words of Paul to the Ephesians provide eloquent advice for you and me. Said he:<br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</i><br><br><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</i><br><br><i>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</i><br><br><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</i><br><br><i>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.</i>[Ephesians 6:11–18]<br><h2><b>The Spiritual Contributions of Our Ancestors</b></h2><br>Now, indulge me if you will, as I make a few comments regarding my family, which you see seated before you. You won't believe it, but it seems only yesterday that I was a student at this great university. I remember well attending devotionals and wondering when all the things Church leaders said about families would pertain to my life. It all seemed so remote, so far into the future. Now here I stand, my own family at my side, acutely aware of my successes and failures as a father, a husband, and a patriarch. As I contemplate my children, they truly are the jewels Gayle and I most treasure. They may not be the most brilliant, the most spiritual, the best-behaved children in the world, but I wouldn't trade one of them for any other. They are uniquely a part of me and they are uniquely a part of my wife. They are uniquely a part of an entire ancestry.<br><br>It is interesting to note how we as individuals are situated very much like the neck of an hourglass, gathering in like a great magnifying lens all the characteristics of a great ancestry and spewing them out in ever-broadening generations of posterity. When I think of myself in that setting, I become acutely aware of the spiritual contributions of my great pioneer and subsequent faithful ancestors, and I realize that I am the only one who can bequeath that heritage to my children. There is not another soul on earth that can do that for me. There can be no vicarious transfer. That is my opportunity and my obligation alone. Furthermore, as a parent I have to help them build their fences at the cliff's edge.<br><h2><b>The Average LDS Family</b></h2><br>And so, as I contemplate that great challenge and responsibility, I am faced with the hope of success and the possibility of failure. But one thing I know. I am not the least bit interested in having an average LDS family. My children have a difficult time with that concept. It's unfair if Mother and I request that they not play football out in the street on the Sabbath--"all the other kids are!" It is not fair if we insist that our children be home at a specified hour--"the others don't have to be home that early!" You see, the average statistics for the LDS are that one young man in three, or thereabouts, goes on a mission. LDS youth on the average, marry about 50 percent of the time in the temple.<br><br>Consider my sons. Could you specify which of the three would go on a mission and which two would travel other paths? Will it be Jeff, whose priests quorum I advise? Or Dennis, whose Little League baseball team I coach? Or Andy, who thinks the neatest thing in all the world is to go motorcycle riding with his dad? Is there one more deserving blessing of a mission than others? Which two should turn their backs on the words of the prophet so that my boys will be average? Tell me, if you will, which two should find more important things to do.<br><br>Can you help me decide which two of my four daughters should forfeit the blessings pronounced at the altars of the temple so that we might be average? Should it be Laura and Lynita, my two BYU coeds? Or how about Jeannine, my musician? Or little Meg, who brings a smile to her dad with such little effort? Which two shall I declare unworthy? Disinterested? Unfaithful?<br><br>I find the prospects of having an average LDS family absolutely intolerable. But that is just exactly what I will get and it is just exactly what you will get if we choose an average kind of path to follow.<br><br>Now, I realize that by calling attention to my family I am putting myself on the spot. If I, or they, fail, fingers may point. But I'm willing to take the heat. As far as I am concerned, one of Satan's greatest tools is to get you and me to become content to take the average road. To go, for instance, to R-rated movies because everyone else does, to lie a little, to cheat a little, to take a little advantage because it's the sort of thing that seems so common. It is the path by which we are led, as said Nephi, "carefully down to hell" (<i>see</i>2 Nephi 28:21).<br><h2><b>Satan's Power Is Very Real</b></h2><br>Now I am not perfect, and neither are you. At times I am greatly tempted and so are you. Look at Satan's potential prize if he can get me. Think how vulnerable my children then become! What's your net worth if he can get you? Think of your unborn posterity. What is their value? Can you see their faces and envision their personalities? Can Satan capture them without so much as a skirmish by getting you before they're even born? It can happen. It did in my family. My great-great-grandfather and his brother were stonecutters on the Nauvoo Temple, having come to America as immigrants from Great Britain. When the prophet said "go west," my great-great-grandfather moved out. His brother, for one reason or another, found sufficient excuse to stay in Iowa. Today my great-great-grandfather has a posterity that numbers into the hundreds, if not thousands. Many have matched his faithfulness and brought glory to his name. His brother has but a handful of living descendants, every single one out of the Church. There is not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints within his posterity. This earth just may close out its term of existence without any trace of his bloodline having ever embraced the gospel of Christ. Truly, that is damnation.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, I testify to you that Satan is very, very real. I have both felt and witnessed his great power and it is a frightening thing. I felt his influence as I prepared this talk. I was beset with unseemly thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, feelings of unworthiness, of confusion, which could only be driven away through earnest prayer.<br><br>It is my further testimony that Christ lives and that he provides each of us with the necessary knowledge to recognize sin and error.<br><h2><b>But for the Grace of God</b></h2><br>I mentioned earlier that I have participated in a number of Church courts. On many occasions, following the conclusion of those experiences, I have walked slowly and tearfully to my home, for I have, on other occasions, felt the same temptations that caused my brethren to fall. Time and again the thought has entered my mind that "there but for the grace of God go I." I don't know why, but somehow the fences at the top of my cliffs were a little sturdier at just the right time. For that I have fallen on my knees and expressed eternal gratitude to my Father. I pray that I can have the wisdom to continue. I pray that my children can prepare their fences and I pray that each of you can recognize those avenues which Satan is stalking in his search for your souls and that you can likewise prepare adequate defenses.<br><br>Jesus Christ is the source of our strength. You and I need that strength if we are to turn away from evil and return to our Father. Of this I testify, in his name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>S.

<h1> Thinketh - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We read in Acts, chapter two, verse 17, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams."<br><br>I hesitate to mention today that I have had a dream, because doing so implies something about my age. I would rather report to you about a vision. Nevertheless, I had a dream about another talk I had to give a few months ago.<br><br>During the preparation for that talk, I awoke one morning from a dream. I had come to the pulpit in my dream to give my address. However, as I stood by the pulpit, vines began to grow all around the pulpit. They covered the pulpit like a large trellis. As I began to talk, the pulpit was faced backward. I was standing with my back to the congregation and was addressing my remarks to those sitting on the stand. As I stood there, facing backward, with vines all around me, the Orem High School marching band came into the chapel, marching up and down the aisles playing "76 Trombones." Well, I am happy to be here this morning and to see that the pulpit is facing the right way, that the plants on the stand have not grown, and that the marching band has not arrived.<br><h2><b>Law of the Harvest</b></h2><br>This spring my eight-year-old son and I went through the normal spring ritual of planting a garden. It is a delightful experience. We have learned two things over the years.<br><br>First, when we plant corn seeds, we receive corn back. When we plant radish seeds, we get radishes, carrots beget carrots, etc.<br><br>Second, we also learned that whatever we planted came back in abundance. When we planted zucchini, we got lots of zucchini.<br><br>These two principles are referred to as the law of the harvest. I am grateful to Brother Frederick W. Babbel for helping me understand this concept and realize the significance of this principle of the gospel. He authored a great book entitled "<i>To Him That Believeth.</i>"<br><br>Brother Babbel writes:<br><br><i>Some people call this the Law of Cause and Effect; others call it the Law of Action and Reaction; still others call it the Law of Karma. References in the holy scriptures usually refer to it as the Law of the Harvest. This law can be named as the first law given during the creation of this earth and all form of life thereon.</i>[See Genesis 1:11–12, 27–28.]<br><br><i>Everything multiplies "after his kind." This includes plants, fruit trees, birds, fish, insects, animals, and human beings. . . .</i><br><br><i>As we apply this principle to daily life situations, we will discern that it also applies to our thoughts, feelings, and actions. . . .</i><br><br><i>Whatever you give to life will return to you--multiplied! This applies to our daily thoughts, feelings, and actions, be they positive or negative, uplifting or depressing. Hence, we need to make wise decisions.</i><br><br><i>Because of this principle, you can make for yourself a heaven or a hell on earth. You alone must bear the responsibility for the choices you make.</i><br><br><i>Who sets the standard of what forgiveness you may expect to receive? You do. (Matthew 6:14–15.) If you wish to be forgiven, you must first forgive others.</i><br><br><i>Who sets the standard of how you will be judged? You do. (Matthew 7:1–2.) Your own judgment by your Heavenly Father will be compassionate or harsh, depending upon what standard you have set in judging others.</i><br><br><i>The things you desire from life, you must first give to life. (Matthew 7:12.) What about acquiring the things you want? Like the seed planted in the ground, life can only return to you that which you first have given--with the added promise that everything you give must ultimately return to you multiplied. Perhaps that is why a sage of bygone years said a great truth, "Give to the world the best that you have and the best will come back to you." And we might add, it will be multiplied!</i><br><br><i>If you feel that you are accident-prone, or a "worry wart," or a "Why-does-this-always-happen-to-me" sort of person, you have become a victim rather than a master of this law. . . . This law can work for you as well as against you.</i><br><h2><b>Job and the Law of the Harvest</b></h2><br>Brother Babbel continues:<br><br><i>In the Bible, Job is the epitome of a just and perfect man with many problems. At the beginning of his record it appears that he did not understand the implications of the Law of the Harvest.</i><br><br><i>As a young person in Sunday School, it used to bother me a great deal when our teacher related to us the story of Job and his excruciating suffering and pain. The explanation was always that we must be patient in our afflictions and sufferings, just like Job.</i><br><br><i>The rationalization was always that the devil wanted to test Job and that God gave him the privilege of literally wrecking this poor man's life and everything he had built up. I could never accept that kind of a God, one who would compromise or "make a deal" with the devil. My experience has confirmed to me that he is a God of love, a God of kindness, and a God of patience. . . . I could not conceive of his deliberately permitting this type of suffering to happen to a perfect person.</i><br><br><i>After reading the biblical account many times,</i>[<i>I finally realized</i>]<i>that Job tells the real cause of all his disasters in the third chapter, twenty-fifth verse: "For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me." (Job 3:25.)</i><br><br><i>In other words, Job acknowledged that he was afraid, that he was a worrier. What would he do if he lost his health? What would he do if he lost his possessions? What would he do if he lost his business? What would he do if he lost his house? What would happen if he lost some of his loved ones? What would happen if he lost his entire family? What would happen if his closest friends turned against him? Such thoughts, apparently, preyed on him continually.</i><br><br><i>The law is that the things which we think and the things which we harbor generate our feelings, and these feelings result in our acts which produce the harvest. For "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." (Galatians 6:7.) "For as</i>[<i>a man</i>]<i>thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7.)</i><br><br><i>Since Job sowed seeds of worry, doubt, and fear, the devil had access to him and the harvest was calamitous. He lost everything but his faith in the Lord.</i><br><br><i>The things that Job was admittedly so much concerned about, came to pass. They became so unbearable that he wished that he had never been born, that he had been hidden under the greatest mountain chain so that not even God could find him or have any recollection of his existence.</i><br><br><i>But with all his problems and troubles, he did not deny God. Finally the Lord came to him and said, in effect, "Job, wake up and be a man. Don't you recall how happy you were in the morn of creation and how eagerly you looked forward to the wonderful opportunity of coming to this earth and partaking of the beauties here? Now stop whining and be a man. Gird up your loins and speak as if thou hast understanding."</i><br><br><i>When Job perceived the message and realized that he had sown the seeds of his own problems and undoing, he took on new courage. (Job 42.) He then departed from fear and desired the things which are of God. He was eager to follow the guidelines that the Lord had given him. Note how the Law of the Harvest began to work for his benefit when he changed his attitude.</i><br><br><i>The scriptures reveal that when Job realized the cause of his dilemma and asked the Lord's forgiveness, his blessings were multiplied abundantly; he was rewarded two-fold in family, in friends, in flocks and herds, in health, and in all that makes for an abundant life.</i>[Frederick W. Babbel,<i>"To Him That Believeth"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), pp. 25–29]<br><br>What are some of the seeds that we may plant in our lives? The seeds of the adversary include the following:<br><br><i>Faultfinding (criticism)</i><br><br><i>Discord (quarrel)</i><br><br><i>Contention (argument)</i><br><br><i>Pride (dispute)</i><br><br><i>Envy</i><br><br><i>Discouragement</i><br><br><i>Disbelief (doubt)</i><br><br><i>Fear (worry, anxiety)</i><br><br><i>Anger</i><br><br><i>Hate</i><br><br>But the seeds of our Father in Heaven would have us plant are these:<br><br><i>Love</i><br><br><i>Rejoicing (praise)</i><br><br><i>Thankfulness (gratitude)</i><br><br><i>Joy</i><br><br><i>Faith</i><br><br><i>Forgiveness</i><br><br><i>Patience (longsuffering)</i><br><br><i>Humility (meekness)</i><br><br><i>Harmony</i><br><br><i>Peace</i><br><br><i>Temperance</i><br><br><i>Goodness</i><br><br><i>Gentleness</i><br><br>[Babbel, p. 33]<br><br>Today I would like to add three additional seeds to this impressive and inspired list. First, that of obedience; second, repentance; and last, what I call the telephone parable, reach out and touch someone.<br><h2><b>Obedience</b></h2><br>An illustration of the blessings that one receives through obedience is given by this story of Abraham Smoot. As you know, the administration building bears his name.<br><br>After the hardships of Ohio, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Abraham Smoot finally was able to settle down in Salt Lake City, build comfortable accommodations for his family, and become mayor of the city. Brigham asked Brother Smoot to come to Provo and be the stake president. The Brigham Young Academy was not Church funded and was the personal responsibility of the stake president. Brother Smoot balked at the idea. "Brother Brigham, I've put my family through so much. I have done all I was asked to do. Now, finally, I have some of the comforts of life, I have a position of respect, and I am able to provide for my family. It is too much to ask. I will not go to Provo."<br><br>At that, Brigham Young, the Lion of the Lord, is reputed to have said, "Brother Smoot, you will go to Provo, or you will go to ------!" Brother Smoot went to Provo. By the time he died, Abraham O. Smoot was deeply in debt from keeping the university functioning. His homes were mortgaged and an auction was held to settle the debts.<br><br>Jesse Knight showed up at the sale and happened to be the highest bidder on every one of the Smoot homes. He took the deeds and signed one over to each of the wives of Abraham Smoot living in the homes.<br><br>Brother Smoot demonstrated to us that by being obedient we harvest eternal blessings which are far more important than the material wealth of this life.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>The second seed that I would like you to plant in your life is that of repentance. I have a daughter who runs the 100-meter hurdles for Orem High School. There are 10 hurdles that she must jump in the race. The race takes about 16 seconds. In fact, some girls have run the 100-meter hurdles in 14.5 seconds. One of her goals has always been to finish the race. This young daughter has worked hard, put in many hours of practice, and has been taught correct principles in how to run hurdles. She has developed faith in herself, and she has been successful in being one of the top hurdlers in the state of Utah.<br><br>The other day I looked at the hurdles from the starting point, and it is quite an awesome sight to see those ten hurdles in straight and narrow lanes. It reminded me that eternal life is our destination, and straight and narrow is the way.<br><br>In one recent meet, my daughter hit the first hurdle, knocking her into the other lane. This disqualified her from the race. They call it being DQ'd. We, too, have hurdles in our way. It may be the hurdle of sin, of transgression, of reluctance, of procrastination, of pride, or of the lack of faith. We, too, have had experience, teachings, hard work, and faith. Sometimes in our life we hit hurdles and may be temporarily DQ'd. Unlike my daughter, however, the race is not over for us. Repentance allows us to continue.<br><br>The Savior provided for us that process of repentance. Jesus taught us the path. He personally walked that path and commanded us to follow him and do the things that he had done. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way . . . that leadeth to salvation (see Matthew 7:14, D&amp;amp;C 132:22).<br><br>Jesus walked the path of disappointment. Remember in Luke 13:34 he said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children . . ., and ye would not!"<br><br>Jesus also walked the path of obedience. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8).<br><br>Jesus walked the path of service. "Love thy neighbor . . ." (see Luke 10:27). Jesus walked the path of prayer and taught us whom we should pray to--our Father in Heaven (Luke 11:2). And to be obedient, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). And finally he taught us to pray for others. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>So as we move along the narrow path, it is important that we follow the Savior and his example. If we are temporarily DQ'd, then repentance allows us to continue on and to be successful in our lives.<br><h2><b>Human Touch</b></h2><br>The last seed I would like to plant in your life is for you to understand the importance of the human touch. Again, the Savior provided us with the proper example. "And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them" (Matthew 8:15). "Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it" (Matthew 9:29, 30). "And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him" (Luke 22:51). "And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them" (3 Nephi 18:36).<br><br>In all of these cases, the Savior was telling us that it is important to express feeling through the human touch. We visualize that when we see a new baby with its mother or when we see an engaged couple holding hands or a father and son wrestling on the living room floor. President Holland is a touch person. President Kimball also emulates that trait. Other examples of the human touch include a handshake, a pat on the back, or a hug. "A hug says it all and makes both the hugger and the huggee feel terrific" (<i>Family Circle,</i>28 April 1981, p. 79). Let me identify a few occasions where giving a hug would be appropriate:<br><br><i>Your kids say, "Wow! Leftovers!"</i><br><br><i>Your father insists, "I like to wallpaper ceilings."</i><br><br><i>You change your hair color and your husband not only notices, he whistles.</i><br><br><i>Your seven-year-old turns off the TV and says, "I just feel like reading a book."</i><br><br><i>Your thirteen-year-old daughter sits down to write a thank-you note--with no prompting.</i><br><br><i>You find your husband--who started out to clean the attic--dreamily looking at your old wedding album.</i><br><br><i>Your husband looks at the ruined fender, then at you, and asks, "Are you sure you're all right?"</i><br><br><i>Your son comes home from college with a haircut.</i><br><br><i>Your teenage son borrows the car and returns it with a full tank.</i><br><br><i>Your teenage daughter calls at midnight to say the party's gotten out of hand, and would you come to pick her up?</i><br><br><i>Your two-year-old asks you to marry her.</i><br><br><i>Your husband says "I'm sorry" even though you know it's just as much your fault.</i><br><br><i>The puppy is trained at last.</i><br><br><i>Your husband does the dishes--and the pots.</i><br><br><i>Your nine-year-old's Little League team loses 32 in an extra inning.</i><br><br>[Mary Mobler, "Fifty Reasons to Give a Hug,"<i>Family Circle,</i>28 April 1981, p. 79]<br><br>The human touch conveys so many emotions.<br><br>We recently had a family home evening where the opposite of this principle was taught. Each of us had a tag on a piece of string around our necks. During the day, when any one of us said anything negative to another, we would tear a little of that person's tag, indicating that what the offender had done was to give negative rather than positive reinforcement.<br><br>So often we do the opposite of what the Savior has taught by tearing each other's tags. For example, when I say to my children, "Why do you do those dumb things?" "You can't do that," "Don't be silly," or "You dummy," I convey a negative connotation to my children. That is, I "tear their tags."<br><br>Each morning, as I would awaken my eight-year-old son, I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And then he would stop at the landing, and again I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And finally, in the bathroom, I would tear his tag again by saying, "Look at the monkey in the mirror." I didn't realize that I was "tearing his tag" until one day at family prayer he said, "Please, Father in Heaven, make it so my Daddy doesn't call me a monkey anymore." Now when we look in the mirror I say, "Look at that neat kid with his handsome father." How often do we tear each other's tags rather than follow the example of lifting through the human touch?<br><br>My older son, who is currently serving a mission, told me of an experience he had while he worked as a disc jockey for K-96. He worked the two till six a.m. shift. One evening he received a phone call from a BYU coed who was not a member of the Church. He could sense that she was distraught and very emotional. She wanted to know the phone number of the Crisis Center since she said, "I am contemplating suicide."<br><br>It seems that her roommates had never invited her to church meetings or activities. They had meant well by honoring her own beliefs, but in the process had forgotten to include her, had forgotten to reach out and touch her. They had not been harsh or mean, but, at the same time, their "neutral" position had not built or sustained a relationship. She felt so alone and unloved.<br><br>He was able to keep her on the telephone, telling her about the gospel and about the Savior, only occasionally breaking off to do the necessary station identification. As the sun started to peek over Timpanogos, only then was she able to bring her emotions under control. His two-hour conversation helped put her life into perspective. He had reached out and touched her.<br><br>How many young people are there who have their tags torn, unable really to experience the joy that comes from the human touch? Children seem to understand this concept so much better than those of us who are called adults.<br><br>My wife teaches second grade at Rock Canyon School. One of her students this year was somewhat of an outcast. He was different. He had a difficult time writing. He had a difficult time expressing his emotions.<br><br>The class members, under my wife's tutelage, learned that they could help him. She would use pats on the back and hugs as positive reinforcement. Whenever this young man achieved, the entire class would applaud.<br><br>It seems that children are always able to respond openly and honestly in terms of their feelings. I asked my young son one time if he was going to become an Eagle like his brother. After much thought he replied, "Nope, I think I'd rather be a duck." One young second grade student responded the following way when asked to name the four seasons: "Duck, deer, fishing, pheasant." He received full credit since his answer conveyed a loving relationship with a committed father.<br><br>Let me further illustrate this caring concept with the following stories.<br><br>Elaine and Dave arrived at the hotel exhausted. Elaine had made all the arrangements for the room and the concert they planned to attend, and she let Dave know about it all the way, telling him how hard she'd worked to coordinate everything.<br><br>Then--horrors!--they walked up to the desk and the hotel manager told them they had no reservations. He pulled out the letter Elaine had written and proved he was right.<br><br>"I had put down the wrong dates," she groaned. "And having been so full of myself, I thought for sure Dave would give it to me."<br><br>What Dave gave her instead was a hug. "Honey," he said, "don't worry. We'll find something else." It dawned on Elaine that she had married the kind of person who never hits you when you're down. "I think of that whenever I start complaining to myself about all that Dave isn't. It reminds me that I've picked the right person."<br><br><i>Soon after their sixth anniversary, . . . Angi and David's home burned to the ground. Angi's first act, when they were allowed to hunt through the blackened remains, was to search for their very precious photograph albums. And when she went to tell David the news that the pictures indeed had survived, she found him kneeling in ashes to rescue, and carefully place in a box, some charred, folded pieces of paper--their courtship love letters.</i><br><br><i>"As I watched David there in the ashes," she</i>[<i>says</i>]<i>, "I was overcome with the certainty that we were meant for one another. There, in the face of our greatest tragedy, our first thoughts were not of our material loss but of the potential loss of these precious parts of ourselves and of our life together. As I knelt to help him with the letters, I was certain that we hadn't lost anything that mattered after all."</i>[Judith Viorst, "True Love Stories,"<i>Redbook,</i>February 1982, p. 38]<br><br>We have developed a game that we play in our home called "Touched You Last." Most nights, as we tuck the children in bed, we play this fun game. One night, after we all had been in bed for a few minutes and the lights were out, my daughter got out of her bed and in the dark crawled quietly on her hands and knees from her room down the hall into our room. She crawled to my side of the bed, reached up and said, "Touched you last." I want you to know that my heart is okay.<br><br>Last spring, our golden retriever, Duchess, had seven brand-new puppies. One day, when the puppies were about five weeks old, I brought the puppies to the Tanner Building so the secretaries could see them.<br><br>While I was here on campus, I took them out on the east side of the Tanner Building and let them run around on the patio area which leads down to Helaman Halls. It was a neat experience to watch these mature, scholarly students as they would stop to play with the puppies. Everyone who stopped got down on their hands and knees and played with the puppies, allowing the little dogs to kiss them.<br><br>It was great to see these college students "reach out and touch" and extend love to little warm puppies. Surely the Peanuts character, Charlie Brown, was right when he said, "Happiness is a warm puppy."<br><br>Today I have told you that whatever a person soweth, so shall he or she reap. This is the law of the harvest. Also, I've said that we have within our grasp the full potential for our own happiness. It is really up to us. As we are obedient to the principles of the gospel and as we put our lives in order, through repentance, we can then "reach out and touch someone."<br><br>Finally, let me end with a short story written by one of my wife's students. The story illustrates the seed and essence of happiness.<br><br><i>If I found some gold and jewels, I would share with my family. I would buy my mom a new car, some clothes, and a new house. My sister some clothes. And a Cabbage Patch for Jane, my sister. Now my brother some new clothes, a car for Jim. For Jack which he thinks he is the king, because he gets everything he wants, I would get him some clothes. Now for my dad anything he wants. My grandma and grandpa I would give them some money. And what do I get! Do you think I need some money? You do, oh! I don't think so. Because I shared with my family and it made me happy. And so I was the richest in the world.</i><br><br>May we plant in our lives the seed of obedience to the gospel principles, the seed of repentance, and the seed of the human touch so that our harvest is one of happiness and joy. My brothers and sisters, I bear testimony to you of the divinity of the Savior Jesus Christ. As we follow his example we will secure joy and harvest the happiness we all so desire. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert J.

<h1>her Flight Levels - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There are laws irrevocably decreed in the heavens above before the foundation of the earth, upon which all blessings are predicated. When we receive a blessing, it is because we are obeying those laws (see D&amp;amp;C 130:20). There are some laws which are apparently higher in a certain sense than others.<br><br>Let me start with a physical law--the law of gravity. If I drop something heavier than air, it falls to the earth. I fly small aircraft. I have been flying for some forty years. Aircraft are heavier than air. Some are heavier than cars, some heavier than locomotives, some very, very large and heavy. They fly because of a higher law--the law of aerodynamics--the law involving a certain amount of speed coupled with the shape of the lifting surface so they overcome gravity. In a sense, it is a higher law.<br><br>I fly two kinds of airplanes: those that can cruise anyplace between sea level and about the height of Mount Timpanogos, and those with turbo chargers or more powerful engines that can fly above the weather. It is no pleasant experience to struggle along in bad weather in the kind of aircraft that does not have the power to go up on top. You are there in the dark clouds, the turbulence, the lightning, the thunder, the rain, the hail. It is a beautiful experience, however, to have a very powerful aircraft that will climb quickly through the weather and clouds. As you break through on top, you enjoy that glorious, beautiful sunshine and the blue sky. When you look down, that which was dark and threatening is now just lovely and delightful white cloud tops.<br><h2><b>Seek Higher Levels of Life</b></h2><br>Applying that principle to life is my subject tonight: Seek the higher flight levels of life. There are many circumstances in our lives. Some of you may think that you are as high as you need to go. I am aware of a returned missionary who thinks that he has already achieved a superbly high spiritual level. He probably thinks the rest of his life will be an anticlimax and will descend. Not so! You should strive continually for a higher flight level.<br><br>There are those recently married; so enjoying the beautiful new love of their lives. Yet they can look forward to even higher levels of living. There are those who are successful in any field--the businessman, the graduate. There are those who are not enjoying so much success. There is the returned missionary whose girl got married while he was gone. There is the scholar who didn't get the scholarship. There is the beauty pageant contestant who didn't make it to the finals. There are those who feel they are too tall or too short, too thin or too fat. There are those who are not quite satisfied with all of these circumstances in their lives. There are the lonely, the lost, the disappointed, the hurt, the wounded. All may find a way to the higher levels of life so they can be above the storms of discouragement and dismay. All can climb to higher levels.<br><h2><b>God Gave Us Higher Commandments</b></h2><br>Let me illustrate some of the higher commandments of life as I feel they were explained by the Savior. The Savior, in the Sermon on the Mount, used the illustration of higher principles. Bear with me in some liberal translations of the scriptures.<br><br>I feel that in the Sermon on the Mount the Savior might have said, "Thou hast heard from the prophets of old, Thou shalt not kill. But allow me to give unto thee a higher law--the law of fellowship, the law of brotherhood. Be not even angry with thy brother" (cf. Matthew 5:21–22). Now that is a higher concept which, if we try to live it, will lift us above the storms, the turbulences, the trials, and the tribulations of life.<br><br>We all know of the additional interpretations of anger--that of being offended, that of criticizing others, that of being bitter. Any of these feelings are like poison to our spirit. The classical illustration is the case of a rattlesnake. If a rattlesnake comes and bites us, what should we do? Should we look for a stick to punish the rattlesnake or should we try to get the poison out?<br><br>Any of these negative feelings will tend to keep us in lower levels of life. We must lift ourselves, free ourselves from those things, and truly live the spirit of brotherhood and love and never be angry with anyone. Those of you who have been roommates or missionary companions have experienced the silent treatment or you have been the one who has given the silent treatment to the other. That is one aspect of what I am trying to speak about. Lift yourself to a higher level of relationships with others.<br><br>The Savior might have said, "Thou hast heard from the prophets of old, Thou shalt not commit adultery. Allow me to give you a higher law. Thou shalt not even look at a person of the opposite sex to lust after them lest thou hast committed adultery in thy heart" (cf. Matthew 5:27–28). He was looking ahead perhaps to this day and age where there is lustful looking, where there are improper magazines, where there are X- and R-rated movies. Pornography is what I am speaking of. Lift yourself to a higher level. It is possible to become addicted. Learn to control thoughts. Learn also that virtue and chastity can be lost piecemeal, a little bit at a time, by lack of thought control, by lack of proper understanding of this higher law of the Savior.<br><br>The Savior said, "Thou hast heard from the prophets of old, Thou shalt not forswear thyself. But I say unto you, Swear not at all. Let your language be, Yea, yea, and Nay, nay" (cf. Matthew 5:33–37).<br><br>Let me illustrate. President Heber J. Grant was told by his doctor that he needed to take up a sport which would put him out of doors and give him fresh air and exercise. The doctor even suggested the game of golf. President Grant took some lessons, felt he was in a condition to play a round of golf, and invited some friends to be with him.<br><br>On the first tee his friends insisted that he go first. He put the little white ball up on the little wooden tee and practiced a couple of swings, then stood up. He was really going to show them what he could do. With a mighty swing he missed the ball. He stepped back again and took a couple more practice swings. This time he was really going to hit it. The problem is that the harder you try to hit it, the more you tend to bend your elbows instead of leaving them out straight. If you bend your elbows, the club head comes toward you instead of toward the ball.<br><br>For the second time the club head missed the ball. This time President Grant was embarrassed and turned a little bit red. He stepped back for more practice swings. This time he was going to knock it a countrymile, but the wind from the club head just caused the ball to roll off the tee a little bit. He was frustrated. He turned to his friends and said, "I never swear, but there are moments, and where I spit, the grass will never grow again."<br><br>I think all of us can find an appropriate response to moments of frustration and live that higher kind of law. The Savior said, "Thou hast heard, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"--the law of retribution. The higher law is what we will live as Christians. He gave them the higher law of turning the other cheek. "If they ask for you coat, give them your cloak also. If they ask you to go one mile, go the second mile" (cf. Matthew 5:38–41). It is a beautiful indication of how we should react to any situation in which we are asked to do something.<br><br>And the Lord said, "Thou hast heard, Love thy friend but hate thine enemy. I say unto you, Love thine enemy, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you" (cf. Matthew 5:43–44).<br><h2><b>Find a Higher Interpretation</b></h2><br>I believe that in almost any of the commandments that we have, we can find a higher interpretation. Let me experiment with a couple. For example, the last of the Ten Commandments--Thou shalt not covet. I can imagine in my mind the Savior saying, "I'll give you, in this, the last dispensation, a higher law, so that you won't even think of coveting: the welfare plan. Be self-sufficient, live within your means, have a year's supply of food on hand." I see the welfare plan as being a higher law than the tenth commandment.<br><br>We can go back to "love thy father and thy mother." A higher interpretation can be, "Also love thy forefathers and do thy genealogy work." A higher interpretation of love thy father and thy mother can be, "And form an eternal family of thine own--eternal marriage in the temple." For almost any of the commandments we want to look at, we can find a higher interpretation.<br><h2><b>Go Beyond Obedience</b></h2><br>Take the principle of obedience. We've all heard the parable of the father with the two sons. He said to the first, "Go to the vineyard and work." The first son said, "No," but afterward repented and went. The father said the same to the second son and he said, "Yes," but forgot or chose not to go (cf. Matthew 21:28–30).<br><br>Now, let me use the parable of the father with the five sons. All of the sons were asked to go to the vineyard to work. The first son said, "No." Rebellious, ornery, he didn't go. The second son said, "No," but then afterwards repented and went. The third son said, "Yes, I'll go," but then became distracted or forgot and didn't go. The fourth son said, "Yes," and he went. A great son, a wonderful son. He did a good job. The fifth son, however, illustrates my point of seeking a higher interpretation of all the commandments. This one in particular, the law of obedience. Before the father got to the fifth son, the fifth son came to him and said, "Dad, I've gone to the vineyard. I've pruned, weeded, fertilized, watered, fixed the fence and gate. I brought the tractor back and put it in the garage. Dad, what else can I do?" The fifth son had the higher interpretation--higher than the law of obedience--of not needing to be commanded in all things. He had initiative and resourcefulness.<br><br>Here is another illustration of the principle of obedience. I had an instructor in the navy, a fine man. He had been a test pilot in the early days of the war. One of his responsibilities was to test a fighter plane that was important to the factory. If they didn't sell it, they would go bankrupt. It was important to the navy because they needed a quality aircraft to operate off aircraft carriers. In those days there were no electronic on-board instruments. He had to take off and fly the aircraft, the first prototype, and then come back and tell the owners of the factory and the admirals whether it passed the test. They watched him take off and watched him climb. He disappeared and after a long period of time he returned, landed, and climbed out of the aircraft.<br><br>All of the engineers, designers, owners, admirals, and navy brass were there, and he said, "As you saw, the aircraft jumped off the ground in less than the required distance." They all nodded. They have been observing that. He said, "Time to thirty thousand feet was so many minutes and so many seconds." Everybody ooed and awed at that. He said, "It climbs like a homesick angel." Tremendous! Everybody was pleased by how fast it arrived at altitude. He said, "Speed at full throttle, straight and level, exceeded the calculations of the engineers by 14 percent." Everyone was impressed and the engineers were calculating how much that must have been. He said, "Power dive, the wings didn't come off, nothing bent." Everybody was wringing their hands out of gratitude that it had passed the test when he said, "But it didn't pass the test. When I put it through the maneuvers in which a fighter plane has to be able to perform, when I tried to do the snap rolls, the Immelmanns, the loops, the evasive maneuvers, this aircraft would not respond to the controls. It is like a mule that gets the bit in its mouth and wants to go straight. Nothing I could do would make it turn fast enough. You have to go back and make larger, more sensitive control surfaces so that the aircraft will be obedient to the pilot."<br><br>I've seen missionaries in the mission field who are super intelligent, charismatic, have great talent and tremendous ability, but failed because they weren't responsive to the controls. They weren't quite obedient. They didn't understand that the rules are first to protect them from Satan and second to bless them with success. There are many interpretations, higher interpretations, of the law of obedience.<br><h2><b>Become Truly Unselfish</b></h2><br>And then there is the law of unselfishness. Let me use here an interpretation of the parable of the prodigal son. This is a famous parable. You all know it as the story of the errant son who has wasted away the inheritance he asked of his father, who probably had to sell some land or something. The son went off and wasted the money. Now he has come back tragically humbled. The father sees him from far off. The father loves him, hugs him, sends the servants off to dress him with rings, robes, and shoes, and so on. He declares a festival in his honor and kills the fatted calf. The older brother comes and sees the party going on and asks what has happened. When he hears, he is upset and goes to his father and says, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a [party] that I might make merry with my friends" (Luke 15:29).<br><br>The father's explanation is not a rebuke, just a simple explanation. "Son, thou are ever with me, and all that I have is thine. . . .[But] this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found" (Luke 15:31–32).<br><br>Imagine with me a higher interpretation of the story. I can now see the older son saying, "Father, forgive me. Wouldn't it be a good idea to divide my inheritance with my brother who has returned?" Can't you see the double joy coming back to that father, thinking, "This, my other son that was lost in selfishness, is found again." I can see him calling the servants and saying, "Get my finest clothes, and my finest rings, and my finest shoes, and put them on this my elder son. Kill another fatted calf and call all of his friends, let us have a great party together. We who were lost to each other are found again."<br><h2><b>Seek True Peace</b></h2><br>And there is a higher interpretation of the principle of peace. The Savior is the Prince of Peace. Great interpretations have been given to that title. One of the finest that I have ever heard in my life was by President Lee. President Joseph Fielding Smith had just died. President Lee was now the brand-new prophet. His first major meeting as the prophet was in Mexico at an area conference down there. His first press conference as prophet was there, and President Lee was asked a trap question.<br><br>Now there are all kinds of trap questions. A trap question is a question to which you can't say yes and you can't say no. The traditional trap question is, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" You can't say "Yes, I've stopped" or "No, I haven't stopped." Whatever you say, you're wrong.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith, back at the turn of the century, in Washington, D.C., was asked a trap question by reporters. That question was, "Are you a prophet of God?" If he said yes, they were going to say, "Well, prophesy something for us, tell us something important that's going to happen. Any earthquakes coming up?" Whatever he said, they were going to ridicule him. They had it all planned. If he said "No, I'm not a prophet," they would say, "Well, the Mormon prophet says he's not a prophet." They would ridicule him yes or no. His inspired answer, when they pulled that trap question on him, was, "I am so sustained by the members of the Church." They couldn't do anything with that, and he gained their understanding.<br><br>Now back to President Lee in Mexico City. Hostile, foreign, international, sophisticated reporters pulled a political question on him. "What is your position with regard to the Vietnam involvement--the Vietnam War?" Some of you may not remember that particular time in history. It was a hot political issue, the Hawks against the Doves--there was an element of patriotism. Our government and our leaders of the nation were involved and said, "We should be there." But there was a growing opposition to it. It has since been reconciled to the satisfaction of some, not to the satisfaction of others. But, at that point, if President Lee said, "I'm in favor of being there," they would headline it, "How strange, a religious leader in favor of war." If President Lee said, "I'm against it," they would say, "How strange, a religious leader who pretends to support his government--it is one of their articles of faith--is against his own government."<br><br>Either way it was a difficult question. President Lee's answer was classic. It was inspiration from the Lord. It was a higher interpretation. He said, "We, together with the entire Christian world, abhor wars." Then he said, "The Savior, however, said that in the world there would be tribulations. He said, 'In me ye might have peace'" (John 16:33). Then President Lee went on to say, "The Savior said, 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you''" (John 14:27). It's even more beautiful in Spanish: "La paz os dejo, mi paz os doy; no como el mundo la da, yo os la doy. No se turbe vuestro corazón, ni tenga miedo." It's more poetic in Spanish. (I just had to do that for the returned missionaries from Latin America.)<br><br>President Lee went on to say, "The Savior was not talking about the kind of peace that you can win with armies and navies and bombs and rockets. He was talking about the kind of peace a person can have in his own heart, no matter what kind of tribulations there may be in the world." He so won the understanding and sympathy of those worldly reporters that they gave good coverage to the conference, and excellent coverage to President Lee as a religious leader. They learned from him--they learned the higher interpretation.<br><h2><b>The Way Up Can Be the Way Down</b></h2><br>Here is another aspect of the higher law: the Lord's way is not always our way. The parable of the Pharisee and the publican illustrates it. Perhaps in one sense, the way up is really down. The Savior observed two men who entered the temple to pray. The Pharisee said, "Thank God I'm not as other men are. I fast twice a week and I tithe all I possess." Today he would have added, "and I observe the Word of Wisdom, and I do my home teaching. Look what a great man I am. I'm thankful I'm not as other men are." The publican, the tax collector--very much looked down upon in those days--prayed, "God, be merciful unto me a sinner." The Savior went on to say, "The publican, the second, is justified, rather than the Pharisee. For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted" (cf. Luke 18:10–14).<br><br>Allow me a personal interpretation. I think I see too many self-righteous, holier-than-thou, better-than-thou in our ranks. I see too many who tend to look down upon other religions and other religious leaders. Some feel that we have a particular corner on spirituality. I'm off on a particular soap box of my own. I think we need to give more Christian love to those around us of other religions--more respect, more attention.<br><br>Although born and raised in the Church, I went to a Catholic university at the age of seventeen--straight from BYU to Gonzaga University at Spokane, Washington. Every professor of mine was a Jesuit priest, wearing the long black, full-length cassock--every one a Ph.D., and every one a great Christian gentleman. I want it understood, I went there scared to death, the only Latter-day Saint boy on the entire campus. They knew that I was a Latter-day Saint. But they didn't ridicule my church, or me, and they gave me great strength and support. I came to see them as great spiritual leaders--making tremendous sacrifices in their own lives.<br><br>Out in South America I saw many Protestant missionaries living in the jungles, doing a magnificent work, sacrificing themselves, their families, their entire lives. They have no eighteen-month or even three-year missions--they are out there for a lifetime in the jungles. They are to be honored and respected for the work they do.<br><br>I also want to pay tribute to my Jewish friends. I do it by saying this: I had many Jewish clients in the years I was in international banking, and I never lost money on a loan to anyone of the Jewish faith. Perfect records--every single one of them paid and all of them were good friends. I enjoyed working with our brethren of the Jewish faith.<br><br>Let me add this particular story to show what I'm trying to illustrate. In World War II, in 1943, the SS Dorchester, a troop ship, was torpedoed with 900 souls on board in the North Atlantic in wintertime. Those who didn't have time to get into the lifeboats would not survive. It went down so fast that only two hundred and fifty or so survived. It was evident that not everyone was going to be able to get into the lifeboats. There were four chaplains on board: a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, and two Protestant ministers. The witnesses, the survivors, said the chaplains were seen helping others into the lifeboats and then they were seen linking their arms together, the four of them bowing their heads in prayer, as the ship went under, united in prayer. There's a chapel today in Philadelphia, built in honor of those four chaplains. The motto of the chapel is "Unity without uniformity." That's a lofty spiritual goal, I think, for all of us.<br><br>The way up is down. King Benjamin said it beautifully. He said, "If ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants" (Mosiah 2:21). I'm making a plea for additional humility. Have a lively sense of your own guilt, Mosiah said (see Mosiah 2:38). Now we don't need to have a lively guilt complex. If it's doing that to you, it's wrong. He goes on to say that a saint is meek and humble. Be aware of your own nothingness. "Remember . . . the greatness of God, and your own nothingness" (see Mosiah 4:5, 11). I think there is something uplifting here if we can get all of King Benjamin's sermon in perspective.<br><h2><b>Get Rid of Negative Feelings</b></h2><br>In order to climb up through the storms and the turbulence of life, one of the things necessary to do is lighten the load. Many of us have excess baggage consisting of guilt. In the process of repentance, confession is necessary. Get rid of jealousy. It is a poison to our spirit. Get rid of contention of any kind, usually caused by selfish pride--"I want it done my way." There is even a song about doing it my way. That doesn't get rid of contention. Get rid of rivalries, get rid of criticizing each other, especially companions and roommates. Get rid of negative thoughts; get rid of petty arguments.<br><br>Whenever we speak of rising above ourselves, rising to higher spiritual levels, there is a usual list of things to do. Let me go through these. The<i>scriptures</i>certainly lift us to higher levels.<i>Prayer</i>is definitely a necessity for rising appropriately. Not only traditional prayer, but frequent, heartfelt prayer with your eyes open while you are driving, or while you are walking and enjoying beautiful things. Talk to the Lord. Learn to pray with your eyes open. Then there is<i>service</i>to others,<i>attending church, being worthy</i>of a temple recommend, beautiful spiritual<i>music,</i>classical music, religious music, and so on. Another part of this list is establish<i>proper priorities.</i>"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>Another one is have the proper motivation. Allow me to spend a little bit of time on this. I see all too often out in the mission field an element of ambition. "I want to be the assistant to the president" or "I want to be the zone leader." I see it sometimes in those who say, "Gee, I'd like to be the first bishop in my family or the first stake president in my family." Misplaced ambition will never lift you to spiritual heights. The only ambition in the kingdom that does lift one up is to have "an eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5). In other words, if you're looking for the glory of the Lord, and you are working hard, then all things will be in place in appropriate ways.<br><h2><b>Understand the Covenants</b></h2><br>Also necessary for rising to a higher spiritual level are the covenants--the covenants and the ordinances in which we enter into a contract with our Heavenly Father. There is a series of contracts that we don't speak very much about. We can't give the details. There are those of the world who are trying to do so, but they miss the point completely. I speak of the temple covenants. Those lofty covenants constitute an ordinance two hours long. Compare that to normal ordinances. Baptism might be a thirty-second ordinance. Laying on of hands can be a two-minute ordinance. Ordinations, two minutes, three minutes, and so on. But in the scriptures there's a beautiful statement about the temple; to me it is talking about the temple ordinance. It is section 52, verses 14, 15, and 16. Allow me to give this interpretation of the temple covenants.<br><br>It says in verse 14: "I'll give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived, for Satan is abroad in Provo and he goeth forth deceiving the students." This is a liberal interpretation. But I have no doubt that Satan is for real, here and now. The verses go on to tell us how not to be deceived by Satan. Verse 15: "He that prayeth whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me" (and I say, "protected by the Lord against Satan") "<i>if</i>he obey mine ordinances." Verse 16: "He that speaketh whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God" (and, I'm adding, "protected by God against the maneuvers of Satan")<i>if</i>(it is conditional), "<i>if</i>he obey mine ordinances." To me those are the highest ordinances of this dispensation: the temple covenants.<br><br>I learned celestial navigation when I was in the navy, but true navigation, to me, is Dr. Hugh Nibley's kind of navigation. He says, "When I go to the temple, I can take my bearings on the universe." Understand the temple and what those ordinances can do to lift you up above the trials and tribulations and the storms of life.<br><h2><b>"Seek Superior Friendships"</b></h2><br>Then there is the higher law of self-control. We're here in this life to learn self-control. Control of all of our appetites and passions. To move higher, we need to associate with higher-minded friends. Now all of us enjoy friends who put up with us regardless of our weaknesses, but on the other hand, do you have friends who are keeping you from achieving your own goals? It's difficult to do, but we must ask ourselves the question and we must do what is necessary to seek loftier levels. What are they doing with their spare time? What is their language level? What kind of movies are they going to? What are their study habits? How do they spend their money? Ask yourself those questions about your friends. At this point I really ought to pay tribute to my great roommates. I had two fabulous roommates--Dr. Waldo Perkins and Dr. Hafen Perkins, both graduates from this great university. The challenge for me was to keep up with my roommates. We competed with each other for grades and church attendance and home teaching and everything else. I found that I couldn't keep up with my roommates unless I "memorized the textbook," unless I really stayed up-to-date in everything. It was stimulating, it was tremendous. President Kimball says, "Seek superior friendships."<br><h2><b>Look Ahead</b></h2><br>Then there is coping with tragedy. All of us have circumstances of life, the death of a loved one, illnesses, loss of jobs, failure in love, failure in ambitions and aspirations. All of these things happen to us. I have a list here of ways to prepare for those kinds of eventualities, because each of us should kind of look ahead, get ready for tragedy or unexpected reverses, by helping others who suffer. Learn from observing others, from observing their strengths and weaknesses. Learn to role-play and anticipate and imagine. Involvement in Christlike service to others builds a reserve--a sort of investment--so that we can face tragedy. Accept normal grief. It is evident that all of us at sometime are going to lose some of those who are near and dear to us. Consolation comes through the Holy Ghost. Any time we fight against what the Lord has seen fit to bring about, any time we struggle against it, we will not be able to receive the blessings of the Holy Ghost--the consolation, the comfort, the understanding. We need that understanding of drawing nearer to our Savior and to our Heavenly Father. The Savior is the Second Comforter.<br><br>The habit of happiness leads one to a higher spiritual level. Make a habit of happiness. Rise above an inferiority complex, learn to cope with failure. We're living right now in a society that praises winning so much that sometimes we haven't prepared those who aren't going to be the gold-, silver-, and bronze-medal winners. It was interesting to me to watch the Olympics the other night. The gold-medal winner was, of course, enthusiastic. The silver-medal winner, second in the entire world--tremendous!--was in tears, because she hadn't made first. But the bronze-medal winner was ecstatic, even more ecstatic than the first, because she hadn't expected to be there. Our reactions are all relative to our expectations, so learn the habit of coping with temporary failure. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "A man's success is made up of progressive failures which he rises above, because he experiences and ventures every day. And the more falls he gets, the faster he moves on." In Argentina the gauchos say, "You're never a good rider until you've been thrown a few times."<br><br>And then there is this statement: "Wisdom comes from good judgment, good judgment comes from experiences, experience comes from poor judgment." Think about that.<br><h2><b>Change to a Higher Level</b></h2><br>Sometimes, to get higher than you are, you need to get out of the rut you might be in. Do something adventurous, change, learn a new sport or a new hobby. Change your hairstyle. Some young men can improve their appearance and change their attitude by changing to a more mature hairstyle. Dress to a higher level. If you really want to get out of a rut, dress to a higher level than has been your habit. Change from Levi's into sports clothes, change from sports clothes into a suit. Change from whatever level you've been at, upgrade, and your girlfriends will really appreciate it. And young ladies, there is room for you to dress higher; and the young men will appreciate it.<br><br>Next are the higher laws of love. The telestial level is: "I have to do it," and you do it out of<i>fear</i>. The terrestrial level is: "I ought to do it," and you do it out of a sense of<i>duty</i>. The celestial level is: "I want to do it," and you do it because of<i>love</i>. President McKay said, "Man is a spiritual being, a soul. There is something within man which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical, to live in a higher and a more beautiful world."<br><br>I believe that wherever we are, and I promise each one of you, that wherever we are, we can find the way to live at a higher level which will take us above the storms and the turbulence and the problems of life. We can soar with the eagles. We are of divine origin. We are children of our Heavenly Father. I testify to you of the truthfulness of the gospel. Our Heavenly Father lives and he loves us and he hears our prayers and he answers them. Jesus the Christ lives, and he loves us. He is not dead on the cross; he is not in the tomb. He is not dead; he lives. Resurrected, glorified, and exalted, he stands physically at the head of this church which bears his name. His spokesman here on the earth is President Kimball, a living prophet. All of our prophets, all of our great prophet leaders, have been prophets and servants of the Lord. Everything we've been teaching from Joseph Smith to President Kimball, everything from the premortal existence to the Second Coming and to the Millennium and to the life to come, everything that has to do with exaltation and eternal life, is true. I testify of it as a witness, praying for the Lord's choicest blessings upon each and everyone of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert E.

<br>
We read from the book of John the account of the baptism of our Savior and the remarkable manifestations that followed this significant event. The scriptures record:<br><br><i>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</i><br><br><i>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</i><br><br><i>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</i><br><br><i>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?</i>[John 1:35–38]<br><br>What a wonderful sight to behold as I look into so many faces today. You seem happy and eager with the prospects ahead of you this week. As I looked at the program for this exciting week's schedule of activities, I saw the title on the front page, "What Seek Ye?" It brought to mind many questions. How soul-searching will you make this week? How deep will you be willing to probe? What will you seek this day? What will you seek here this week? Will you seek self-renewal and rejuvenation in your stay on the campus these next few days?<br><br>The thirteenth article of faith tells us, "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."<br><br>What seek ye intellectually, in talents, in skills? What seek ye in knowledge, in wisdom, in mental and emotional stability, in peace of mind? We must be here seeking something that will better our lives, that will improve our talents, our abilities, our knowledge, that will make life sweeter and more meaningful for us. Otherwise, we would not have made the effort to gather and spend time at this institution.<br><br>Within the Church there is a place for all truth--for everything that is praiseworthy, virtuous, lovely, or of good report. We are taught "to look with unwavering confidence for other revelation, truths yet to be added, glories grander than have yet been made known, eternities of powers, dominions, and progress, beyond the mind of man to conceive or the soul to contain" (James E. Talmage,<i>Articles of Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924], p. 430).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:8]<br><h2><b>Our Changing Society</b></h2><br>What an exciting world we live in today! We have opportunities now that even just a decade ago we would never have believed possible.<br><br>The other day I sat in my hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, and watched a young Mormon athlete, Peter Vidmar, win his gold medal for his performance on the pommel horse. I marveled and was fascinated and exhilarated by the world we live in today. Imagine sitting so far away on the other side of the world, enjoying events happening simultaneously at the Olympics being held in Los Angeles. It is stimulating, as well as overwhelming, to try to comprehend the changes just ahead of us in our society.<br><br>In his book,<i>Megatrends,</i>John Naisbitt says that we live in an information economy, an information society. In other words, we have shifted from an industrial society to one based on the creation and distribution of information. "No longer do we have the luxury of operating within an isolated, self-sufficient, national economic system; we now must acknowledge that we are a part of a global economy" (John Naisbitt,<i>Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives</i>[New York: Warner Books, 1982], p. 1).<br><br>And so it is regarding the Church. We are no longer just a Wasatch Front or Utah or an American church. We are a global church, reaching everywhere.<br><br>What a challenge it is to keep pace with an everchanging world. I have been fascinated with computers for years, ever since I became exposed to the punch card, the floppy disc, the microchip, the mainframe, the tape drives, the software and the hardware, and all that goes into their makeup.<br><h2><b>Our Central Processing Unit</b></h2><br>Computers are designed to imitate the functions of the human mind. All computers do similar things. They receive data input, they process it according to instructions in a central processing system, and they produce a result, an output. In our minds it is automatic. In many ways the human brain operates like a computer, but on a higher level, with judgment and self-awareness. Our human computers, our minds, receive input from our senses--sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. This data and the instructions as to what to do with it, are loaded in from sources such as schooling, other experiences, reasoning, and inspiration.<br><br>We store these data and instructions in our memory. They remain there until they are changed or erased. Our central processing unit examines the instructions and then brings the data back from our memory to be processed. The results will either be stored in our memory for future use, or the results will be used as output--speech, movement, insight, or solutions to problems.<br><br>Instructions which determine how our input data is processed are arranged in program patterns of thought or action, just as in electronic computers. When our human model is misprogrammed or misled, or receives false instructions, we produce bad output, usually to our harm. To correct the wrong program, we must clear out the register and lay out a new set of processing instruction which will produce a happier, more beneficial output. This is the process of repentance.<br><h2><b>We Need Righteous Input for Righteous Output</b></h2><br>When we have processed the same kind of data over and over again with the same kind of instructions, the actions involved become almost automatic. Righteousness or unrighteousness also become habitual through the things we see, hear, do, or think about continually. The old computer adage is certainly true that "garbage in produces garbage out."<br><br>In terms of the gospel, we each possess a powerful, spiritual central processing unit, which may or may not operate adequately if it is troubled by a storm or bad static from our human processors. We can receive input from righteous sources or from evil sources. Our programming can be according to the Spirit and commands of God, or it can be from Satan. Our output can be righteous lives and actions which produce happiness and joy, and from which come blessings, or it can be misery, unhappiness, and condemnation that come from wrongdoing and wrong thinking.<br><br>The electronic counterparts of our mental computers will process mistaken data just as easily as correct data. We cannot have right or truly useful output in ignorance. Studying the holy scriptures provides righteous input, as well as programming instructions for righteous processing. Personal prayer produces a continual correction of error and opens the way for inspiration input to us from heavenly sources.<br><br>The words of prophets provide us with instruction and data. The whisperings of the Spirit can confirm that we are operating correctly.<br><h2><b>We Must Program Carefully</b></h2><br>I remember vividly my first exposure to computer programming which taught me a great lesson. We were to computerize a swing at a golf ball and direct it toward a hole. We had to take into account all the factors to be certain our golf ball was programmed to reach the hole safely. We had to program the length of the stroke, the power of the swing, the type of ball we were using, the angle at which we struck the ball, the atmospheric conditions in which the ball would take flight, and the type of terrain on which it would land.<br><br>I remember how I struggled with this problem. The first time I tried out my program on the computer, there was a swing at the ball, the ball took off into space and never landed again! I had to turn the computer off to get the ball back into the atmosphere. It was headed in a direction entirely out of control and away from its objective. I had to go back and, piece by piece, reconstruct the steps until I found the error and could change the course of the ball toward the hole.<br><h2><b>It Applies to All Dispensations</b></h2><br>Lessons taught to us in the history contained in the Book of Mormon certainly illustrate this point. What we put into our system is exactly what comes out in our actions. History records in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi that there were no contentions or wars in Zarahemla, but the people still suffered.<br><br><i>The people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.</i><br><br><i>And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.</i><br><br><i>And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized.</i>[Alma 4:2–4]<br><br>They had corrected their input. But then, only a few verses later, we see what begins to happen to the people.<br><br><i>And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.</i><br><br><i>Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma . . . and [the] elders over the church. . . .</i><br><br><i>For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one toward another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.</i><br><br><i>And thus, . . . there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride.</i>[Alma 4:6–9]<br><br>What was their output as a result of their becoming so involved with the riches of the world? The people lifted themselves up in their pride, despising each other and turning their backs on the needy and the naked, and those who were hungry, and those who were thirsty, and those who were sick and afflicted.<br><h2><b>We Have an Advantage over Computers</b></h2><br>Yes, what we put in is exactly what will control our output. Fortunately, we, as human beings and children of God, have a distinct advantage over computers. We can reason with our brain. We can adapt, we can change if we so desire. We can change that which might have been programmed that is not good. But once we are programmed, it is not easy to change. How much better then that we live our lives in such a way that we are programmed only with what the Lord would have us do. How important it is that we carefully screen and watch what we input into out brain!<br><br>It is the diseased minds of this world that produce immoral plays and movies, disreputable literature, violence, crime, and corruption. How much of this can we absorb without having the same results come out in our actions?<br><br>What is the status of you spiritual data-processing system? Are you in control of the input, the instructions, and the output? Are you happy or unhappy? Are you moving toward higher goals or are you wandering through a wasteland of wrongdoing? Join the age of marvels and "power up" your spiritual processing system for righteous thinking, righteous doing, and happiness before the Lord.<br><h2><b>What Do You Seek?</b></h2><br>Today we are gathered at the beginning of another Education Week at BYU. So again we ask the question, "What seek ye here?" Do you come here to seek strength to be obedient, to follow the commandments? Do you seek earnestly for the best gifts, always remembering the reason they are given--that we may be of greater service? Do you seek to be of greater service in the kingdom of God?<br><br>[These gifts]<i>are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:9]<br><br>Do you seek the assurance that the course you are pursuing in life is approved of the Lord? You can enter into the "rest of the Lord" while still in mortality if you can gain the peace of mind and heart that comes from knowing your pursuits in life are in complete harmony with God's commandments, and you know without doubt that you have chosen the right way.<br><br>Do you seek help with the problems and decisions in your life?<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8]<br><br>Are you here seeking to become an instrument in the Lord's hands by seeking humility, meekness, and submissiveness?<br><br>Sister Pat Holland, newly called first counselor in the Young Women presidency, said,<br><br><i>It was a long time . . . before I came to a path in my life where I understood the need to fully submit to the Lord's will. I think I was probably a mother with two small children before that became really clear to me.</i><br><br><i>I just can't underscore enough that loyalty to the will of God is the only way to fulfillment and peace.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>15 July 1984, p. 4]<br><br>Are you seeking for happiness, contentment, peace of mind? Do you seek for physical well-being, good health, exercise? What seek ye in your home and in your family? What seek ye to accomplish in your family home evenings, in your family prayer? Do you seek for the good in others or look for the flaws that are so common in human beings?<br><br>Do you seek to be a good example? Do you seek for emotional stability by being understanding with others, patient, loving, and accepting responsibility for the direction your own life is taking? Do you seek to improve your relationship with God, and yet fail to improve your relationship with your neighbor?<br><br>What seek ye in the way of forgiveness among your family, your neighbors, your friends, your business associates? Can we forever reach out with a spirit of forgiveness to all?<br><br>Do ye "suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?" (Mormon 8:39). Or do you look for ways to serve them?<br><br>Do you come here seeking to make your leisure hours more productive? How mundane or ordinary our lives would be without cultural endeavors. Cultural arts are the spice of life. How we need to seek for the finer things of life to keep us on a higher plane--symphonic music rather than rock and roll, beautiful paintings rather than pornography, good literature rather than so-called adult magazines, exquisite needlework rather than idleness, educational programs on TV rather than sex and violence. What are we exposing our minds, our brains, to?<br><h2><b>What Influences Do You Choose?</b></h2><br>Eventually we will become not only what we think, but what we watch.<br><br><i>Unfortunately, too many people exist on a mental diet of television, motion pictures created to shock us, and publications designed to stimulate us. . . . Most of what we have available is "junk food" that leads to mental malnutrition and poor emotional and spiritual health. You can turn off the TV set, but you can't turn off television's influence.</i>[Denis E. Waitley, Seeds of Greatness:<i>The Ten Best-kept Secrets of Total Success</i>(Old Tappan, N.J.: Fleming H. Revell Co., 1983), pp. 45–46]<br><br>On the other hand potential learning opportunities afforded us by television programming is unparalleled. Think what we can do in teaching gospel principles worldwide with satellites now available to us? Which do you choose?<br><br>The most beautiful melody has yet to be composed. The sweetest poem has yet to be written. The most magnificent sculpture has yet to be made. The most breathtaking sunset has yet to occur. The finest painting has yet to be painted. The most magnificent building has yet to be built. The greatest book is still forming in someone's mind.<br><h2><b>Love One Another</b></h2><br>Are you here seeking great compassion and understanding for your fellowmen? Can we seek love and benevolence for our fellowmen? Benevolence embraces charity and love for others. The Savior placed it second only to the love of God.<br><br>On one occasion, certain Pharisees came to Christ, tempting him with questions on doctrine in the hope they could entangle him.<br><br>Their spokesman, a lawyer, said:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:36–40]<br><br>Do we seek for this love? We cannot have one without the other. Without love for one another, it would be impossible to please God. John the Beloved said:<br><br><i>Let us love one another: for love is of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</i><br><br><i>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</i>[1 John 4:7, 20–21]<br><h2><b>This Land of Promise</b></h2><br>Did you come here seeking a better insight into ways you can help preserve and help build this great land of America, this land blessed above all others, a land of promise? The Lord has declared to us:<br><br><i>Even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.</i>[1 Nephi 2:20]<br><br>Yes, a land especially prepared for the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a magnificent land, truly a land of promise! We know the Lord has poured out his blessings upon this land with one great provision:<br><br><i>And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them.</i>[Ether 2:9]<br><br>What seek ye to fulfill your part in preserving this choice land, in upholding law and order, in making your community a better place to live? Did you attend your mass meetings? Did you vote in the primary election today before coming to BYU?<br><br>Did you seek to study the issues, know the platforms, acquaint yourself personally with the candidates' beliefs and intentions? Are you seeking to be a participating member in this land of the free by making your contribution in your own special way in preserving the great blessings the Lord has given to us?<br><h2><b>Are You Seeking the Spirit of God?</b></h2><br>What seek ye in spirituality? Do ye seek spiritual well-being, spiritual insight and understanding? Do ye seek for greater faith? Do ye seek an eternal perspective toward life's purposes? Do ye honestly and wholeheartedly seek for a true knowledge of the Lord's ways?<br><br>What seek ye in understanding the powers and workings of the holy priesthood, to know its blessings and its magnitude? Do we constantly make an effort to communicate with our eternal Father in Heaven? Do we seek him in humble, pleading, and yet gratuitous prayer? Do we pray often enough? Do we seek to have a prayer in our heart always?<br><br>Do we seek to understand his many, many ways of communicating with us, not only through prayer and inspiration, but through the messages of his prophets who are here today? Do we listen? Do we grasp the message? Do we<i>hear</i>the word of God?<br><br>Do we seek the spirit of God through fasting and prayer, by studying and pondering the scriptures, by reading as well as listening to the teachings of our prophets?<br><br>Do you seek for a greater understanding of the scriptures? Do you seek from the scriptures the blessings which are yours to receive? Do you seek for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in every aspect of your life--for direction in all things? Are you willing to be led by the Holy Spirit? Do you seek to magnify the light of Christ, the light that all of his children are born with?<br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:46]<br><br>What are we doing with this light? What do we seek with it? Do we seek to stand before the judgment seat of Christ clean and pure, faithful and ready to face our Savior?<br><br>What seek ye on the Sabbath day? Will the promised blessings, temporal and spiritual, from the Lord be yours because you have sought always to keep the Sabbath day holy? Do you seek after a Christlike character, for personal integrity, for a good reputation, a reputation that will stand the test with Church members or nonmember friends?<br><h2><b>Are You Obeying the Commandments?</b></h2><br>Do you seek for an honest living, to be honest in all your dealings with you fellowmen? Are you seeking to pay all obligations? Do you seek to be in good standing with the Lord financially by paying a full tithe, a generous fast offering, a missionary contribution?<br><br>What seek ye in the way of a testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God? Do you seek to take upon yourself the name of Christ? Do you seek to make the Lord the center of your life? Do you seek to understand the Atonement, the great atoning sacrifice the Savior made for us and the blessings that are ours, attainable only because of it? Do ye seek to live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God? Do ye seek to embrace the new and everlasting covenant? Do ye seek for the blessings of the temple for yourself and your spouse, for your children, for your ancestors?<br><br>How important it is to seek to live worthy of the temple recommend you carry in your pocket. How important it is to use it. This is our obligation as recommend holders,<i>not just an option we have.</i><br><h2><b>Are You Seeking the Blessings of the Temple?</b></h2><br>Oh, what joy there is in temple attendance! While the Salt Lake Temple was undergoing remodeling, my wife decided one day to gather up some of the ladies in our condominium building and drive out to the Jordan River Temple to enjoy a session there. After completing the session, they came out of the temple to find the land being blessed with hard rain. As they drove out of the temple grounds, standing under the shelter waiting for the bus was a little, elderly lady. My wife stopped and asked her if she wanted a ride into the city. She immediately came forward. On the ride into the city they heard a most humble testimony of a sweet sister, who every day was taking the bus out to the Jordan River Temple, summer and winter, rain or shine, to accomplish her temple work. She was only eighty-four years of age. She possessed a spirit of enthusiasm for temple work which deeply affected the riders in the car that day.<br><br>I attended a touching and very heartwarming event recently on a trip to Tonga. We held a birthday celebration honoring the first anniversary of the dedication of that temple. I was so impressed with the people who gathered that morning as we sang a hymn and offered a prayer of thanksgiving to the Lord for having a temple in their land. I asked the temple president how the membership had responded to this new blessing in their midst. The statistics he furnished were shocking. Each temple recommend holder in Tonga had attended an average of twenty temple sessions during the first year of its operation.<br><br>As you know, Tonga is made up of a group of small islands. Some Saints had literally paddled over from their island to come and stay two and even three weeks, sleeping on straw mats on a cement floor and cooking over an open fire to provide their nourishment while they fulfilled their obligation in the temple.<br><br>What seek ye in the blessings of the temple? Do ye seek for the great teaching of truths we can learn from no other place? What seek ye in developing a deep, rich, spiritual understanding of your purpose here in mortality? It is not enough to just think about good works, or desire them, or wish for them. We cannot simply sit back and pray for help and expect the Lord to answer our prayers forthwith. Spiritual growth, intellectual growth, stimulating our minds and our brains, all takes time and effort. But, oh, it is so worthwhile. It is not so much<i>when</i>we start seeking, but<i>how</i>we seek and<i>what</i>we seek.<br><h2><b>You Are Never Too Young</b></h2><br>For example, Mickey Mantle, at age twenty, hit twenty-three home runs his first year in the major leagues. Golda Meir was seventy-one when she became prime minister of Israel. Mozart was just seven when his first composition was published. Ben Franklin was a newspaper columnist at the age of sixteen, and a framer of the United States Constitution at age eighty-one (<i>Reader's Digest</i>, June 1984, p. 99). Joseph Smith was a mere boy of fourteen when he began to seek after truth and found it.<br><br>You are never too young or too old to seek after the right things. I know most of us have a plan, well-defined, and have set some goals. Yes, we think about them, and often ponder them. We generally do seek after good things.<br><br>I was impressed with what Sharlene Wells, Miss Utah of 1984, said:<br><br><i>Setting high goals is essential if you want to develop your potential. I go for anything I think I can accomplish. . . . The Lord has given everyone certain talents, and we have to realize that only by developing our own unique abilities will we be able to become like our Heavenly Father.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>1 July 1984, p. 10]<br><br>She has a strong conviction, not only about the gospel, but about her self-development as well.<br><h2><b>We Must Each Seek Our Own Guidance</b></h2><br>"What we obtain too cheaply, we esteem too lightly," said Thomas Paine. Each of us must earn our own salvation and exaltation. We have this privilege through the Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ. No one else can do it for us. We must each seek for our own specific guidance. Seek for valiant testimonies of the truthfulness of the gospel. Seek for the good things in life. Let us not be so busy that the Spirit cannot enter into our minds and our hearts, and give us promptings and guidance, and the help we so earnestly want and need.<br><br>Let us not be so busy seeking after the things of the world that we forget to seek after the things that really count in eternal life. Let us listen to the still, small voice as we seek our Heavenly Father in our daily activities. Let us strive to live so honestly, so righteously, so devotedly and in tune with the Spirit that our earnest prayers will be heard. For "if there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>Now you have before you this glorious week! What effort will you be putting forth to store the right input into this great central processing unit the Lord has especially blessed you with?<br><br>Will what you experience here expand your vision, change your determination, open new opportunities, and develop within you a greater understanding of your personal worth?<br><br>I hope this week will "power up" your enthusiasm to seek after the good things, the eternal truths with which we have been so abundantly blessed. May our output from this experience reach out to dramatically affect the world in which we live for good.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the gospel of Jesus Christ is true! God lives! Jesus is the Christ! Of this I bear solemn witness to you! The Lord has shown us the way to live. He wants us to seek after truth, to seek after our own testimonies, to know of a surety that he lives, and that he will be willing to help and guide our lives along the path to exaltation. He wants us to seek after the very best and stretch ourselves to do that which is for our eternal good. The Lord has given us a great promise:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together in my name, . . . behold, there will I be in the midst of them--even so am I in the midst of you.</i><br><br><i>Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</i><br><br><i>. . . perform with soberness the work which I have commanded you.</i><br><br><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</i><br><br><i>. . . be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:32–37]<br><br>I know this to be true. Once again, what seek ye here this day? In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L. Tom Perry was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 August 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>uot;In the Thick of Life&#039;s Urgencies&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeff:</b>It is wonderful to see such a large group welcoming Sister Holland and me back from our victorious summer at the Olympics. Considering how well we did there, I have actually been very disappointed that there hasn't been more of a public response here in Provo--but I can see that you have saved all that for today. How sly of you!<br><br>Yes, Sister Holland was gold medal all the way in her specialty--jumping to conclusions.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>And Jeff set a U.S. record in the running fever. He went from 98.6 to 104.1 in seven minutes and thirteen enchiladas.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>We of course also brought home the four gold medals won by the university in the 4 x 400 Boy-George-Look-Alike relay. In that race, rather than pass the baton, the participants pass the buck. All in all it was a victorious summer. We are grateful for this rousing welcome home.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>And we welcome<i>you</i>home, as well. We have missed all of you and it is wonderful to have you back on campus.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>You know, this is a very special new year for us because our first child, our oldest son Matt, entered BYU this fall as a freshman.<br><br>[<i>Matt starts to move toward the stand from the audience.</i>]<br><br>That is a new and exciting prospect for us, a new kind of responsibility we. ... No, Matthew. No. We're in a devotional right now. I didn't mean for you to come up here. We are speaking to these students.<br><br>[<i>Matt keeps coming, goes to Pat and confers with her. She goes to President Holland and whispers. He hands Matt the car keys and he starts as if to return to his seat.</i>]<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Yes, we know it will be a wonderful experience to share with all of your parents the joys of having a student at BYU....<br><br>[<i>Matt turns around and walks back to the podium.</i>]<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Matthew, for pete's sake, we are trying to hold an assembly here. What on earth do you want?<br><br>[<i>Matt pulls Pat away and whispers something.</i>]<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>I'm sorry for this interruption. It is embarrassing. Forgive us for just a moment here.<br><br>[<i>Pat comes back. President Holland pulls out his wallet and hands Matt some money. Matt moves toward his seat.</i>]<br><br>I'm very sorry. As I was saying, I know Matt and all of you are serious about your opportunities here and will be applying yourselves....<br><br>[<i>Matt is now back with a 3 x 5 card. He hands it to Pat who reads it and hands it to President Holland. Matt then returns to his seat.</i>]<br><br>I can't believe this. Would the brunette on row seventy-eight in Political Science 110 leave her name and telephone number taped to the back of her chair tomorrow. MH on row eighty-three will make contact.<br><br>Row seventy-eight! Row eighty-three! We don't have large freshman classes. We don't have anything that goes past row six.<br><br>It will now be our pleasure to hear from Sister Holland.<br><h2><b>Patricia T. Holland</b></h2><br>Setting the humor of this little exchange aside, I want you to know that my feelings are deep today, not simply because my own oldest child sets out on a voyage of discovery here at BYU that will shape and affect his life forever, but also because with each passing year (this is our fifth with you) you all seem more and more like my children. I actually get butterflies in my stomach as school approaches, and when I see you swarming back on campus around Labor Day I feel like the mother who waits and watches and finally sees her children drive up for Thanksgiving or Christmas or Easter or the Fourth of July. The nice thing about BYU is that every day with you is a little like Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter and the Fourth of July all rolled into one--especially the Fourth of July part! But Jeff and I do want you to know that we do love you and we take our "family" relationship with you seriously.<br><br>I don't want to embarrass you any more than we have embarrassed Matt by conveying an<i>in loco parentis</i>attitude, but we do sense some obligation to think and act and worry about you in the absence of your own parents. So forgive a mother's doting today as I fuss over your meals, straighten your clothing, and ask if you've done your homework.<br><br>May I express that love to you with one short story and one word of encouragement for the new year.<br><br>Several years ago we were in a small group with President and Sister N. Eldon Tanner. They have always been so kind to us ever since Jeff served under his direction while President Tanner lived in England as president of the West European Mission. In this social setting they asked us how our children were doing and I said something foolish like, "They're just fine--they're not old enough yet to get into any difficulty."<br><br>President Tanner laughed and said, "That reminds me of what I used to say to my girls when they<i>were</i>old enough to get into difficulty. As their dates came for them and as they were about to leave the house, I would see them out the door and say, 'Goodnight kids. Have fun and be good.' They said that always perturbed them and that I should make up my mind one way or the other whether I wanted them to have fun or be good."<br><br>I want you to have fun and study hard and love the Y and be good. I<i>especially</i>want you to be good.<br><br>Have you ever stopped to think about how often we use the word "good" in the course of the day?<br><br>We say "good morning." We tell our family, friends, and acquaintances to "have a good day." We wish people we like good luck, and say of people we don't like, "good riddance." We have good times, good cheer, good food, good fun. We sing of the good ol' summertime, the good ship Lollipop, and (here's one for all you Beach Boy fans) "good, good, good vibrations." Our parents tell us of the "good old days"--you know, walking ten miles to school in a blizzard uphill both ways. We like good news. Someone we admire is a "good egg," and, of course, when our day ends--whether or not it was--we say "good night."<br><br>Well, BYU is a good place to be. Furthermore, I know you want to be good and that is half the battle already won. It is said that "by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we do not quite know what it is, and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil, widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower." May I just repeat that. I believe it is a profound and very encouraging thought. "By desiring what is perfectly good, even when we do not quite know what it is, and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil, widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower."<br><br>The Lord does allow darkness and struggle and pain. He often uses it to call us to him. Using my own children as examples, I've come to know that the one who is playing happily is so preoccupied with pleasant experiences that he sometimes may not respond when I call and may even run farther away. But the child who has been hurt, or is in pain, seeks me out, comes to me readily, knocks at my door (if you will), and is anxious for me to help and be healed.<br><br>Can you make the transition from this motherly concern I have for you to the perfect parental concern of heaven? Even if such a call from him seems as faint as the stroke of a dove's wing, respond to it and ask, "What would you have me do?" In personal, private communion with God, I promise you that the light in you will widen and darkness will grow narrower. That which may have been depressed will move, and you will be lifted above your troubles to embrace God's love.<br><br>I bear testimony of that love--and with it you will have a good year--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Jeffrey R. Holland</b></h2><br>Obviously, part of our purpose in this very first hour together is just to have fun--to sing the songs and hear the band and laugh a little together. But I find myself wishing selfishly that I had two or three hours with you to consider what a new year might mean for us. Once in my life--when I was about your age--I wished I had money. Now I'm older and wiser (and still about as poor) and I wish far more desperately for time. What you do with your time "in these next few months will matter infinitely more to you than any financial investment could mean to your bank account.<br><br>On that subject of your time may I do something here I have never done before-- make a strong, personal plea for your attendance at our forum and devotional series here in the Marriott Center every Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. This weekly alternating series is one of the richest traditions we have at Brigham Young University. I know of no university in the nation that offers twice a month, every month, as we do, the visit of truly distinguished men and women, leaders in art and science and government and letters, including some of our own finest faculty members.<br><br>As for our devotional assemblies, there is certainly no place, including Salt Lake City itself, where every other week of the academic year a General Authority of the Church prepares and delivers a major message of interest and inspiration. Given the growth of the Church, most members will now see a General Authority only once a year at one stake conference. Yet we are privileged at BYU to have them visit at least twice a month-- sometimes more--<i>every</i>month of the year.<br><br>But attendance at both events has been steadily and persistently declining for ten years. In the name of intellectual curiosity and spiritual renewal, I ask for your attendance here. If attendance continues to decline, the future of the series is in serious jeopardy. To cease holding them would be an immense loss to all of us now here, and an even greater loss to the students who will come after us. Please make this an important hour on your weekly educational calendar and be in attendance.<br><h2><b>Responsibilities at School</b></h2><br>Now, in this very first assembly of the year, it is traditional for the president to run down a laundry list of items regarding some of your responsibilities while at school. Included on that list has always been something about dress and grooming. I wish to make a historic departure today and<i>not</i>speak about dress and grooming (hold your applause). I do that because I think for the most part you look absolutely splendid this year. I compliment you for that and I ask you to continue to take pride in clean, modest dress and appropriate grooming.<br><br>I should note, however, that shorts seem to be popular this year and we are seeing too many of them on campus--any is too many. New Wave is still around, so be careful not to push that to excess. However, I do love the return of the crew cut. I went all through BYU with a crew cut and that was only fifty-seven years ago. BYU likes very cautious progress on these matters of fashion.<br><br>I congratulate you--you do look magnificent and we thank you for that. Your appearance says something about you and it says something about BYU. Thank you very much.<br><h2><b>Two Letters</b></h2><br>Far more important are the truly substantial issues of our Honor Code which deal with matters of character and integrity. I have here in my hand several examples of the twelve or fifteen letters I get every year on this subject. I wish to refer to just two of them this morning.<br><br>Inasmuch as this one is from a very recent student, you will realize that the first sentence caught my eye rather quickly. It says: "Here is the $700 I owe the scholarship program." The letter then notes that a scholarship for this student was an absolute must to be able to attend BYU but although the high school grade point average was relatively high, the first taking of the ACT exam did not bring a score good enough for a scholarship. Then, during the crucial second taking of the exam, a friend offered some answers--you know the rest of the story. "I didn't know how much this would come back to haunt me. I love the Y, but I came there the wrong way. I hope this money I am returning can allow some deserving student to come the right way." The other letter is from a woman who attended BYU in the 1930s--that is fifty years ago, give or take a year or two. What does that make her in age--seventy or seventy-five now? She writes: "This past year we have been trying to put our lives in order. ... I need to confess something to you. ... During the time I attended BYU I worked in [such and such a] department. The wage in those days was twenty-five cents an hour. I needed the money and on a few days I indicated on my time card that I worked more overtime than I had."<br><br>Now listen to this incredible next paragraph.<br><br>"In talking this over with my husband, we decided that I probably could have worked two hours a day during the week and maybe four on Saturday. I worked part of two summers also, but to be on the safe side I added hours for all the summer months. All in all we figured that it could have been possible, at the very most, to earn $357.00 in total wages for the entire time I was at BYU. The amount I cheated on could only have been a few dollars, but I am returning everything. Enclosed is a check for $357.00.<br><br>"This is a difficult letter to write. I am ashamed and a very humbled person. I ask you, on behalf of BYU, to accept this restitution and I pray for your forgiveness."<br><br>These happen to be some of the moral issues we can talk about here with you quite comfortably. Obviously, we can't discuss some of the far more personal and, I think it is fair to say, far more destructive abuses, sexual and otherwise, that can and do haunt some at this university. But these letters at least give us a very visible place to begin, a point on which surely no one can disagree. Honesty. Integrity. Character. Virtue. Those are marvelous words in the BYU vocabulary and I pray they always will be. I thank these people for caring enough to write these letters and put their lives in order.<br><br>I ask you to use their example and do your own best work. Earn your own success here. If you quote from someone else in a paper or presentation, give appropriate credit. Be courteous. Live within the rules. Be disciplined and devout. Work hard. Be kind. Live together in love. Try to understand what Robert Frost meant when he said freedom was moving easily in the harness (see<i>Contemporary Quotations,</i>comp. James B. Simpson [New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1964], p. 370).<br><h2><b>A University Education</b></h2><br>What does any of this have to do with an education? Well, everything.<br><br>José Ortega y Gasset, the man who for me is the most gifted and persuasive Spanish voice of the twentieth century, said of education, and specifically of university education,<br><br><i>In history--in life--possibilities do not become realities of their own accord; someone, with his hands and his brain, with his labor and his self-sacrifice, must make realities of them....</i><i>All we are given is possibilities--to make ourselves one thing or another....</i><br><br>[But]<i>slovenliness ... penetrates our whole national life from top to bottom....</i>[To oppose slovenliness]<i>the individual must ... go into training, and give up many things, in the determination to surpass himself....</i>[A]<i>generation</i>[who will do that]<i>can accomplish what centuries failed to achieve without</i>[it].<i>And there, my young friends, lies</i>[your]<i>challenge....</i><br><br>[Yours is]<i>the historic</i>[task]<i>of restoring to the university its cardinal function of "enlightenment."</i>...<i>In the thick of life's urgencies and its passions, the university must assert itself as a major "spiritual power,"</i>...<i>standing for serenity in the midst of frenzy, for seriousness and the grasp of intellect in the face of ... unashamed stupidity.</i><br><br><i>Then the university, once again, will come to be what it was in its grand hour: an uplifting principle in the history of the western world.</i>[José Ortega y Gasset,<i>Mission of the University,</i>trans. Howard Lee Nostrand (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1944), pp. 39–45 passim, 86, 99]<br><h2><b>Speaking of Zion</b></h2><br>Brigham Young University's "grand hour" is yet to come. But if we want it badly enough and will work for it, then BYU will, like Zion herself, rise up and put on her beautiful garments.<br><br>We don't speak much of Zion anymore, but those old-timers did and they kept on searching for it--from New York to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois to the Great Basin west. Whatever else Zion was, then or now, it was a place where good people with pure hearts could gather in common purpose to love God and their neighbor while pursuing eternal truths. A cross-cultural, rapidly growing, multinational church can't speak of Zion quite as easily today as it once did in Jackson County or Nauvoo the Beautiful, or even in the Salt Lake Valley. Of necessity we now speak of multiple Zions, of remaining pure in heart in the far reaches of the world where perhaps only the scriptural two or three are gathered in his name.<br><br>But a little glimpse of that older, original idea could and should remain here. Is it possible that this campus represents the one remaining "city," if you will, where 35,000 of the young and old, male and female, new convert and longtime member have<i>chosen</i>to "gather"--to voluntarily live together as a community founded on gospel principles in what could be a holy experiment very much like those of the ancients who sought to "bring forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish" (D&amp;amp;C 39:13)?<br><br>What the start of school does for me each year is declare that one shining symbol of that age-old quest is still alive and well on 600 acres of land nestled beneath Y Mountain in Provo, Utah. And once more we have a chance to hold some things in common, and indeed to hold them sacred, while we pursue truth and celebrate virtue in our own little united order.<br><h2><b>The Price That Others Have Paid for Us</b></h2><br>May I conclude with two stories about two very different aspects of what we share here.<br><br>The first experience is now 130 years old, the story of one mother's desire to raise her children in the company of the Saints, no matter what the cost.<br><br>Having left home and possessions in England in order to move west by handcart, a thirteen-year-old girl wrote of her mother's determination and their journey, including the almost immediate death and burial of the family's youngest, a two-year-old child. This thirteen-year-old was the grandmother of Sister Marjorie Hinckley, wife of President Gordon B. Hinckley.<br><br><i>We traveled from fifteen to twenty-five miles a day ... till we got to the Platte River....</i><i>We caught up with the handcart companies that day. We watched them cross the river. There were great lumps of ice floating down the river. It was bitter cold. The next morning there were fourteen dead. ... We went back to camp and had our prayers and ... sang "Come, Come Ye Saints, No Toil Nor Labor Fear." I wondered what made my mother cry that night.... The next morning my little sister was born. It was the twenty-third of September. We named her Edith. She lived six weeks and died.... She was buried at the last crossing of the Sweetwater.</i><br><br><i>When we arrived at Devil's Gate it was bitter cold. We left many of our things there....</i><i>My brother James ... was as well as he ever was when we went to bed that night. In the morning he was dead....</i><br><br><i>My feet were frozen; also my brother's and my sister's. It was nothing but snow. We could not drive the pegs in our tents. ... We did not know what would become of us. Then one night a man came to our camp and told us ... Brigham Young had sent men and teams to help us. ... We sang songs; some danced, and some cried....</i><br><br><i>My mother never got well. ... She died between the Little and Big Mountains....</i><i>She was forty-three years of age....</i><br><br><i>We arrived in Salt Lake City nine o'clock at night the eleventh of December, 1856</i>.<i>Three out of the four that were living were frozen. My mother was dead in the wagon....</i><br><br><i>The doctor amputated my toes ... while the sisters were dressing mother for her grave. ... That afternoon she was buried.</i><br><br><i>I have often thought of my mother's words before we left England. "Polly, I want to go to Zion while my children are small</i>so<i>that they can be raised in the Gospel of Jesus Christ."</i>[Mary Goble Pay, quoted by Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Faith of the Pioneers,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1984, p. 6]<br><h2><b>Making a Zion</b></h2><br>That is part of the price that others have paid for us. It is part of the reason we ask you to study diligently and live with Christian commitment. Too many children and too many mothers paid too high a price for Zion then to have us muff our far easier chance now.<br><br>This second experience is quite different and is only nine days old.<br><br>As a rule I suppose football would not seem to be part of any discussion for establishing Zion. Nevertheless, Coach Edwards told me last week that as the team was returning to Provo about 2:00 a.m., following the Pittsburgh game, he and his wife couldn't help overhearing two of his players talking in the seat just behind them in the bus. They were not talking about beating a traditional powerhouse like Pittsburgh. They were not talking about how the offense had sparkled or how the defense had dug in. They were not talking about a conference championship or an undefeated season, or about a national ranking.<br><br>They were talking about the one player's recent baptism into the Church, along with his wife who is also a student athlete here. He spoke of his eager anticipation of receiving the priesthood and of a future sealing in the temple. Indeed, there seemed to be only one disappointment in this whole conversation, and it wasn't about the ball game. It was that this young man had not known--and joined--the Church early enough to be able to serve a mission. At that, the other player, in reply, spoke of how much his mission had meant to him and how it had given real direction to his life. Much of this young man's life had been spent without a father in the home and I happen to know what it has meant to his mother to have him bear the priesthood and serve a mission.<br><br>Coach and Sister Edwards said they had a little trouble fighting down the lumps in their throats, thinking of these 260-pound behemoths sitting behind them--kids who eat steel girders for breakfast and concrete slabs for lunch--talking quietly after one of BYU's greatest football wins ever, of baptism and priesthood and mission and temples. I daresay those are<i>not</i>standard discussion topics with any other football teams in America.<br><br>Another young man in that bus played marvelously well against Pittsburgh and contributed very directly to that victory. He took quite a beating that afternoon and even a Helaman Halls bed must have looked awfully good to him by the time he hit the pillow at 2:30 or 3:00 that morning.<br><br>But his branch president told me that this weary warrior was up and at church bright and early the next morning. When President Uluave expressed some momentary surprise at his presence, this rock-solid young man with thighs the size of tree stumps said simply, "I am a priest. We have only three in the branch and I wasn't sure who would be here to bless the sacrament." "When we conclude to make a Zion," said Brigham Young, "we will make it, and this work commences in the heart of each person" (<i>JD</i>9:283). "I have Zion in my view constantly," he said. "We are not going to wait for angels, or for Enoch ... to come and build [it], but we are going to build it [ourselves]" (<i>JD</i>9:284).<br><br>The need for us to invest our time wisely and to lean with discipline and integrity toward that great goal is my dream for BYU. For such unique reasons as these just cited, education here is a moral issue and all of us need to be committed to the task. To paraphrase Dante: The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintained their neutrality.<br><br>Don't be neutral. Commit everything you have to your educational experience with all the Latter-day Saint significance that has for us here. Your opportunity for growth at BYU, if not a moral crisis, is at least a moral issue. Immerse yourself in the privilege which is yours so that "in the thick of life's urgencies and its passions, ... [we can grasp the intellect and] assert [ourselves] as a major 'spiritual power,' ... [as] an uplifting principle in the ... western world."<br><br>Welcome back to school. Work hard. Have fun. Be good. We love you. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>for Students - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My fellow students: I have spoken to BYU audiences on many occasions, but never on one like this. I am sorry that President Kimball is unable to speak to you today. He was with us in our meeting in the temple last Thursday. He expressed his love for each of us, as he always does. I know he would want me to express his love for each of you and his regret that he is not strong enough to address us at the beginning of this school year.<br><br>I am sorry that President Hinckley was unable to speak to you today. We all marvel at the way the Lord magnifies him to carry his great load. I am glad that by being here as his substitute I can do something to lighten that load.<br><br>I learned of this assignment only a week ago. I would normally prepare many weeks for such a major occasion as this. But short notice seems to be the emerging pattern of my life. I learned of my release as president of BYU about twenty-one hours before it was announced publicly. I learned of my calling to the Council of the Twelve about thirteen hours before it was announced. By comparison with those experiences, a week's notice of an invitation to talk to a friendly audience seems generous.<br><br>June and I are always thrilled to return to this campus. This is familiar ground, and we love it. Our nine years at BYU were happy years for us and for our family. We love this place and its wonderful people, new and old.<br><br>I may even presume that we are known to some of you. Our service at BYU makes us known to most of the faculty and staff. I may even be known to some of you students. While running some errands on campus last winter, I noticed a student looking at me quite intently. It took only about half a minute before he recognized me. I know he recognized me because he unfurrowed his brow and called out, "Now I know you. You're the guy on the old TV reruns of devotionals!"<br><br>This is the largest audience I have addressed in the five months since my calling to the Council of the Twelve. In that period many have wanted to know my feelings about this calling. With the encouragement of President Holland, I will begin by answering that question. My feelings were surprise, fright, gratitude, and resolution, in that order.<br><br>This calling was a stunning surprise to me. I was completely occupied and entirely happy in the professional work of a justice of the Utah Supreme Court. While I had a premonition that there would be one more large change in my professional life--that the Utah Supreme Court was not the last position in my working life--I had no inkling of my final destination or when I would reach it. I was also happy in my Church calling as gospel doctrine teacher in the Oak Hills First Ward, a position I had held for about eight months, following two years as the teacher of the sixteen-year-olds.<br><br>I was in Tucson, Arizona, on professional business when President Hinckley reached me by phone and notified me of my calling. Though surprised, I, of course, accepted immediately. Three other feelings followed in quick succession. All three remain with me to one degree or another.<br><br>My second reaction was fear, motivated by feelings of unworthiness and inadequacy. Prior experience at BYU and as a Regional Representative made me aware of many of the responsibilities of members of the Twelve, and I shrank from thinking of myself in those terms. That feeling persists.<br><br>As I prayed and pondered the significance of this calling, I was also filled with gratitude that our Heavenly Father would call me to this position, where I can use my experience and spend all my time and talents for the rest of my life in, his service. I have had an unusual combination of professional and Church experiences. For many years I have felt a strong sense of stewardship in respect to those experiences. I have been convinced that I was being prepared for further service. Many times I prayed that when the time came, I would be able to recognize the work for which I had been prepared, and be able to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in performing it. Now, with this calling, my prayers have been answered, my course has been set for the rest of my life, and I am grateful.<br><br>Finally, I am resolved to serve God the Eternal Father and his son, Jesus Christ, whose special witness I am, with all my heart, might, mind, and strength.<br><br>I have much to learn and millions of miles to travel, but my surprise is over, my fear recedes, my gratitude increases, and my resolution is strong. That is how I feel about my calling.<br><h2><b>I Bid You Welcome</b></h2><br>The tradition of this university calls for the first devotional assembly of each school year to consist of a message of welcome and instruction from a leader of the Church. Consistent with that tradition, I bid you welcome. To the majority of you who are LDS, I give a reminder that you are supported by the tithes, love, loyalty, and prayers of over five million of your brothers and sisters, many of whom have desired to be in this place but have been unable to achieve that aspiration. To keep faith with those who pray for you and support you, look on your opportunities at BYU as a sacred stewardship. Conduct your studies and your personal lives accordingly.<br><br>To the hundreds of you who are not LDS, I extend a special welcome. We look on you as friends, as brothers and sisters. We anticipate that your presence here will enrich our education as well as yours. We invite you to take part in the active religious life of our campus wards and stakes. Or, if you choose, affiliate with a church or synagogue of your choice in this area. But by all means, have an active religious life while you are here, so that your college years will be times of spiritual as well as intellectual growth.<br><h2><b>"This Quest of Truth"</b></h2><br>It is appropriate to remind all BYU students of the importance The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints attaches to education. It is important to say this, but it should be unnecessary. As you look at the facilities on this campus, as you consider the stature of the Latter-day Saints who have devoted their careers to scholarship and teaching at this university, and as you contemplate the tens of millions of dollars the Church appropriates to BYU each year, you know the importance we attach to education.<br><br>The acquisition of knowledge is a sacred activity, pleasing to our Father in Heaven and favored by him and his servants. Speaking on this campus about forty years ago, President J. Reuben Clark declared:<br><br><i>God made clear that the gaining of knowledge is not to be like the commonplace work of earning a livelihood. He who invades the domain of knowledge must approach it as Moses came to the burning bush; he stands on holy ground; he would acquire things sacred; he seeks to make his own the attributes of Deity, the truth which Christ declared he was (John 14:6)</i>,<i>and which shall make us free (John 8:32)</i>. . . .<i>We must come to this quest of truth--in all regions of human knowledge whatsoever, not only in reverence, but with a spirit of worship.</i>[Remarks given at the inauguration of BYU President Howard S. McDonald, 14 November 1945 (Inauguration Speeches, BYU Archives)]<br><br>That is why we choose to pursue learning in a special setting, with explicit standards of conduct and appearance for students and teachers alike. Those standards, the BYU Code of Honor and the dress and grooming standards, are an essential part of the educational mission of BYU. All students and all BYU personnel are explicitly committed to observe them.<br><h2><b>Strive for Personal Worthiness</b></h2><br>In the remainder of this message I will offer some suggestions to help students in the coming year, and, indeed, for all the years ahead. My text is the word of the Lord given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832 in connection with the commandment to build the Kirtland Temple and to initiate the Church's earliest effort in formal education, the School of the Prophets. This is section 88, verse 124, of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to</i><br><br><i>find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i><br><br>Consider these ideas in order:<br><br><b>1. Cease to be idle.</b>Here is a familiar and basic command. Your parents probably sent you off with the same advice: "Work hard." I read in the<i>Daily Universe</i>that President Holland gave you the same advice last week.<br><br>I know of no better words of advice on the subject of ceasing to be idle than to "work first and play after." The discipline of forcing oneself to work first, until the job is completed--whether it be a daily assignment, a term paper, or other needed task--and only then to enjoy the pleasure of play, is a master secret of life. It bears immediate fruits in accomplishment, but its most important effects are long-range. In following this priority we learn self-discipline, which unlocks the door to undreamed-of accomplishments.<br><br>How do you spend your time? Are you the master of your time, or do others control it by flicking the switch on a television or by impromptu invitations to pleasures or diversions that you have no willpower to resist? Work first and play after.<br><br><b>2. Cease to be unclean.</b>One of the most distinctive characteristics of Brigham Young University is our proud affirmation that character and morality are more important than learning. As I have already noted, we consider personal worthiness an essential ingredient of our educational enterprise. That educational philosophy was revealed by God, and we will follow it faithfully and without apology.<br><br>Our concern with personal worthiness stems from our knowledge that we learn best when we are in harmony with the commandments of him who is the source of all truth. By this means we can have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the great teacher whose mission is to testify of Christ, to guide us into all truth, and to bring all things to our remembrance (John 14:26, 15:26, 16:13). But to receive and retain that assistance, we must keep the commandments of God. And we must be clean.<br><br>In his various messages to BYU students, President Kimball has always stressed personal worthiness, and he has usually warned against sexual impurity, the abuse of the sacred procreative powers which God has given and which he has commanded be reserved for marriage relations between man and woman. "Be ye clean," the Lord has commanded. As you enter a new year of opportunities, we cannot ignore the fact that it is also a new year of temptations. Again, I say, as the prophets have said, be ye clean! The Holy Spirit will not dwell in us if we are not.<br><br>Sin drives out the Spirit of the Lord. When the Spirit departs, the lamp of learning flickers, and the special illumination available from the Holy Ghost is gone. This is one of those eternal principles that you can verify by immediate personal experience. Recall a time when you were resentful or quarrelsome or angry or filled with hate. Could you study effectively? Could you think clearly? Did you receive any enlightenment during that period?<br><br>Anger and sin darken the mind. They produce a condition in men and women that is the opposite of the light and truth that characterize the word intelligence, which is the glory of God. Repentance, which can cleanse us from sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, is therefore an essential step along the path of learning for all who seek light and truth through the teaching power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord gives this great promise, which clearly ties the enlightenment of the mind to personal worthiness: And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bod[y] shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>This is the ideal toward which we strive, but none of us measures up completely. None of us is perfect. Though our desires are good, we are all capable of foolish omissions and self-destructive acts. We all have need of repentance. At some time in our lives, each of us needs help in getting over what someone has called "Fool's Hill." The steep forward slope of Fool's Hill represents the foolishness and self-centeredness of boys and girls, but its summit and farther side, once attained, afford the wider unselfish perspective of men and women. I hope you are, or soon will be, over Fool's Hill, with the maturity to glimpse the wider vistas beyond.<br><br><b>3. Cease to find fault one with another.</b>What does this commandment have to do with learning? Doesn't the process of learning involve the kind of faultfinding involved in questioning old ideas and old ways? Don't we seek illumination in the crucible of colliding ideas?<br><br>But the Lord has said, "Live together in love" (D&amp;amp;C 42:45), and "Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). The Savior taught the people of the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</i>[3 Nephi 11:29–30]<br><br>We should shun the spirit of contention, and do away with our tendency to be scornful of others or the efforts of others. As it says in Proverbs, if we eliminate scorn, "contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease" (Proverbs 22:10).<br><br>We can have disagreements on facts or theories or policies or administration without finding fault with those who hold another view. We can differ with dignity and without rancor or faultfinding. If we differ in this manner, we can retain the Spirit as our teacher. This is a valuable lesson. Learn and practice it, and you will be blessed. "Blessed are the meek," the Savior taught, "for they shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5).<br><br><b>4. Cease to sleep longer than is needful.</b>Oh, there's a sermon for the first class after lunch, for evening school, for early morning, or for any other time or season! Let us repeat what follows that injunction in the Doctrine and Covenants, for it is never more essential than for young people of your age and your activity:<br><br>. . .<i>cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies, and your minds may be invigorated.</i><br><br>I stress again the promise with which this verse ends, which I believe relates to all four of its subjects--idleness, uncleanliness, faultfinding, and sleep habits:<i>"that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated."</i>If you desire that blessing, look well to the four commandments on which it is predicated.<br><br>As I conclude this thought, I repeat again the Lord's commandment to his servants who were establishing the School of the Prophets. It is applicable to all students at all times and in all places:<br><br><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:124]<br><h2><b>Be Hungry to Learn</b></h2><br>And now, two additional thoughts in closing. Both concern priorities and attitudes in learning.<br><br>In order to be successful in pursuing an education at BYU, you should be hungry to learn. In order to obtain a good education, one that will increase your joy and enlarge your capacity to serve your family, your community, and your profession, seek learning for the sake of learning. Do not limit yourself to a grudging compliance with minimum requirements of attendance, assignments, and degrees. Pursue learning for the purpose implied in the<br><br>motto of this university--"The Glory of God Is Intelligence."<br><br>A learned person is an enemy to ignorance, and there is so much ignorance in the world. People by and large lack literacy in the vital subjects of general education: in clarity of thought and expression, in economics, history, and government; in nutrition, health, ethics, and education; in law and medicine; in knowledge of God and his commandments. We are too easily victimized by quacks and demagogues, by preachers of false doctrine, by rainmakers, panacea-peddlers, and political and other practitioners of the cults of something-for-nothing and get-rich-quick. A learned Latter-day Saint should seek and be able to evaluate answers to the important religious, physical, social, and political problems of the day. He or she should be prepared to defend the truth, to withstand social pressures, and to make a positive contribution to society.<br><br>President Kimball expressed our high aspirations for the students and graduates of BYU in a prayer he offered in this place almost a decade ago. He was dedicating the lovely carillon bell tower, whose music accompanied our steps to this assembly. That tower was a gift from the alumni to the university on its hundredth anniversary. President Kimball's words of dedication are at one time a compliment and a challenge to all who attend this university:<br><br><i>We thank thee for this institution and what it has meant in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and their posterity, for the truths they have learned here, for the characters that have been built, for the families which have been strengthened here.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Just as these bells will lift the hearts of the hearers when they hear the hymns and anthems played to thy glory, let the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, Dedication of the BYU Carillon Tower,<i>Second Century Address</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), p. 12]<br><h2><b>Drink of the Living Water</b></h2><br>I conclude with the most important thought of all. It concerns priorities in learning and doing.<br><br>During his journey across Samaria, Jesus rested at Jacob's well. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and he asked her for a drink. When she marveled that a Jew would speak to a Samaritan, he told her that if she knew who he was, she would ask him for living water. Seeing that he had no implement to draw water from the deep well, she asked Jesus how he could obtain any water to give her.<br><br>Before we remind ourselves of his answer, we should note how this incident is similar to our present circumstance. The Savior is in our midst, sometimes personally, frequently through his servants, and always by his Spirit. His power is such that he could obtain anything on this earth. He need not ask for water at the well or for tithes and offerings at the Church, or for work at the welfare farm. He asks us for these temporal things, just as he sought a drink from the woman at Jacob's well, so he can bless us with something of far greater importance to us than what we give.<br><br>In answer to the Samaritan woman's question of how he could give her living water without any way to draw it from the well, Jesus answered:<br><br><i>Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</i><br><br><i>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i>[John 4:13–14]<br><br>As you begin a new school year, it is appropriate to think of your education as an implement that can draw water from the well. We need such an implement; we encourage great personal sacrifice and the Church expends large resources to aid students in acquiring it. You can use the implement of education to satisfy earthly desires for yourself and those who are or will be dependent upon you. On occasion, your education can also be used to provide earthly support for the Savior and his work and his servants.<br><br>But while we are spending great efforts to acquire knowledge of earthly things--of things<br><br>in the earth and under the earth, and so forth (D&amp;amp;C 88:79)--we must never forget what the Savior told the Samaritan woman: "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall never thirst again." Only from Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior of this world, can we obtain the living water whose partaker shall never thirst again, in whom it will be "a well of water springing up into everlasting life."<br><br>Jesus taught us how to obtain that living water. The teaching he gave the Samaritan woman reminds us, even as we are involved in acquiring implements to draw water from wells of earthly skills and knowledge, that what we obtain from Jacob's well gives only temporary relief. The water of Jacob's well--however significant in satisfying temporary earthly desires--is insignificant in value beside what we can obtain from Jesus' words and from his atoning sacrifice. This is the most important message I urge you to remember on this day, during this year, and throughout your life.<br><br>God lives. Jesus Christ is his Only Begotten Son. He has restored the gospel in this latter day. Joseph Smith saw God the Father and his son Jesus Christ, and the Prophet's successors have presided over this Church to the present day when we are guided by a living prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. I bear you that testimony and ask the blessings of the Lord to be upon you in this school year and throughout your lives, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H.

<h1>th the End in Mind - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Our being here reminds us of those days when we were where you are now in your schooling. We had three important goals. One was to<i>get married.</i>Then, once married, our next goal was to<i>get by</i>financially. Then our goal was to<i>get through.</i>We got married when Sister Nelson was an undergraduate student and I was in my second year of medical school.<br><br>Because I was under legal age, parental consent was required. My father was very amused when I called him away from his work to sign for me so I could get a marriage certificate. With Sister Nelson's (and parental) help, we were able to make it through medical school after we each received our baccalaureate degree. I then informed her that it was customary to have a year internship. Following that I was determined to specialize, and I let her know that it would require additional training.<br><br>I'll confess to a bit of naivete. If we had known that the interval between my getting my doctor's degree and our finally going into practice would be twelve and a half years with six children added, we might not have been quite as enthusiastic in the beginning. So I pay great tribute to her for her role in our partnership. I owe so much to her.<br><br>Now I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to direct our discussion tonight.<br><br>I have entitled my remarks "Begin with the End in Mind." I suppose some of this comes from my surgical background. An elective incision is never made without planning to close it. The same principle is generally applicable in all fields, however. Track stars don't begin a race without knowing the location of the finish line.<br><br>So, in your important race, I would plead for you to begin with the end in mind. To assist you in defining that end, I would ask you this simple question: What would you like said about you at your funeral? Or, if you were to write your own eulogy and you could have only three sentences (no big flowery speeches, please), what would you want to say?<br><br>If it's fair for me to ask that of you, it's fair for you to ask that of me. If I were to write what I hope might be said about me, those three sentences would include:<br><br>I was able to render service of worth to my fellowmen.<br><br>I had a fine family.<br><br>I evidenced unshakable faith in God and lived accordingly.<br><br>Some of you have already defined your goals. Some have even developed a system of priorities to give order to your interests and responsibilities. I applaud such discipline and think it's useful, but I believe that this ordering process may often be a little artificial. Rarely do we fragment the life that we live. It is not possible to influence one facet of our life without that affecting other aspects as well. So, in my own experience, I have preferred not to compartmentalize my interests, but to synergize them. Let me explain what I mean.<br><br>Nephi said, "I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23). He was advising us to weave the fiber of scriptural wisdom into the fabric of our own being.<br><br>King Benjamin taught this interrelationship:<br><br><i>When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>As I ponder serving God, I recognize that I cannot serve him without first serving the children that he has sent to bless our family. Then, as I ponder service to our children, I know I cannot serve them to the fullest without first serving and honoring my wife, the mother of those children.<br><br>She is my highest priority. When we were married, we vowed that we would "seek<i>first</i>the kingdom of God and his righteousness" (see Matthew 6:33). Do you see how<i>these goals and priorities all are indelibly intertwined?</i>To say that your highest priority will be to your occupation or to your family or to the Lord is really much more difficult than it is to merge strengths and pursue those interests concurrently.<br><br>One of the most remarkable things about these three objectives is that they all have one requirement in common. That requirement is education. The educational process is crucial for success in each objective and is neverending.<br><h2><b>Service to Mankind</b></h2><br>First, with regard to service of worth to mankind, I was introduced to you as a heart surgeon. But that really doesn't tell the whole story. When I started medical school, we were taught that one must not touch the heart, for if one did, it would stop beating. But I also pondered the scripture that tells us that "all kingdoms have a law given. . . . And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (D&amp;amp;C 88:36, 38). I believed sincerely the scripture that certifies:<br><br><i>When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]<br><br>Knowing these scriptures while concentrating on the "kingdom" of and the blessing of the beating heart, I knew that even the function of this vital organ was predicated upon law.<br><br>I reasoned that if those laws could be understood and controlled, perhaps they could be utilized for the blessing of the sick. To me this meant that if we would work, study, and ask the proper questions in our scientific experiments, we could learn the laws that govern the heartbeat.<br><br>In 1949 our group of researchers presented at the American College of Surgeons the report of the first successful use of the artificial heart-lung machine in sustaining the life of an animal for a thirty-minute period of time, without its own heart powering its circulation.<br><br>In the decade of the 1950s<i>,</i>successes in the animal laboratory were extended to human beings. Now, with many of those laws learned, the heartbeat can be turned off while performing delicate repairs on the damaged valves or vessels, and then turned on again--provided the laws are obeyed upon which that blessing is predicated. Over 200,000 open-heart operations are performed in this country annually, and many more worldwide, thereby extending life for many. But you should know that it was through the understanding of the scriptures and "likening" them to this area of interest, that the great field of heart surgery as we know it today was facilitated for me.<br><h2><b>Family</b></h2><br>Turning now from service of worth to my fellowmen, the second sentence that I hope may be said of me at my funeral would be that I had a fine family. That's really a subject near and dear to my heart, and I won't try to treat it broadly except to say that Sister Nelson has brought into our family ten beautiful children. We have tried to treat them consonantly with important scriptures: "Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12). The importance of honoring parents extends beyond your own father and mother. This scripture implies that we honor the father and the mother of children that might yet be born to us. We considered this implication while dating and in the early years of our marriage. But I fully understood that concept only later as I watched Sister Nelson cradle those children in her arms as they arrived one by one. Each time she reassured herself and her newborn baby that no blessing was ever withheld from that child because of any act of impurity in her life that could have deprived that infant of its full potential in any way. To honor father and mother means to honor fatherhood and motherhood and the divine provision for procreation and all that pertains to it.<br><br>Part of honoring parenthood is honoring children. There is a great temptation to believe erroneously that our children are our possessions. They are not. They are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. Their spirits are eternal as are ours. This was brought forcibly to my attention many years ago when our youngest was about four years of age. I came home from work one night to find my sweetheart very weary from a full day with nine children underfoot. My day had been heavy also, but I offered to get the children ready for bed. I began to give the orders to our little four-year-old daughter: take your clothes off, hang them up, brush your teeth, get your pajamas on, say your prayers, etc.--commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army. She then cocked her little head to one side, looked at me with her wistful eyes, and said, "Daddy, do you own me?"<br><br>Then I realized that I was using coercive methods on this sweet spirit and that to rule children by command or force is the technique of Satan, not of the Savior. She taught me this important lesson: We don't own our children; we have them for a brief season. As parents, it is our privilege to love them, to lead them, and then to let them go.<br><br>The Lord said, "I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:40). This we have tried to do.<br><br>Another aspect of our parental responsibility has been to be faithful to the duty we were called to perform in the Church. Is this a paradox in priorities? No, it isn't. A scripture states: "Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this<i>because of</i>thy family" (D&amp;amp;C 23:3; emphasis added). We have recognized that among the fine things we can do for our children is to be faithful to any call we have received in the Church. Experience gained in the Church strengthens our capacity to serve the public and our family.<br><h2><b>Faith in God</b></h2><br>The third sentence that I hope I may merit at my funeral service is that my faith in God was unshakable. I do have a deep and abiding faith in him and his son, Jesus Christ. Educa-tion has increased that faith. As I have spent forty years of my life in the study of one of God's greatest creations, the human body, I know that this marvelous instrument is of divine origin. The anatomy, the physiology, the protective mechanisms, the healing powers--all are so well constructed and function so beautifully. It is as evident to me that they are the products of a divine creator as it must be for an astronomer to reach the same conclusion as he studies the endless phenomenon of the stars in the heavens.<br><br>Furthering education need not challenge, but should increase your faith. In fact, we have a religious responsibility to educate our minds. "The glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). We have a divine command to "obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man" (D&amp;amp;C 93:53). Similarly, the Lord exhorted us to "study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15).<br><br>The scriptures further admonish, "Learn wisdom in thy youth" (Alma 37:35, see also Proverbs 29:3). "Teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:77–78).<br><h2><b>Steps in Learning</b></h2><br>We all understand the<i>importance</i>of education. Perhaps now we should consider<i>how</i>to learn. May I suggest four steps to facilitate the learning process.<br><h3><b><i>Desire</i></b></h3><br>The first is to have a great<i>desire</i>to know the truth. As a teacher of surgery for many years, I have observed the differences in desires of individuals to learn. Before every operation there is an interval for scrubbing hands for a measured period of time. Some trainees have either been silent or have passed this time with trivial conversations that had no substance. Those with desire filled that time with questions. I observed that students with great desire know what they don't know and seek to fill those voids.<br><h3><b><i>Inquire</i></b></h3><br>The second step would be to study with an<i>inquiring</i>mind. Again I take this pattern from the scriptures. You remember that when the brother of Jared was preparing for a transoceanic migration, he realized there was no provision for light in the ships. So he asked the Lord, "Shall we cross this great water in darkness?"<br><br>The Lord gave an interesting reply: "What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? . . . Ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you. . . . Ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea" (Ether 2:22–24).<br><br>The Lord could have told the brother of Jared what to do, but he was left to study this out in his own mind before proffering the solution. As a result, he selected sixteen stones and then asked the Lord to touch them that they might provide the light for their travel.<br><br>That same concept was again stressed in latter-day revelation, when the Lord told his servant, "You have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8).<br><br>Many of the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the prophets only after profound study and thoughtful, focused inquiry of the Lord. So it was with the Word of Wisdom and the revelation on the priesthood given to President Spencer W. Kimball in 1978. Similarly, you will learn best with the spirit of inquiry.<br><h3><b><i>Apply</i></b></h3><br>The third step is to<i>apply</i>or practice your learning in your daily lives. Those who have learned another language know how important that is. Even with great desire and study, mastery of a language comes only as it is applied to the daily situations of life.<br><h3><b><i>Pray</i></b></h3><br>The fourth and very important step in the learning process is to<i>pray</i>for help. I did not hesitate to communicate with the Lord in great detail, even about the technical steps in a new operative procedure that was to be performed. Often just the process of rehearsing it in my mind while engaged in prayer allowed divine direction for me to see a better way.<br><h2><b>A Warning</b></h2><br>Now may I offer important words of warning: Learning, if misused, can destroy your goals. Let us consider some safeguards to protect you from such an undesirable end.<br><h3><b><i>Nourishment</i></b></h3><br>Your faith must be nourished. You are blessed at this university to do this by enrolling in religion classes. Enrich that faith additionally with private scriptural study and with exposure to other fine books, art, or music. Nourish the gifts of the Spirit on the same daily basis that you feed your physical body.<br><h3><b><i>Role Model</i></b></h3><br>Choose your role model wisely. Before you endorse all of the teachings of any teacher, ask yourself if his or her<i>faith</i>is strong enough to be worthy of emulation. If it isn't, be very discriminating in what you learn from such an individual. Remember that the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price are the standards by which you should measure all doctrine.<br><h3><b><i>Avoid Pitfalls</i></b></h3><br>Avoid poisons of faith such as sin, pornography, or barely abiding the letter of the law instead of embracing the ennobling spirit of the law. Remember, "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life" (2 Corinthians 3:6).<br><h3><b><i>Prepare for Challenges</i></b></h3><br>Many challenges will be put in your way. You will hear allegations that the Church is "anti-intellectual." When people make that statement, I am reminded of a common sight in the jungles of Africa. A bird, like the critic, will often perch on the uppermost part of an elephant. This bird pecks away at the hide of the stately animal, achieving temporary nourishment and position of eminence by virtue of this association. While the elephant doesn't need the bird, the bird needs the elephant for its place of prominence. Though the bird may peck, squawk, and smear, the elephant steadily pursues its course in seeming oblivion to its parasitic passenger.<br><br>To the charge that the Church is "anti-intellectual,"<i>you</i>are the greatest evidence to refute such an erroneous statement. Individually, you have been encouraged to learn and to seek knowledge from any dependable source. In the Church, we embrace<i>all</i>truth, whether it comes from the scientific laboratory or from the revealed word of the Lord. We accept all<i>truth</i>as being part of the gospel. One truth does not contradict another.<br><br>Some of the greatest "intellectuals" have been those with the strongest faith. Socrates felt that the unexamined life is not worth living, so nothing was exempt from his questioning. But he, with Immanual Kant, had unwavering faith in God, freedom, and immortality. Socrates never doubted the will of his personal God. He believed so much in freedom that he tied his own self-responsibility to that freedom. So deeply did he believe in the doctrine of immortality of the soul that although he might have prolonged his biological life by choosing exile, he submitted with complete serenity to the death sentence of the Athenian court.<br><br>Louis Pasteur made this statement on his reception into the French Academy:<br><br><i>The Greeks have given us one of the most beautiful words in our language, the word enthusiasm, which means "a God within.</i>"<i>The grandeur of the acts of men is measured by the inspiration from which they spring. Happy is he who bears a God within!</i>[See Rene J. Dubos,<i>Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science</i>(Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1950), p. 392]<br><br>Consider the Council of the Twelve. Eleven of them hold baccalaureate degrees. (The one exception was occasioned by the interruption of collegiate education by war.) In addition, there are<i>seven</i>earned doctor's degrees among those twelve men. I must add that educational attainments have not qualified them for their spiritual callings, but they do indicate that their own scholarly pursuits make them not only sympathetic to, but supportive of the divine decrees to gain knowledge.<br><br>Fortify yourselves against attacks on the leaders of the Church. They have never purported to be perfect or even close to it. In fact, the Lord described them as "the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised." But, the Lord continued, they will "thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 35:13).<br><br>Under brutal attack by his critics, Joseph Smith said, "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught. Must I, then, be thrown away as a thing of naught?" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 368).<br><br>As you edify yourselves with education for the eternities, search the scriptures. Liken them unto you. Learn the law in the kingdom of your own activity. Use the standard works as literal standards of eternal excellence against which you measure every thought and deed.<br><br>Begin with the end in mind. Shape your own destiny. Remember that the development of your career, your family, and your faith in God is your individual responsibility--for which you alone will be held accountable.<br><br>To you, I extend my love and invoke an apostolic blessing upon you that success will be yours in all your righteous' endeavors. I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the Living God, the head of this Church, and our advocate with the Father. I testify to the divine role of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the restoration of the gospel, and that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Russell M.

<h1>ns of Excellence - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is homecoming time, a special time for all of us to come to BYU, a time of reunion, and a time of recommitment to the "traditions of excellence" for which Brigham Young University stands. I would like to use the theme of this homecoming week for my remarks today.<br><h2><b>The Foundation</b></h2><br>We have just experienced the 154th Semiannual General Conference of the Church. Conference time itself marks a time of tradition for many of us. There are the many conference visitors from far and near, the missionary reunions, the long lines and large gatherings of people on Temple Square, and even the conference week sales and specials in many of the local stores. Fathers and sons attend general priesthood meeting together and then converge on the hamburger stands and ice cream shops. Families gather together in front of their television sets to hear the conference messages and music, which never fail to stir our souls. General conference is indeed a good tradition in our lives. It is a time for instilling more deeply within us the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ<i>and</i>the desire to understand them and live them more fully. It is a time when we are taught and reminded of the foundation of every tradition of excellence--the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Cultural War</b></h2><br>We all recognize that in our lives today, as never before, are those forces that would have us break away from what we know as the traditional values and morals of our culture and religion.<br><br>Patrick J. Buchanan of the<i>Chicago Tribune</i>wrote a commentary a few years ago describing what he called "an historic struggle taking place between separate, competing and hostile cultures," a struggle that "divides parties and pulpits, universities and generations. It is carried on in magazines and books, in film and theater . . . it is a cultural war . . . and the issues upon which it is being fought are among the most fundamental."<br><br>Mr. Buchanan described this cultural war as one being fought "not in the arena of weapons, but in the arena of ideas, beliefs, customs, values, traditions, morals and ideals, the outcome of which will determine the future of our civilization."<br><br>This same struggle between the false traditions of men and the eternal traditions of the gospel was also apparent among the Saints in the days of the Apostle Paul. Paul wanted to prepare the Saints for the onslaught of persecution that would precede the second coming of Christ. He warned them of the deceit that would be brought among men by the wiles of the adversary. The value of righteous traditions was made clear as Paul wrote to the Saints in Thessalonica.<br><br><i>Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</i>[2 Thessalonians 2:15]<br><br>Approximately twelve years later Paul wrote a similar appeal in his letter to the Colossians. He pleaded with the people to remain close to Christ, whom they had received, and beware of the sophistries of men.<br><br><i>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,</i>so<i>walk ye in him:</i><br><br><i>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</i><br><br><i>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</i>[Colossians 2:6–8]<br><h2><b>A Proper Reply</b></h2><br>President Kimball has told of a time when he was meeting with church leaders in a foreign country where different ideologies touched their children. He asked how the parents were able to hold their children and keep them from evil. He said their reply was proper.<br><br><i>We train our children in our homes</i>so<i>completely in the way of right and truth that the destructive, godless philosophies and heresies of their other teachers run off without penetrating, like water on a duck's back, and our children remain true to the faith.</i>["The Family Influence,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1973, p. 15]<br><br>President Kimball then responded, "Ah, that is the answer. Family life, home life, home evenings, dedicated, selfless parents. That is the way the Lord ordained our lives to be" (Family Influence, p. 15).<br><br>As we consider traditions of excellence in our lives, it is important for us to evaluate present traditions and look to the future, seriously considering the heritage we are establishing for our children.<br><h2><b>Traditions Build and Strengthen</b></h2><br>Tradition defined is, first of all, most often associated with family--that which we hand down from ancestor to posterity--the handing down of an inherited culture, attitude, beliefs, opinions, customs, stories, etc., from parents to children.<br><br>Excellence refers to that which is clearly above the average, of unusual worth, of excellent quality--worthy.<br><br>Traditions of excellence, then, are clearly found within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ and are those traditions which build and strengthen family relationships.<br><br>Those present at the general priesthood meeting heard Elder Thomas S. Monson speak of the tradition of missionary work established in the family of President Ezra Taft Benson of the Council of the Twelve. President Benson's father answered the call to serve a mission in England when it meant leaving behind seven children and a wife who was expecting their eighth child. The tradition was set in place as this mother gathered the family together in the evening to read the letters from their missionary father. The spirit of missionary service filled the heart of every family member. The excellent tradition of service to God was established so well that every child in that family has now completed a full-time mission. This includes President Benson's two widowed sisters, who after many years volunteered to serve as missionaries. To President Benson's delight, they were called to the same mission in which he had served years before in England.<br><br>In addition, many of the grandchildren and great-grandchildren have carried on this tradition of excellence through their missionary service. Their response to calls to serve has become predictable--it can be depended upon.<br><h2><b>Keep Your Spiritual Balance</b></h2><br>You, too, can establish this tradition of excellence in your family. Service to the Lord can be a part of your experience even while earnestly engaged in your academic pursuits. It needs to be if you are to keep the spiritual balance necessary to maintain your eternal perspective.<br><br>When Bonnie and I arrived at the University of Southern California to pursue a doctoral degree, we had four children, little money, a fellowship, and lots of hope. We knew there were difficult and demanding years ahead.<br><br>My adviser was a fine faculty member who was also a member of the Church. He was well respected on the campus by both faculty and students. I sought his counsel regarding my program and how best to secure the desired degree.<br><br>He encouraged me with assurance that we would be able to meet the academic, time, and financial demands. He also reminded me that such a course would require careful attention to priorities. Pursuit of the degree would have to be the number one objective for both Bonnie and me. Of course, we would have to take time with our children and with each other. He advised me to inform our bishop that I would not be available for Church service except on a limited basis on Sunday.<br><br>Now, Bonnie and I had determined early in our lives that we would serve wherever and whenever the Lord should call and had done so from the time we were married. During my freshman year at BYU I had also determined that I would not study my schoolwork on the Sabbath day.<br><br>Not long after that the stake president extended a call for me to serve as one of the presidents of the seventies quorum of the stake and as a stake missionary. The call was accepted. The doctoral degree was completed. That experience in service was as important as the educational period that accompanied it.<br><h2><b>Key Principles in the Gospel</b></h2><br>J. Willard Marriott, whose beneficiaries we are as we enjoy these excellent facilities here at the Marriott Center, feels that the two greatest words in the English language are<i>work</i>and<i>prayer.</i>Both of these words represent key principles in the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not surprising then that, as the traditions of work and prayer became hallmarks of his personal and business life, Brother Marriott experienced great success and excellence in both.<br><br>So well did Brother Marriott establish these principles in his life that he transmitted them to his children. He has stated that Bill Jr. is so committed to service that he has seen him leave a meeting where matters concerning in excess of one hundred million dollars were being discussed to fulfill a Church service assignment. Both Brother Marriott's children and his employees have grown to experience the satisfaction of a commitment to work, to excellence in service and a desire to make personal improvement. Millions of patrons today benefit from these traditions of excellence.<br><h2><b>Forsaking Incorrect Traditions</b></h2><br>For the past three and a half years I have had the assignment to serve as executive administrator of the Australia/New Guinea Area. Although my assignment has recently been changed and the title of executive administrator is no longer used, I shall not forget the experience I had in New Guinea as the Church was first being established there.<br><br>Viba Rome and his wife, Mauveri, and their three children live in Papua, New Guinea. About three years ago a missionary couple taught the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to them in small Two-Mile Village, just outside Port Moresby. Two young boys led the missionary couple to the Wadega hut, where they found twelve people living in one small room. Viba and Mauveri were living there with Mauveri's family, the Wadegas. The missionaries taught them the gospel. It was well received by the entire family except for Mr. Wadega, who was reluctant to join any church.<br><br>Viba and Mauveri desired to be baptized immediately. Baptism would require them, however, to forsake some long-established traditions of their culture. Fighting, gambling, and beating their wives were traditional and acceptable pastimes for the men of the village. Betel nuts not only colored their teeth and gums a bright scarlet hue but had a narcotic effect upon those who chewed them and made them lazy and lethargic. The women also had changes to make. Attending church meetings would require them to cover their nakedness, a practice contrary to the tradition of their society. The other women of the village ridiculed them and accused them of trying to act superior to them. The traditional role of the women was to be unseen and unheard in any public gathering except when participating in the dances and singing of their culture. Attending church meetings and participating with men in worship service required a very great change in their social relationships.<br><br>Viba and Mauveri were baptized in the Coral Sea several weeks after hearing the gospel taught to them. Three weeks following their baptism I had the privilege of conferring the Aaronic Priesthood on Viba and ordaining him to the office of priest. On that day he wore his first white shirt, given to him by the missionary couple, Elder and Sister Campbell. Viba bore his testimony to the congregation of about 200--most of whom were members of less than one year. These were his stirring words:<br><br><i>Before I accepted the message of Jesus Christ from the missionaries, my heart was as a boiling caldron and my life was filled with fighting and abuse to my family and others. Now my heart is filled with peace and I have only love for my family and I have no desire to injure anyone.</i><br><br>With their acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Viba and his wife and others have had the determination and courage to break away from the false traditions of their ancestors. The superstitions and voodoo like practices have been replaced with priesthood power and true gospel service. The relationship of husband and wife as a partnership, education, self-improvement, honesty, virtue, and monogomy were all new traditions to be established in the Rome's lives. They have the desire and faith to live close to the Lord and they have the gospel of Jesus Christ and the programs of the Church as full resources to help them establish and maintain desired traditions of excellence.<br><br>Viba has a job at a cane furniture factory and is striving to establish an independent home and the traditions of an LDS family. This is not easy for him, because leaving his traditional home has meant taking from his family and the family of his wife their source of income. In New Guinea, when one has a job, all of that person's resources are used to support all family members living in that single dwelling.<br><br>Though Viba believes the custom of paying for his bride is not a good one, he will honor the marriage contract he made with Mauveri's father before he received the gospel. Because of the higher value placed on female offspring, Mauveri's value increased as each of their three daughters was born. Viba has determined that he will not carry on this tradition with his own daughters, however, even though their value would make him a very prosperous man. I think it should be noted here that Mauveri's father delayed setting her final price for five years until he found her true worth: how many daughters she could bear.<br><br>Viba now knows the true and eternal value of his family. A little over a year after their baptism I met Viba and Mauveri again, this time in the New Zealand Temple, and had the unforgettable opportunity of performing their sealing ordinance. Their trip to the temple for that special blessing was made possible for them by their gospel brothers and sisters in Brisbane, Australia. For the first time in their lives they rode in an airplane, wore shoes, slept in beds, and ate with forks and spoons from a table set with linen and fine chinaware. They experienced for the first time cold weather and the warmth of borrowed sweaters and the unfeigned love of their brothers and sisters in the temple surroundings.<br><br>Viba and Mauveri came forth from the temple endowed with the promise of celestial blessings through their faithfulness. They go forth as the first of their people to be sealed for time and eternity. They will set the eternal traditions before their people and establish among them the true traditions of excellence.<br><br>Viba has taught the gospel to his father's family in the village of Garibu. Today, Viba's father is the Garibu branch president. He has expressed his great love and appreciation for his son and the joy of receiving the gospel truths through him.<br><br>Fortunately, we here today do not face all the challenges of a Viba or Mauveri Rome. We are not isolated from our culture while striving to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Students at BYU are surrounded by the security of daily gospel instruction and almost daily activity in the Church. It is Viba's and Mauveri's challenge to maintain courage and faith to break the ties of old traditions that are contrary to their new life in the gospel and to establish traditions new and different and as yet unaccepted in their culture.<br><h2><b>Our Challenge</b></h2><br>We face a different challenge of holding fast to the already established and proven gospel traditions, of overcoming complacency and the competing adversary culture--or counterculture, as described by Patrick Buchanan. The faithful practice of daily prayer and regular scripture study, of moral values and cheerful service to others is common among us. The gospel is taught and followed freely without apology or reservation.<br><br>All here who have received the gospel of Jesus Christ and membership in his true Church have the full resources necessary to establish and maintain the desired traditions of excellence. The gospel provides the knowledge, purpose, and principles. The Church provides the programs, ordinances, and power for the development of these eternal traditions.<br><br>May each of us today, as we ponder the traditions of our lives, be determined to fulfill our own responsibility to develop the desire and faith to stay true to the teachings of the Lord in the righteous traditions of our fathers. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Rex D.

<h1>e Own Self Be True” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In 1982, on the fourth day of the National Spelling Bee, eighty-five of the 137 contestants were eliminated, including Andrew Flosdorf. The word that got him was "echolalia." When Andrew had spelled it, he had mistakenly substituted an "e" for the first "a." I mention Andrew, specially, though, because the judges misunderstood him and thought he had spelled the word correctly. It wasn't until after the round when some of Andrew's friends asked him how to spell his word that he learned his mistake.<br><br>He gulped back his tears and went right to the judges, who had to eliminate him. It was hard to do, but Andrew said, "I didn't want to feel like a slime."<br><br>Chief judge of the event, Robert Baker, said, "We want to commend him for his utter honesty."<br><br>So did the world, it seemed. Suddenly the thirteen-year-old was besieged by reporters requesting interviews and appearances on network television. Andrew was surprised by all the attention. "The first rule of Scouting is honesty," he said.<br><br>But we live in a world that gives attention to rare events. The old journalistic saw is that it's no news when the dog bites the man, but if the man bites the dog, start the presses. And honesty, especially in cases where the stakes are as high as they were for Andrew, has become rare enough to make the news. Unfortunately, we have become conditioned to dishonesty. "Lie a little here." "Cheat a little there." "It's okay," too many say. "Everybody does it."<br><h2><b>Honesty Starts with Ourselves</b></h2><br>The day that everybody really does do it, we are in big trouble. If our nation ever falls, it won't be because a better system has been developed. It will be because our own system has become overburdened with dishonesty and laziness. As Paul Harvey said, "We don't need new religions. We don't need new ethics. We don't need a new system; we need only to make honest the one we have" (Paul Harvey News, American Broadcasting Company, Chicago, Illinois).<br><br>"Everybody does it."<br><br>But there are some things that everybody ought not to do, and the place to start in making a change is with ourselves. Someone has said, "When I repent there is one less rascal in the world!"<br><br>William D. Brown, a clinical psychologist from Washington, D.C., put together an ethics test for<i>Success Magazine</i>that is worth thinking about. Let me pose to you just some of the questions he asks in this test<i>(Success Magazine,</i>December 1982, p. 30).<br><br><b>First,</b>do you give a full day's work for a full day's pay? The lack of productivity among American workers has observers anxious on all sides. Someone somewhere is not working at work to his fullest capacity. Is that you?<br><br><b>Second,</b>asks Brown, do you ever take office items, even small ones, for personal or family use? Pencils, erasers, and notepads have a way of disappearing from offices. One grocery attendant leaned over to another and whispered that he was going to call a long-distance sports quiz number on his employer's phone. That is the same kind of thing. We can't rationalize that it won't matter if we take just one item home since the company has so many of them. That is not so. It does matter.<br><br><b>Third,</b>do those who know you consider your word your bond--even your family? Do you keep your promises? Are you there when you say you'll be there? Or are your promises, as Mary Poppins said, "Piecrust promises--easily made and easily broken." Do you pledge things you don't mean, just to get yourself off the hook? In the end, these kind of false promises put us on the hook as people learn not to trust us.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>would your friends describe you as a loyal and faithful friend to them? We all have bushels of acquaintances, but a friend is a rare commodity. That is because a real friend requires a commitment of time and energy. We have to be there to share joys and sorrows. And we have to be the kind of person another can trust with confidences. Can others let down their veneer of safety and share their vulnerabilities with you and know you will love them just the same and it will go no further?<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>do you strive to remain honest in all interactions? Honesty is a habit that has to be acquired like anything else that is really worthwhile. Let's face it. When we are tempted to be dishonest, it is often to save face. We want to appear better than we are. We want to pretend we've done the job. Or sometimes we simply want to make our life more convenient. These are very human tendencies that we simply have to weed out of our lives.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b>if your spouse's emotional and physical fidelity were equal to yours, would you be satisfied? Let me tell you what Brown says about this.<br><br><i>Days of the "double standard" in marriage are gone for good, and thoughtful men and women will say, "good riddance!" It is important for both sexes to recognize that fidelity underscores commitment, without which a relationship couldn't survive.</i>[<i>Success Magazine,</i>p. 31]<br><br>And emotional fidelity is just as important. We have to learn to put the needs of our spouse above all other things, and not let business or other people supersede that relationship.<br><br><b>Seventh,</b>do you really treat others both at home and away from home the way you want to be treated? It is sometimes easy for us to be polite and charming to people outside our home, but are we as good to the people who live there? Do our families ever receive the benefit of our courtesy, our good cheer? It is essential that they do.<br><br>And it is also important to treat the stranger we will never see again with the courtesy we would shower upon our most influential friend. Think about how you treat other drivers on the street, someone who wants the same parking place you do when it's the last one on the block, or the clerk at the store when you are in a hurry.<br><br>These questions we've been asking ourselves bear very strongly on our personal integrity, and our integrity will bear very strongly on our personal success in this life. Virtue is not only its own reward; it rewards us in tangible ways every day we practice it.<br><h2><b>"This Above All"</b></h2><br>In Shakespeare's<i>Hamlet,</i>Laertes was embarking on a journey to foreign lands. Polonius, his father and lord chamberlain, a windbag and busybody, nevertheless gave him some sound advice that applies to all of us. He said, "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man" (<i>Hamlet,</i>act 1, sc. 3, lines 78–80).<br><br>To thine own self be true!<br><br>Jesus said, "For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?" (Luke 9:25).<br><br>To sell our integrity is to sell life itself.<br><br>It is not easy to stand up for what you believe in. It never has been, and it is no accident that the world is set up this way. Otherwise, how could you tell if you had integrity or not?<br><br>Walter Lippman wrote, "[A person] has honor if he holds himself to an ideal of conduct though it is inconvenient, unprofitable, or dangerous to do so" (<i>A Preface to Morals</i>[Time Inc.: New York, 1964], p. 209).<br><br>Doing the right thing when it is also the easy thing or the profitable thing is not a sign of integrity. That's like high jumping without a crossbar. Anybody can do it. David O. McKay said that the greatest battles of life are fought within the silent chambers of the human heart. He was right. Those are the real battles of life or death.<br><br>The victories and defeats of those inward battles show themselves in our outward actions.<br><br>It has been said that after about age forty, each of us pretty much deserves the face we are wearing. We designed it from the inside.<br><br>That's part of what makes life exciting. We can be anything we want to be, but we must build solidly on a foundation of honor and integrity.<br><br>I've often wondered when it comes to honesty if there are any little things or little issues. The smallest wedge can penetrate the psychological barrier against dishonesty, and once broken, it is easier to break again until dishonesty is a habit. We may even abandon it eventually as an ideal. If that ever happens, individually or collectively, our quality of life will slip drastically. Dishonesty does not pay--it always costs!<br><br>Hi Nelson wrote a story about a boy named Jack who found out just how much it cost.<br><br><i>"One more test and I'm finished--graduated!" thought Jack. He shuffled into the last seat in the corner. It was cooler there. The window was wide open and every now and then, when he felt like resting his mind, he could look out and daydream.</i><br><br><i>He had little to worry about. He had studied hard. Besides, his marks had been high all term.</i><br><br><i>Test papers were passed out and then the last nervous chuckles and jokes came to an end.</i><br><br><i>Just then Jack noticed Ted Zorens. He was sitting right across the aisle. As Jack tackled the first few questions, he glanced over at Ted now and then.</i><br><br><i>Jack could tell that Ted was in trouble. Obviously he hadn't studied for the exam, but that was not unusual. He was</i>so<i>good at spotting the answers on the other students' papers that his friends called him "Obie," short for Old Binocular Eyes.</i><br><br><i>Jack could hear Ted's fingers tapping nervously on the desk top. If Ted flunked this exam, he wouldn't graduate.</i><br><br><i>But luck was with him. A girl student on the other side of the room was sick. The pressure of the exam was too much for her. She had been too nervous to eat breakfast that morning. Now she felt faint.</i><br><br><i>As the teacher called an assistant for help, Ted made his move. He passed Jack a note, "Just list the twenty short answers."</i><br><br><i>Jack hesitated only an instant. Ted was his friend. No one was caught; no one was hurt; Ted graduated.</i><br><br><i>Jack lost touch with Ted after graduation. Not until fifteen years later were they to meet again.</i><br><br><i>Jack was a salesman. He had been driving for eight hours straight. He fell asleep at the wheel and his car slammed into a tree. Jack was barely conscious as the ambulance screamed through traffic.</i><br><br><i>The stretcher-bearers rushed him into the operating room for surgery. He heard the voice of the surgeon. "Don't worry, you'll be fine. I'm Dr. Ted Zorens.</i>"<br><br><i>As Jack went under the anesthesia, he could hear the nervous tapping of fingers.</i>[Hi Nelson,<br><br>"Who Needs a Cheater at a Time Like This?"]<br><h2><b>At the Mercy of Things That Matter the Least</b></h2><br>Have you ever noticed that when everybody knows something or says something or adopts a certain standard, the pressure is overwhelming to do the same? If everybody acts a certain way, the sheer numbers may urge you to act the same way. If everybody adopts a certain attitude, it is far easier to yield to the group than stand aside, lonely and apart. But I've been overwhelmed as I've watched through the years how often popular opinion is untrue.<br><br>Take that favorite childhood story about Pieter, the Dutch boy who stuck his finger in the dike and saved the area from flooding. We Americans tell that story to our children to remind them how important it is to be brave. Unfortunately, the story is simply an American invention. No Dutchman ever heard of brave little Pieter. But now comes the really interesting twist. So many American tourists to Holland asked about Pieter that the Dutch decided it was only sensible to erect a statue in his honor. So today, in a town near Amsterdam, there is a statue to Pieter, who never existed at all, except in the minds of American parents and children.<br><br>Of course, to follow popular opinion about some story may not be serious. But to follow popular opinion about moral behavior or long-range goals could lead you to imperil your very eternal life. Think about the choices you make every day. Are they based on popular opinion or your deepest values?<br><br>Too many of us get caught in monkey traps!<br><br>In parts of Africa the natives capture monkeys in a unique way. They lop the top off a coconut, clean out the meat, anchor the coconut to the ground and place a peanut in the empty shell. Then they leave. You know how monkeys love peanuts. They smell the peanuts and cannot resist reaching into the coconut to grab the peanut. But holding the peanut in their paw, the monkeys can't get the doubled-up paw out of the small hole in the top. The natives return with gunnysacks and pick up the trapped monkeys, who fight, bite, scream, kick, and do everything in the world but the one thing that would save their lives--let go of the peanut.<br><br>Have you ever been caught in a monkey trap where the things that matter the most are at the mercy of things that matter the least?<br><br>For instance, what do you do for recreation? Do you go to the movie that everybody's talking about this week, even though the language is profane, the story immoral? Have you learned to unconsciously adopt the values of the crowd, thinking it is more important to find out who won Miss America than what is found in the Bible? Popular opinion holds a tremendous power over our recreational choices and our values, often leading us to compromise ourselves.<br><br>How about your goals? Are they influenced by popular opinion or by eternal values? Most of us may find that we compromise ourselves there, too. We learn to envy those who are served in the world instead of those who do the serving. When we dream of the future, we hope for wealth and power rather than eternal life. The Lord has outlined a remarkable goal for us in the scriptures. He says:<br><br><i>It shall come to pass that every soul who</i><br><br><i>forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>The Lord has said we can see his face, but too often we ignore that great promise and fix a goal for ourselves gleaned from popular opinion. We want to be well liked and have lots of fun. We want to be good-looking and showy. That's a goal based on compromise--giving up the eternal values for the things that will not and cannot last.<br><br>How about your conversations? Do you compromise yourself when you talk? We all know how important it is to be kind and charitable, to withhold judging another. But in the thick of a conversation, how easy it is to compromise, to be unkind or critical. How easy to laugh at a joke you know should never have been told.<br><h2><b>It's Easy to Follow a Cow Path</b></h2><br>The reason that the road leading to heaven is straight and narrow is probably because it is not a popular path. It is a difficult one, and those who must follow popular opinion against their conscience may find the road set steep. They like this lazy cow path described in a poem by Sam Walter Foss instead.<br><br><i>One day through the primeval wood</i><br><i>A calf walked home as good calves should;</i><br><br><i>But made a trail all bent askew,</i><br><i>A crooked trail as all calves do.</i><br><br><i>This forest path became a lane,</i><br><i>That bent and turned and turned again;</i><br><br><i>This crooked lane became a road,</i><br><i>Where many a poor horse with his load</i><br><br><i>Toiled on beneath the burning sun,</i><br><i>And travelled some three miles in one.</i><br><br><i>And men two centuries and a half</i><br><i>Trod in the footsteps of that calf.</i><br><br><i>For men are prone to go it blind</i><br><i>Along the calf-paths of the mind,</i><br><br><i>And work away from sun to sun</i><br><i>To do what other men have done.</i><br>[Sam Walter Foss, "The Calf-Path,"<i>Whiffs from Wild Meadows,</i>(Boston: Lee and Shepard Publishers, 1898), pp. 77–80]<br><br>Our lives were not meant to be cow paths where we blindly follow whoever went first. If we base our actions on what other people do or think, in the end we will be abandoned. We will pay a steep price for the momentary comfort of following the crowd, assuming mob values. An individual cannot imitate others without giving up something of himself.<br><br>A man told this story about his youth. It seems that when he was seventeen, he used to run with a gang of boys who had great times together. One night after they had been together, he heard the shouting of excited people coming toward his house. Being curious, he dressed and went downstairs to discover that a mob was approaching. It was not long until it arrived and from it sprang three or four of his friends, all members of the gang. One of them said to him, "Come with us, Joe. This man has hurt a girl and we're going to lynch him." Before Joe could ask any questions, they grabbed him by the arms and he was swept along in a swirling, shouting sea of humanity.<br><br>A mile from his house was a large oak tree. Almost before he knew what was happening, the mob had placed a rope around the accused man's neck, placed him on a horse, and thrown the rope over the limb of a tree. The moment of death had arrived. Have you ever known such a moment when important things weigh in the balance?<br><br>A profound silence came over the mob. The last details of the lynching had been completed. Quite by chance or by the force of circumstance, Joe found himself right next to the horse. Suddenly, the leader--and every mob has such a leader--shouted at him. "Joe, kick that horse and let's get this thing over with." The tension within Joe could not be described. He'd never seen this man before. But here Joe was with all these people watching him, anxious for him to carry out the command. He felt the pressure as he hesitated, but then, blinded by emotion and the desire to have the approval of the mob, he kicked the horse. The man met his death.<br><br>The next day the mob discovered that they had lynched an innocent human being. This man had had nothing to do with the alleged crime. And for sixty-five years Joe tried to find peace. He wished again and again in the agony of his soul that at the moment when the mob took him along and he found himself by the side of the horse he had had the ability and courage to live as his conscience dictated.<br><br>But from his agony and suffering he reported that he learned many things. He learned that some people try to have many consciences. "This is the way I act with the gang because I want their approval. And this is the way I act in school or at work. This is the way I act in church, but this is the way I act on Saturday night."<br><br>General Douglas MacArthur described it as "The roar of the crowd on one hand and the voice of our conscience on the other." The fact is that if any of us try to live with several consciences we will be made miserable in the end. In the thick of life, compromising our standards may seem the easiest route, but in the end we are painfully diminished. In a world of constantly changing standards, it is never good enough to say, "Everybody does this, so I can, too." Instead we have to use that unchanging standard for our life's conduct:<i>What would the Savior do?</i><br><br>All of our lives we face tests of character.<br><br>And while, if we have been taught well, we are sure we want to be honest, courageous, and compassionate, life does not present us our character tests in calm, unhurried moments so we can respond how we hope we would. Instead, in the midst of worries, pressures, and frustrations, a test of character is slipped in, and we might not even recognize it for what it is. Temptations rarely announce themselves as such. Tests of character are never so obvious, saying, "Now let's see what you're made of." Instead, our tests wear masks to disguise themselves, and if we should slip and fail, then we may not even recognize our mistake. It is so easy to rationalize, "I had to respond that way because life was tough on me just then."<br><br>It is relatively easy for any of us to respond well when life is not frustrating or challenging us. We can pass our tests of character with flying colors when anxiety or exhaustion aren't nailing us to the wall. But the real test is how we respond amidst the traumas and problems of everyday life, not how we can be temporarily when life is easy. When we hear about a test of character we can think of just the right way to act, but can we be that way when we are in the midst of it, and no one told us that this was a character test?<br><br>He who has a strong character can pass his tests as well in foul weather as in sunny. In fact, like a fair-weather friend, a fair-weather test is almost no test at all.<br><br>So life will confront us with temptations, with tests of character, and we have no guarantee that they will come when we are most able to handle them.<br><h2><b>Prepare to Pass the Tests</b></h2><br>How can we be prepared to handle them when they do come, then? Perhaps we can learn a lesson from our physical bodies, To be able to pass tests of physical strength and stamina, we have to keep our bodies physically fit. This requires a certain amount of consistent effort from us, often directed toward a certain goal. If we want to run a mile, we start out by walking it first and then working our way toward our goal. We don't eat junk food that would subvert our health; we watch our nutrition, knowing that we become what we eat.<br><h2><b>To Pass a Test</b></h2><br>To pass life's character tests takes similar effort and consistent work. How, otherwise, can we expect character fitness? This work usually falls into three areas.<br><br>First, we need to expose ourselves to examples of good behavior so that we can recognize it when we see it. Like the star a mariner chooses to guide his ship at night, so can our good examples guide us through the murkiness of the world. People whose qualities are worthy of emulation fill the scriptures, great literature, and history.<br><br>Noble hearts are all around us if we but look. Let us concentrate our minds and hearts on these examples, rather than indiscriminately mimicking whatever images the world hands us.<br><br>Second, let us decide in advance how we will respond to our character tests. Often when the moment is upon us we have lost our perspective and take the course of least resistance. The advance decision puts us in control of our responses rather than making us mere reactors to the pressures of the present.<br><br>Winston Churchill, that grand old hero of World War II, declared: "Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never--in nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense" (Address at Harrow School, 29 October 1941).<br><br>Third, we need to pray for help to recognize those moments of decision when our character hangs in the balance. We need to find the strength to carry out in the storm those decisions made when life was calm. Richard L. Evans noted, "If you don't want temptation to follow you, don't act as if you are interested" (<i>Thoughts for One Hundred Days,</i>vol. 5 [Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1972], p. 87). The Lord can help us know temptation when we see it so we don't become interested.<br><br><i>When in the dim beginning of the years,</i><br><i>God mixed in man the raptures and the tears</i><br><i>And scattered thru his brain the starry stuff,</i><br><i>He said, "Behold! Yet this is not enough,</i><br><i>For I must test his spirit to make sure</i><br><i>That he can dare the Vision and endure.</i><br><br><i>"I will withdraw my Face,</i><br><i>Veil me in shadow for a certain space,</i><br><i>Leaving behind Me only a broken clue--</i><br><i>A crevice where the glory glimmers thru,</i><br><i>Some whisper from the sky,</i><br><i>Some footprint in the road to track Me by.</i><br><br><i>"I will leave man to make the fateful guess,</i><br><i>Will leave him torn between the No and Yes</i>,<br><i>Leave him unresting till he rests in Me,</i><br><i>Drawn upward by the choice that makes him free</i><br><i>Leave him in tragic loneliness to choose,</i><br><i>With all in life to win or all to lose."</i><br>[Edwin Markham, "Man-Test,"<i>Poems of Edwin Markham,</i>sel. Charles L. Wallis (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1950), p. 5–6]<br><br>My prayer in behalf of you noble young men and women who have the future of the world in your hands is "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man." That is my testimony to you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L. Backman was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 23 October 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> We Ought to Be, We Better Be Becoming - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Helen Wells</b></h2><br>As the mother of such a lovely daughter, it is impossible for me to express in the English language, or even in the Spanish language (which is a more beautiful, flowery language), how I really feel this night. I hope that you can try to imagine a little bit of what I'm feeling.<br><br>I don't want to take away from Sharlene's time, but I do want to share with you two aspects of this many-faceted personality that is our daughter. There are many attributes that Sharlene has that have helped her be the contributive person that she is.<br><br>Sharlene has always set goals, and I think if she were speaking in my place she would say, "Whatever we ought to be, we better be becoming, and whatever we ought to be doing, we better be doing it." As a family we see this in Sharlene. She has always been this way, a very curious person, a person desirous of knowing as much as she can as quickly as she can. As her life bespeaks, she would say, "Set goals and follow them." She would say, "Plan your direction because direction is important." She would say, "Decisions are important. Make wise ones."<br><br>Another lesson that Sharlene has internalized early in her life is that a person may be tolerant without compromising herself or her own traditions, background, beliefs, convictions, or habits of life. She has truly exemplified this. Tolerance without compromising truth, sound principles, or fundamentals is one of the great needs of today.<br><br>We are very proud that Sharlene stands up for what she believes to be true. She is tolerant of all peoples. She has been raised, as I like to say of all of our children, color blind, which doesn't mean she can't distinguish between colors with her eyes, but that she sees no difference in color of skin, race, creed, culture, or religious background. She is tolerant of all peoples but never compromises truth, sound principles, or fundamentals.<br><br>She is an instigator of righteousness and it certainly is a privilege, an honor, and a great blessing to be her mother.<br><br>I bear my testimony that I know that what she radiates and what she believes is what we all should radiate and what we should internalize as our beliefs. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Robert E. Wells</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters and friends of Sharlene, I'm grateful that Paul has given a perfect scripture for this occasion. I'm reading from 1 Corinthians 9:23–26: Paul explains, "And this I do for the gospel's sake." And to a very large degree I like to think that Sharlene is doing this [the role of Miss America] partly because of a spiritual motivation behind it all. Paul goes on to say,<br><br><i>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain</i>[the prize or the crown].<i>And every man</i>[every woman, of course]<i>that striveth</i>. . .<i>do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we</i>[seek]<i>an incorruptible</i>[crown]. [1 Corinthians 9:24–25]<br><br>Paul was talking about the difference between the honors of men, temporal, worldly things that may not last too long, versus those things of eternal value. He was talking about exaltation and eternal life. He was talking about spiritual values, eternal values, a different kind of crown. He goes on to say, "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air" (1 Corinthians 9:26). In other words, he is really going to go for it, for those eternal principles.<br><br>Now, carrying this illustration just a little bit further, I like to use the example that anyone who competes in this kind of competition, the scholarship-pageant competition, does so in the same sense that an Olympic athlete competes in a pentathlon.<br><br>Let me mention the events. The first is, of course, the judges' interview, in which the candidates are judged on their ability to articulate, to communicate, to think on their feet, to respond with their own opinions and feelings about things, and to project a warm, pleasant personality. The second part is the talent event. The judges are looking at the years of study required and for the ability to present oneself exceptionally well on a stage before many people. Then there is the physical fitness section of it. And there is an evening gown, feminine graces section of it. These are the four recognized events.<br><br>I feel (this is a personal feeling, certainly I'm not reflecting the pageant, I'm reflecting what I think was part of it as a Church leader and as a father of one of the contestants) there was a fifth category of spirituality, of virtue--of those things that when we talk about crowns, when I say being a queen in Israel, you know what I am talking about. I believe that was an element, a degree that is difficult to explain and difficult to talk about. But the judges were not really aware of that. After the crowning I was asked what I thought about this and I said that I thought the judges were looking for this kind of a young lady. It turns out that the judges never said that they were looking for a spiritual, virtuous young lady. They said they were impressed with many of the other qualities.<br><br>I still feel there was a spiritual element. I'll tell you why. I have a final scripture to use, It is Moroni 7:29.<br><br><i>And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.</i><br><br>When I gave Sharlene a father's blessing before she left home, I did not bless her to win. I blessed her that she would do her best. I blessed her physically, spiritually, and emotionally to do her very best. In the prayer I even mentioned her harp, that the strings wouldn't break and that the wood wouldn't crack because we had had that kind of problem in the past. I also blessed her that angels would attend her because I believe that angels do minister to the children of men.<br><br>After the crowning, when Sister Wells and I met Sharlene for a brief embrace before she rushed off to the interview with the press, she whispered as she hugged me, "Daddy, as my fingers touched the strings for the first chord, I felt like angels were with me." I think angels might have been there with the judges, too.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I leave you my testimony. I leave my prayer and blessing on each and everyone here that all of us will have goals and ambitions looking toward eternal crowns of being kings and queens in Israel, incorruptible crowns in Zion.<br><br>I close by testifying that our Heavenly Father is in His heaven. He loves us, He hears our prayers, He answers them. I testify that Jesus the Christ, our Lord and Savior, lives. He lives, resurrected, glorified, exalted, standing physically at the head of this Church which bears His name. His spokesman here on the earth is a living prophet, our beloved President Kimball. Everything that we stand for, that Sharlene stands for, and everything that we believe about the premortal existence, the reason of this earth life, this time of mortal probation, the second coming, the life to come, is true. I testify of it humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Sharlene Wells</b></h2><br>When they told me that I was speaking, I thought, "Okay, if I were you, what would I want to hear from me." Probably, how in the world did I get here? I've asked myself that question many times and I think what I've come up with is I've always been very aware of opportunities. At the same time I've also been aware that the Lord must have some great purpose for me because He has blessed me a great deal with a family that is so supportive, with opportunities running into me, almost. I had to decide that I was not going to turn down any opportunities because I was either nervous or busy. Those are poor excuses in my book. So I had to take advantage of any opportunity because of the great sense of duty and responsibility that I felt to the Lord.<br><br>Maybe I could share with you some of those experiences and opportunities that I feel have prepared me for this position. When I was in South America the second time--many of you know that I have spent about eleven years there--I was about thirteen and in the eighth grade. I had my first encounter with what being "different" meant. Down there they don't date, they "go with someone." Here I was, only thirteen, and this young man approached me and asked, "Will you go with me?" I was so naive I replied, "Where?" Needless to say, that was the last time I ever was asked out while I was down there!<br><br>At first I was on the defensive when people would call me "goody-goody." Now I have learned to take it with a sense of humor. I was very much on the defensive until I realized that a sense of humor can smooth over anything. So the next time one of the boys would come up to me and kid me about being goody-goody (Remember those Goody-Goody combs? Well, back then, in eighth grade, they used those combs.), and if he had one of those combs, I would say, "See, you're not so bad yourself." Then he would say, "Okay, okay, I get what you mean." They didn't tease me anymore once I decided that I was not going to be on the defensive.<br><br>When I was on the "David Letterman Show" and he insinuated that I don't have fun because I don't drink, I said, "Oh, I drink--milk, water, juice, and 7-up, etc." Then we got on to other things; we didn't dwell on the fact that I'm not having "fun" by the world's standards.<br><br>While I was in South America, there were only a few of us in high school from the States who were members of the Church--my sisters, the mission president's sons, and a couple of others. We were always invited to the weekly school parties that they had down there and of course there were many activities going on. There was beer and smoking, but we learned that, yes, we could condemn the action, but it didn't mean we had to condemn the people. We still loved our friends. So we would go to the parties as long as they provided the Sprite for us and then we would leave when they started to get a little boring. We would just say, "You guys are boring, we're taking off now. We're going to have our own party." We learned being different doesn't matter, we can still have fun. So now when I have to go to cocktail parties, it doesn't bother me in the slightest to raise up my glass of water in a toast. Nobody thinks to make fun of me. Sure, it might be strange by the world's standards, but as long as we are not apologetic about it, it is quite all right.<br><h2><b>Fitting In</b></h2><br>Another one of my challenges was moving often. We moved many times throughout my childhood. At first it was hard because I didn't fit in--I was different. I remember when we first moved up here to the United States when I was seven. Nobody wanted to hear about South America, and that was of course my only background. It was hard to fit into elementary school. Then we moved again and it was hard to fit into the cliques on the other side of the city. Then we moved back down to South America. I think it was down there that I finally decided that in order for me to fit in wherever I go, I have to first fit in with myself. I have to be completely confident of myself and then I can have a great time. I think at that time I didn't understand why I was not fitting in, and now I do. Now I realize that because I'm so interested in different kinds of people, as I travel across the country, in some small way I can relate to people of all different backgrounds. I have not just fit in with one clique.<br><br>Then, of course, there was coming to college--BYU. But before I get into that, I was in Boston just this last week when Boston College dropped to eleventh and BYU went to fourth in the football polls. I was very proud to be from BYU and I found it hard to keep from gloating. While I was signing autographs a man came up to me and said, "I feel really bad about Boston College dropping to eleventh, but if it had to be another university, I'm glad it is a university such as Brigham Young University." Then he left. That made me feel really good. I didn't feel so bad about gloating anymore.<br><br>I was fairly confident in high school about what I could do, about my talents, about what I could accomplish as a person. Then I got to college and I thought there was no way I could compete at a college level. I was one against a million. It took me my first year here to realize that we are all one against a million, which makes us all equal and at the same time very individualistic with regard to talents and skills and abilities. But we all have exactly the same advantages.<br><h2><b>Young Ambassadors</b></h2><br>My second year I decided I would tryout for Young Ambassadors. It was kind of presumptuous of me since I had never danced before in my life. I thought I would just tryout as a singer. That was how much I knew about Young Ambassadors. You have to do<i>everything</i>in Young Ambassadors, including technical responsibilities such as setting up mikes.<br><br>I went into the audition room and was handed a microphone, just about the first time I had ever held one. I was expected to sing, so I did. I didn't think I would make callbacks, so my roommate who was there, had to call me and say, "Get down here, you made callbacks."<br><br>I asked, "Well, what do I have to do? Do I have to sing another song?"<br><br>"No," she said, "you have to dance."<br><br>I said, "Oh boy, I better just quit right here." She insisted, "No, get down here."<br><br>So I showed up in my jeans, tennies, and sweatshirt for dance auditions. Well, some kind soul came up to me and said she had a pair of sweats I could borrow. Another said she had a cutoff sweatshirt I could borrow--which I did. So, I show up on the dance floor with my sweats and tennies and cutoff sweatshirt and everyone else is in leotards and tights and jazz pants and jazz shoes, looking like they came out of "Fame," and here I am out of<i>Rocky.</i>Needless to say, I forgot half the dance, but I remembered something--as long as you keep smiling, maybe they'll forget the rest of the body. It must have worked. I think ninety percent of it was inspiration on the part of Randy and Dee. They knew that I needed this. And then maybe ten percent was that they thought I had potential. After looking over my resume they asked me, "Haven't you ever had any dance experience?" I said, "No, but I've always been very involved in sports. Does that count?" Maybe they thought it did.<br><br>I learned so much about this group and how much impact this group can have worldwide and how much impact even one individual can have. I also learned that there is no room for the word<i>tired.</i>After eight shows in one day in Waukegan, Illinois, we had our final show, a two-hour special with seventeen costume changes. We're supposed to be peppy, jumping off the stage and going into the audience and greeting people for about half an hour. The only thing that makes it worthwhile--not the only thing, but one of the main things--is when someone comes up and says, "It is so great to see young people who have a purpose in life and who can show it through their music." It is also exciting when a missionary runs up all excited and says, "Our family has just committed to baptism!"<br><br>I kept that in mind, that there is no room for being tired. Right after I won the Miss America Pageant I had to get up at 4:00 in the morning and go to CBS and ABC and NBC and then right after that to a couple of press conferences where they asked me the same questions about Vanessa and my squeaky-clean image and I had to come up with all sorts of creative answers so that I didn't get bored. Of course, each appearance required me to be in different outfits. That is a challenge, pulling clothes out of a suitcase that look like opponents after a BYU football game and trying to make them look presentable. Then I attended the opening of a restaurant where the only things I could understand on the menu were escargot, duck liver, and chocolate mousse. So what do I pick? The chocolate mousse! Then I went to a cocktail party where some people were not quite sober. But one sober man came up and said, "When I learned that you were Mormon, I knew you stood for everything right." That was fulfilling for me. It made the whole day worthwhile--that I can stand for something right and represent what all of you stand for in a way which you would be proud of.<br><h2><b>Learning a Lot</b></h2><br>Yes, I have learned a lot from Randy and the Young Ambassadors. They have taught me a lot about sharing my assurance, my confidence--not on a soapbox, but rather with actions and commitments. Integrity is only sustained by commitment. There are other groups of friends and influential people that, of course, I want to thank. I'm quite a people watcher. I look at all these different people who have influenced my life and I try to pick out at least one thing from each that I want to emulate. For instance, my sister Elayne is quite a journal keeper. That has influenced me. I take that aspect and say to myself, "I can keep up my journal if she can," although she is the 4.0 Stanford student.<br><br>I learned a lot from my South American friends. I learned that I should differentiate between the actions and the person. Never condemn anyone because they smoke or drink. They are just as much a human being as I am, although I may not condone their actions.<br><br>Then there are all my secular and ecclesiastical leaders and teachers, not to mention my voice, piano, and harp teachers who have all worked with me and not tried to create anything. They have worked with my raw materials, which I really appreciate because I'm not one to be molded. If anyone is going to do the molding, I want to do it, and the Lord can. But I love to learn from everyone.<br><br>I'm also thankful to all those people in the pageants with whom I have been involved. I learned a lot about service through those pageants--titles are not fame and glory. It is a lot of hard work. It is a lot of service.<br><br>Also, I want to thank special friends such as Janice and Robin and LeAnne--they know who they are--my roommates, friends who have stuck with me, and of course all of you out there with whom I have associated. I have great regard for those of you who have taught me a lot. I keep you in mind all the time and for this reason: seventy-five percent of my confidence has come from you, my peers, because that is really what means the most to me. My family is biased, so I can't really draw my confidence from them, although there is a great amount of support there. But when it comes from my peers, that is what means the most to me.<br><br>Again, of course, the Young Ambassadors, my second family, helped me greatly. Besides teaching me what the word impact means, they have also taught me what the word diet means. A few months ago, while on tour, right before the Miss Utah Pageant, Randy came up to me on the bus and asked, "Are you on a diet?" I said, "No." He said, "Well, you should be thinking of one." So then I had to decide which had more calories, the chocolate pudding or the chocolate cake. That was hard.<br><h2><b>He Didn't Raise His Voice, He Intensified It</b></h2><br>Now to another special group and that is my family. I recently received a letter from one of my parent's missionaries when my dad was mission president. This is what he says about my dad: "His teaching was always done with composed patience. You often behaved well for him because you knew he expected you to behave and you didn't want to disappoint him. He understands women so well that he usually defers to your mother until and unless he wants to make a point. He did not raise his voice, he intensified it. His love always seemed unreserved and always abundant." That is one thing that I've learned from my dad, not to raise my voice, but to intensify it. I see myself doing that in press conferences whenever there is something that jumps out, especially with regard to my principles. That is when I intensify my voice and speak with assurance because he has taught me that.<br><br>Also there is my mom--I have to refer to her as the air traffic controller of the family, especially with three younger daughters. When we were in South America we had one piano and all three of us had to practice at least half an hour before school. We had to get up at 5:30 to accomplish this. It has really been a challenge, I'm sure, for my mom to schedule all of our comings and goings. I appreciate her for everything she has done. I feel it would be more appropriate for her to be wearing the crown than myself. She has really been the wall, and myself, the grapevine.<br><br>I have to thank my supportive family, my sisters who always show up at whatever I'm doing and who have the talents to challenge me and to keep me on my toes.<br><br>And most important, I have to thank my Creator. I have been blessed so much, not only with a firm belief in who I am and my purpose in life, but also with my family and the opportunities I spoke of before. Just recently we were flying back from Hawaii, going to Chicago, and we were coming from the sunset, so we were travelling through the night. As I looked out the window, there were these stars just absolutely beautiful with the moon and no cloud cover because we were above the clouds, and every now and then I could see the earth below. It prompted me to think about the potential that I have, that we all have, to be looking down on an earth someday. It magnified my responsibility on earth right now because I have a lot at stake later on.<br><h2><b>"If I But Learn to Do His Will"</b></h2><br>I received a letter from a friend just recently and she summed up exactly what I feel in this short paragraph: "It is one thing, of course, to be chosen as an individual to represent a city and state. It is quite another to represent the kingdom of God in such a visible and vulnerable way. The responsibility is infinitely greater but so is the sense of satisfaction, knowing that much higher purposes are being fulfilled. I would so much rather be a little tool in God's hands than a luminary on my own. I find it lots more fun."<br><br>That is exactly the way I feel. I feel like that is what I am right now--a tool in God's hands--that that's what I have been prepared for. We all know the song "I Am a Child of God"<i>(Sing with Me,</i>B-76). To me the phrase "If I but learn to do His will" is the key to everything. Everything will fall into place if we learn to allow ourselves to be guided.<br><br>I want to leave you with my testimony. Our Father does live and His son Jesus Christ was sent to this earth for our sake and we owe him a great deal for what we are and what we can become. I know I do. I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Sharlene Wells was a BYU student and reigning Miss America when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 October 1984.

<h1>: What Is Your Personal Ranking? - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the last two months, Tuesdays have become special days in the lives of most BYU students and friends. It is the day when the TV and radio stations and newspapers announce BYU's ranking. Today, before leaving to come here, I asked my secretary, "What is BYU's rating this week?" I didn't say anything about football. I was told, "They are No. 4 in the nation." Being ranked in the top three or four of the nation in football is not only a new high for BYU but a worthy achievement. I wholeheartedly commend Coach LaVell Edwards, his associates, and team members on their rating and winning their ninth straight WAC championship last Saturday.<br><br>It is my understanding that college football teams are basically ranked according to the number of wins and losses, who their opponents were, and by points scored or allowed. I suppose there are some weeks when some frustrated coaches think that those who determine the rankings take into consideration the color of the uniforms as part of the formula. However, I am not here today to quarrel with those who put out the rankings. I am here to talk about the words "remember" and "rank."<br><br>Perhaps at this time of the season the best pep talk BYU coaches could give their football players would be in the form of a sign in the locker room saying "Remember."<i>Remember</i>what you have been taught.<i>Remember</i>it takes total individual commitment to the team effort to make a team work.<i>Remember</i>self-pride and self-discipline.<i>Remember</i>no team is better than the performers who comprise it.<i>Remember</i>no player is worth much who thinks he is more important than the team.<i>Remember</i>you won't maintain a high ranking if you don't remember.<i>Remember</i>words of praise and high ratings are damaging if they dull your memory.<i>Remember</i>I am to be a class person on a class team.<br><br>"Remember" is defined as "To retain in the mind and keep carefully in memory." For our purposes today, "rank" is defined as the degree of worth or excellence compared with others in the same category.<br><br>I believe the best-educated student or faculty member is the person who learns much, shares much, and remembers to implement the worthy in to his life.<br><h2><b>Teachings to Remember</b></h2><br>During the recent October general conference, all of us were encouraged to read and reread the Book of Mormon. Perhaps additional worthy counsel could be, as you read, train yourself to remember the words and feelings experienced.<br><br>In reading the book of Helaman recently, I was greatly impressed with Helaman's emphasis in talking to his sons Nephi and Lehi about the importance of<i>remembering.</i>The people of his time had success when they remembered his teachings. They failed when they forgot.<br><br><i>Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i>[Helaman 5:6]<br><br>Helaman gave his sons the names of Nephi and Lehi so they would remember their first parents who came out of Jerusalem. Remember and honor their great names, he pleaded. Remember them because they were good, he emphasized. Helaman's sons gained strength and high rating as they remembered.<br><br>Teachers do students a great favor when they not only encourage them to study, but to retain and remember. Only when we remember and apply the worthy are we truly educated. An important part of true education is remembering people whose conduct helps us to do better. They are a light on dark days. They give us direction when life's paths become cluttered.<br><h2><b>Friends to Remember</b></h2><br>With this in mind, let me share five friends who rank very high with me. I will be most pleased if you will remember them and what they teach us. Three of them are on this campus. One is affiliated with another college campus forty miles or so to the north. Three will not be identified for privacy reasons. The fourth's conduct has been a constant example of stability even before the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in this last dispensation. Obviously they are not ranked in any order.<br><h2><b>Act Instead of React</b></h2><br>Mary Jones, not her real name, is a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is now a returned missionary. I first met her in the mission field after she had served just three months. She was a convert of less than a year. After the usual "I'm pleased to meet you," I said, "How are things going?"<br><br>She said, "Pretty well." Now, when missionaries tell me things are going pretty well, I know they are not going very well.<br><br>I said, "Is there something I can help you with?" She answered, "Oh no, everything is going pretty well."<br><br>I said, "Tell me what is keeping it from going very well."<br><br>She said, with her chin quivering, and responding from my insistence, "Well, I've been in the mission field three months. I've been a member of the Church for one year. During the three months I have been in the mission field I have not had one letter from anyone. When I joined the Church my parents disowned me. They want nothing to do with me. Elder Ashton, what can I do?"<br><br>The only thing I could think to suggest to her at that time was, "Even though your parents have disowned you and won't write to you, do me a favor and write them every week. Write without fail; write without response; write without feelings."<br><br>She is home from her mission attending school here and doing very well. Just the other day she greeted me and said, "Elder Ashton, I want you to know that my Mom and Dad are writing to me."<br><br><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose . . . the way of eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 10:23]<br><br>This Mary Jones will continue to improve her personal rating as she remembers to act and not react.<br><h2><b>The Lord Loves Men and Women of Integrity</b></h2><br>Second is Hyrum Smith, the older brother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, faithful all his days. I like to study and read about Hyrum Smith because he rated very high with his Heavenly Father. We have an opportunity to be ranked high in the kingdom of God and on earth if we will do the same. Simply stated in Doctrine and Covenants 124:<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:15]<br><br>The Lord loves men and women of integrity. The Lord is pleased with those who love that which is right.<br><br>In football terms, Joseph Smith was a captain and quarterback. Hyrum was strong on defense.<br><br>It is significant that at the time of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, Hyrum, this great defender, this tremendous friend of the Savior, was shot first and fell, calmly saying: "I am a dead man!"<br><br>Let us remember why Hyrum ranks high. He remembered to love that which is right. He loved the right, and his brother more than life itself.<br><h2><b>Go Forward Humbly</b></h2><br>Third is Mary Smith, not her real name. She is also a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is on campus today a little older than most of you. Her education was delayed while she and her widowed mother financed a brother and son through the mission field and this institution.<br><br>Maybe her delay will limit her chances for the pleasures of courtship and marriage. She's the kind of a gal I like to remember because she is willing to put others first and take her chances as she walks uprightly before her Heavenly Father with priorities that are firm and with goals that are lofty. Humbly she goes forward--not passively, but humbly. I would like to include here a statement from Alma 38:14.<br><br><i>Do not say:</i>O<i>God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say:</i>O<i>Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy--yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</i><br><br>I would like to say in passing that Mary is one of the most selfless people I can remember.<br><h2><b>Remember to Take Courage</b></h2><br>Let's identify number four as Harry, another person I will always remember and want to. Last week I went to the hospital to visit my friend Harry. He is slowly recovering from heart surgery that involved five bypasses. Despite great discomfort and distress physically, his attitude is excellent. During our visit he reached through sheets and tubes, took my hand and said, "Marv, say a prayer for me, will you please?" While I prayed he strongly gripped my hand. His grip was more than strong. It was powerful. Why?<br><br>In normal life Harry walks with his hands and arms. He'd been confined to a wheelchair for dozens of years. His mobility is determined by his hands and his friends. Harry and his wife, Margaret, will always be remembered by me as two of my best friends. Every time I talk to them I get a new lift from life. I remember him when I need courage. I remember him when I'm inclined to be discouraged.<br><br>I wasn't going to identify Harry, but I think I will. He's the head tennis coach at the University of Utah. His teams have won enough WAC tennis championships to make other coaches think about coaching from a wheelchair.<br><h2><b>Build Your Foundation</b></h2><br>President Jeffrey R. Holland ranks very high on my rating list because:<br><br>1. He<i>remembers</i>to promote excellence in every academic department of BYU, within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. He<i>remembers</i>to enforce lofty standards of conduct for all on the campus so they may develop self-discipline, self-respect, and self-reliance. (Some of you may resist and resent, but I promise you as you mature you'll remember it was for your best good.)<br><br>3. He<i>remembers</i>to listen and counsel without prejudice even when he doesn't have time.<br><br>4. He<i>remembers</i>to administer with love and purpose when some would provoke him to anger.<br><br>5. He<i>remembers</i>when disappointments and discouragements surface to choose hope over despair.<br><br>6. He<i>remembers</i>the importance of smiling particularly on days when it would be easier to cry.<br><br>7. He<i>remembers</i>to love and court his wife and sweetheart, Pat, with sincere affection and respect on a steady basis.<br><br>8. He<i>remembers</i>the importance of taking time to be a good father. Family members Matt, Mary, and Duffy are not just children on the squad. They are the heart of the team! And President Holland and Pat remember to take the time to tell them so.<br><br>9. He<i>remembers</i>that when he is my doubles partner in tennis he has to do most of the work.<br><br>10. He<i>remembers</i>to share his strong personal testimony in words similar to those spoken by Helaman:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><h2><b>A Nameless Friend</b></h2><br>Let me share with you one more friend. We don't even know his name. Nevertheless I would have us all remember him.<br><br><i>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</i><br><br><i>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</i><br><br><i>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</i><br><br><i>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion in him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i><br><br><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i><br><br><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i><br><br><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i>[Luke 10:25–37]<br><br>Oh, how powerful in the processes of learning are good lives! The Good Samaritan--we don't even know his name, but what a lesson, what an example.<br><br>I would humbly ask all within the sound of my voice to do me a special favor. Put a sign on your wall, on your desk, or fasten one to your mirror. Just let it have one word. The word is "Remember." I promise you without any hesitation it can help in your ranking with yourself and God.<br><br><i>Remember</i>BYU football players who get knocked down, but won't stay there.<br><br><i>Remember</i>the Savior. He is Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, our Redeemer, our advocate with the Father.<br><br><i>Remember</i>he said, among other great truths, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:11).<br><br><i>Remember</i>the worth of souls is great in the sight of the Lord. "For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more" (Jeremiah 31:34). I hope you believe that. That is the kind of a Savior I believe in. If we repent, if we remember him, the things that we have done will not be remembered by him.<br><br><i>Remember</i>God lives.<i>Remember</i>God loves you.<i>Remember</i>to pray to him frequently.<i>Remember</i>that as his children you are special.<br><br>What is the reward for those who rank high with the Lord?<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>What is BYU's ranking? What is your personal ranking? I thank God we have the right and responsibility to determine that ourselves.<br><br><i>Remember,</i>O<i>remember,</i>the Church of Jesus Christ is true. Remember with God's help we can know and share good cheer and happiness now and in all the days ahead. Today is a new beginning. Today is a new opportunity. I bear my testimony and share my witness that one of the greatest values and strengths in my life is not only to read and know the Savior, but to remember what he taught and remember who he is. I leave you this my testimony and my blessings in the worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>nk You of Thanksgiving? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago a close friend wrote a provocative little book that she entitled<i>What Think You of Christmas?</i>With all due credit to my friend, I'd like to pose the question to you: "What think you of Thanksgiving?"<br><br>Is Thanksgiving celebrated in your home as a significant religious holiday, or is it a day filled with food, football, and plans to begin really serious Christmas shopping?<br><br>It is symptomatic of our time that Thanksgiving has lost much of its spiritual flavor. The same pagan attitudes and pressures that have led many to substitute Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny for our Savior at Christmas and Easter celebrations have had a profound effect on our Thanksgiving observances. Many of our observances have become celebrations of consumption rather than spiritual feasts of love, gratitude, and sharing. Somehow we have lost the custom of sharing the blessings of God's providence with those who are in need.<br><br>It hasn't always been so<i>.</i>The first community Thanksgiving was celebrated by our Pilgrim forefathers at Plymouth in the fall of 1621. Theirs was a celebration of gratitude to a Heavenly Father who had sent a bounteous harvest to that beleaguered little colony. Almost half of Plymouth's original 101 settlers had died during the severe winter of 1620–21. Those who survived that first winter struggled to understand the vagaries of farming in the new land. Most of the Plymouth Pilgrims had been merchants and artisans in England, and they were woefully unprepared to live off the land. They had little seed and had to depend upon corn kernels and other unfamiliar seed left behind by the Indians. Yet their very lives depended upon reaping a harvest sufficient to see them through another winter. As the bounteous harvest was gathered in the storehouses in the fall of 1621, a grateful and relieved Governor Bradford proclaimed a three-day period of fasting and celebration. That celebration was at least partially borrowed from the admonition found in Leviticus that provides: "When ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord . . . and ye shall rejoice before the Lord, your God" (Leviticus 23:39–40).<br><br>That first feast and many subsequent celebrations of Thanksgiving focused upon man's relationship with his Heavenly Father. Our forefathers understood well their dependence on God. George Washington, in his proclamation establishing the 1789 Thanksgiving celebration, said in part,<br><br><i>Whereas, it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor.</i>. .<i>that we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks for his kind care and protection of the people of this country.</i>[<i>The Writings of George Washington from the Original Main Source, 1745–1799</i>, vol. 30 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1939), pp. 427–28]<br><br>King Benjamin clearly taught the sacred origin of Thanksgiving when he proclaimed unto his people:<br><br><i>O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another.</i>. . .<i>I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i>[Mosiah 2:19–21]<br><br>Regrettably, with prosperity came false and foolish notions. People who once rendered thankful praise to their God soon came to praise their own industry and intellect. Reverend Adam Reid, in celebrating Thanksgiving in 1840, prophetically observed:<br><br><i>And yet it is difficult to tell how long this revered custom</i>[of Thanksgiving]<i>shall be permitted to prevail; for in spite of all that is said about the.march of intellect and the enlightenment of the age, the temper of the times is rash and revolutionary. There is a spirit of infidel independence and reckless radicalism widely at work, which spurns at every sacred restraint.</i>[<i>Principles of National Prosperity: A Discourse Delivered at Salisbury, Conn., on the Day of the Annual Thanksgiving, Nov. 19th, 1840,</i>(Hartford: Elihu Geer, 1841), pp. 6–7]<br><br>Even the most cursory reading of the Book of Mormon should give all of us reason to pause and consider. The circumstances and attitudes described by Reverend Reid were repeated time after time as succeeding generations became prosperous and inevitably estranged from their God. The significance of Thanksgiving goes far beyond the legal holiday. Thanksgiving is the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The proper observance of the holiday places us in proper relationship with our Heavenly Father. It acknowledges our dependence upon him and our responsibility for one another.<br><br>I would hope that as we make plans for our Thanksgiving celebration we would contemplate the great blessings we enjoy. As we contemplate our blessings, thought should be given as to how we can share a portion of our material blessings with those who have so little--for it is through sharing with our brothers and sisters that we most eloquently express our thanksgiving to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Our task today is to reconnect to the sacred principles of the past--to proclaim with joyful hearts and voices that we are the literal children of God, that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth, that through the atonement of Jesus Christ we can enjoy eternal life, that we are led by a mighty prophet of God, that we live in a blessed land of promise, that we share together as brothers and sisters the blessings and vicissitudes of mortal life.<br><br>May we as a people proclaim these truths with thankful voices and hearts, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>John B. Stohlton was the assistant executive vice president of BYU when this devotional address was given on 20 November 1984.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
I have sought for the help of the Lord in selecting a subject and also for help in delivering that subject. My desire to do well is not a selfish one. I'm concerned that if I do not do well, it might reflect adversely upon Religious Education, and I would not want that to happen. Or it might appear that the subject matter is not important, and I would not want to convey that impression either. So, for the sake of the message and the reputation of this university, and out of consideration for your time, I pray for a facility of expression, that I will be helped by the Holy Spirit. I pray also that the same Spirit will carry this message into your hearts so that where I might lack, the Spirit will generously supply. For what Isay today, Ialone am responsible, although I believe what I am going to say is true.<br><br>I am particularly grateful for the help Ireceived from the topical guide in the LDS edition of the Bible and also for the index in the new edition of the triple combination, which helped me find the references I wanted more quickly.<br><h2><b>The Scriptures Are Witnesses of Christ</b></h2><br>This is a happy time of year. We become excited about Christmas, we sing, we get the spirit of giving, we talk, and we think about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and about his birth into mortality. He was born in a manger--it really was a holy night. He is the son of God the Father and of Mary. Prophets testified of his coming, angels sang, shepherds rejoiced, stars shone, wise men came, Herod worried. The Father smiled upon that birth, and the devil did everything he could to destroy that child after he was born. Eternity was intensely interested in what went on that day.<br><br>The record of the birth of Jesus is given in the New Testament, and we are more or less familiar with the story. The New Testament isawitness for Jesus Christ. But the Book of Mormon is also a witness for and a testament of Jesus Christ, and it gives us additional insights and concepts about<i>why</i>the birth of Jesus took place and<i>why</i>it was so important. There is no other book in all this world that tells us as clearly about the mission of Jesus Christ as does the Book of Mormon. Whereas the Bible tells us<i>what</i>happened, the Book of Mormon and other latter-day scriptures tell us<i>why</i>it happened. The Bible writers also knew why, but the Bible has not come to us in its original purity and clarity, and thus the Lord has brought forth these other records in plain terms so that we might not wander in darkness and oblivion. The Lord wants us to know about the greatest truths in the history ofmankind.<br><br>A number of years ago, when the first astronauts landed on the moon, the president of the United States said it was "the greatest week in history." The Reverend Billy Graham corrected him and said, "No, the greatest week in history was the week in which Jesus died and rose from the grave."<br><br>And I thought to myself, "The Reverend Graham was correct--that time."<br><br>I'd like to read some basic scriptures, first from the Doctrine and Covenants. We do not ordinarily think of this scripture in connection with Christmas, but I would like to read it to you, and I think you will see before we get through that it does have a connection.<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>You notice that the scripture said those laws were laid down before the world was created.<br><br>Now I have been impressed with many things in the Book of Mormon. I will read a comment from Nephi:<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given, and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.</i><br><br><i>And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which he hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his grace, and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.</i><br><br><i>And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish.</i>[2 Nephi 11:4–6]<br><br>It was just that important: If Christ did not come, all men would perish.<br><br>Now, in a missionary situation, Alma says:<br><br><i>Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God, and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</i><br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</i><br><br><i>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</i>[Alma 12:22–24]<br><br>And from Alma 22:13–14, another missionary situation:<br><br><i>And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</i><br><br><i>And since man had fallen be could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.</i><br><h2><b>Two Kinds of Death Were Introduced byAdam</b></h2><br>There is passage after passage in the Bookof Mormon and in other scriptures indicating that the fall of Adam brought death upon mankind, two kinds of death: the death of the body, which is the death we are familiar with in relation to mortuaries and funerals and undertakers, and then the death of the spirit, which means a separation from things of righteousness or an alienation from the things of God. Because of the fall of Adam, first Adam and then all of his posterity suffered both of these deaths. If there were no atonement made by someone who was not subject to those deaths--if there were no atonement made by Jesus Christ--then mankind would everlastingly remain subject to those two deaths and could not redeem himself.<br><br>And so it was absolutely critical that the Lord come into the world and work out an atonement.<br><br>I will read a passage from Nephi's younger brother Jacob. Jacob is the great doctrinal preacher of the Book of Mormon. He is the great theologian. It would be hard to measure one prophet against another, but some have gifts in one direction and others have gifts in another, and Jacob, whom I will now quote, had a great insight and a great facility of expression to explain the atonement.<br><br><i>O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it.</i><br><br><i>And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.</i><br><br><i>And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.</i>[2 Nephi 9:20–22]<br><br>Now also from this same Jacob, in this same chapter, but a little earlier, verses 6–10:<br><br><i>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration....</i><br><br>Now the first judgment which came upon man was "thou shalt surely die." It involved both of those deaths, the death of the body and the death as to things pertaining to righteousness, which the scriptures call spiritual death.<br><br><i>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more</i>[that is, if there were no resurrection of the body]<i>our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</i><br><br><i>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself. . . .</i><br><br><i>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</i>[2 Nephi 9:6–10]<br><h2><b>"I Am Come That They Might Have Life"</b></h2><br>I have noticed that quite often, when we talk about our Savior, we talk about the resurrection, but we rarely talk about what would have been our circumstances if there had been no atonement by Jesus. I remember a discussion in a class many years ago when I was a teenager, when one of the students asked the teacher--this was not here at BYU--what would have become of our<i>spirits</i>if there had been no redemption by Jesus.<br><br>He said, "Well, I do not know what would have happened to our spirits, but I give it as my guess that, if there were no atonement by Jesus, we would still go on to whatever degree of glory we had merited, but we would have to go there as spirits without bodies because Jesus brought to pass the resurrection, and if there were no resurrection we would have no bodies."<br><br>None of us in the class knew enough about the gospel to know whether that was the right answer or not. But sometime later, on my mission, I was reading 2 Nephi and I realized that if Jacob had been in that meeting that day he would have said, "Now wait a minute. This is what the atonement of Jesus does for us. It not only brings the body forth from the grave, but it redeems the spirit from what otherwise would have been an endless, miserable condition with the devil." Or, to say it in other words, every man, woman, and child, everybody who belongs to the family of Adam, would have become sons of perdition had there been no atonement by Jesus Christ. Jacob, knowing that and having commented upon it, then says these words--which we have already read but need to read again:<br><br><i>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</i>[2 Nephi 9:10]<br><br>And so, when we sing and think and read and talk and meditate upon the coming of the Son of God into the world, we need to think interms of what he did for mankind, all mankind, both as to the resurrection of the body and in bringing them forth out of what would have been a most miserable and gloomy existence. Jesus said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). You see that when we understand the alternative, it gives altogether new meaning, and additional meaning, to his words.<br><br>There are so many passages, we could not read them all right now. I will read from Luke, who tells about Jesus going into the Garden of Gethsemane and there working out an atonement for all mankind:<br><br><i>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</i><br><br><i>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</i><br><br><i>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down and prayed,</i><br><br><i>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</i><br><br><i>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</i><br><br><i>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</i><br><br><i>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</i><br><br><i>And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</i>[Luke 22:39–46]<br><br>It was in Gethsemane, on the slopes of the Mount of Olives, that Jesus made his perfect atonement by the shedding of his blood--more so than on the cross. We have a corroboration of that concept in the Doctrine and Covenants in section 19:16–20:<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have tasted at the time Iwithdrew my Spirit.</i><br><br>All of us have at some time or another done something that caused the Spirit to leave us; we felt low, we felt down, we felt alone. And yet we were losing the Spirit only because of something we had done individually. But then there is Jesus, who had the Holy Ghost all the days of his life (and the Holy Ghost is the Comforter)--he had had the help of the Holy Ghost ever since birth. At every trial and at every endeavor and every temptation, he had had the strength of the Holy Ghost to be with him.<br><br>But as he went into the Garden of Gethsemane and began to take upon him our sins, the Father withdrew the Spirit from him, and he worked out the atonement alone (see<i>JD</i>3 :205–6). He refers to that in the verses we just read where he indicated that it was a hard thing to bear, and then he said, "You tasted it in the smallest, yea, in the least degree at the time I withdrew my Spirit from you." Jesus committed no sins, but he did carry upon himself our sins, as indicated in the scripture that says "Ihave trodden the wine-press alone" (D&amp;amp;C 133:50). It appears that the Father withdrew the Spirit at that time so Jesus might tread the winepress alone. Jesus alone is our redeemer and savior.<br><br>In John 3:16–17 we read:<br><br><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in himshould not perish, but have everlasting life.</i><br><br><i>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through himmight be saved.</i><br><br>The Bible makes this great statement and says that without the Savior we would perish. Paul discusses these things in 1 Corinthians and in Romans, but not as clearly as we would like. It takes the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price to explain more fully why we would have perished. We would have perished because of the fall of Adam; we being unable to save ourselves either from his fall or our own sins.<br><h2><b>Premortal Life Is the Key to the Mission of Christ</b></h2><br>We often talk about the War in Heaven and what took place there. We understand that the Savior was selected in that premortal life as ourRedeemer. We knew him there. Our first acquaintance with Jesus began many thousands of years before we were ever born into mortality. When we talk about our relationship to the Savior and our redemption, we must begin with our premortal life.<br><br>I think we often miss the real issue of the contention in the spirit world that eventually led to the War in Heaven. We talk about it as though Lucifer was going to force everybody to obey. He said, "I will save them all," and we interpret that as meaning that he was going to have forced obedience.<br><br>It has seemed strange to me that a third of all the spirits that could have been born into this world would have favored a plan that would cause them to have forced obedience. Most of us do not like to be forced. As I see it, the real issue was not so much one of force as it was that Lucifer said he would<i>guarantee</i>their salvation. He promised salvation without excellence, without effort, without hard work, without individual responsibility. That is the lie he promulgated in the pre-earth councils.<br><br>That so-called shortcut to salvation captivated many gullible and lazy spirits. They wanted something for nothing. We have certain aspects of that in our life today where something is offered for nothing (a free lunch we sometimes call it), with certain kinds of subsidies that promise to guarantee the reward without the effort. On that basis, Lucifer led away many spirits, but individual progress does not come that way.<br><br>Only by serious and strenuous exertion dowe improve in character and in spiritual growth. In our society we still come in contact with many who are influenced by this erroneous philosophy. They think they can achieve salvation and exaltation without a struggle. We are still fighting the War in Heaven with the same participants and the same issues, but we are fighting it on new territory and on a different battleground.<br><br>Having ascertained that the devil's program was one of promising excellence without effort, we can better appreciate the real struggle that Jesus had, that we all have, to do our best in this world to overcome our weaknesses and to obtain redemption from the effects of mortality. It is in view of the premortal life and the issues that were fought in the War in Heaven that everything else in the ministry of Jesus and in the gospel must be understood.<br><br>If we overlook premortal life, then we will never get the clear perspective necessary to understand the gospel in mortality. But when we do have that concept, and talk about Christmas--the night Christ was born, the star that led the way so that later the wise men might find him, the angels who came and spoke to the shepherds--and when we find the enthusiasm of the prophets in predicting and prophesying the coming of the Savior, we begin to see why they were so excited. This was an absolutely essential event in the history of mankind.<br><br>Jesus was the divinely appointed Beloved Son of God the Father, and he was born of Mary into mortality. In many ways, in the incidentals like eating and talking and the wearing of clothes, he was like other men. But in parentage, being sired by the Eternal Father himself, he was very different from all others. It was necessary that he be different from others so that he could make a payment for the transgression of Adam and for everyone's personal, individual sins.<br><br>Every other person who has been born into the world has been born subject to the fall of Adam and therefore subject to death. Only Jesus was able to die but remain undominated by death. Thus, when he chose to die, not having been made subject either by Adam's fall or by any sins of his own, he could shed his blood and give his life as an offering for others. He could also rise from the dead with a perfect, glorified physical body. No one else was able to do that.<br><br>I suppose that many of us, if not all, labored as missionaries for the Savior in the premortal life, going among the spirits to persuade others to choose the Savior, and following him in preparing for earth life. We now have a veil of forgetfulness drawn over our minds, and we do not remember the details of those events; yet the spiritual capacity that we developed in the pre-earth life has come with us into mortality, and when we hear the gospel preached it strikes a familiar note. We are learning again principles we once knew; that capacity responds to every true doctrine that is taught to us when it is properly stated. Our main business in this world is to continue that spiritual development we started so long ago, and this we will do by obedience to the gospel.<br><h2><b>Jesus Is the Only True Redeemer</b></h2><br>Jesus said about himself, "I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light, the Resurrection. Iam the Law. I am the Lawgiver. I am the Standard, the Door, the Savior, the Shepherd, the Redeemer, the Example, the Master, the Advocate. I am your Judge. I am your Friend. Iam your Lord. I am your God. And I am the only way that you can be redeemed."<br><br>Paul wrote to the Philippians about Jesus: "God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name" (Philippians 2:9).<br><br>As I have reflected upon the importance and the seriousness of all of this and how quickly we complain when something goes wrong, and how often we feel we have been wronged, I remember the Lord has enjoined us to be patient, to be full of love, to be long-suffering, to be forgiving, and to pattern our lives after him.<br><br>We started this devotional today by quoting from the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord said that every blessing we obtain in this life is by obedience to a law and a plan that was worked out before the foundations of the world. We then read a statement from Nephi, where he said he delighted in proving to his people the importance of the coming of Christ and that, save Christ should come, there would be a dearth and a gloom come upon all mankind.<br><br>Now a word from Alma:<br><br><i>Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.</i><br><br><i>And</i>[the gospel is]<i>made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored. ...</i>[Alma 13:22–23]<br><br>Not to recognize and appreciate the atonement is the greatest of all ingratitude; to ignore Christ is the height of folly; to obey him is the greatest happiness. The greatest display of wisdom that we can demonstrate on this earth is to follow the Lord and to keep his commandments.<br><br>If we take away from the plan of salvation the doctrine of the fall of Adam and the doctrine of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ and the concept of the pre-earth life, then we make of the gospel simply a system of ethics. And that will not do. The gospel is ethical, but it is so much more than that. I rejoice with you in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. I am so glad he came.<br><br>We see that our association with him is not optional, it is not casual--it is absolutely critical and necessary. He has honored us by letting us bear his name--for all of us when we are baptized take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. That is an honor, a privilege. He calls us servants until we reach a certain level of faithfulness, and then he calls us friends. The promise is that we can become joint heirs with Jesus in all that the Father has.<br><br>As we move in the next few days toward the day on which we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, let us all remember and mingle our testimonies with those of the prophets that Jesus Christ, our Elder Brother, the Son of God, is our Leader, our Example, and our Savior. Ibear testimony that I know those doctrines which I have taught to you this day are true, and I pray that the Spirit of the Lord might carry that feeling into your hearts, that, as we read the Christmas story, we might realize not only<i>what</i>happened, but<i>why</i>it happened--and then measure our favored condition today. I say this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert J.
