<h1>eason and Faith - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a pleasure to be with you as we celebrate the onset of a new year together. This is a wonderful time in our BYU history, in the history of the Church, and even the history of the world. Yes, we are faced with many problems, challenges, and disappointments in our personal and collective lives, and yet with all of the things we might wish were different, there is much evidence that these are the "best of times."<br><br>A couple of months ago there was an interesting article in the <i>Deseret Morning News</i> that had been reprinted from the <i>Washington Post.</i> It was authored by the Reverend John I. Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, and by his provost, Thomas Burish ("Reason and Faith at Harvard," <i>Washington Post,</i> 23 October 2006, A21). Their article began with this question: "What should a properly educated college graduate of the early 21st century know?"<br><br>I immediately and reflexively asked myself the question "What should a properly educated <i>LDS</i> college graduate of the early 21st century know?" And, more specifically, "What should a properly educated and motivated Latter-day Saint <i>BYU</i> graduate of our day know?"<br><br>I shall return to my questions in a few moments. Let me first address the query of our friends from Notre Dame.<br><br>They noted that a task force on general education at Harvard University had recently proposed an answer to their question by stating that, among other things, such a graduate should know "the role of religion in contemporary, historical, or future events--personal, cultural, national, or international." To meet this goal, the Harvard committee recommended that every Harvard student be required to take at least one course in the area that the committee described as "Reason and Faith."<br><br>My understanding is that this recommendation has been suggested only and has not been enacted. It likely will never be, and Jenkins and Burish acknowledge this.<br><br>As reported by the Notre Dame leaders, the Harvard committee found that today's college students struggle with an academic environment that they describe as "profoundly secular." Most would agree with this assessment of Harvard University and perhaps most American institutions of higher education. I doubt our friends at Notre Dame consider that description to be completely accurate of their campus, and I know of no one, thank heaven, who would suggest that to be the case at BYU.<br><br>Father Jenkins and Dr. Burish gave a historical perspective that reminds us that secular preeminence has not always been the case at Harvard and other great universities. In fact, most have their roots in and early support from various religious communities. "For centuries," Jenkins and Burish report, "scholars, scientists and artists agreed that convictions of faith were wholly compatible with the highest levels of reasoning, inquiry and creativity."<br><br>Sadly, we know that is no longer the case at many places. On the other hand, we gladly proclaim our assertion that faith and reason are both vibrant and integrated at Brigham Young University. For this we are profoundly grateful.<br><br>Please make no mistake: I see no effort nor momentum to make BYU's approach to learning the academic model for emulation broadly across this country or any other. What we do see is something of an awakening to the reality that both reason and faith have a place in the academy and that, for many, this is not only true but also appropriate. It increasingly seems to be recognized that religion, in spite of many detractors and critics, is clearly a fact of 21st-century life.<br><br>According to Harvard University's own data, over 90 percent of entering Harvard students discuss religion and more than 70 percent attend religious services at least some of the time. The Harvard task force observes that when students get to college, they<br><br><i>often struggle--sometimes for the first time in their lives--to sort out the relationship between their own beliefs and practices, the different beliefs and practices of fellow students, and the profoundly secular and intellectual world of the academy itself.</i> [<i>Preliminary Report: Task Force on General Education</i> (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences, October 2006), 18; www.fas.harvard.edu/~secfas/Gen_Ed_Prelim_Report.pdf]<br><br>Without being unduly critical, I note that this observation from Cambridge, Massachusetts, gives added cogency to the BYU Mission and Aims statements.<br><br>Please be certain that the folks at Harvard are not talking about framing secular learning in an environment of sustaining faith such as we strive to achieve at BYU. Let me return again to the words of the Harvard Task Force:<br><br><i>Harvard is no longer an institution with a religious mission, but religion is a fact that Harvard's graduates will confront in their lives both in and after college. We therefore require students to take one course in a category entitled Reason and Faith. Let us be clear</i> [the committee continues]. <i>Courses in Reason and Faith are not religious apologetics. They are courses that examine the interplay between religion and various aspects of . . . culture and society.</i> [<i>Preliminary Report,</i> 19]<br><br>A number of other recent, credible academic studies have reached similarly interesting and somewhat surprising conclusions in contrast to those that subscribe to the "God is dead" school of thinking first rampant in higher education circles decades ago and persisting with some dominance in many American universities today.<br><br>The Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA is currently conducting a broad-reaching study of the spiritual life of more than 112,000 American college students representing 236 U.S. institutions. The survey so far has found that 79 percent professed a belief in God, 69 percent claimed to pray, and about three-fourths reported attending religious services at least some of the time ("Reason and Faith at Harvard"; also <i>The Spiritual Life of College Students: A National Study of College Students' Search for Meaning and Purpose</i> [Los Angeles: UCLA Higher Education Research Institute, 2004–05], 4; http://spirituality.ucla.edu/spirituality/reports/FINAL%20REPORT.pdf).<br><br>Baylor University also recently conducted a national study entitled "The Values and Beliefs of the American Public." They estimate that 85 to 90 percent of Americans "believe in God," over two-thirds pray at least weekly, and half attend church monthly (<i>American Piety in the 21st Century: New Insights to the Depth and Complexity of Religion in the U.S.</i> [Waco, Texas: Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion, September 2006], 4; www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/33304.pdf).<br><br>All of these studies and some others confirm the assertion that many people have strongly held religious and spiritual values. While I personally might not be quite as optimistic as Sir John Marks Templeton, the 1998 recipient of a BYU honorary doctorate and head of the Templeton Foundation, which financed many of the aforementioned studies, his observation does deserve careful consideration:<br><br><i>Of all the encouraging trends that mark the closing years of the twentieth century, none is more heartening or more important than the remarkable spread of spiritual values.</i> [John M. Templeton, <i>Is Progress Speeding Up?: Our Multiplying Multitudes of Blessings</i> (Philadelphia: Templeton Foundation Press, 1997), 243]<br><br>While we might find all of these observations to be interesting and even comforting, you might well ask, "What does this have to do with us?" I believe a great deal. While we subscribe to, and occasionally glory in, the assertion of Peter that we are "a peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9), there is so much that we have in common with all of Heavenly Father's children.<br><br>I return to the question posed at the outset: "What should a properly educated Latter-day Saint BYU graduate of the early 21st century know?" The answer is both in what we share and in what we have to share.<br><br>First, I would assert that the properly educated Latter-day Saint BYU graduate should know what any properly educated college or university graduate should know. Implicit in this assertion is that if we ask more of the BYU graduate in some area, we do not excuse corresponding or compensatory deficits in other areas of what constitutes a proper education. In fact, we aspire explicitly to have our graduates be in the first rank of those deeply and broadly educated in all the dimensions that the academy would deem to be both desirable and essential. You will know that our Aims and Mission statements do not equivocate on this matter.<br><br>Second, Brigham Young University and its supporting trustees have the expectation that our Latter-day Saint graduates will also have a deep and profound understanding of and faith in some fundamentals and principles related to our Church and its doctrines. Let me refer to the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., given in 1938 in his "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," with which, hopefully, many of you students and all of the faculty are familiar:<br><br><i>In all this there are for the Church and for each and all of its members, two prime things which may not be overlooked, forgotten, shaded, or discarded:</i><br><br><i>First: That Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, the Creator of the world, the Lamb of God, the Sacrifice for the sins of the world, the Atoner for Adam's transgression; that He was crucified; that His spirit left His body; that He died; that He was laid away in the tomb; that on the third day His spirit was reunited with His body, which again became a living being; that He was raised from the tomb a resurrected being, a perfect Being, the First Fruits of the Resurrection; that He later ascended to the Father; and that because of His death and by and through His resurrection every man born into the world since the beginning will be likewise literally resurrected. This doctrine is as old as the world. Job declared: "And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold, and not another." (Job 19:26, 27.)</i><br><br><i>The resurrected body is a body of flesh and bones and spirit, and Job was uttering a great and everlasting truth. These positive facts, and all other facts necessarily implied therein, must all be honestly believed, in full faith, by every member of the Church.</i><br><br><i>The second of the two things to which we must all give full faith is: That the Father and the Son actually and in truth and very deed appeared to the Prophet Joseph in a vision in the woods; that other heavenly visions followed to Joseph and to others; that the Gospel and the holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God were in truth and fact restored to the earth from which they were lost by the apostasy of the Primitive Church; that the Lord again set up His Church, through the agency of Joseph Smith; that the Book of Mormon is just what it professes to be; that to the Prophet came numerous revelations for the guidance, upbuilding, organization, and encouragement of the Church and its members; that the Prophet's successors, likewise called of God, have received revelations as the needs of the Church have required, and that they will continue to receive revelations as the Church and its members, living the truth they already have, shall stand in need of more; that this is in truth the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and that its foundation beliefs are the laws and principles laid down in the Articles of Faith. These facts also, and each of them, together with all things necessarily implied therein or flowing therefrom, must stand, unchanged, unmodified, without dilution, excuse, apology, or avoidance; they may not be explained away or submerged. Without these two great beliefs the Church would cease to be the Church.</i> [J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," talk given at Aspen Grove, 8 August 1938]<br><br>In this long quotation from President Clark's foundational address we find an excellent summary of the special or additional things a properly educated Latter-day Saint BYU graduate of the early 21st century should know. I suspect in this regard most of you have already qualified, and I congratulate you. For those who may yet be struggling with any of the dimensions of President Clark's outline, let me suggest that there is no better place than Brigham Young University--together with its student wards, stakes, and other support systems--to find, round out, and qualify for this remarkable knowledge.<br><br>As President Spencer W. Kimball taught when he asked Sister Naomi W. Randall to change one word in her wonderful hymn of testimony, "I Am a Child of God" (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 301), more is required of us than just knowing, as vital as knowledge itself is. We must also "do."<br><br>What is it that we must do? All of us--students, faculty, staff, and administration--are regularly reminded that as we come to BYU, we "enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>We, of course, serve in many and diverse ways and should always do so as we search for appropriate means and approaches to do even more and to do it better. One of the ways that we serve is by sharing what we have learned or polished or enhanced during our stay at BYU. Of course this means that if we have trained in education or engineering, nursing or neurosciences, in law or languages, in business or biology, or in any branch of learning available here at BYU, we apply the best and latest principles of these honored professions in the context of our ethical, gospel, and moral understandings. As we attempt to implement the counsel of the broad mandate of the Restoration scriptures, we commit to making a better world by contributing directly to strong families, communities, congregations, companies, and other vital institutions. Listen to these words of the Lord:<br><br><i>Behold, I will hasten my work in its time. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms. . . .</i><br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:73, 77–79, 118]<br><br>There is, however, even more that we can and must do. In addition to keeping the Lord's commandments faithfully, we must, as the Apostle Peter taught, "be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15).<br><br>All of you who have served as missionaries and, hopefully, the rest of us as well know and appreciate that this is a very delicate and sensitive matter. It calls for decorum, tenderness, and tact. It demands great respect for the feelings, faith, traditions, and values of others. It requires understanding that those not of our Church background and culture often will not see things as we might or reach the same conclusions we do about the same observations and data. It mandates great reverence and respect for all individuals as children of God whatever their individual or current circumstances. It is expected that we not only preach the Golden Rule but also practice it. It asks for patience, long-suffering, forgiveness, and humility. Most of all, to have the opportunity to share the reason for our optimism, faith, and hope, we must live our lives with complete authenticity, including having full congruence of our behaviors and actions with the fundamentals we hold dear.<br><br>As we go about contributing in the ways that we have learned to serve while being students at Brigham Young University, we invite the verbal opportunities to share our hope and testimonies. Often it is more important that we can behaviorally bear our witness of these fundamental principles to those who observe and interact with us.<br><br>As I stated at the outset in reporting the interesting data on the feelings of so many college students with respect to reason and faith, I believe in many ways there are more with us than against us (see 2 Kings 6:16) and many "who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (D&amp;amp;C 123:12).<br><br>But it is not only in the outside world where we find these kindred souls. Across our campus are those who come seeking one kind of knowledge and find additional, unexpected light. These individuals not only come from the United States but also from around the world. They may be from California or Alabama, New Hampshire or Texas, from Turkey, Russia, Argentina, or from Sri Lanka, China, or Guatemala.<br><br>Each of their experiences is unique and personal. Yet there are some common themes. These individuals generally have big smiles across their faces. They are happy. They say they have found something of great worth. Listen to these comments:<br><br>"I felt something when I came to BYU. I felt something good like I've never felt before."<br><br>"I didn't grow up believing there is a God, but now I have come to know my Heavenly Father. I know He loves me."<br><br>"I used to think my life didn't have any particular purpose. Now I know my Heavenly Father has a plan for me."<br><br>"People were so kind and friendly. I wanted to know why."<br><br>Sometimes it has been the example of great roommates or a caring faculty or staff member. Sometimes it has been the full-time missionaries. In one case it was the little LDS girl next door who many years ago tried to read the Book of Mormon to a young boy as he jumped on her trampoline.<br><br>The seeds of faith and light are planted, cultivated, nurtured, and grow bathed in the glow of His tender care--the behavioral and verbal testimony examples of Latter-day Saint BYU students and graduates on campus and around the world.<br><br>My prayer and the blessing I invoke upon us at the beginning of another year brimming with potential is that we will reflect regularly on what a properly educated Latter-day Saint BYU graduate of the 21st century will know and do and that we will then continue to get on with the exciting adventure of becoming and helping each other become more authentic examples of such. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 9 January 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>l, Small Voice of the Holy Ghost - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Brigham Young University for the 2007 school year. Hopefully you had a wonderful Christmas holiday as you remembered and honored the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I so enjoy this time of year because it also includes gatherings with those you love--family and friends. These times and others create memories to be remembered and recalled throughout one's lifetime.<br><br>One such memory of mine includes an extended family portrait taken several years ago. Whenever someone who has not seen it before views this portrait, a puzzled look appears on the person's face and this question is usually asked: "Why is there a little boy in the picture holding a blue bucket?"<br><br>To the viewer, this appears to be rather odd in a formal portrait setting, and the individual's curiosity is piqued. This cute little boy in the picture is my nephew, Jeremy. Jeremy is autistic. His parents brought the bucket to the photographer's studio filled with some of his favorite toys. Having a picture taken with so many people is a tedious process, and much confusion can arise. Since Jeremy didn't like to be in crowds or in an unstructured environment, his parents wanted him to have something to entertain him until the time came to take the picture. His security and comfort on this occasion was found in clutching firmly his blue bucket, and he would not let it be taken away from him when the time arrived to pose for the picture--even by his lovingly pleading parents. Thus Jeremy has his bucket in the picture, and our family members smile with love for Jeremy when we view the photograph.<br><br>During the Savior's ministry, He was asked by His disciples this question: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"<sup>1</sup> In response He<br><br><i>called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</i><br><br><i>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The scriptures also teach us that "a little child shall lead them."<sup>3</sup> Jeremy has taught his family many spiritual lessons, and often the family has felt that he at times was more spiritually in tune than they. May I tell you of one of these times that occurred to me when I was taught by this young boy?<br><br>At nine and one-half years of age, Jeremy expressed a desire to be baptized, and so it was arranged to have him baptized at the same time as his younger brother. Jeremy was very excited. As family and friends were waiting in a classroom for their turn to proceed to the font for the baptism to be performed, Jeremy went about greeting everyone with excitement as he repeated to each of us the words "I am going to have the Holy Ghost in me. I am going to be baptized and have the Holy Ghost." My heart was touched as this little boy--who often didn't relate to others in such a way--felt that something very important was to occur in his life that day. He was going to be baptized and then receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and he was pleased. One may wonder how much Jeremy really understood about baptism, the Holy Ghost, Jesus, and Heavenly Father. However, his parents have had experiences and conversations with Jeremy that testify that he has had spiritual lessons through the Holy Ghost in the ensuing years.<br><br>Those of you here today who have been baptized and confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been given by the laying on of hands by one in authority one of the greatest gifts you can enjoy on earth, the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, if you but heed the promptings of that Spirit and keep yourselves worthy of its presence. Are you as excited about it as was a little nine-and-one-half-year-old boy? How often do you express gratitude to your Heavenly Father for the great privilege it is for you to have the companionship of one of the members of the Godhead? Do you seek to use this blessing in your lives each and every day?<br><br>During the weeks and months ahead in this new school year, you will have many opportunities to make choices and decisions based on your beliefs, values, and desires that will define your integrity, worth, decency, honor, and spirituality. You are blessed with the scriptures; a prophet of the Lord, President Gordon B. Hinckley; Apostles; and righteous models in your families and associates who can provide teachings and examples of true conduct in your lives. Many wonderful blessings await you when you are faithful and serve others and the Lord.<br><br>However, sometimes you will run into stumbling blocks in your path. There may be difficult decisions to make, temptations that may seem overwhelming, crises in your faith and feelings of personal worth, or times of sorrow where you find it difficult to find solace. Sometimes you may feel confused and alone in your struggles. At times such as these there is the need for inspiration, understanding, and guidance to assist you as you forge onward in your pursuits.<br><br>As our Savior approached the conclusion of His ministry on earth, He spoke to His disciples and members of the Church about leaving them. They had often been in the presence of the Savior, and He had guided, taught, and ministered unto them. They sorrowed at the prospect of Him leaving them. They also feared that they would feel alone and distraught without Him. However, He promised:<br><br><i>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. . . .</i><br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Just as the Saints at that time were not left alone, the Holy Ghost can abide with you every hour of the day wherever you may be. It can be your constant companion; however, in order to enjoy the benefits of this wonderful gift, you must be worthy to receive it and thus be able to use it in your lives. The Holy Ghost can be a compass to direct you back to your Heavenly Father.<br><br>In 1847 the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared to Brigham Young in a dream or vision. Brigham Young asked the Prophet if he had a message for the Brethren. The Prophet said:<br><br><i>Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>This is also a message for you today. With this wonderful gift you may know what to do and what not to do to obtain happiness and peace. You can resist temptation, be warned of dangers, and be guided as you make important decisions and solve problems. Every aspect of your lives can be influenced by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer has taught:<br><br><i>You can never make a serious mistake without being warned. You will never take the wrong road or go around the wrong bend or make the wrong decision without you having been warned. That pattern is the pattern of the Latter-day Saint. You were confirmed a member of the Church, and you had conferred upon you the gift of the Holy Ghost to be a guide and a companion to you, to be a comfort to you. The Holy Ghost is a comforter.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>The Holy Ghost can communicate with you if you but seek this communication and are worthy to receive it. Revelation from the Holy Ghost is often described as a "still small voice"<sup>7</sup> and most often comes as words you feel more than hear. How many times have you said, "I had a feeling . . ." If you are in tune with the Spirit, this can be a communication from the Holy Ghost.<br><br>You have been taught by our Church leaders and the scriptures that the Holy Ghost will not dwell with a person who does not obey and keep the commandments of our Heavenly Father. As you take the sacrament each Sunday, you promise to obey the Lord's commandments. In the sacrament prayer you are told by the Lord that you can "always have his Spirit to be with [you]"<sup>8</sup> if you keep this promise. Your hearts and minds will be ready to receive the still, small voice and the whisperings of the Spirit if you are worthy.<br><br>I have always been confounded by the actions of Laman and Lemuel as described in the Book of Mormon. They rebelled against the Lord and their brother Nephi even though they had been spoken to by an angel and heard his voice from time to time. They even attempted to take Nephi's life. Nephi said to them:<br><br><i>Ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>If you are not keeping the Lord's commandments, you will not be able to feel or hear the still, small voice.<br><br>The desire of your hearts, I know, is that you are constantly in tune with the Holy Ghost and have this compass to guide and bless you in every aspect of your lives. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, loves you dearly and wants you to be comforted and guided as you strive to gain strong testimonies of Him and to one day return to His presence. He will give you abundant blessings, and it is through the power of the Holy Ghost that you can receive them if you but strive to serve Him and all your brothers and sisters. It is my prayer that all of us keep our hearts open to receive the promptings of the Spirit and use this sacred gift in our lives, and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>ream and You - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I asked our records department to tell me how many college-age youth we have in the Church. They responded 1,974,001. Good, I thought, I will speak to the <i>one.</i><br><br>You may be here in this congregation or somewhere in any one of 170 countries. You, the one of nearly two million, are in the early morning of your life, while I am in the late evening of mine.<br><br>My college life began at Weber College, then a very small junior college. World War II had just ended. Most of the men in our class were recently returned from military service. We were, by and large, more mature than college students of your day. We had been through the war and carried with us many memories. Some of them we held on to; others we were glad to have fade away. We were more serious and did not enter into fun and games as much as you do. We wanted to get on with our lives and knew that education was the key.<br><br>We took the insignias and labels and sometimes even the buttons off our uniforms, mixed them with odds and ends of civilian clothes, and wore them to school. That was all we had to wear.<br><br>At military training camps, we had been marched from place to place in formation. Often we would sing marching songs. At college, I attended the Institute of Religion classes. We had our own marching songs. I remember one of them:<br><br><i>A root-tee-toot, a root-tee-toot.</i><br><br><i>Oh, we are boys of the institute.</i><br><br><i>We don't smoke, and we don't chew.</i><br><br><i>And we don't go with girls that do.</i><br><br><i>Some folks say we don't have fun.</i><br><br><i>We don't!</i><br><br>Some laughed with us; others laughed at us. Whatever ridicule they intended with their mocking was of no concern to us. We had gained personal testimonies of the gospel. We had decided long since that we would live the gospel and not be ashamed of the Church or the history or any part of it (see Romans 1:16).<br><br>The whole focus of our lives in the military had been on destruction. That is what war is about. We were inspired by the noble virtue of patriotism. To be devoted to destruction without being destroyed yourself spiritually or morally was the test of life.<br><br>I did not serve a mission during those years. Staying close to the Book of Mormon has, I think, made up for that. That witness had come little by little.<br><br>Together, my wife and I made our way through the ordinary challenges of life--getting through school, finding employment, raising a family.<br><br>You too live in a time of war, the spiritual war that will never end. War itself now dominates the affairs of mankind. Your world at war has lost its innocence. There is nothing, however crude or unworthy, that is not deemed acceptable for movies or plays or music or conversation. The world seems to be turned upside down. (See 2 Peter 2:1–22.)<br><br>Formality, respect for authority, dignity, and nobility are mocked. Modesty and neatness yield to slouchiness and shabbiness in dress and grooming. The rules of honesty and integrity and basic morality are now ignored. Conversation is laced with profanity. You see that in art and literature, in drama and entertainment. Instead of being refined, they become coarse. (See 1 Timothy 4:1–3; 2 Timothy 3:1–9.)<br><br>You have decisions almost every day as to whether you will follow those trends. You have many tests ahead.<br><br>As a boy, President Joseph F. Smith, son of Hyrum, came west in 1848 with his widowed mother. He was called as a missionary to Hawaii when he was 15 years of age. He spent much of the next four years alone. He was released in 1857 at the age of 19 (just the age we call missionaries now). Penniless, he stopped in California to earn money for warm clothes.<br><br><i>With another man, . . .</i> [Joseph] <i>took passage in a mail wagon. They traveled all night, and at daylight stopped near a ranch for breakfast. The passenger and the mail carrier began to prepare breakfast, while Joseph went a short distance from camp to</i> [gather wood and] <i>look after the horses. . . .

He told his family, "Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision" (1 Nephi 8:2).<br><br>You may think that Lehi's dream or vision has no special meaning for you, but it does. You are in it; all of us are in it.<br><br>Nephi said, "[All scripture is likened] unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23).<br><br>Lehi's dream or vision of the iron rod has in it everything a young Latter-day Saint needs to understand the test of life.<br><br>Lehi saw:<br><br>A great and spacious building (see 1 Nephi 11:35–36; 12:18),<br><br>A path following a river (see 1 Nephi 8:19–22),<br><br>A mist of darkness (see 1 Nephi 12:16–17),<br><br>An iron rod which led through the mist of darkness (see 1 Nephi 11:24–25),<br><br>The tree of life, "whose fruit was desirable to make one happy" (1 Nephi 8:10; see 1 Nephi 11:8–9, 21–24).<br><br>Read it carefully; then read it again.<br><br>If you hold to the rod, you can <i>feel</i> your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost, conferred upon you at the time you were confirmed a member of the Church.

It is <i>after</i> you have partaken of that fruit that your test will come.<br><br>I think now and then of one of our classmates--very bright, good looking, faithful in the Church, and drenched with talent and ability. He married well and rose quickly to prominence. He began to compromise to please the world and please those around him. They flattered him into following after their ways, which were the ways of the world.<br><br>Sometimes it is so simple a thing as how you groom yourself or what you wear, such as a young woman teasing her hair endlessly to give the impression that it has not been combed or a young man dressing in slouchy clothes, wanting to be in style.<br><br>Somewhere in little things, my classmate's grasp on the iron rod loosened a bit. His wife held on to the rod with one hand and on to him with the other. Finally, he slipped away from her and let go of the rod. Just as Lehi's dream or vision predicted, he fell away into forbidden paths and was lost.<br><br>Largely because of television, instead of looking over into that spacious building, we are, in effect, living inside of it. That is your fate in this generation. You are living in that great and spacious building.<br><br>Who wrote this incredible vision? There is nothing like it in the Bible. Did Joseph Smith compose it? Did he write the Book of Mormon? That is harder to believe than the account of angels and golden plates. Joseph Smith was only 24 years old when the Book of Mormon was published.<br><br>You will be safe if you look like and groom like and act like an ordinary Latter-day Saint: dress modestly, attend your meetings, pay tithes, take the sacrament, honor the priesthood, honor your parents, follow your leaders, read the scriptures, study the Book of Mormon, and pray, always pray. An unseen power will hold your hand as you hold to the iron rod.<br><br>Will this solve all your problems? Of course not! That would be contrary to the purpose of your coming into mortality. It will, however, give you a solid foundation on which to build your life. (See Helaman 5:12.)<br><br>The mist of darkness will cover you at times so much that you will not be able to see your way even a short distance ahead. You will not be able to see clearly. But you can <i>feel</i> your way. With the gift of the Holy Ghost, you can <i>feel</i> your way ahead through life. Grasp the iron rod, and do not let go. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can <i>feel</i> your way through life. (See 3 Nephi 18:25; D&amp;amp;C 9:8.)<br><br>We live in a time of war, that spiritual war that will never end. Moroni warned us that the secret combinations begun by Gadianton<br><br><i>are had among all people. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, O ye Gentiles</i> [and the term <i>gentile</i> in that place in the Book of Mormon refers to us in our generation], <i>it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this secret combination which shall be among you.</i> [Ether 8:20, 23–24]<br><br>Atheists and agnostics make nonbelief their religion and today organize in unprecedented ways to attack faith and belief. They are now organized, and they pursue political power. You will be hearing much about them and from them. Much of their attack is indirect in mocking the faithful, in mocking religion.<br><br>The types of Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor live among us today (see Jacob 7:1–21; Alma 1:1–15; Alma 30:6–60). Their arguments are not so different from those in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>You who are young will see many things that will try your courage and test your faith. All of the mocking does not come from outside of the Church. Let me say that again: All of the mocking does not come from outside of the Church. Be careful that you do not fall into the category of mocking.<br><br>The Lord promised, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><br>Even Moroni faced the same challenge. He said, because of his weakness in writing,<br><br><i>I fear . . . the Gentiles shall mock at our words.</i><br><br>[And the Lord said to him:] <i>Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;</i><br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i> [Ether 12:25–27]<br><br>Embedded in that dream or vision is the "pearl of great price" (Matthew 13:46).<br><br>Lehi and Nephi saw:<br><br>A virgin bearing a child in her arms,<br><br>One who should prepare the way--John the Baptist,<br><br>The ministry of the Son of God,<br><br>Twelve others following the Messiah,<br><br>The heavens open and angels ministering to them,<br><br>The multitudes blessed and healed,<br><br>And the Crucifixion of the Christ.<br><br>All of this they saw in dream or vision. And they saw the wisdom and pride of the world opposing His work. (See 1 Nephi 11:14–36; see also 1 Nephi 1:9–14.)<br><br>And that is what we face now.<br><br>Now to you, the one of two million, I speak individually. Just as the prophets and apostles in times past did, "we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, . . . that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins" (2 Nephi 25:26).<br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i><br><br>[And then Nephi added:] <i>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</i><br><br><i>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</i> [2 Nephi 32:3–5]<br><br>You live in an interesting generation where trials will be constant in your life. Learn to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It is to be a shield and a protection and a teacher for you. Never be ashamed or embarrassed about the doctrines of the gospel or about the standards that we teach in the Church. You always, if you are faithful in the Church, will be that much different from the world at large.<br><br>You have the advantage of being assured that you can be inspired in all of your decisions. You have many decisions ahead of you--small decisions that have to do with getting through school, finding a life's companion, finding an occupation, settling in, raising children in a world that is turned upside down. Your children will be exposed so much more than we were in our generation.<br><br>We notice, as we travel about the Church, that our young people are stronger than heretofore. When I hear them speak in conferences and in sacrament meeting, I hear them quote the scriptures, and I hear them protecting the standards. I do not hear the cynical mocking that is typical of those who are not faithful and not truly converted.<br><br>We preside over a Church of twelve million-plus and growing. The Church is out in the world. Much of it is international now. Most of the members of the Church, by that standard, live a different life than you do. Many of them do not have the opportunity of going to college, but they live the gospel. And it is a wonderful, powerful thing to see them and to be among them.<br><br>As we think of you young Latter-day Saints and think of the Book of Mormon and think of the dream or vision that Lehi had, we see that there are prophecies in there that can be specifically applied to your life. Read it again, beginning with the eighth chapter of 1 Nephi, and read on to the counsel that is given. The Book of Mormon talks about life after death: what happens to the spirit (see Alma 40:11–12) and what happens in the spirit world (see 2 Nephi 2:29; 9:10–13; Alma 12:24). All of the things that you need to know are there. Read it, and make it a part of your life. Then the criticism or mocking of the world, the mocking of those in the Church, will be of no concern to you as it is of no concern to us (see 1 Nephi 8:33). We just move forward doing the things which we are called to do and know that the Lord is guiding us.<br><br>I pray the blessings of the Lord upon you in your work. I pray the blessings of the Lord upon you in your life as you move forward from the morning of your life, where you are now, to the late evening of your life, where I am now, that you will know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. You will face many great and tumultuous and difficult things in your life, and you will also enjoy great inspiration and joy in your life.<br><br>You are better than we were. I have the conviction that against what was surely coming and the prophecies that were given, the Lord has reserved special spirits to bring forth at this time to see that His Church and kingdom are protected and moved forward in the world. As a servant of the Lord, I invoke His blessings upon you and bear testimony to you that the gospel is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Boyd K.

<br>
In 2002 my wife and I directed a Study Abroad program to Madrid. As part of the program's activities we organized a trip to Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. This city became famous in the Middle Ages when it was assumed to be the resting place for the remains of the Apostle James. As a result it flourished as one of Christianity's most-frequented pilgrimage sites. For pilgrims the Santiago trail symbolized every man's search for forgiveness, identity, and purpose. Because of these strong spiritual corollaries, we felt that it would be good for the students to experience a four-kilometer portion of the trail. We started at the Monte do Gozo, or Mount of Joy--the point at which the pilgrims catch their first glimpse of the city--and walked to the cathedral.<br><br>While we walked we conversed with pilgrims--many of them having already traveled hundreds of kilometers on foot. We learned that each one had a unique story and purpose for pursuing their journey. All of them held in common a sense of belonging to a community of believers, a connection to the earth, a place in history, and a spiritual legacy embodied in the trail. Though there were a multitude of reasons for undertaking the journey, the joy the pilgrims experienced at its completion was singular. This fact became clear when we attended the pilgrims' mass in the cathedral and witnessed the humility and gratitude they expressed as they closed this chapter of their life. It became apparent from the look in their eyes and the expression on their face that they would walk away from their experience with renewed hope and a deeper faith. What we noted in their countenance and what they felt upon completing their journey is humankind's universal need to find fulfillment and joy in having reached a desired goal, for God has declared: "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>1</sup><br><br>Pilgrimages allow you to pause, to meditate, to listen, and to learn. As a result, you may discover peace, hope, and new possibilities. Key to a successful journey is your attitude. You must be teachable, humble, obedient, selfless, diligent, and persistent. These qualities produce a singleness of heart, mind, and will and prepare you to receive divine instruction.<br><br>The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>In Proverbs the poet declared, "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."<sup>3</sup> King David implored, "Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?"<sup>4</sup> The path of righteousness is always present to those of us who look for it. Unfortunately, many travelers ignore it and are tempted by the easy way. Your success along life's path depends on the choices that you make, whether to walk the "strait" and "narrow" road that leads to eternal joy or to wander the "wide" and "broad" way that brings sorrow. Job was cautioned that the disobedient will "rebel against the light" because "they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof."<sup>5</sup><br><br>In a recent stake conference Elder Donald J. Butler referred to a sign he saw outside of Juneau, Alaska, that read: "Choose your rut, for you will be in it the next 20 miles."<br><br>There are two ways that you can see the ruts in your life. There are those ruts that are unproductive, dull, and, most important, mundane. These roads lead nowhere and become traps that inhibit movement and destroy your agency. Some of these ruts you will carve out for yourself throughout a lifetime of passiveness or disobedience; others will be traps laid by the wicked and divisive. On the other hand, there are the ruts that resemble those left by our pioneer forefathers. Those ruts represent the sure, unwavering path that leads to a newness of life and hope.<br><br>Along these roads you will meet other travelers. Some of these encounters will be instructive, edifying, and inspiring. Others will weaken your soul by undermining your values and challenging your most sacred beliefs. Where you go and what you do depends on the path you choose and the associations you willingly embrace.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball warned:<br><br><i>In these days directly ahead of you is the decisive decision. Are you going to yield to the easy urge to follow the crowd, or are you going to raise your head above the crowd and let them follow you? Are you going to slip off into mediocrity, or are you going to rise to the heights which your Heavenly Father set for you? You could stand above the crowd and become a leader among your people so that some day they would call your name blessed, or you can follow the usual demands and urges and desires and lose yourself in the herd of millions of folks who do not rise to their potential. The decision is yours and yours only. No one else can fashion and order your life.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Cleopas and his traveling companion learned this important lesson on the road to Emmaus. While the two men walked and talked of the things that had transpired in Jerusalem after the death of the Savior, the Lord drew near and asked, "What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"<sup>7</sup><br><br>After Cleopas recapped the events of the day, the Savior began to teach them. He rehearsed to them the scriptures that foretold His mission and death. Both men listened intently, drawn to the stranger and His message. As the small group approached a nearby village, the Savior<br><br><i>made as though he would have gone further.</i><br><br><i>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</i><br><br><i>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>On that road two men traveled and communed with one another. While they walked they met another traveler who opened their eyes that they might see more clearly and understand more deeply eternal truth. They learned on the road to Emmaus that the truth they sought was not to be found solely in the things that they had seen but in the feelings they experienced when touched by the spirit of testimony. During their brief encounter with the Savior, He opened their mind, engaged their spirit, and confirmed the reality of what they had witnessed concerning His life. Not only was the truth confirmed to their mind but to their soul.<br><br>Let's consider the Lord's counsel to Oliver Cowdery when he hoped to translate portions of the Book of Mormon. The Lord declared:<br><br><i>You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie affirmed:<br><br><i>Logic and reason lead truth seekers along the path to a testimony, and they are aids in strengthening the revealed assurances of which a testimony is composed. But the actual sure knowledge which constitutes "the testimony of Jesus" must come by "the spirit of prophecy." This is received when the Holy Spirit speaks to the spirit within men; it comes when the whisperings of the still small voice are heard by the inner man. Receipt of a testimony is accompanied by a feeling of calm, unwavering certainty.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>When you open your heart and mind to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, your spirit vibrates and responds to its promptings. Then, and only then, can true spiritual progress occur as you take that next step along life's path.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer declared:<br><br><i>Oh, if I could teach you this one principle! A testimony is to be</i> found <i>in the</i> bearing <i>of it. Somewhere in your quest for spiritual knowledge, there is that "leap of faith," as the philosophers call it. It is the moment when you have gone to the edge of the light and step into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just a footstep or two.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Unfortunately those who reject these whisperings "wander in a wilderness where there is no way. They grope in the dark without light."<sup>12</sup><br><br>As each of you walk the path of life, take care to harmonize the <i>feeling</i> of the Spirit with the <i>doing.</i> In the Epistle of James we read:<br><br><i>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</i><br><br><i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i><br><br><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</i><br><br><i>But whoso . . . continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith learned this principle when, feeling the need to satisfy a spiritual longing, he studied the scriptures, found his answer, and then acted on God's promise. He recorded:<br><br><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>The knowledge he sought came because he studied it out in his mind, exercised faith, and exerted the physical effort required to get his answer. Joseph's answer was a glorious one, and, as a result, he embarked on a path that would lead to revelations, restorations, and the fulfillment of prophecy. Not all of us will experience such great and glorious manifestations of divine intervention, but the Lord has promised the humble seeker of truth:<br><br><i>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i><br><br><i>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>In 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi we read the story of Lehi and his family and their journeys in the wilderness. Through Lehi, Sariah, Nephi, Jacob, Laman, and Lemuel, the Lord reveals patterns of behavior that lead either along the path of righteousness or to a path wandering aimlessly toward self-destruction. Key to understanding how they reacted to Lehi, to his visions, and to his teachings is the level of commitment, desire, and obedience individually exercised toward God. Therefore, Lehi's vision of the tree of life provides a significant model--and revelation--regarding the consequences of choice and action on your individual pilgrimage toward salvation.<br><br>The core of Lehi's dream centers on the redemption of his children and their eternal progress. This fundamental concept becomes the nucleus of all the subsequent journeys in the Book of Mormon as prophets strove to set their descendants' feet on the true path that leads to salvation.<br><br>In Lehi's account a man in white robes motioned to the prophet to accompany him.<sup>16</sup> He led Lehi through "a dark and dreary waste,"<sup>17</sup> yet the prophet trusted the messenger and pressed on in his journey. Lehi declared:<br><br><i>And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Soon he entered "a large and spacious field"<sup>19</sup> and saw "a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy."<sup>20</sup> He ate the fruit that was "sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted" and "white, to exceed all the whiteness that [he] had ever seen"<sup>21</sup> to the point that it "filled [his] soul with exceedingly great joy."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Later in the Book of Mormon, Ammon taught that this joy is the "everlasting light" that is the "everlasting salvation" enjoyed by all those who "are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love."<sup>23</sup><br><br>In subsequent verses in chapter 8 of 1 Nephi, Lehi described the path that he desired his family to travel. Ultimately, he hoped that they would also eat of the fruit. Lehi also warned his family of the pitfalls that would await them along way.<br><br>Integral to Lehi's dream is his description of the travelers moving toward the tree of life. Among them are those who press forward "that they might obtain the path" and who "commence in the path" but are lost in the "mist of darkness" and "lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost."<sup>24</sup> These are those who hear the word and do not understand it, and "then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart."<sup>25</sup> Others catch "hold of the end of the rod of iron" and "press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they . . . come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree."<sup>26</sup> However, they soon "cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed,"<sup>27</sup> being overcome by the contempt of the world, and they fall away to wander along "forbidden paths" and become lost.<sup>28</sup> Indeed, these are those who at first received the word with joy, but when difficulties arose they vacillated in their commitment to the gospel and were offended because of the word.<sup>29</sup><br><br>Finally, Lehi described the faithful who "caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and . . . press[ed] their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down [to worship] and partook of the fruit of the tree."<sup>30</sup> This person hears, understands, and applies the word and bears fruit.<sup>31</sup><br><br>The dream introduced a fourth group of travelers made up of those who choose to ignore the rod of iron and, instead, feel their way toward the "great and spacious building."<sup>32</sup> Some of them wander along "strange roads" while others drown "in the depths of the fountain" and are lost from view.<sup>33</sup> This group represents those who hear the word but because of the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches close their hearts.<sup>34</sup><br><br>Later, in chapter 15, Nephi expanded on this vision and taught his brothers:<br><br><i>Whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>As a second witness, Nephi was privileged to see his father's vision. His account elucidates Lehi's experience by providing an interpretation of the signs and symbols found in the dream that can lead the determined traveler to enjoy the fruit of Jesus Christ's infinite Atonement. Because Nephi had sufficient faith to believe, to accept the words of his father, and to take that step forward in his progression, he received a personal witness of the Savior's birth to Mary,"<sup>36</sup> His baptism at the hands of John,<sup>37</sup> the calling of the Twelve Apostles,<sup>38</sup> Christ's miracles,<sup>39</sup> and His Crucifixion.<sup>40</sup> Nephi's vision carried him forward to witness the persecution of the Saints of God<sup>41</sup> and the destruction of his people because of sin.<sup>42</sup> Finally, Nephi saw the restoration of the gospel in the latter days.<sup>43</sup><br><br>Both iterations of the dream blend into a single testimony of the divine nature of humanity's pilgrimage through mortality. As disciples, we are invited to turn our gaze away from worldliness, to hold tight to the revealed word, to receive God's love, and to seek after Jesus Christ, who is our Savior and Redeemer.<sup>44</sup><br><br>Indeed, Nephi has become your exemplar of the humble pilgrim. His willingness to listen to his father and to seek a personal witness of the truth set him apart from his brothers and kept him on the strait and narrow path of righteousness. Because Nephi never doubted, he learned obedience through the recovery of the plates of Laban, patience through affliction and hardship, wisdom when he was commanded to build a ship, and recognition of the reality of priesthood power and authority when he learned to trust in God.<br><br>On the other hand, Laman and Lemuel dutifully "followed" their father into the wilderness yet allowed themselves to succumb to petty complaining, jealousy, and rebellion. Because of their unwillingness to learn for themselves the truthfulness of Lehi's words, they undervalued the journey, and, as a result, the physical discomfort they experienced overshadowed the multitude of blessings that awaited them. It is interesting to note that Laman and Lemuel had digressed in their spiritual aptitude to the point that they were unable to recognize God's power to inspire, to direct, and to sustain them. Instead, they fell prey to vanity and pride, which led them into a state of resentment and bitterness.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell warned:<br><br><i>Failing to understand the "dealings" of the Lord with His children--meaning His relations with and treatment of His children--is very fundamental. Murmuring is but one of the symptoms, and not the only consequence either; in fact, brothers and sisters, this failure affects everything else!</i><br><br><i>To misread something so crucial constitutes a failure to know God, who then ends up being wrongly seen as unreachable, uninvolved, uncaring, and unable--a disabled and diminished Deity, really--about whose seeming limitations, ironically, some then quickly complain.</i><sup>45</sup><br><br>Nephi told his brothers:<br><br><i>Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.</i><sup>46</sup><br><br>As Nephi began to wrap up his record and close it with his witness of Christ, he returned to his experience with his father's vision and declared:<br><br><i>After ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>In 1855, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Jedediah M. Grant invited Church members to<br><br><i>seek continually unto the Lord for wisdom . . . that when we shall have finished our pilgrimage upon the earth, we may go hence in peace, having wrought righteousness and established justice thereon, and, through having fought the good fight and kept the faith, be prepared to come forth with a glorious resurrection to inherit eternal lives and exaltation.</i><sup>48</sup><br><br>Last year my stake took the youth to Martin's Cove. Each participant was to trek in the name of either a rescuer or a handcart pioneer. Part of our preparation was to learn as much as we could about their experience. Our goal was to "walk in their footsteps." Through my research I discovered that two of my great-grandfather's brothers had been involved in this pioneer tragedy. Moses Cluff, who had just returned from a mission to England, joined the Hodgett Wagon Company that accompanied the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies. His younger brother, Harvey Cluff, who was only 20 years old, was one of the "valley boys" who formed the first wave of rescuers to meet up with the stranded pioneers. As I learned about their experiences, one interesting detail stood out. Harvey's history reads:<br><br>[The] <i>raging blizzard from the north compelled the relief party to seek shelter some miles down the river where the growth of willows was dense enough to break the force of the wind and afford shelter to animals and some protection to the camp. While encamped in this retired spot, three miles from the road, Harvey was called upon by the captain to take a sign board to the road, in case there were any who might pass along the road and thereby miss the camp. . . . In a few hours after the board was up, two men, Captain Willie and his companion, rode horseback into camp. . . . These two men, without bedding, could not have survived through the night, had they not been directed to the relief camp by the sign board.</i><sup>49</sup><br><br>Harvey's obedience and willingness to make the appropriate sacrifice of self not only saved Captain Willie and his companion but facilitated the rescue of all those who were stranded along the trail. Like those who were searching for relief and rescue from the storm, you must scan the horizon for signs along the path that will guide you to shelter and safety. You must press forward with faith, and, by and by, the path will appear and the destination will become evident to you.<br><br>My pilgrimage into the Wyoming prairie--through wind, sand, and rain--taught me to appreciate more deeply the faith and endurance of those who embarked on the long and arduous journey that led them to Zion. Throughout the experience I realized more fully that the challenges found along life's journey are often tempered by the rewards you receive because of diligence, persistence, obedience, and all those other qualities that make for a dedicated pilgrim. There was an added blessing that came from the trek. I was allowed to experience briefly the sweetness of peace that comes from completing a journey and enduring to the end.<br><br>Paul reminded us:<br><br><i>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</i><br><br><i>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</i><sup>50</sup><br><br>The most significant pilgrimage that you will experience in your life will be the one that moves you to seek truth, to exercise faith, and to gain a firm testimony that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.<br><br>I testify that you and I are where we should be, marking a path toward our eternal goal. We have been given the charge to improve our minds and deepen our testimony through study, faith, and prayer. Inasmuch as we have accepted this responsibility and have set our foot upon the path of learning, we must make it our primary obligation to prepare ourselves to be effective instruments in the hands of God.<br><br>I testify that this gospel is true, that it is the great source of all knowledge. The greatest knowledge of all is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that the gospel has been restored in these latter days through prophets who are divinely called, and that all this is accomplished and sustained by modern-day revelation. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alvin F.

<h1>ptures: a Reservoir of Living Water - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Bednar and I are grateful to meet with you tonight. As we travel the earth, we especially appreciate opportunities to gather with and learn from faithful young people like you. Tonight I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we worship together and seek in unity to be taught from on high (see D&amp;amp;C 43:16).<br><br>I want to begin by asking a simple question. What is the most valuable substance or commodity in the world? We might initially think that gold, oil, or diamonds have the greatest worth. But of all the minerals, metals, gems, and solvents found on and in the earth, the most valuable is water.<br><br>Life springs from water. Life is sustained by water. Water is the medium required to perform the various functions associated with all known forms of life. Our physical bodies are approximately two-thirds water. Whereas a person can survive for many days or even weeks without food, an individual will usually die in only three or four days without water. Most of the world's great centers of population are situated near sources of fresh water. Simply stated, life could not exist without the availability of and access to adequate supplies of clean water.<br><h2><b>Living Water</b></h2><br>Given the vital role of water in sustaining all forms of life, the Savior's use of the term "living water" is supernally significant. As described in the fourth chapter of John, Jesus and His disciples passed through Samaria as they were traveling from Judea to Galilee. In the city of Sychar they stopped at Jacob's well:<br><br><i>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</i><br><br><i>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</i><br><br><i>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</i><br><br><i>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? . . .</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</i><br><br><i>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i> [John 4:7–11, 13–14]<br><br>The living water referred to in this episode is a representation of the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel. And as water is necessary to sustain physical life, so the Savior and His doctrines, principles, and ordinances are essential for eternal life. You and I need His living water daily and in ample supply to sustain our ongoing spiritual growth and development.<br><h2><b>The Scriptures Are a Reservoir of Living Water</b></h2><br>The scriptures contain the words of Christ and are a reservoir of living water to which we have ready access and from which we can drink deeply and long. You and I must look to and come unto Christ, who is "the fountain of living waters" (1 Nephi 11:25; compare Ether 8:26, 12:28), by reading (see Mosiah 1:5), studying (see D&amp;amp;C 26:1), searching (see John 5:39; Alma 17:2), and feasting (see 2 Nephi 32:3) upon the words of Christ as contained in the holy scriptures. By so doing, we can receive both spiritual direction and protection during our mortal journey.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a sacred stewardship to preserve the written revelations in purity and in safety (see D&amp;amp;C 42:56)--this precious reservoir of living water. A monumental work was accomplished by the Church in the 1970s and 1980s and resulted in the edition of the scriptures we enjoy today with extensive footnotes, cross-references, and additional study aids, maps, and information.<br><br>As the updated scriptures were first introduced to the members of the Church in the early 1980s, Elder Boyd K. Packer prophesied:<br><br><i>With the passing of years, these scriptures will produce successive generations of faithful Christians who know the Lord Jesus Christ and are disposed to obey His will.</i><br><br><i>The older generation has been raised without them, but there is another generation growing up.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1982, 75; or "Scriptures," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1982, 53]<br><br>Twenty-four years have passed since Elder Packer spoke those words. And the generation to which he was referring is seated tonight in Church buildings all across the globe! He was talking about you, and he was talking about me. The vast majority of you have only known the scriptures as we have them today. Please keep that fact in mind as I continue to quote Elder Packer:<br><br><i>The revelations will be opened to them as to no other in the history of the world. Into their hands now are placed the sticks of Joseph and of Judah. They will develop a gospel scholarship beyond that which their forebears could achieve. They will have the testimony that Jesus is the Christ and be competent to proclaim Him and to defend Him.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1982, 75; or "Scriptures," 53]<br><br>Not only are we blessed to have these scriptures so readily available to us today, but we also have the responsibility to use them consistently and effectively and to drink deeply from the reservoir of living water. I believe this generation of youth is more immersed in the scriptures, more deeply acquainted with the words of the prophets, and more prone to turn to the revelations for answers than any previous generation. But we still have a great distance to travel along the strait and narrow path--more to learn, more to apply, and more to experience.<br><h2><b>Obtaining Living Water from the Scriptural Reservoir</b></h2><br>I now want to review with you three basic ways or methods of obtaining living water from the scriptural reservoir: (1) <i>reading</i> the scriptures from beginning to end, (2) <i>studying</i> the scriptures by topic, and (3) <i>searching</i> the scriptures for connections, patterns, and themes. Each of these approaches can help satisfy our spiritual thirst if we invite the companionship and assistance of the Holy Ghost as we read, study, and search.<br><br><i>Reading</i> a book of scripture from beginning to end initiates the flow of living water into our lives by introducing us to important stories, gospel doctrines, and timeless principles. This approach also enables us to learn about major characters in the scriptures and the sequence, timing, and context of events and teachings. Reading the written word in this way exposes us to the breadth of a volume of scripture. This is the first and most fundamental way of obtaining living water.<br><br><i>Studying</i> by topic typically follows, grows out of, and builds upon our reading of the scriptures from beginning to end. For example, as we read the Book of Mormon we may identify and seek to find answers to important doctrinal and practical questions such as these:<br><br>• What is faith in the Savior?<br><br>• Why is faith in Jesus Christ the first principle of the gospel?<br><br>• Why and how does faith in the Redeemer lead to repentance?<br><br>• How does the Atonement strengthen me to do things in my daily life that I could never do with my own limited capacity and in my own strength?<br><br>Focusing upon such questions and studying by topic, using the Topical Guide and index to the triple combination, allow us to dig into and explore the depth of the scriptures and obtain a much richer spiritual knowledge. This approach increases the rate at which living water flows into our lives.<br><br>Both reading from beginning to end and studying by topic are prerequisites to the third basic method of obtaining living water from the scriptural reservoir. Whereas reading a book of scripture from beginning to end provides a basic breadth of knowledge, studying by topic increases the depth of our knowledge. <i>Searching</i> in the revelations for connections, patterns, and themes builds upon and adds to our spiritual knowledge by bringing together and expanding these first two methods; it broadens our perspective and understanding of the plan of salvation.<br><br>In my judgment, diligently searching to discover connections, patterns, and themes is in part what it means to "feast" upon the words of Christ. This approach can open the floodgates of the spiritual reservoir, enlighten our understanding through His Spirit, and produce a depth of gratitude for the holy scriptures and a degree of spiritual commitment that can be received in no other way. Such searching enables us to build upon the rock of our Redeemer and to withstand the winds of wickedness in these latter days.<br><br>I want to emphasize an essential point. You might initially assume that a person must have extensive formal education to use the methods I am describing. This assumption simply is not correct. Any honest seeker of truth, regardless of educational background, can successfully employ these simple approaches. You and I do not need sophisticated study aids and should not rely extensively upon the spiritual knowledge of others. We simply need to have a sincere desire to learn, the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the holy scriptures, and an active and inquiring mind.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that we should<br><br><i>search the Scriptures--search the revelations which we publish, and ask your Heavenly Father, in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, to manifest the truth unto you, and if you do it with an eye single to His glory, nothing doubting, He will answer you by the power of His Holy Spirit. You will then know for yourselves and not for another. You will not then be dependent on man for the knowledge of God.</i> [<i>HC</i> 1:282]<br><br>If you and I will ask, seek, and knock (see Matthew 7:7), always keeping ourselves worthy to learn from the Spirit, then the gates of the spiritual reservoir will open to us and the living water will flow. I witness, I testify, and I promise that this is true.<br><br>Let me briefly explain and provide examples of what I mean by connections, patterns, and themes.<br><h2><b>Connections</b></h2><br>A connection is a relationship or link between ideas, people, things, or events, and the scriptures are full of connections. Consider the relationship between the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ (see Mosiah 15:1–9); between mercy and grace (see 2 Nephi 9:8); between clean hands and a pure heart (see Psalm 24:4); between a broken heart and a contrite spirit (see 3 Nephi 9:20); between the wheat and the tares (see D&amp;amp;C 101:65); between knowledge and intelligence (see D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19); between justification and sanctification (see D&amp;amp;C 20:30–31); between sheep and goats (see Matthew 25:32–33); between immortality and eternal life (see Moses 1:39); and countless others. Prayerfully identifying, learning about, and pondering such connections--the similarities and differences, for example--is a primary source of living water and yields inspired insights and treasures of hidden knowledge.<br><br>As I have read each of the standard works from beginning to end and studied different topics, I noticed that the word <i>understanding</i> was commonly described in relation to the heart. Two verses in the Book of Mormon illustrate this connection:<br><br>"Ye have not applied your <i>hearts</i> to <i>understanding;</i> therefore, ye have not been wise" (Mosiah 12:27; emphasis added).<br><br>"And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did <i>understand</i> in their <i>hearts</i> the words which he prayed" (3 Nephi 19:33; emphasis added).<br><br>I find it most interesting in these and many other verses that understanding is linked primarily to the heart. Note that we are not explicitly counseled to apply our minds to understanding. Obviously, we must use our minds and our rational capacity to obtain and evaluate information and to reach appropriate conclusions and judgments. But perhaps the scriptures are suggesting to us that reason and "the arm of flesh" (D&amp;amp;C 1:19) are not sufficient to produce true understanding. Thus, understanding, as the word is used in the scriptures, does not refer solely or even primarily to intellectual or cognitive comprehension. Rather, understanding occurs when what we know in our minds is confirmed as true in our hearts by the witness of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The spiritual gift of revelation most typically operates as thoughts and feelings put into our minds and hearts by the Holy Ghost (see D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3, 100:5–8). And as testimony and conviction move from our heads to our hearts, we no longer just have information or knowledge--but we begin to understand and seek after the mighty change of heart. Understanding, then, is the result of revelation; it is a spiritual gift, it is a prerequisite to conversion, and it entices us to more consistently live in accordance with the principles we are learning.<br><br>This revealed insight about the relationship between the heart and understanding has greatly influenced my approach to gospel learning and study, has affected positively the way Sister Bednar and I teach our children and grandchildren, and has impacted my priesthood service.<br><h2><b>Patterns</b></h2><br>A pattern is a plan, model, or standard that can be used as a guide for repetitively doing or making something. And the scriptures are full of spiritual patterns. Typically, a scriptural pattern is broader and more comprehensive than a connection. In the Doctrine and Covenants we find patterns for preaching the gospel (see D&amp;amp;C 50:13–29), for avoiding deception (see D&amp;amp;C 52:14, 18–19), for constructing temples (see D&amp;amp;C 115:14–16), for establishing cities (see D&amp;amp;C 94), for organizing priesthood quorums (see D&amp;amp;C 107:85–100) and high councils (see D&amp;amp;C 102:12), and for a variety of other purposes. Identifying and studying scriptural patterns is another important source of living water and helps us become acquainted and more familiar with the wisdom and the mind of the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C 95:13).<br><br>As I have both read from beginning to end and studied topics in the Doctrine and Covenants, I have been impressed with a pattern that is evident in many of the Lord's responses to the questions of missionaries. On a number of occasions in 1831, various groups of elders who had been called to preach the gospel desired to know how they should proceed and by what route and manner they should travel. In revelations given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord respectively counseled these brethren that they could travel on water or by land (see D&amp;amp;C 61:22), that they could make or purchase the needed vehicles (see D&amp;amp;C 60:5), that they could travel all together or go two by two (see D&amp;amp;C 62:5), and that they could appropriately travel in a number of different directions (see D&amp;amp;C 80:3). The revelations specifically instructed the brethren to make these decisions "as seemeth you good" (D&amp;amp;C 60:5; 62:5) or "as it is made known unto them according to their judgments" (D&amp;amp;C 61:22). And in each of these instances the Savior declared, "It mattereth not unto me" (D&amp;amp;C 60:5, 61:22, 62:5, 63:40; see also 80:3).<br><br>The Lord's statement that such things "mattereth not unto me" initially may seem surprising. Clearly, the Savior was not saying to these missionaries that He did not care about what they were doing. Rather, He was emphasizing the importance of putting first things first and focusing upon the right things--which, in these instances, were getting to the assigned field of labor and initiating the work. They were to exercise faith, use good judgment, act in accordance with the direction of the Spirit, and determine the best way to travel to their assignments. The essential thing was the work they had been called to perform; how they got there was important but was not essential.<br><br>What a remarkable pattern for you and for me to apply in our lives. Jesus Christ knows and loves us individually. He is concerned about our spiritual development and progress, and He encourages us to grow through the exercise of inspired, righteous, and wise judgment. The Redeemer will never leave us alone. We should always pray for guidance and direction. We should always seek for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. But we should not be dismayed or discouraged if answers to our petitions for direction or help do not necessarily come quickly. Such answers rarely come all at once. Our progress would be hindered and our judgment would be weak if every answer was given to us immediately and without requiring the price of faith, work, study, and persistence.<br><br>The pattern I am describing is illustrated succinctly in the following instruction to those early missionaries:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you desire to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it from the hand of the Lord, with</i> a thankful heart in all things.<br><br><i>These things remain with you to do</i> according to judgment and the directions of the Spirit.<br><br><i>Behold, the kingdom is yours. And behold, and lo,</i> I am with the faithful always. <i>Even so. Amen.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 62:7–9; emphasis added]<br><br>The principal issues in this episode are not horses, mules, or chariots; rather, they are gratitude, judgment, and faithfulness. Please note the basic elements in this pattern: (1) a thankful heart in all things; (2) act according to judgment and the directions of the Spirit; and (3) the Savior is with the faithful always. Can we begin to sense the direction and assurance, the renewal and strength that can come from following this simple pattern for inspired and righteous judgment? Truly, scriptural patterns are a precious source of living water.<br><br>The most demanding judgments we ever make are seldom between good or bad or between attractive and unattractive alternatives. Usually, our toughest choices are between good and good. In this scriptural episode, horses, mules, and chariots may have been equally effective options for missionary travel. In a similar way, you and I also might identify at various times in our lives more than one acceptable opportunity or option that we could choose to pursue. We should remember this pattern from the scriptures as we approach such important decisions. If we put essential things first in our lives--things such as dedicated discipleship, honoring covenants, and keeping the commandments--then we will be blessed with inspiration and strong judgment as we pursue the path that leads us back to our heavenly home. If we put essential things first, we "cannot go amiss" (D&amp;amp;C 80:3).<br><h2><b>Themes</b></h2><br>Themes are overarching, recurring, and unifying qualities or ideas, like essential threads woven throughout a text. Generally, scriptural themes are broader and more comprehensive than patterns or connections. In fact, themes provide the background and context for understanding connections and patterns. The process of searching for and identifying scriptural themes leads us to the fundamental doctrines and principles of salvation--to the eternal truths that invite the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost (see 1 John 5:6). This approach to obtaining living water from the scriptural reservoir is the most demanding and rigorous; it also yields the greatest edification and spiritual refreshment. And the scriptures are replete with powerful themes.<br><br>For example, the Book of Mormon came forth in this dispensation to "the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations" (Book of Mormon title page). The central and recurring theme of the Book of Mormon is the invitation for all to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him" (Moroni 10:32). The teachings, warnings, admonitions, and episodes in this remarkable book of scripture all focus upon and testify of Jesus the Christ as the Redeemer and our Savior.<br><br>Let me provide a few additional examples of important themes using scriptures from the Book of Mormon:<br><br>"If . . . the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them" (1 Nephi 17:3).<br><br>"Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20).<br><br>"Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>"In the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things" (Alma 20:4).<br><br>"Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10).<br><br>If you promise not to laugh, I will tell you about one of the simple ways I search for scriptural themes. I do not advocate or recommend that you use the same approach; different people use different methods with equal effectiveness. I am simply describing a process that works well for me.<br><br>In preparation for a recent speaking assignment, I was impressed to talk about the spirit and purposes of gathering. I had been studying and pondering Elder Russell M. Nelson's recent conference message on the principle of gathering (see <i>CR,</i> September–October 2006, 83–87; or "The Gathering of Scattered Israel," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 79–82), and the topic was perfectly suited to the nature of and setting for my assignment (see "The Spirit and Purposes of Gathering," address delivered at a BYU–Idaho devotional, 31 October 2006; www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2006_10_31_Bednar.htm).<br><br>I recognized that I had much to learn from the scriptures about gathering. So I identified and made copies of every scripture in the standard works that included any form of the word <i>gather.</i> I next read each scripture, looking for connections, patterns, and themes. It is important to note that I did not start my reading with a preconceived set of things for which I was looking. I prayed for the assistance of the Holy Ghost and simply started reading.<br><br>As I reviewed the scriptures about gathering, I marked verses with similar phrases or points of emphasis, using a colored pencil. By the time I had read all of the scriptures, some of the verses were marked in red, some were marked in green, and some were marked in other colors.<br><br>Now, here comes the part that may make you laugh. I next used my scissors to cut out the scriptures I had copied and sorted them into piles by color. The process produced a large pile of scriptures marked with red, a large pile of scriptures marked with green, and so forth. I then sorted the scriptures within each large pile into smaller piles. As a first grader I must have really liked cutting with scissors and putting things into piles!<br><br>The results of this process taught me a great deal about the principle of gathering. For example, I learned from examining my large piles that the scriptures describe at least three key aspects of gathering: the <i>purposes</i> of gathering, the <i>types and places</i> of gathering, and the <i>blessings</i> of gathering.<br><br>I noted that some of the primary <i>purposes</i> of gathering are to worship (see Mosiah 18:25), to receive counsel and instruction (see Mosiah 18:7), to build up the Church (see D&amp;amp;C 101:63–64), and to provide defense and protection (see D&amp;amp;C 115:6). In studying about the <i>types and places</i> of gathering, I discovered that we are gathered into eternal families (see Mosiah 2:5), into the restored Church (see D&amp;amp;C 101:64–65), into stakes of Zion (see D&amp;amp;C 109:59), into holy temples (see Alma 26:5–6), and into two great centers: old Jerusalem (see Ether 13:11) and the city of Zion or New Jerusalem (see D&amp;amp;C 42:9; Articles of Faith 1:10). I was grateful to learn that edification (see Ephesians 4:12–13), preservation (see Moses 7:61), and strength (see D&amp;amp;C 82:14) are some of the <i>blessings</i> of gathering.<br><br>Through this process I gained an even deeper appreciation for the spirit of gathering as an integral part of the restoration of all things in the dispensation of the fulness of times. I will not take the time now to recount the other things I learned about gathering; my purpose here is to briefly illustrate one way of searching for scriptural themes.<br><h2><b>The Blessings We Can Receive</b></h2><br>The blessings of knowledge, understanding, revelation, and spiritual exhilaration that we can receive as we read, study, and search the scriptures are marvelous. "Feasting upon the word of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20) is edifying, exciting, and enjoyable. The word is good, "for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me" (Alma 32:28). "Behold they are written, ye have them before you, therefore search them" (3 Nephi 20:11), and they "shall be in [you] a well of water springing up into everlasting life" (John 4:14).<br><br>In my personal reading, studying, and searching over a period of years, I have focused many times upon the doctrine of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. No event, knowledge, or influence has had a greater impact upon me during my 54 years of mortality than repeatedly reading about, studying in depth, and searching for connections, patterns, and themes related to the doctrine of the Atonement. This central, saving doctrine, over time, gradually has distilled upon my soul as the dews from heaven; has influenced my thoughts, words, and deeds (see Mosiah 4:30); and literally has become for me a well of living water.<br><h2><b>Lehi's Vision</b></h2><br>The importance of reading, studying, and searching the scriptures is highlighted in several elements of Lehi's vision of the tree of life.<br><br>Father Lehi saw several groups of people pressing forward along the strait and narrow path, seeking to obtain the tree and its fruit. The members of each group had entered onto the path through the gate of repentance and baptism by water and had received the gift of the Holy Ghost (see 2 Nephi 31:17–20). The tree of life is the central feature in the dream and is identified in 1 Nephi 11 as a representation of Jesus Christ. The fruit on the tree is a symbol for the blessings of the Savior's Atonement. Interestingly, the major theme of the Book of Mormon, inviting all to come unto Christ, is central in Lehi's vision. Of particular interest is the rod of iron that led to the tree (see 1 Nephi 8:19). The rod of iron is the word of God.<br><br>In 1 Nephi 8, verses 21 through 23, we learn about a group of people who pressed forward and commenced in the path that led to the tree of life. However, as the people encountered the mist of darkness, which represents the temptations of the devil (see 1 Nephi 12:17), they lost their way, they wandered off, and they were lost.<br><br>It is important to note that no mention is made about the rod of iron in these verses. Those who ignore or treat lightly the word of God do not have access to that divine compass which points the way to the Savior. Consider that this group obtained the path and pressed forward, exhibiting a measure of faith in Christ and spiritual conviction, but they were diverted by the temptations of the devil and were lost.<br><br>In verses 24 through 28 of chapter 8 we read about a second group of people who obtained the strait and narrow path that led to the tree of life. This group pressed forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. However, as this second group of people was mocked by the occupants of the great and spacious building, they were ashamed and fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. Please notice that this group is described as <i>clinging</i> to the rod of iron.<br><br>It is significant that the second group pressed forward with faith and commitment. They also had the added blessing of the rod of iron, <i>and they were clinging to it!</i> However, as they were confronted with persecution and adversity, they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. Even with faith, commitment, and the word of God, this group was lost--perhaps because they only <i>periodically</i> read <i>or</i> studied <i>or</i> searched the scriptures. Clinging to the rod of iron suggests to me only occasional "bursts" of study or irregular dipping rather than consistent, ongoing immersion in the word of God.<br><br>In verse 30 we read about a third group of people who pressed forward continually holding fast to the rod of iron until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree. The key phrase in this verse is "continually holding fast" to the rod of iron.<br><br>The third group also pressed forward with faith and conviction; however, there is no indication that they wandered off, fell into forbidden paths, or were lost. Perhaps this third group of people <i>consistently</i> read <i>and</i> studied <i>and</i> searched the words of Christ. Perhaps it was the constant flow of living water that saved the third group from perishing. This is the group you and I should strive to join.<br><br><i>What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would</i> hold fast unto it, <i>they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i> [1 Nephi 15:23–24; emphasis added]<br><br>What, then, is the difference between clinging and holding fast to the rod of iron? Let me suggest that holding fast to the iron rod entails the prayerful and consistent use of all three of the ways of obtaining living water that we have discussed tonight.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life.</i> [1 Nephi 11:25]<br><br>Each of these approaches--reading from beginning to end, studying by topic, and searching for connections, patterns, and themes--is edifying, is instructive, and provides an intermittent portion of the Savior's living water. I believe, however, that the regular use of all three methods produces a more constant flow of living water and is in large measure what it means to hold fast to the rod of iron.<br><br>Through normal activity each day, you and I lose a substantial amount of the water that constitutes so much of our physical bodies. Thirst is a demand by the cells of the body for water, and the water in our bodies must be replenished daily. It frankly does not make sense to occasionally "fill up" with water, with long periods of dehydration in between. The same thing is true spiritually. Spiritual thirst is a need for living water. A constant flow of living water is far superior to sporadic sipping.<br><br>Are you and I daily reading, studying, and searching the scriptures in a way that enables us to hold fast to the rod of iron--or are you and I merely clinging? Are you and I pressing forward toward the fountain of living waters--relying upon the word of God? These are important questions for each of us to ponder prayerfully.<br><br>As we conclude tonight, we will sing together the hymn "The Iron Rod." Indeed, this song of the righteous will be a fervent and poignant prayer (see D&amp;amp;C 25:12). May we have ears to hear the lessons this hymn teaches.<br><br>I witness of Jesus Christ and of the power of His word and of Him as the Word. He is the Son of the Eternal Father, and I know that He lives. I testify that holding fast to the rod of iron will lead to His living water. As His servant, I invoke this blessing upon you: that your desire and capacity to hold fast to the rod of iron will be enlarged, that your faith in the Savior will increase and replace your fears, and that as you drink deeply from the scriptural reservoir you will come to know Him. May we ever remember that<br><br><i>when temptation's pow'r is nigh,</i><br><i>Our pathway clouded o'er,</i><br><i>Upon the rod we can rely,</i><br><i>And heaven's aid implore.</i><br>["The Iron Rod," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 274]<br><br>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A. Bednar was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was delivered on 4 February 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>amily, and Friendship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Let me begin by telling you a little about myself. In the process I will share with you my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ as well as the three key ingredients we need to ensure happiness and peace in this life and give us a taste of what life will be like in our heavenly home.<br><br>I grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. New York City is a wonderful place that is full of excitement and entertainment. As a youth I was heavily involved with rap music, and my brother and I belonged to a rap group called CBS. No, it was not the television station. The acronym CBS stood for Can't Be Stopped. We thought the name was cool.<br><br>We traveled throughout the city performing at wedding receptions, high school dances, and block parties. During the summer months different rap groups would visit the neighborhood park to perform free concerts. Most of the youth involved with rap visited the parks to listen and, at times, compete with the other rap groups. Often, however, these free concerts attracted drug deals and promoted random violence.<br><br>It was during the summer of my 14th year that a random violent event occurred--which I will not go into--that provided me an opportunity to leave New York City and changed the course of my life forever.<br><br>During that time I was fortunate that my mother decided to send the family money and invited all of the children to come live with her in Hawaii. The money came at the right time, and that week I purchased a one-way ticket to Hawaii.<br><br>When I arrived in Hawaii, I quickly recognized its many differences from New York City--the ocean's clear blue water and the fresh cool breeze at night. I also recognized the many different nationalities and cultures. After my first day of attending Mililani High School, I came home and told my mother that it had felt like I was representing Africa at a United Nations meeting.<br><br>During the first few weeks of high school, the basketball coach noticed that I was one of the tallest young men on campus, and he invited me to try out for the basketball team. While living in New York I had not played much basketball. I enjoyed baseball and was on the bowling team, but I had never played on a basketball team. I believe it was because of my height that I started on the varsity team as a sophomore.<br><br>We won three basketball games that year, and everyone in the community was excited because it was three more games than the team had won the year before. In my junior year we won six games, and by the time I was a senior we had won 14 games and we became the Western Division champions, which advanced us to the Hawaii state play-offs. Because of my successful senior year, I was recruited to play basketball for BYU–Hawaii. All I knew about BYU–Hawaii was that it was a church school similar to Notre Dame or a St. Mary's University.<br><br>At the start of the fall semester I was instructed by my academic advisor that I needed to take several religion courses to graduate from BYU–Hawaii. For my first semester I decided to take a New Testament course, and for the first time I began to understand in part the importance of a Savior. While living in New York I had been a converted Muslim. The Islamic faith regards Jesus Christ as a great man or prophet, similar to Moses or Abraham. I had not realized the importance of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice until I read about His life in the Gospel of Luke. I studied how the Savior healed the sick, raised the dead, and made the blind to see and the deaf to hear.<br><br>Imagine for a minute that we all lived during the time of the Savior and that we watched from a distance as He called His apostles and performed many miracles, including feeding the 4,000. Imagine that we also watched as He took upon Him the sins of the world.<br><br>In Luke 22:39 it reads, "And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him." The word <i>wont</i> means "usually." When the Savior wanted to be alone, He often visited the Mount of Olives and similar places to pray.<br><br>The scripture continues:<br><br><i>And when he was at the place, he said unto</i> [His apostles], <i>Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</i><br><br><i>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and</i> [He] <i>kneeled down, and prayed.</i> [Luke 22:40–41]<br><br>Picture in your mind the Savior instructing His apostles to pray to overcome temptation and then His withdrawing Himself "from them about a stone's cast"--around 30 to 40 yards. He then knelt down to pray, saying, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).<br><br>At this moment I believe the Savior knew that He would take upon Him the sins of the world; nevertheless, He asked the Father if there was another way that this sacrifice could be made. If not, His response was, "Not my will, but thine, be done."<br><br><i>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</i><br><br><i>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</i> [Luke 22:43–44]<br><br>The Savior felt the pain of our sins. You know how it feels when you have made a mistake and your heart begins to ache. The Savior felt our heartaches and our feelings of guilt and anguish. He took upon Him the sins of all mankind--my sins, your sins, the sins of those who lived before us, and the sins of those who will live after us. The pain was so great that it caused the Savior, even Jesus Christ, to bleed from every pore of His body (see Mosiah 3:7, D&amp;amp;C 19:18). Well, you know the rest of the story. Judas betrayed the Savior with a kiss and Jesus suffered more pain before He was nailed to the cross. The Savior suffered death so that we might have life.<br><br>As the fall semester progressed, I was introduced to the missionaries. They visited my dorm room on a regular basis. I remember playing my rap music on my boom box, and I would ask the missionaries if they wanted me to turn the music down. For a long time I thought my music was the reason the missionaries came by my dorm room so often. It was not until I served my own mission that I learned that missionaries are not allowed to listen to music.<br><br>After about a week of daily visits, the missionaries asked if I wanted to take the missionary discussions. My first discussion with them was in the library on the BYU–Hawaii campus, and they showed me the video <i>The First Vision.</i> The movie talked about Joseph Smith and how at the age of 14 he felt confused about the many different religions. He wanted to learn the truth and to understand Heavenly Father's plan more fully. Young Joseph searched the scriptures and read in James 1:5 that "if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God." This scripture touched young Joseph, and he decided to exercise his faith and to ask God to direct him to the truth (see JS--H 1:9–13).<br><br>Joseph Smith went into a grove of trees and knelt to pray. As he prayed he saw a marvelous light, and in the midst of that light young Joseph saw our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ (see JS--H 1:14–20). As I watched this video, I felt in my heart it was true. Joseph Smith exercised faith, trusted in the Lord, and received the answer to his prayer.<br><br>The missionaries continued to teach me the remainder of the fall semester. It was fun and I learned a lot, but I had no desire to join the Church.<br><br>The next semester I again met with my college advisor and was again instructed to take a religion course. I decided to take the Book of Mormon course. I had no doubt about the possibility of additional scriptures because as a Muslim I had studied the Holy Koran.<br><br>My Book of Mormon instructor was Brother Gary Smith of the School of Business. As the course began I started to read about Nephi and how as a young man he listened to the Lord. And when Father Lehi instructed his sons to return to Jerusalem for the brass plates, Laman and Lemuel complained whereas Nephi simply said:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i> [1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Nephi exercised faith, trusted in the Lord, and obtained the brass plates.<br><br>I read about King Benjamin and how he served the people with all his heart, might, mind, and strength. He loved the people he served and, more important, he loved the Lord. During his last days upon the earth King Benjamin built a tower so he could teach his people many things pertaining to the kingdom of God. King Benjamin stated:<br><br><i>I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i> [Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>King Benjamin served his people as we must serve one another. King Benjamin exercised faith, trusted in the Lord, and brought peace to an entire nation.<br><br>I read on in 3 Nephi of how the resurrected Lord visited the people on the American continent. The Savior was introduced by His Father:<br><br><i>Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him....</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i> [3 Nephi 11:7, 9–11]<br><br>The Lord told the people:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i> [3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>The Savior--my Savior, the resurrected Lord--extends His hands of mercy and love to all who will come unto Him. The Savior. My Brother. My Friend. I stopped reading.<br><br>It was near the end of winter semester. I completed my finals and was preparing to return home to the other side of the island. My scholarship did not cover the spring term, and I was prepared to work for the spring and summer to save some money for the fall semester. On the day I was prepared to leave campus, I received a note in my mailbox from Brother Gary Smith, my Book of Mormon teacher. He wanted to see me. I returned to my dorm room, where I received another note stating Brother Gary Smith wanted to see me. I thought to myself, "Why would he want to see me? Will Brother Smith give me an F grade for religion? No one ever fails religion."<br><br>I dropped by his office, and the secretary mentioned that Brother Smith was at the Seasider, a mini-café on campus. I found him, and, as we talked, Brother Smith proceeded to tell me how I knew the Church was true and that it was time for me to join the Church. I looked at him amazed, and I wondered what he had been drinking.<br><br>He continued and said, "From what I'm about to tell you, either one of two things will happen. You will join the Church right away or it will take you awhile." He quoted a scripture in Ether that states:<br><br><i>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i> [Ether 12:6]<br><br>I thought, "What does this scripture have to do with me?"<br><br>Brother Smith explained that he believed I was waiting for some type of miracle or vision to take place before I would join the Church. He said, "You need to act upon what you already know to be true before you will receive a greater witness. 'Wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial [or exercise] of your faith.'"<br><br>Brother Smith was right. I thought, "Why can't I receive a vision like the Prophet Joseph Smith?" I wanted a greater witness. Well, it took me awhile to join the Church.<br><br>I returned to the other side of the island and started to hang out with my friends. Toward the end of the summer I began to feel somewhat empty, confused, and uncertain. I was missing school and the wonderful feelings I had felt at BYU–Hawaii. I knew something was wrong because I could not wait to return to school.<br><br>Two weeks before school was to begin, I received a phone call from Coach Ken Wagner. Coach Wagner was the assistant coach at BYU–Hawaii, and during that summer he had received the head coaching job at Dixie College in St. George, Utah.<br><br>He asked if I wanted to play for him at Dixie College. I said yes. That first year I did not play basketball; I redshirted. This gave me the time to watch the Mormons. As I watched, I noticed that at least three types of Mormons seemed to exist.<br><br>The first type is similar to you: students who attend institute and seminary and take religion classes on a regular basis. Their personalities glow, and they always seem to have smiles on their faces. When tough times come upon them, they know whom they can trust and that the Lord will help.<br><br>The second type of Mormons are the ones who realize that they are away from home for the first time and no one will know what they are doing. They party and get involved in immoral relationships. They believe they are having fun when in their hearts they feel unhappy. They do not have the "glow."<br><br>The third type of Mormons are the ones who "sit on the fence," unsure about who they are. When the winds of temptation blow their way, they seem to follow in that direction. They look confused more than anything else.<br><br>As I noticed these types of Mormons, I thought, "Peter, what type of Mormon do you want to be?" I wanted to be just like Rick West, my first roommate at BYU–Hawaii and a returned missionary; Bob Barnes, a teammate at Dixie College and a great friend; and Coach Wagner, who had helped me to understand the importance of family. They had the glow.<br><br>I thought, "If I am going to be a Mormon, I must learn how they date." So I enrolled in an institute class called Dating and Courtship. And I guess the other 28 male students in the class thought the same as I did.<br><br>Soon afterward, a good friend, Trudy Smith, began to take the missionary discussions. She invited me to attend with her. This time the sister missionaries taught me about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As you know, sister missionaries teach the gospel differently than do the elders. After each discussion they would cry as they shared their testimonies, and they wanted so much to hug me but realized that it was against mission rules. Toward the end of the discussions they asked me to do something the elders had not. They asked me to fast and to pray about the truthfulness of the gospel. I was familiar with fasting. As a Muslim, we fasted during the month of Ramadan, a sacred time for worship.<br><br>I fasted, and when I was done, I returned to my dorm room at Dixie College, knelt down on my knees, and simply asked, "Heavenly Father, is the Book of Mormon the word of God? And is Joseph Smith a prophet?"<br><br>No, I did not receive a vision or a visit from an angel. I felt warmth in my heart, a feeling I had felt many times before--a feeling I had felt when I attended BYU–Hawaii and took Brother Smith's Book of Mormon class. It was the same feeling I had felt when I saw the movie about Joseph Smith. This time, however, the feeling of warmth came when I was by myself, and I knew it came from God. He answered my prayer. I had a testimony.<br><br>I told the missionaries that I wanted to be baptized, but first I wanted to return to Hawaii so my mother could witness my joining the Church. I thought that as soon as I got off the plane I would find the missionaries and join the Church. Well, that did not happen. I started to hang out with my old friends, and I returned to my old habits. Toward the end of the summer the old feelings of uncertainty and confusion returned.<br><br>In August 1986 I was at home in my room, and I decided to read the Bible. I read in John, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). I knew I loved my mother; she is a source of strength in my life. I knew I loved my family, but did I love God?<br><br>I knelt down to pray and told my Heavenly Father for the first time that I loved Him. Later that day I was on my way to the gym to play basketball when I noticed two missionaries riding their bikes. I almost ran them over! They pulled to the side of the road, and I asked them to come by my home that night. They thought it was a miracle. The next week I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I returned to Dixie College that fall and played my sophomore year. We had a great team. We won 32 games and lost only three. I was recruited by several NCAA Division I universities, but I decided to postpone my college education to serve a mission. I was called to serve in Alabama. In Alabama I met people and families who exercised their faith and trusted in the Lord. Because of their faith, their lives were blessed.<br><br>One such individual was Sister Eva Oryang from Uganda, Africa. While living in her home country she had held a top political office and served as a prominent member of the government. However, in the summer of 1988 government officials of Uganda received several death threats, and Sister Oryang feared for her life. She left Uganda and arrived in Tuskegee, Alabama, where her oldest son was attending Tuskegee University. After two weeks of living in the United States, she became discouraged and very depressed. She had left a few of her children and a husband back in Africa, and she was unsure as to when her family would be together again.<br><br>Sister Oryang had learned of God back in her country and had faith in Him. One night she prayed. She prayed all night until the next morning, and all she said in her prayer was this: "Heavenly Father, I know I need a church. Will you please send me the right church first?"<br><br>In the morning there was a knock on the door. Her daughter answered the door and returned to her mother's room. "Mother, you have visitors."<br><br>Sister Oryang thought to herself, "I am a stranger in this country. How can I have visitors?" Seeing the young men at the door, she thought, "America is a strange place. Parents send their children outdoors with names on their shirts."<br><br>The missionaries introduced themselves. Sister Oryang told them, "I have just finished my prayers, and I asked the Lord to send me the right church." Of course the missionaries smiled with joy and stated that they <i>were</i> representatives of the right church.<sup>1</sup><br><br>As Sister Oryang led the way into the living room, there was another knock on the door. It was a minister of another faith who lived across the street. He had been watching the family for the past week and thought this would be a good time to visit. Comparing this older gentleman to the missionaries, Sister Oryang wondered, "How can these young boys tell me anything about God?"<br><br>She led the minister into the kitchen. As he sat down, there was another knock at the door. Two older sisters of yet another faith had been proselytizing in the area and decided to knock on the Oryangs' door!<br><br>Sister Oryang thought, "I have just finished my prayer, and I asked the Lord to send me the right church <i>first.</i>" She said good-bye to the minister and the two other sisters and listened intently to the missionaries. Within weeks Sister Oryang joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other family members soon joined the Church as well.<br><br>Before the Oryang family joined the Church, the Tuskegee Branch had about 10 members attending each Sunday. Following Sister Oryang's conversion--and through her example of faith and testimony--the branch grew in just nine months from 10 to more than 60 people attending church. And her son David became president of the Tuskegee Branch a few years later.<br><br>Sister Oryang, like others, was blessed with the fullness of the everlasting gospel--a gift she shared with many. She understood the influence and the power of the Holy Ghost and how it helps to change lives and bring people closer to our Heavenly Father. I worked with Sister Oryang following her conversion, and she helped me understand the three key ingredients necessary to ensure happiness and peace in this life and give us a taste of what life will be like in our heavenly home.<br><br>The key ingredients are faith, family, and friendship.<br><br>The first ingredient, faith, is essential for us to obtain the power necessary to understand the love that our Heavenly Father has for us and His desire for our success. Faith is the power that moves us to repent and instills in us the desire to improve. Exercising faith allows us to overcome discouragement and heartache as we recognize that the Savior suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane so that the suffering and pain we feel at times can be relieved and peace restored.<br><br>There is a difference between having faith and exercising faith. Having faith denotes a belief in the Savior; exercising faith requires action. When we exercise faith, we allow our belief to guide us to pray, to read and study the scriptures, to repent, and to keep the commandments of God. It is through exercising faith that our belief, knowledge, and love for the Savior grow and thereby strengthen us.<br><br>The second ingredient is family. Having a solid family relationship is imperative in helping us to understand the principles of forgiveness, service, and selflessness. President Spencer W. Kimball, our 12th president of the Church, suggested that it is through families that we master the teachings of the gospel of Christ. He stated:<br><br><i>Spirituality is ... nurtured in our actions of patience, kindness, and forgiveness toward each other and in our applying gospel principles in the family circle. Home is where we become experts and scholars in gospel righteousness, learning and living gospel truths together.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Families come in all shapes and sizes. Some children are raised in a single-parent home, some are adopted, and some are taught and raised by grandparents and other relatives. I was raised by a single parent. My mother always taught me to have faith, and she helped me to understand the workings of God in our lives.<br><br>Now I am married and have been adopted into Stephanie's family. I continue to learn a great deal from my in-laws and how important grandparents are in raising and teaching our children.<br><br>The third ingredient is friendship. President Larry Gibson, president of the Highland Utah West Stake, defines a friend as "one who is attached to another by affection, by esteem, and by respect. It is these attributes that lead to a desire to be with a friend and seek to promote prosperity and happiness."<sup>3</sup> Good friends provide support and guidance.<br><br>In April 1997 general conference, President Hinckley, our beloved prophet, declared that every member of the Church needs three things: "a friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with 'the good word of God' (Moroni 6:4)."<sup>4</sup> Later he suggested that becoming a friend is probably the most difficult. To get outside our comfort zone and to extend a hand of friendship is challenging. It takes time to develop friendships--but this is the time we need to take.<br><br>At some point we will all be tested. It is a part of life. When those times come--and they will come--it is a great feeling to know you have a friend at school, at work, or in your ward to show you love, to listen to your concerns, to be an example of goodness, and to testify of truth. These are the attributes of friendship. The Savior called us His friends when He said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). And in Proverbs it states, "A friend loveth at all times" (Proverbs 17:17). We need to take the time to become friends. There are those whom you associate with who need your friendship and support.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know God lives. I know Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and the Only Begotten of the Father--our Redeemer, our Savior, and our Friend. I know we have a living prophet, even Gordon B. Hinckley, and this is the Lord's Church upon the face of the earth.<br><br>We have been given much; therefore we must give of ourselves and incorporate and strengthen faith, family, and friendships. Doing so can ensure happiness and peace in this life and help us begin to understand, in part, what life will be like in our heavenly home.<br><br>My friends, take full advantage of the Lord's goodness. His arms of mercy and love are extended, and all are invited to come. For the Lord has said:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i> [Matthew 11:28–30]<br><br>The Savior loves you and me. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peter M. Johnson was an assistant professor of accounting at BYU when this devotional address was given on 6 February 2007.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. The missionaries who knocked on the Oryangs' door that morning were Elder David Steab and his companion. They taught and subsequently baptized the Oryang family in 1988. Peter Johnson served in Tuskegee, Alabama, from September 1988 to May 1989--after the Oryangs were members of the Church. It was during this time that the branch grew from 10 to more than 60 people attending sacrament meeting on a consistent basis.<br><br>2. Spencer W.

<h1> Ministry: Sacred and Precious - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I guess you are wondering why I wore this red jacket. My hope is that it will remind you that tomorrow is Valentine's Day. So, on this day before Valentine's Day, I've been wondering: "How's your heart?" If your heart hasn't already been promised to someone, think about doing it. And remember, your mother doesn't count!<br><br>I'd like to begin with a story.<br><br>My daughter-in-law's mother, Susan, was a wonderful seamstress. President Kimball lived in their ward. One Sunday, Susan noticed that he had a new suit. Her father had recently returned from a trip to New York and had brought her some exquisite silk fabric. Susan thought that fabric would make a handsome tie to go with President Kimball's new suit. So on Monday she made the tie. She wrapped it in tissue paper and walked up the block to President Kimball's home.<br><br>On her way to the front door, she suddenly stopped and thought, "Who am I to make a tie for the prophet? He probably has plenty of them." Deciding she had made a mistake, she turned to leave.<br><br>Just then Sister Kimball opened the front door and said, "Oh, Susan!"<br><br>Stumbling all over herself, Susan said, "I saw President Kimball in his new suit on Sunday. Dad just brought me some silk from New York . . . and so I made him a tie."<br><br>Before Susan could continue, Sister Kimball stopped her, took hold of her shoulders, and said: "Susan, never suppress a generous thought."<br><br>Susan didn't have an assignment to make that tie. She wasn't hired to do so. Despite feeling a bit hesitant, she did it because it <i>felt</i> right. Susan had a quiet sense of mission to serve others. I was also the beneficiary of such service. Her service went beyond any calling because it lasted throughout her life. Never suppressing a generous thought became a part of her <i>personal</i> ministry.<br><br>Some years ago, at the conclusion of a Utah Board of Higher Education meeting, Elder Neal Maxwell submitted his resignation. He said he needed to do so to make time for his personal ministry. Most of the board members assumed he was referring to his apostleship. However, he explained that his personal ministry was different than his apostleship. His personal ministry was to comfort fellow cancer patients.<br><br>We often speak about the Savior's ministry. But have you ever wondered if <i>you</i> have a personal ministry? I have.<br><br>What is personal ministry? Each of us has a personal ministry. I believe we received our personal ministry in the premortal world. It was divinely given and lasts a lifetime.<br><br>I hope all of you are excited to study the teachings of President Kimball in Relief Society and priesthood this year. I love what he taught when he said:<br><br><i>Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles!</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>How can we know what was entrusted to us at that time? As we accept callings and love and obey the Lord, our personal ministry unfolds. It is a sacred and precious thing. It embraces the people who come and go across the path of our life. It extends beyond our temporary callings as presidents, counselors, secretaries, teachers, and so on. It is illuminated by our patriarchal blessings. And while each of our ministries is unique, they allow us to become extensions of the Lord's love.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is key to pursuing our personal ministry. I pray that the Spirit will attend us in these moments together and that we will each have a greater desire to minister personally to others.<br><br>It's so important to realize that every interaction we have is an opportunity to minister, to nurture. You can minister to someone right now. Tell the person sitting next to you "Thank you for sitting by me." And if no one's sitting by you, pop over next to someone and tell them thanks.<br><br>"To minister" is defined as attending to the needs and wants of others. The Bible Dictionary adds, "The work of the ministry is to do the work of the Lord on the earth--to represent the Lord among the people."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Ministering involves extending charity--that pure love of Christ--to others, one person at a time. By doing so, we offer a kind, generous, peaceful, and pure heart. Opportunities to minister may come within the formal stewardship of a calling or assignment, or they may come as we spontaneously extend ourselves to someone in need. I believe these words of Elder Maxwell:<br><br><i>Our impact is less likely to emanate from the pulpit--more often it will occur in one-to-one relationships, or in small groups where we can have an impact on an individual.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Such ministering follows the scriptural admonitions that should govern our every interaction with all of our brothers and sisters: "Be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient."<sup>4</sup> "See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently."<sup>5</sup> As we offer such Christlike service to those around us, we and they are blessed and feel His love.<br><br>Most ministering opportunities are spontaneous, not planned in advance. Much of the Savior's ministering seemed almost incidental, happening while He was on His way to somewhere else--while He was doing something else. Chapter 9 of the Gospel of Matthew is an amazing illustration of that.<br><br>Early in the chapter, the Savior disembarked a ship. A man with palsy was brought to Him. Jesus stopped and healed him. Then Jesus had a discussion with the Pharisees and a man interrupted, saying his daughter had died. So Jesus left to assist the man. On His way, a woman touched His garment. Jesus healed her. He continued on His way and raised the girl from the dead. As He departed her home, two blind men followed Him, and He healed them. As He continued on His way, He cast the devil from a man possessed. All of this took place in one chapter! He gave us the example of ministering <i>as He went.</i><br><br>Just as a doctor comes to heal the sick, Jesus came to heal the sinner. When the Pharisees criticized Him for spending time with sinners, He responded, "They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick." Then He said, "Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy."<sup>6</sup> Had they simply watched Him ministering as He went, they would have learned what He meant. They would have seen His mercy. When we are merciful to others, we can feel at one with the Savior in that moment.<br><br>President Hunter taught:<br><br><i>We have the responsibility to learn of him, the things he taught and the things he did during his earthly ministry. Having learned these lessons we are under commandment to follow his example.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Like Him, we can go and do likewise if our hearts are open to those opportunities.<br><br>Just as ministering doesn't always need to be planned, it doesn't need to be spectacular. It is something we can do every day in natural, comfortable ways. Mother Teresa suggested that we "do small things with great love."<br><br>My sister Joyce called our 98-year-old Aunt Leona and asked, "What can I do for you?"<br><br>Aunt Leona didn't even hesitate but said, "Oh, I would just love a note in the mail when you have a minute."<br><br>That's pretty simple. Who do you know that needs a note?<br><br>While we were serving in London, we received a missionary from another mission. During his first interview he told my husband, Jim, that he did not like the Brits and did not want a British companion. Jim had prayed about the companionship and had felt impressed to put this missionary with one of the hardest-working missionaries--who also just happened to be British. Although that British missionary never complained about his new companion, he later told us it was a difficult time. Nonetheless, he served his companion in small ways: he made him breakfast, ironed his shirts, even shined his shoes. At the conclusion of his mission, I asked the missionary who had not wanted to serve with a Brit who his favorite companion had been. It was no surprise--it was his British companion.<br><br>I've heard remarkable stories of how you BYU students, faculty, and staff minister to each other. Listen for the common threads as I share three experiences.<br><br><i>I was a little apprehensive and nervous when I moved into a new apartment. Of the girls in the apartment, two were sisters and the others were already good friends. I worried about fitting in. To complicate matters, their interests and strengths were my weaknesses: they could make bread from scratch, bake pies, and run a household. Their uniforms for these activities were their well-worn aprons, which hung prominently on the kitchen wall. Then, as I was moving in, I noticed a sewing machine on the kitchen table. I was shocked. They even did their own sewing!</i><br><br><i>Well, they must have read me very easily because I was soon presented with my very own apron that they had sewn just for me. It didn't seem like ministering, but that blue apron symbolized their extended friendship, and it made me feel welcome. They helped me gain confidence in the kitchen--but, more lasting, they helped me through their examples. They included me in their circle as they gave of themselves. I still have and use that blue apron in my kitchen as I try to open my home and heart to others around me.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The second experience is from a BYU graduate:<br><br><i>As a sophomore, I had a roommate named Krista. She ministered to me by just being a loyal and kind friend. She asked about my life and always listened. She noticed what my talents were and suggested a field of work I never would have considered--the next 15 years of my life were altered because she noticed my skills and abilities and I took her advice related to a career. She could have noticed my inabilities and weaknesses--maybe she did, but she never commented on them. She just helped me be the best person I could by believing in me.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The last experience tells of a professor's impact:<br><br><i>I was a research assistant for a professor who taught me how to run statistics software, how to cull themes out of qualitative data, and how to patiently comb through survey responses. But he also shared with me faith-filled personal experiences and stories about his family. He lived his values and always remembered which things were most important in life. He inspired me to want to sing more and laugh more and appreciate life often, even in its extremities. When I came to his office to work, I always left edified. He ministered to me even though I wasn't doing a stellar job for him because I was so busy and stressed out with school. He looked at the situation and saw the most important thing in it. And that thing was not the work. It was a person who needed hope and faith in a challenging time of life.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>One common thread I see in these stories is people who followed the Savior's admonition: "Feed my lambs. . . . Feed my sheep."<sup>11</sup> Isn't it wonderful that there is so much flexibility in <i>how</i> we minister to each other? I hope you can see that all our personal interactions provide us with opportunities to minister.<br><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Believe in yourselves. Believe in your capacity to do some good in this world. God sent us here for a purpose, and that was to improve the world in which we live. The wonderful thing is that we can do it.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>We can often learn more about our personal ministry <i>through</i> our callings. I hope all of you are visiting teachers or home teachers. Look at these assignments with new eyes. They are great opportunities to minister to each other. Do you know the hearts of those you visit? Do you spend time with them? Do you listen and give them the great gift of knowing they have been heard and understood? It takes time and energy, but it is so important! I testify that as you seek for inspiration, you will not only know how best to serve others but will better understand your own personal ministry.<br><br>Let me give you an example. Elder Maxwell talked the talk, but he also walked the walk. Aileen Figuerres, who currently serves on the Relief Society General Board, shared this story:<br><br><i>Elder Maxwell oversaw the Asia North Area while my husband, Cyril, presided over the Japan Fukuoka Mission. Each time we saw the Maxwells, they would ask if there was anything they could do for us when they returned to Utah. However, we never wanted to burden such busy people with extra things to do.</i><br><br><i>While we were in Japan, our daughter Dawn was a new BYU student. One day she was called to the front desk of her dorm to find Elder and Sister Maxwell waiting.</i> [Wouldn't that be a surprise!] <i>They knew she was away from us and brought her a potted plant for her room and a book by Elder Maxwell. He humbly and humorously suggested that she could read it if she was ever having difficulty falling asleep. They chatted with her, told her about what we were doing, and offered her the name and phone number of their daughter who lived nearby in case Dawn ever needed assistance.</i><br><br><i>But this was not the end of their ministering to a young college student. During the Christmas holidays Dawn received a call to make sure she had somewhere to go. Sister Maxwell even invited her to the MTC to hear Elder Maxwell speak.</i><br><br><i>Their ministering was a blessing to Dawn and to us, her parents, who thought about her and worried about her as we lived half a world apart from each other.</i><br><br>Have you ever been the recipient of someone's ministering? Do you welcome or resist when others try to minister to you? Does it make you feel like a "project"? Sometime ago in our ward priesthood meeting, one of the brethren mentioned that the compassionate service leader in Relief Society had said there were ward members who did not want to be projects. This made it difficult for the sisters to serve them. My husband raised his hand and said if it would help, he did not mind being a project. So if the sisters wanted to bring him some meals when I was out of town, that would be okay. Unfortunately for Jim, they thought he was just kidding.<br><br>Jim, will you share your favorite story of learning to receive?<br><br>Jim Parkin: Once when Bonnie was the ward Relief Society president, an unusual thing happened. She was sick and could not go to church. She gave me careful instructions for preparing Sunday dinner. I put the roast in the pan with potatoes and carrots and celery around it, with the proper seasoning, and placed it in the oven. The boys and I were stoked, as it was our favorite Sunday dinner.<br><br>When we returned from church, the house smelled of that wonderful roast beef fragrance. I went to Bonnie's bedside for further instructions. She told me to put the roast and all the trimmings on serving dishes and take it to another family in the ward.<br><br>All I could say was: "What will we eat?"<br><br>She said, "Diana heard I was sick, and she's bringing us dinner."<br><br>Remembering the wonderful roast I had just soloed on, I said, "Well, how about we eat our dinner and give Diana's dinner to that other family?"<br><br>Bonnie responded, "No! We need to learn to receive as well as to give."<br><br>That lesson has served me well, and I have taught it on many occasions. But it still hasn't gotten me any extra dinners from the Relief Society!<br><br>Bonnie Parkin: Thanks, honey. What I know is that personal ministry must begin in our homes--and apartments.<br><br>Don't deny others the blessings of service. Allowing them to minister to us is another form of ministering. Personal ministry helps us feel the love of the Lord and come unto Him. Alma taught us that we entered into a covenant with the Lord at the time of our baptism. We specifically committed <i>"to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; . . . and . . . mourn with those that mourn; . . . and comfort those that stand in need of comfort."</i> As we minister to each other, Alma promised that the Lord would "pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us]."<sup>13</sup> Thus, when we serve one another, we are individually blessed.<br><br>A young couple took Alma's words to heart. They learned that a woman in their BYU ward had been diagnosed with advanced leukemia. They opened their hearts to her, her husband, and their young daughter. Listen to what this couple did. They contributed the money they would have spent on Christmas to this family to help defray their mounting medical bills, and they visited the wife in the hospital, read to her, and brought small gifts to cheer her.<br><br>Six months after the diagnosis, this mother died. The young couple had planned to move east to pursue professional opportunities following graduation. They decided to delay their move so that they could help this newly widowed father while he completed law school. When the father went to class, the young couple cared for his two-year-old daughter. They planned a surprise birthday party for this dad, and, with help from the ward, they kept the meals coming. I can't imagine that such extended service was easy for either this young couple or the widowed father.<br><br>Love and relationships--simply and profoundly--are what personal ministry is all about. President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Our mission in life, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be a mission of saving. . . .</i><br><br><i>If we are to build that Zion of which the prophets have spoken and of which the Lord has given mighty promise, we must set aside our consuming selfishness. We must rise above our love for comfort and ease, and in the very process of effort and struggle, even in our extremity, we shall become better acquainted with our God.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>We can become better acquainted with Heavenly Father through prayer. Personal ministry can answer prayers. We can offer a daily prayer that enlists the help of the Lord Jesus Christ as we ask: "Help me to be the answer to someone's prayer today." The Lord consistently answers this prayer as we tune our eyes and ears to discerning the needs of those around us.<br><br>The prayers of one missionary's parents were answered by the personal ministry of another. A missionary arrived in a foreign mission and was struggling with discouragement. He said he couldn't take it and wanted to come home. His parents and others tried to encourage him but to no avail. At a reception during a training session, this distraught father mentioned his son's struggle to a priesthood leader.<br><br>The following week an envelope arrived at the parents' home. Inside was a copy of a letter that had been sent to their son. The letter had been typed on a typewriter and very tenderly addressed to the discouraged elder. It was several pages long, full of encouragement and the writer's own missionary experiences about faith and sticking to it. The letter was warm, loving, thoughtful, personal, and signed, "Sincerely, your brother, President Gordon B. Hinckley." Shortly after this, the elder wrote his parents to say he was staying. He became a mighty power for good among the people of his mission.<sup>15</sup><br><br>It is motivating to think that in spite of President Hinckley's many responsibilities and his age, he is actively involved in personal ministry. As I attend the board meetings of the Church Educational System, I am moved and touched when it is President Hinckley's turn to pray: He prays for each of you that you will be blessed with faith and testimony in Jesus Christ. As you increase your faith and testimony, you answer a prophet's prayers.<br><br>We become the hands of our Savior as we do His work. In a missionary zone conference we discussed being the answer to someone's prayers. One pair of missionaries went home and prayed that evening and the next morning that they would be the answer to someone's prayers. The next morning they walked down the high street, and a man came running out of a hotel. He asked if they had a copy of the Book of Mormon--and they did! He explained he was a member attending a business conference. He was worried about some personal problems, and, as he prayed, he received the impression that his answer was in the Book of Mormon. But he did not have one with him. That morning he was sitting in the hotel restaurant. He suddenly had the impression to go immediately to the front of the hotel, where he saw the missionaries, who provided him with the answer to his prayer.<br><br>Asking to be an answer to someone's prayer has a powerful impact. There are sacred, quiet experiences for those who participate with the Lord in answering prayers. As we go about listening, watching, and feeling for the answer to those prayers--even in the midst of our busy schedules--I testify that our earthly ministry unfolds by revelation and divine empowerment. Our testimonies, faith, and feelings of connectedness to the Lord expand in amazing, unexpected ways.<br><br>And we can increase that participation with the Lord through prayer and even fasting for others. This helps us become aware of the great power the Lord grants us to make a difference for our brothers and sisters. In short, we can initiate and partake in small miracles on behalf of others--miracles that we are uniquely prepared to do, and that <i>only</i> we can do.<br><br>Wherever and whenever we are ministering, we are sharing God's love. Then, as He always does, both the giver and the receiver are blessed. May I suggest that finding your personal ministry begins with making a decision about a consistent way of being: a way that seeks to nurture, to be entirely helpful--not just now and again, but always. Ultimately, it is a decision to further consecrate ourselves to the Lord, to more fully take upon ourselves His name--to do as He did. Making this decision deepens our connectedness to one another and to the Lord. Such a responsive way of being is who we really are--from before this life.<br><br>I'd like to share part of a letter from someone who experienced this connection with another and with the Lord:<br><br><i>Dear Sister Parkin,</i><br><br><i>We fly quite a bit, and when we got our boarding passes, we had been upgraded to first class. This has never happened before, and may not again, but it was a little exciting.</i><br><br><i>As I was getting on the plane, I saw to my left a young woman in military uniform. The thought immediately came to me, "You need to give her your seat." It was quite a strong impression, and one I could not ignore. So, not being totally obedient, I went to my seat and put my bag down and sat down. I could not sit there though, and I walked back to talk to the stewards. I told them I wanted to give my seat to someone I had seen while getting on. Then I went back to get my bag.</i><br><br><i>I stood by the stewards until this young woman boarded the plane, and I pointed her out. They stopped her and informed her that I wanted to give her my seat. She was very appreciative, and I told her that I appreciated all she did for our country and I was happy to do this. I found out her seat assignment and went back and settled in.</i><br><br><i>About halfway through the flight this young woman came back to my seat and thanked me again. She kept calling me ma'am and telling me how grateful she was for this kindness. Then she handed me a little piece of paper and walked back to her seat. The note said, "Ma'am, I just wanted to say thank you so much! You helped me out in my hour of need. This soldier is forever thankful for your kindness. I am heading home to attend my mother's funeral. She passed away yesterday in a car accident. I thought God left me and punished me for something, but through this He gave me an angel to help my travel. Thank you. Here is a little something that helped me out. Now I'm passing it to you." Enclosed with the note was a little metal cross that said, "God loves you."</i><br><br>The letter concludes:<br><br><i>I am so grateful that I listened to the Holy Ghost and acted on that prompting. I don't know her name or where she was going. I really only know that she was a soldier. But I know that Heavenly Father knows her name and where she was going and that she was hurting. He wanted her to know that He loves her and was comforting her at this difficult time. I know that Heavenly Father loves me, too, and that He trusts me. It was such a simple thing to do. I guess that is what most service is--very simple things.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, we are each called to reach out to others--most of the time it happens through simple acts of kindness, one to one. These are the events that really matter!<br><br>Our personal ministry is sacred and precious. It allows us to become an extension of the Lord's love. It embraces all who cross our path. What are those things you can do for another person that only you can do? I invite you to find out.<br><br>As you leave the Marriott Center today, you will have immediate opportunities to practice your personal ministry. Please, never suppress a generous thought.<br><br>God bless you to follow your promptings, and, as you do, I promise that He will expand your heart to become more like His. My heart has expanded as I have ministered and been ministered to. It's in those ministering moments that I know that God loves me, and I testify that He also loves you and pray that you can feel His love daily. I testify that Jesus is the Christ. I know this for myself. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bonnie D.

<h1>t to the Words of the Prophets - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thirty-three years ago, while a student at Brigham Young University, I had a small role in an evening fireside like the one we are holding tonight. The speaker was President Spencer W. Kimball, and I found myself walking next to him as he moved toward the entry coming into the Marriott Center. I asked him if he ever became nervous standing before such a large assembly. With a smile, he responded: "Brother Andersen, you know that the scriptures say, 'If ye are prepared ye shall not fear' (D&amp;amp;C 38:30). I am trembling from my head to my toes." Tonight I know how he felt.<br><br>I express my love and respect for each of you seated here and for you who are gathered across the world. I know of your goodness and devotion to the gospel, your faith and hope for the future, and your desire to please your Heavenly Father. I pray that the Lord's Spirit will bless my words and your understanding.<br><h2><b>Hold Fast to the Iron Rod</b></h2><br>I want to tell you of the Lord's guiding hand in our meeting tonight. During the early days of January I worked to organize and outline what I would present to you. Knowing that Elder David A. Bednar was scheduled to speak to you in February, I asked him if he had finalized the subject he would address.<br><br>I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. It was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. The choir was already practicing this beautiful number that they have just shared with us.<br><br>As Elder Bednar and I discussed the messages we had prepared, it was evident that we had approached the subject differently. Elder Bednar thought for a moment and said: "The Lord loves the young adults of the Church. There is purpose in this. This is a message the Lord wants delivered." I determined to proceed.<br><br>Then, just a week later and before Elder Bednar's talk, President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a BYU devotional address he entitled "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehi's Dream and You</a>."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/"><sup>1</sup></a> He too included in his talk what it means to hold fast to the iron rod.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, this is a subject the Lord wants you to think about.<br><br>You will remember from the talks of President Packer and Elder Bednar, and from your own study of the Book of Mormon, the key elements of Lehi's dream of the tree of life. Elder Bednar taught us that the tree of life, identified as the love of God, is a representation of Jesus Christ and that the joy and happiness received by partaking of the fruit of the tree symbolizes the blessings of the Savior's Atonement (see 1 Nephi 8:10; 11:8–9, 21–24).<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_reservoir-living-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a><br><br>There was also a great and spacious building (see 1 Nephi 11:35–36, 12:18). President Packer's talk opened my mind to new ways of thinking about this part of the dream.<br><br>Also in the dream were mists of darkness (see 1 Nephi 12:16–17)--representing the temptations of the devil--that obscured the pathway (see 1 Nephi 8:19–22) leading to the tree. Finally, there was an iron rod (see 1 Nephi 11:24–25)--representing the word of God--allowing one to successfully pass through the mists of darkness and arrive at the tree.<br><br>The choir sang so beautifully:<br><br><i>Hold to the rod, the iron rod;</i><br><i>'Tis strong, and bright, and true.</i><br><i>The iron rod is the word of God;</i><br><i>'Twill safely guide us through.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>How we loved hearing it sung in Spanish and Portuguese as well, and how we wish we could hear it in all the languages of those who are listening to us tonight.<br><br>Nephi promised us that "whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, . . . would never perish; neither could the temptations . . . of the adversary overpower them . . . , to lead them away to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24).<br><br>The iron rod <i>is</i> the word of God. I like to think of it in this way: The word of God contains three very strong elements that intertwine and sustain one another to form an immovable rod. These three elements include, first, the scriptures, or the words of the ancient prophets. You will remember Elder Bednar's piercing question of last month: "Are you and I daily reading, studying, and searching the scriptures in a way that enables us to hold fast to the rod of iron?"<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_reservoir-living-water/"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>The second element of the word of God is the personal revelation and inspiration that comes to us through the Holy Ghost. President Packer said it this way:<br><br><i>If you hold to the rod, you can</i> feel <i>your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Grasp the iron rod, and do not let go. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can</i> feel <i>your way through life. (See 3 Nephi 18:25; D&amp;amp;C 9:8.)</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/"><sup>5</sup></a><br><br>My subject tonight is the third element, a critical addition intertwining with the other two. This third part of the iron rod represents the words of the living prophets. We must also hold fast to the word of God as delivered by the living prophets. My prayer is that from our time together tonight we will increase our attentiveness to what the living prophets are teaching, accelerate our response to what we are learning, and deepen our understanding of what it means to <i>hold fast</i> to their words.<br><h2><b>The Words of the Living Prophets</b></h2><br>Many years ago, President George Q. Cannon, then a member of the First Presidency, said:<br><br><i>We have the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; but all these books, without the living oracles and a constant stream of revelation from the Lord, would not lead any people into the Celestial Kingdom of God. This may seem a strange declaration to make, but strange as it may sound, it is nevertheless true.</i><br><br><i>Of course, these records are all of infinite value. They cannot be too highly prized, nor can they be too closely studied. But in and of themselves, with all the light that they give, they are insufficient to guide the children of men and to lead them into the presence of God. To be thus led requires a living Priesthood and constant revelation from God to the people according to the circumstances in which they may be placed.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Of course we who are here tonight love President Gordon B. Hinckley, the two counselors in the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. But in acknowledging our love and our loyalty, I would ask, "Could our attention to the counsel and the teaching of these Brethren be more active, searching, and responsive?"<br><br>Think how you would respond to the following questions: Could you tell me the names of the three members of the First Presidency and the names of each of those who comprise the Quorum of the Twelve? These are the 15 men you and I sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>If we were to hold up a picture of these Brethren, would you recognize each of them? We rarely pay close attention to someone we do not recognize or know.<br><br>Could you share with me the counsel given by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from last October's general conference? And could you identify the concerns of President Hinckley, President Monson, and President Faust in the First Presidency messages of the <i>Ensign</i> and <i>Liahona</i> during the first three months of this year?<br><br>Perhaps more important, could you share with me a recent decision where you changed something in your life because of counsel received from one of these 15 men?<br><br>The reasons our answers to these questions are so important rest in the calling and responsibility of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles. Whenever the Lord's Church has been established, the Lord has called prophets and apostles. The Savior said, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you" (John 15:16). To these men that ordination brings a spiritual power and a solemn responsibility--a power to know and to testify and a responsibility to teach and to bless. It also brings a responsibility and a promise to us. We have the responsibility to listen and to follow, and we have a promise that blessings will come as we believe and act on their words.<br><br>When the Lord called twelve disciples in the Americas after His Resurrection, He taught the people this: "Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants" (3 Nephi 12:1). In our day, in a very difficult time, the Lord promised the Saints: "If my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place" (D&amp;amp;C 124:45).<br><br>This is the Lord's pattern. He calls 15 men from "the ordinary pursuits of life"<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a> and endows them with the keys and power to guide and direct us. We are not forced to obey; there is no compulsion. But if we will be attentive to their words, if we will be responsive and willing to change our behavior as the Holy Ghost confirms their counsel, we will not be moved out of our place--meaning we will hold fast to the iron rod and will forever remain safely on the path leading to the tree of life.<br><br>How do we seek out and hold fast to the counsel of the living prophets? Let's consider the question by thinking more deeply about the three words we use in sustaining these men--<i>prophets, seers,</i> and <i>revelators.</i><br><h2><b>Prophets</b></h2><br>First, the word <i>prophet.</i> The Apostle John said that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" (Revelation 19:10). Prophets testify of Christ. Their sure witness of the living Christ is one of the greatest blessings to the Church and to the world. The Lord declared that these men are to be "special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world" (D&amp;amp;C 107:23). Above all else, their voices are raised in testimony of His divinity and His reality. This witness, born in their discipleship and tempered in their ordination, can have a significant influence on our own feelings.<br><br>Their testimonies are expressed simply, allowing the Holy Ghost to carry the witness into our hearts. For example, we may hear them testify with such words as these: "As surely as I know that I am here and you are there, I know that Jesus is the Christ. He lives!"<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/04/the-cloven-tongues-of-fire?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>8</sup></a> Or, "Mine is the certain knowledge that Jesus is our divine Savior, Redeemer, and the Son of God the Father. I know of his reality by a sure perception so sacred I cannot give utterance to it."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/04/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p18,p19?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a><br><br>While these statements are powerful, it is the accompanying spiritual confirmation that burns in our hearts and strengthens us.<br><br>Explaining the role of angels, Mormon taught:<br><br><i>And the office of their ministry</i> [the ministry of angels] <i>is . . . to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.</i><br><br><i>And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts.</i> [Moroni 7:31–32]<br><br>The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are the Lord's chosen vessels.<br><br>Our own faith in the Savior grows and develops through the times and seasons of our lives. There may be moments of doubt or discouragement when we feel as though we are enveloped in the mists of darkness. Do not underestimate what we each can receive from the solemn, sure testimony of the Savior borne by His special witnesses. That witness, received in a spirit of faith, will strengthen us in moments of difficulty and give us a firm footing as we move along the path toward the tree of life. Hold fast to the words of the prophets. Ponder them. Believe them. Trust them. Follow them.<br><br>Let me give you an example. A young married friend of mine lost his little daughter in a tragic accident. In the months that followed, with the loneliness, the asking "why," and the sadness, doubt began to enter his life. He told me that he wasn't sure what he believed anymore. I suggested to him that in this difficult time he might want to yield to his doubts a little less and trust the words of the Savior and the Savior's chosen vessels a little more. My friend pored over the scriptures, the promises of the Savior, and the bold, reassuring witness of the living prophets. He held fast to their sure testimony of the Savior when his own seemed to falter. He held fast to the iron rod. With time, the darkness dissipated, the tree came back into view, and he partook of the precious fruit of the Atonement.<br><h2><b>Seers</b></h2><br>Next, what is a <i>seer?</i> In the Book of Mormon, Ammon explained the role of a seer to King Limhi:<br><br><i>But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, . . . and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them.</i> [Mosiah 8:17]<br><br>Look at this beautiful picture [a partial photo of blue water and shoreline]: What do you see? Wouldn't you love to be canoeing in this peaceful setting? Doesn't it look appealing?<br><br>What if your view was suddenly enlarged and you saw this [a full photo showing the same water pouring over a waterfall]: The canoe ride would be very different from what you first perceived.<br><br>Spiritually, seers see the wider view. They see what we sometimes cannot see. Their words and counsel help us see the larger view. If we heed their counsel, holding fast to the iron rod, we will be safe.<br><br>Let me give you an example. President Hinckley has spoken strongly about the blessings of tithing. He speaks frequently to the General Authorities on this subject. He has said:<br><br><i>We</i> can <i>pay our tithing. This is not so much a matter of money as it is a matter of faith. . . .</i><br><br><i>I urge you, . . . every one of you, to take the Lord at His word in this important matter.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1985/10/let-us-move-this-work-forward?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a><br><br><i>We reiterate the promise of the Lord given anciently through the prophet Malachi that he will open the windows of heaven upon those who are honest with him in the payment of their tithes and offerings, that there shall not be room enough to receive the promised blessings.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1984/04/the-miracle-made-possible-by-faith?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>In the fall of 2001 three of the Twelve were in Brazil at the same time, and each taught the promises of an honest tithing. A few months later a young college student in So Paulo was put to the test. She was working and going to school. Here are her words, which were shared by President Hinckley:<br><br><i>The university in which I studied had a regulation that prohibited the students</i> [who had not paid all their fees] <i>from taking tests. . . .</i><br><br><i>I . . . faced serious financial difficulties. It was a Thursday when I received my salary. When I figured the monthly budget, I noticed that there wouldn't be enough to pay</i> [both] <i>my tithing and my university. I would have to choose between them. The bimonthly tests would start the following week, and if I didn't take them I could lose the school year. I felt great agony. . . . My heart ached. I had a painful decision before me, and I didn't know what to decide.</i><br><br>Through prayer she determined that she would trust in the Lord and in the words of the prophets. On Sunday she paid her tithing. The next day she sought a way to be able to take her tests but could not find a solution. She then explained what happened:<br><br><i>The working period was ending when my employer approached and gave the last orders of the day. . . . Suddenly, he halted, and . . . asked, "How is your college?" I was surprised. . . . The only thing I could answer . . . was, "Everything is all right!" He looked thoughtfully at me and bid farewell again. . . .</i><br><br><i>Suddenly the secretary entered the room, saying that I was a very fortunate person! When I asked her why, she simply answered: "The employer has just said that from today on the company is going to pay fully for your college and your books. Before you leave, stop at my desk and inform me of the costs so that tomorrow I can give you the check."</i><br><br>The student then explained her feelings:<br><br><i>After</i> [the secretary] <i>left, crying and feeling very humble, I knelt exactly where I was and thanked the Lord for His generosity. I . . . said to Heavenly Father that He didn't have to bless me so much. I only needed the cost of one month's installment, and the tithing I had paid on Sunday was very small compared to the amount I was receiving! During that prayer the words recorded in Malachi</i> [and declared so often by the prophets and apostles] <i>came to my mind: "Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it" (Mal. 3:10).</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/04/we-walk-by-faith?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>Clouded in the mists of darkness, the decision was difficult; the outcome was unsure. But she held fast to the iron rod. Her faith in the Lord and in the Lord's prophets was confirmed. While all experiences may not be so immediate in their resolution, the promises for those who honestly keep the law of tithing are absolutely certain.<br><br>I have heard President Thomas S. Monson say to returned missionaries, "There is one way you will always stay active in the Church--always be honest in your payment of tithing." What a beautiful promise!<br><h2><b>Revelators</b></h2><br>Finally, a <i>revelator.</i> "The English word <i>revelation</i> is translated from a Greek word <i>apocalypse,</i> meaning to make known or uncover."<sup>13</sup> As revelators, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles make known the Lord's specific concerns for us and what we need to do to respond. Moreover, with so many choices and decisions available to us, revelators help direct our attention to what is most important in our journey through mortality. They help us focus.<br><br>In August 2005 President Hinckley invited us to read the Book of Mormon prior to the end of the year. He helped us focus our discretionary time toward what the Lord would have us do. As often accompanies the invitations of prophets, a promise was included by President Hinckley--a promise that I'm sure is as true today as when he said it in August 2005. He said this:<br><br><i>Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/08/a-testimony-vibrant-and-true?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a><br><br>Were we not blessed just as the prophet promised?<br><br>One sister from the Ukraine wrote: "Every morning I asked that the Holy Ghost be my companion so He could enlighten my mind. A miracle occurred: the Book of Mormon was opened to me anew. I received answers to questions I had had for years." A brother from Germany wrote: "Because I studied longer each day, I made connections I had never made before. The Book of Mormon truly is full of testimonies of Jesus Christ. Because of the Spirit I felt, my own testimony of my Redeemer increased."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/12/taking-the-challenge/something-remarkable-testimonies-of-the-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>And how about this comment from a young family in Utah: "We wondered if our four-year-old was even listening [when we read the Book of Mormon], but then one day when asked why his room was so messy, he replied, 'Someone has been plundering in there!'"<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/12/taking-the-challenge?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a><br><br>Here is another example of the role of a revelator. President Hinckley has strongly counseled you, the young adults of the Church, to pursue as much education as possible. In October general conference he said: "I call your attention to another matter that gives me great concern. In revelation the Lord has mandated that this people get all the education they can. He has been very clear about this."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/rise-up-o-men-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>17</sup></a><br><br>What is the great concern? Education. Who has been very clear about this? The Lord. Who is revealing this to you? His prophet. And, yes, he is speaking to you.<br><br>If you come from a family that has few resources for education, you may be unsure about what this means for you. When you are unsure, hold fast to the iron rod. Trust the words of the prophet! The answers will come.<br><br>In some parts of the world, such as in the United States and Europe, it may mean that you need to sell your automobile or live in more humble circumstances in order to stay enrolled or return to school. In other areas of the world the sacrifice may be greater. In some countries the Perpetual Education Fund may be able to help. In almost all cases it will require faith, trusting in the Lord and in the Lord's prophet--holding fast to the iron rod--as you find your way. If you are not sure how to follow the specific counsel of the prophet, pray with all your heart and discuss your concerns with your parents and with your bishop. While it will require patience and faith, I promise you that answers will come and a way will be opened to you.<br><br>I have seen answers come to many young people of faith in Latin America. Thousands are holding fast to the iron rod, trusting in President Hinckley, and pursuing their education.<br><br>Prophetic direction flows from each member of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, all of whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. If we had time, we could review the counsel from each of them.<br><br>Let me give you an example of counsel from one of the Twelve. Nearly two years ago Elder Dallin H. Oaks addressed you in an evening like we are sharing tonight. You will remember that he caught your attention when he raised the issue of dating rather than "hanging out." He said:<br><br><i>My single young friends, we counsel you to channel your associations with the opposite sex into dating patterns that have the potential to mature into marriage, not hanging-out patterns that only have the prospect to mature into team sports like touch football.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/archive/ces-devotionals/2005/01?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>18</sup></a><br><br>Now, the important question: What did you do following his talk? Did anything change? Elder Henry B. Eyring gave this warning:<br><br><i>The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future. . . .</i><br><br><i>Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspired counsel or decided that I was an exception, I came to know that I had put myself in harm's way. Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets, felt it confirmed in prayer, and then followed it, I have found that I moved toward safety<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel?lang=eng">.</a></i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel?lang=eng"><sup>19</sup></a><br><br>How do your actions over the past two years show that you are holding fast to the iron rod? Those who responded positively and promptly to Elder Oaks's counsel surely found that the blessings of heaven followed. Let me read from a letter sent to Church headquarters from a couple in Arizona more than a year after his talk:<br><br><i>Your remarks have had a lasting impact on our lives. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Your direct and clear counsel helped us realize that dating was an opportunity to get to know one another better and not an immediate commitment to a long-term relationship or marriage.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>The result was that they <i>were</i> married in May in the Washington D.C. Temple.<br><br>I would like to invite my wife, Kathy, who has taught these principles so well to our family, to share her feelings about the importance of the words of the prophets.<br><h2><b>Remarks from Sister Kathy Andersen</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I had an experience about 20 years ago that made a deep impression on me. We were living in Florida. We had taken our children to the stake center to listen to general conference together. A short time later we received our conference edition of the <i>Ensign</i> magazine in the mail. We decided that for family home evening each week we would study one of the conference talks given by a member of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<br><br>Our children were young, but they were old enough to read, and we wanted each member of the family to have a copy of the talks so that we could read and study and mark them together. We didn't have a store in Florida where we could purchase additional <i>Ensign</i> magazines, so I took the copy that we had received in the mail to our local copy center and made copies of the talks for our family.<br><br>When I finished, I took the copies to the cashier, who tabulated the cost of the copies I had made and announced to me that I owed approximately $50. I am embarrassed to say that I felt a little bit sick at my stomach. And I thought, "That is a lot of money to pay to make copies of these talks for our children." Then, brothers and sisters, this thought pierced my heart: "What is it worth to you and your family to have the words of God's prophets?"<br><br>I knew then, but I know with even greater certainty now, that it is worth everything to us and to our family. It is worth everything to you and to your future families. Of this I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><h2><b>"As If from Mine Own Mouth"</b></h2><br>It is a marvelous blessing to be married to a person who has pure and uncompromising faith. I love you, Kathy, and am grateful for you.<br><br>In one month we will have the opportunity to participate in a general conference of the Church and hear the messages of the men we have spoken about tonight. General conference is a time to pause from what we are doing, to listen to the Lord's servants, and to prayerfully set our course for the months ahead. Please consider these questions:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Have I clearly marked general conference on my calendar so that I will be able to listen to each of the sessions available to me?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>How will I prepare myself during this coming month so that I will be spiritually ready to receive the messages?</li><br></ul><br>And, as general conference concludes, we might ask:<br><ul><br> 	<li>What specific impressions came to me during the conference?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>What necessary changes will I make in my life?</li><br></ul><br>The iron rod <i>is</i> the word of God. The scriptures, the words of the living prophets, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are powerful in their ability to keep us safe. Let us hold fast to the words of the prophets. Let us hold fast to the iron rod.<br><br>I would like to conclude with an experience we had in March 2000. Sister Andersen and I were invited to attend the temple dedication in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I knew that I would be asked to speak and that my remarks should be brief.<br><br>We entered the celestial room dressed in white. President Hinckley sat in the middle chair with a member of the Twelve on his right and with me on his left. As we reverently awaited the first session, I felt a distinct and specific impression that I should adjust the remarks I had prepared. The impression came: "Speak of the keys. Speak of the keys."<br><br>I quickly turned to the scriptures to locate the passages that explain the keys of the priesthood being returned to the earth. Then--and I can remember it as if it were yesterday--a powerful spiritual feeling came into my mind and heart. The feeling that burned within me was this: "He who sits next to you holds all the priesthood keys upon the earth. He who sits next to you holds all the priesthood keys upon the earth."<br><br>I took a deep breath. I looked over at President Hinckley. I could not deny the powerful manifestation of the Spirit. I thought of this scripture:<br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth. . . .</i><br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 21:5–6]<br><br>God, our Heavenly Father, lives and loves us. His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior. He is resurrected. He lives. Together They appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's anointed prophet today, vested with all the priesthood keys upon the earth. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil L.

<h1> Precepts of Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a blessing it is to be here at BYU--to sing, study, and worship under the light of the restored gospel and to be guided by prophets, seers, and revelators! I am deeply grateful for that, and grateful today to be surrounded by superb faculty, extraordinary students, parents, friends, and family--including my brothers Robert and Wayne Barrett, both of whom are also professors here at BYU.<br><br>I was privileged to teach a Book of Mormon class last semester, which I count as one of the greatest experiences I have had in the 20 years I've been here at BYU. While grading a student's paper from that class, I was prompted with some thoughts that I would like to share with you here today.<br><h2><strong>"Nearer to God"</strong></h2><br>Joseph Smith said:<br><br>I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.1<br><br>Since I am, by nature, an experimental scientist, I wanted to see if that statement was true. So I performed "an experiment upon [the] words."2 To conduct the experiment, I kept a daily Book of Mormon journal. Each morning I would read and ponder a verse and then write about it--sometimes only part of a verse, because the Book of Mormon is so rich. Sometimes I would write a paragraph and sometimes two to three pages. It took me several handwritten journals and five years to get through 2 Nephi. The meaning of many verses would not yield themselves to a single reading--such as those in the Isaiah chapters. Often, multiple prayerful readings and ponderings were necessary, following which often came the sweet, tutoring influence of the Spirit as I would write. And I would find myself learning from what was being written.3 I would also try to teach and apply what I read and what I wrote.<br><br>What was the result of this experiment? Not only did it get me nearer to God, but the catalyzing influence of the Book of Mormon taught me to listen to and learn from the Spirit and to treasure the precious precepts and freshwater doctrine that flow unimpeded from its pages. It has also cultivated a love for the Book of Mormon that will never fade. I read from it every day. In short, I'm hooked!<br><h2><strong>"Precept upon Precept"</strong></h2><br>I remember reading one morning the words of Nephi found in 2 Nephi 28:30, where Nephi wrote:<br><br>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.4<br><br>And I wrote the following:<br><br>Our ever-so-generous Heavenly Father does not penuriously withhold precious precepts from us. He is not stingy but is giving. But He does not want to drown us in doctrine or give us more than we can handle. Rather, He gives us "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little," measuring carefully what we can handle, what we can assimilate, making sure that we absorb and respond to that which we have been given before pouring more upon us. What a gracious and kind Heavenly Father we have!<br><br>My writing prompted me to ask the question I began with: Why and how are we blessed when we hearken to His precepts and lend an ear to His counsel? And the answers began to flow.<br><br>First, our Father's divine laws are packaged in precious precepts taught by His Son. For example, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."5 And those who make peace with God, with their neighbor, and with themselves are blessed--with an increased measure of the Spirit in their lives, with happiness, and with greater knowledge and purpose. Thus, "when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."6 The law, in this particular example, is to live in peace. The precept is that blessings come from living the law. The perceptive come to learn and love the predicates of the precepts.<br><br>A motivating precept for those at BYU might be: "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."7 Perhaps this precept can be generalized: Whatever principle of testimony, devotion, and worthiness I attain unto before my mission will rise with me in the mission field. Whatever principle of obedience, diligence, and selfless service I attain unto during my mission will rise with me when I return. Whatever principle of kindness, gentleness, and charity I attain unto before marriage will rise with me in my family life. And maybe even, for us here now: Whatever measure of work, effort, and understanding I attain unto during this semester will rise with me in finals week.<br><br>A second reason why we are blessed when we hearken to His precepts and lend an ear to His counsel is that those who receive and act on the precepts of God receive more. And, since each precept brings with it attendant blessings, receiving more precepts brings more blessings.8 Thus to the list of precious precepts we may add the precept of perpetuation, since one precept, acted upon, begets another. This is not quite the precept of perpetual precepts, since it is incumbent upon us to act, but it is close.<br><br>Third, in addition to the blessings attached to a given precept, and the promise of more to come, there is a bonus blessing. That is that the compounding and knitting together of precious precepts yields compounded blessings, just as with compounded interest. The quantum mechanics of both precepts and blessings rubbing against each other also produce a quantum leap in gratitude and joy, in faith and humility, and in the ability to perceive the higher-level precepts that flow from the interleaving of precept with precept and blessing with blessing. Such weaving produces genuine wisdom and, when woven by the Lord, becomes part of the tapestry of our lives.<br><br>So in this verse more really does mean more--more than we have room to receive, because such precepts and blessing are forever growing so that we can forever grow, because that too is woven into the fabric of our divine nature. Thus when we say "we've had enough," we cease to grow and begin to shrink from the endowment attendant to our being sons and daughters of God. Such shrinking not only curtails growth but causes a spiraling decline and unraveling of the compounded precepts and blessings we once enjoyed. In such shrinking I do not believe that our kind Father snatches back that which we have with anger or disgust or retribution, for His hand is ever "stretched out still," but I do believe His heart breaks a little, and often a lot, when we are not willing to receive that which we might have received.9 And being an all-wise Heavenly Father, He will not burden us with precepts and blessings we are not prepared to receive. As the Master Gardener, He titrates the soil of our soul in a mercifully measured way, "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little," not because He is not giving--quite the opposite. It is so that little by little we can one day receive all that He has.10 Because His love for us is perfect, He will not drown us with perfect precepts or blessings if we are not prepared to receive them--whether they are being dispensed with an eyedropper or a fire hose.<br><h2><strong>Learning Precepts from Life's Experiences</strong></h2><br>Life in general is a grand experiment in learning correct precepts. Allow me to illustrate this with an example from my childhood. When I was 10 years old, I was out in the country at my grandmother's house sledding with my two brothers on New Year's Day. It was a beautiful Currier and Ives setting as we stood at the top of the hill gazing down over the pasture covered in white with a beautiful, clear stream angling across the bottom. As in a Norman Rockwell painting, I hopped on my Flexible Flyer and told my brother Wayne to hop on top. My artistic brother, Robert, remained at the top of the hill to capture the magic moment in his memory as down the hill we went. As we leveled out at the base of the hill, I performed the hard-rudder-right maneuver to avoid the impending stream. The sled disregarded my instructions, and into the icy stream we went.<br><br>Undaunted, we dragged ourselves back into the house, took a hot bath, put on some warm, dry clothes, and went out again. As we approached the top of the hill again, I hopped on the sled and invited my older but now somewhat more cautious brother to hop on board. I thought to myself, "This really should have worked." And down we went again. But as we neared the stream, age gave way to discretion and, discretion being the better part of valor, my older brother bailed on me. (After all, he is a mathematician, and he had a "proof by example.") As for me--and, as you might suspect--the flexible steering mechanism again failed me, and again I plummeted into the icy stream. Alone. However, this time a stick from the brush went through my cheek, and we had to go find someone to sew it up, or else I would have been out there a third time. Even though it "really should have worked," the laws of physics said otherwise. But perhaps some useful precepts can be drawn--even from failed experiments.<br><br>For one, overwhelming momentum overrides small course corrections: a vital lesson to remember in sledding as well as in personal relationships when you are alone with someone late at night--a potential slippery slope and a pattern for heartache; a reminder that if we fail to follow divinely established patterns of conduct and morality, as taught by living prophets, the momentum of the moment may inflict mortal wounds, robbing us of virtue, happiness, and peace of mind. Small course corrections each week as we partake of the sacrament and each morning and night as we kneel before our Heavenly Father, remembering Him who was wounded for our transgressions, will prevent us from taking on the debilitating wounds that delay or destroy our scheduled patterns of personal progress and our future rendezvous with happiness. Such spiritual corrections are vital because the adversary also has patterns and plans by which he tries to destroy us--patterns that fuel the vain and foolish precepts of men. But, for us, a better pattern is: Don't be alone with someone late at night. Instead, allow small course corrections to guide your momentum rather than the other way around. Such careful thinking and behavior, if practiced daily and exercised thoughtfully, will allow us to one day steer our immortal souls to "the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven."11<br><h2><strong>The Gospel Embraces All True Precepts</strong></h2><br>Clearly, discovering all true precepts from personal experience can be hazardous. As a practical matter, you have to be willing to learn from others, since there isn't time to perform all of the experiments or make all of the mistakes yourself. This is why the restored gospel is placed within our grasp and why we are here at BYU. Discovering true precepts in faith, in science, in the arts, in great literature, or in whatever course of study is a great adventure. I am confident that our Father in Heaven does not differentiate true precepts based on their perceived domain.<br><br>Brigham Young taught:<br><br>Our religion is simply the truth. It is all said in this one expression--it embraces all truth, wherever found, in all the works of God and man that are visible or invisible to mortal eye.12<br><br>Yet, having said that, we must still labor for and search for true precepts like the woman who, if she lost a piece of silver, would "light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it."13 Sometimes students wring their hands, cross their fingers, and hope that their answer to a problem is right, even when the answer is hollow or not well thought out. Such flawed thinking can also lead to bad results when it comes to life's real problems regarding relationships, finances, or other personal choices. In contrast, I am convinced that those who really love the truth care more about finding correct answers and about what is really right than they care about vacuous answers that are expedient or acceptable. The world already offers too many solutions of this kind. Life's real reward for genuine solutions to real problems is an exclamation point, not a check mark!<br><br>Henry Eyring, a noted chemist and father to Elder Henry B. Eyring, stated:<br><br>The significant thing about a scientist is this: he simply expects the truth to prevail because it is the truth. He doesn't work very much on the reactions of the heart. In science, the thing is, and its being so is something one cannot resent. If a thing is wrong, nothing can save it, and if it is right, it cannot help succeeding.14<br><br>Brigham Young stated that "truth is calculated to sustain itself; it is based upon eternal facts and will endure, while all else will sooner or later perish."15<br><br>So, whether in the lab, in the classroom, or in the scriptures, we search for true principles and precepts with dogged determination. Whether in sledding or in science, we search for answers with tenacity and faith that we will find a solution.<br><br>I've often told my own children that my idea of heaven is being trapped in a room with a handful of bright students and some problems that are so difficult you don't even know how to articulate them. They often respond by saying, "Hmmm, that kind of sounds like the other place to me."<br><br>But when we have paid the price, needed answers to tough problems come as sudden bursts of ideas and intelligence, bringing elegant, high-level insights--the unmistakable signature of the Spirit--but in His own time and in His own way. The best ideas always come from the Spirit. The rest we just labor and muddle over and try to make work. The following examples illustrate some of our current muddling:<br><br>1. In computer graphics we create models of real-world objects so that they can be animated and placed in movies. In our lab we do this by extracting points from photographs and then connecting the dots to describe the object geometry. By assigning the right color to these points, a realistic model is created. Just as correctly connecting points here result in a believable model, so connecting the "points" of true precepts helps us to see "things as they really are, and . . . as they really will be."16<br><br>2. With about 2.5 billion document images in the granite mountain vault, automated handwriting recognition has become an important problem in family history because it helps us more efficiently identify names and information for temple work. We approach this problem using pattern-recognition algorithms coupled with human training. Finding and recognizing ancestors not only helps us find ourselves but also helps us recognize the unfolding patterns and precepts in our own lives.<br><br>3. Our recent research in the medical domain makes use of globally optimal algorithms to accurately extract anatomy from medical scans. Just as a global understanding of object properties in medical imaging allows proper and timely diagnosis, so seeing our own inner parts through the lens of precious precepts from the restored gospel will help us not only see who we currently are but what we ultimately must become.<br><br>As we try to understand secular knowledge, we do the best we can--the best we can surmise with what we know. But it changes. Keep that in mind as you learn. We don't repudiate ideas just because they are from men, but, as we muddle along, we winnow and sift for the truth, weighing what we learn carefully in the balance of restored truth and subjecting it to the light of the restored gospel. If a precept is true, it fits within the gospel framework. It is a piece of the puzzle. And if we will search and study by faith, the spiritual dimensions of all the precepts that we learn will become more evident to us, and thereby enhance our faith.<br><h2><strong>Precepts of God Versus Precepts of Men</strong></h2><br>Nephi warned us about the precepts of men that will prevail in our day. He used phrases such as "contend one with another"; "eat, drink, and be merry"; "lie a little"; and "take . . . advantage of [others]." He described these as "false and vain and foolish doctrines."17 Thus another instructive experiment that enhances spiritual knowledge is to identify a precept of men and then discover the contrasting precept of God, or vice versa. For example:<br><br>• The precepts of men tell us that we must see before we can believe. Nephi teaches us that we must believe before we can see.18<br><br>• The precepts of men teach that resources are scarce--that you must get all you can while you can. Scriptural precepts teach us that "there is enough and to spare."19<br><br>• Men's precepts urge a makeover in the image of the world. Alma urges a makeover in the image of God.20<br><br>• Men teach to believe in nothing; hope for nothing; endure nothing; and "live without God in the world."21 But we believe all things, hope all things, endure all things, and find abundant life through Him.22<br><br>• Men's ways are to hide or cover sins because "no one will know."23 God's way is for us to "confess . . . and forsake" sins so that He can "remember them no more."24<br><br>• The precepts of men speak of being beaten "with a few stripes" but ultimately being saved without ever having to change, without ever overcoming self or the world, without ever changing our hearts or feeling the peace and joy of repentance and forgiveness--without ever becoming like Him.25 But by accepting our Savior's stripes for us26 and repenting "in the depths of humility,"27 we can overcome ourselves and the world.28<br><br>The precepts of men will ultimately fail. The precepts of God will endure forever.29<br><h2><strong>Precepts That Get Us Nearer to God</strong></h2><br>A year or so ago I conducted another experiment. I began to write down a list of precepts that I felt were unique to the Book of Mormon. Several hours and several pages later I knew that I had only just begun. Allow me to close where I began, by sharing a few of the precepts from the Book of Mormon that have become precious, personal precepts to me and that get me nearer to God.<br><br>•Nephi's "I will go and do"30 reminds us that it is in the going and doing that we not only find that the Lord provides a way but we find the way itself. And in following that way we also find ourselves drawing nearer to Him.<br><br>•Lehi's "opposition in all things"31 helps me understand and cope with life's triumphs and tragedies. It helps me remember that I chose to choose and that is why I am here. And it helps me remember, too, that our Savior had agency too but gave it away for you and for me, allowing His will to be swallowed up in the will of the Father as He suffered, bled, and died for me. And that I can never forget. And it draws me nearer to Him.<br><br>•Jacob's "infinite atonement"32 brings me nearer to God because it lets me know that I can be forgiven and become clean again and have my guilt swept away. It draws me nearer to God because it helps me understand how very comprehensive the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ truly is as He suffered for every broken bone and every broken heart. It helps me understand that His infinite suffering was born out of His infinite love for you and for me and that we are of infinite worth because an infinite price was paid for us!<br><br>•Saved by grace, "after all we can do"33 reminds me that some of the most precious precepts are found in pondering the "parentheticals."<br><br>•From cover to cover, the Book of Mormon teaches me that Jesus Christ is and was the long-promised Messiah, the Holy One of Israel, our Savior and Redeemer, the Lamb of God, the Son of God.34 Understanding His premortal identity, His long-suffering with the children of Israel, and the very personal love He showed to the Nephites helps me remember that He who has "graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands"35 cannot forget us but is in this for the long haul. And seeing His endurance helps me endure a little longer too.<br><br>• And, finally, enduring to the end36 gets me nearer to Him--because it is at the end I will find Him!<br><h2><strong>Abiding in Him--The Only True Precept</strong></h2><br>It is both the reading and abiding that gets us nearer to God, and that allows us to accept His invitation to come unto Him and be saved because we cannot be saved in ignorance. We cannot receive all that our Father has without understanding all that He is and does. And so we perform the ultimate experiment by planting the seed in our own hearts. We nourish it with patience and faith until it becomes "a tree, springing up in [us] unto everlasting life,"37 throwing out a branch of charity here and virtue there and overcoming the natural man in the process. Through His incomparable Atonement, Christ offers to us the fruit of the tree if we will fall down and partake of it.38 And if we do, then "when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."39 We will not only get nearer to Him spiritually but nearer to being like Him, and you can't get any nearer than that.<br><br>Elder Holland taught that to "abide" means "'to remain, to stay' . . . but stay forever."40 If we will abide in these precepts, they will abide in us. More important, if we will abide in these precepts, we will abide in Him whose precepts these are, and He will abide in us41--"permanently, unyieldingly, steadfastly, [and] forever."42<br><br>Thus Christ, of whom the Book of Mormon bears witness, is the ultimate precept. It is of Him that our lives must bear witness as we accept His invitation to come unto Him and become like Him.43 And it is of Him and His living reality that I bear witness.

<h1>sionary All Your Life - Quentin L. Cook - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I consider it a great privilege and responsibility to be given this opportunity to speak to you. After I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I asked President Samuelson what I should talk about.<br><br>He said, "You are the executive director of the Missionary Department. Why don't you talk about missionary work?"<br><br>I have decided to follow his counsel.<br><br>You are a magnificent sight! Many of you are recently returned from full-time missions. Many of you will soon be full-time missionaries. I hope all of you are committed to being lifelong missionaries.<br><br>Some feel this is a difficult time to do missionary work. A Gallup Poll three weeks ago found 46 percent of Americans view "Mormons" unfavorably, 11 percent don't know who we are, and 18 percent think of polygamy when our name is mentioned.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Let's put this in perspective. In 1842 John Wentworth, editor of the <i>Chicago Democrat,</i> wrote to Joseph Smith requesting information about the Church. The Church had been organized 12 years earlier and had just over 20,000 members. The Prophet Joseph replied and concluded his response by using the Standard of Truth as a preface to what we know today as the Thirteen Articles of Faith.<br><br>As I tour missions, many missionaries memorize the Standard of Truth. It conveys in a concise way what must be accomplished. As I recite it, I invite those of you who know it to say it with me:<br><br><i>No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Who is going to help achieve this? You and your generation!<br><br>I believe with all of my heart that we are on the threshold of the most significant missionary success to date. Let me share two accounts of those who have been converted in the recent past.<br><br>The conversion of Jordan Vajda, a fine young man who had been a Catholic priest, is instructive. When he was in grade school he had Latter-day Saint friends in his class who shared with him their love of the gospel. At age 13 he found an offer from the Church for a free Book of Mormon. He sent for it, and two sister missionaries responded. They were surprised that he was only 13 and had requested the Book of Mormon. He was impressed with what they taught and what he felt, but after discussions with his family, he decided to become a priest in the Catholic Church. As he prepared to be a priest, he remained interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>He studied at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He became acquainted with many who take the position we are not Christians, but he also associated with the students at the Latter-day Saint institute of religion at Berkeley. He decided to write a master's thesis on why certain people maintain that we are not Christians. Two of the issues he addressed in his master's thesis were:<br><br>1. The nature of God and our belief that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ are the two separate individuals the Prophet Joseph beheld in the First Vision.<br><br>2. Exaltation and our belief in eternal progression--that we can progress to live with and be like God.<br><br>He compared these doctrinal issues with Pre–Nicene Creed early Christian writers and determined that there was significant support for the position of the Church of Jesus Christ. He concluded in his master's thesis, which has since been published by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies:<br><br><i>Ironically, those who would excoriate Mormons for believing in the doctrine of exaltation actually agree with them that the early church experienced a "great apostasy" on fundamental doctrinal questions.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>This was primarily an academic pursuit. He became a priest in the Dominican order and had assignments in Arizona and then at the University of Washington. There he came in contact with our missionaries.<br><br>After being taught by missionaries and praying sincerely, he received inspiration that he should resign as a Catholic priest and be baptized and confirmed into the Church of Jesus Christ. His letter of resignation expressed his love and appreciation for the Catholic Church and then stated:<br><br><i>But why am I doing what I am doing? To put it most simply: I have found a fuller truth and goodness and beauty in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After years of study and reflection, I have come to believe that the LDS Church is the only true and living Church of Jesus Christ, guided and led by living apostles and prophets.</i><br><br><i>I believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, called and ordained for this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. I love the Book of Mormon; I believe it to be the word of God for us in these latter days.</i><br><br><i>I can no longer deny my feelings, my heart, my conscience. I cannot deny the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost which has come after much prayer and soul-searching. At this point in my life, at this moment, as I look forward to and prepare for my convert baptism, I have found a happiness greater than I ever imagined possible.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>This good man is completely active in the Church, has been to the temple, teaches the Gospel Doctrine class in his ward, and has a management position in a hospital in Seattle.<br><br>The gospel truly changes people's lives. Last month I met the missionaries who taught a family of five in South Carolina last year. The father of this wonderful African-American family was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. His father had abandoned his mother when he was very young. He said his "angel mother" worked hard every day of her life to keep them from being homeless. He cannot remember one fun day as a child or as a teenager. He stated, "Other than the love of my mother, I felt very much alone in this world." He served in the navy on the aircraft carrier <i>Kitty Hawk,</i> where he learned discipline, organization, and order. He subsequently met and married his sweetheart, and they have three children. They came in contact with the missionaries, and he subsequently wrote:<br><br><i>The missionaries taught us to pray. They taught us about the Restoration. They taught us about revelation and truth. As they bore their testimonies, my heart became softened and I saw in their eyes the truth of what they said. In my whole life I have never seen such sincerity and love. On May 5, 2006, my family was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br><i>Now I really do believe that I have found my place in this world.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>He has received the Melchizedek Priesthood, he baptized his eight-year-old daughter two weeks ago, and the family is planning on going to the temple this May to be sealed for time and all eternity.<br><br>Listen carefully to the requirements for baptism as set forth in D&amp;amp;C 20:37:<br><br><i>All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.</i><br><br>When you think of the two accounts I recited and realize that there were over 270,000 wonderful converts who met the requirements for baptism last year, you get some idea of the significance of missionary work.<br><br>These two accounts emphasize the great joy that comes into the lives of new converts.<br><br>People all over the world are seeking permanent happiness. The prominent magazine <i>The Economist</i>, in its holiday double issue, featured "happiness" on its cover and as its lead story. In one article it noted that increased national economic success had not increased happiness. "Happiness ... has hardly changed over 50 years. ... Rich countries do not get happier as they get richer."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Happiness has little to do with material wealth. Nor does permanent happiness come from entertainment or fun and games. Instead of being diversions from an otherwise productive life, these pursuits have become all-consuming to many people.<br><br>The lead article on happiness in <i>The Economist</i> quoted Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, as questioning: "How many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of frivolous utility?"<sup>7</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, much of what is available today is not just frivolous but also morally reprehensible.<br><br>Contrast this with those who prepare for baptism with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.<br><br>We all face problems and challenges. The rain falls on the just and the unjust, but those who accept the gospel and live righteously have a wonderful promise in D&amp;amp;C 59:23: "But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come."<br><br>Peace in this life does not come from merely pursuing worldly objectives. Eternal life, especially exaltation, does not come from pursuing merely worldly objectives.<br><br>Our challenge is to share the joyous, eternally significant gospel with our brothers and sisters so they can find peace and happiness and exaltation.<br><br>With this in mind, how can we be effective missionaries?<br><h3><strong><i>First: Be a missionary all your life.</i></strong></h3><br>President David O. McKay taught that every member is a missionary, and it is as true today as when it was first declared.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has said it this way: "Great is our work, tremendous is our responsibility in helping to find those to teach. The Lord has laid upon us a mandate to teach the gospel to every creature."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, "After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel."<sup>9</sup><br><h3><strong><i>Second: Overcome feelings of hesitancy or inadequacy.</i></strong></h3><br>The account of the first missionary to serve outside of North America in this dispensation is inspiring.<br><br>In June of 1837, in the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith whispered to Heber C. Kimball that "the Spirit of the Lord" had spoken that Heber should "go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation."<sup>10</sup><br><br>At the time Heber C. Kimball was 36 years old. He had been a member of the Church for five years and an Apostle for two years. He had a wife and small children, and he was the first missionary called to serve outside of North America.<br><br>A financial panic had swept over the country and the Church in 1837. It was not an auspicious time for Joseph or Heber to commence such a project. But, as Joseph said, "the Spirit of the Lord" had directed the action.<br><br>Heber recorded his reaction: "O, Lord, I am a man of stammering tongue, and altogether unfit for such a work; how can I go to preach in that land."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Almost everyone who attempts missionary work feels inadequate in some way. The idea of such a mission was almost more than Heber could bear, but his faith and obedience prevailed. He stated:<br><br><i>However, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of duty; the moment I understood the will of my Heavenly Father, I felt a determination to go at all hazards, believing that He would support me by His almighty power, and endow me with every qualification that I needed; ... I felt that the cause of truth, the Gospel of Christ, outweighed every other consideration.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Just think of the challenge of being a missionary and opening a new country without members, church buildings, a mission home, or any funds.<br><br>Despite these feelings of inadequacy, Elder Kimball worked hard and was very humble. He and his companions were very successful.<br><h3><strong><i>Third: Do not be discouraged because missionary work is hard.</i></strong></h3><br>The New Testament tells of the Apostle Paul's visit to Athens. Paul wanted to proclaim the message of the resurrected Christ. Certain philosophers invited Paul to Mars Hill. Acts 17:21, speaking of Paul's audience, states: "For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing."<br><br>Doesn't that sound like the world we live in now? When the Athenians realized that Paul was speaking of the risen Savior, some of them mocked him, and the more polite but still not interested said, in verse 32, "We will hear thee again of this matter." The situation in our own day is not a lot different. Missionaries experience this kind of rejection every day.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve, in speaking about how hard missionary work is and has been, said:<br><br><i>I am convinced that missionary work is not easy because</i> salvation is not a cheap experience. <i>Salvation </i>never<i> was easy. We are The Church of Jesus Christ, this is the truth, and He is our Great Eternal Head. How could we believe it would be easy for us when it was never, ever easy for Him?</i><sup>13</sup><br><h3><strong><i>Fourth: Be a good example and take every opportunity to share the gospel.</i></strong></h3><br>Paul counseled Timothy, "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>14</sup> It is not enough to preach the gospel. One must also live the gospel. Very often people are receptive to being taught because they have had a positive experience with a Church member.<br><br>I know one BYU graduate who is a great example, loves people, loves the Lord, and has a great desire to be everyone's friend and share the gospel.<br><br>He points out that there is a mirror quality to conversation. If we talk about the weather, people respond by talking about the weather. If we talk about sports, they respond by talking about sports. This friend says he asks people he meets about their school and listens intently. After they respond by asking him about his school, he tells them about BYU and then shares his testimony of the gospel. Then, in a positive way, he offers to let them learn more from the missionaries. He has been very successful in sharing the gospel. He has also remained on excellent terms with his friends who do not respond to his challenge because he genuinely loves them and is interested in them.<br><br>One sister in France who is a great missionary talks every day about the joy she receives in teaching Primary children and ends up having many gospel conversations and many referrals for the missionaries.<br><br>Elder Clayton M. Christensen, who is a professor at Harvard Business School and an Area Seventy, indicated:<br><br><i>I have learned to use terms that associate me with Mormonism in my conversations--comments about my mission to Korea, my children's missions, my assignments in the Church, my having attended Brigham Young University, and so on. These comments open the door for a conversation about the Church. Most who notice that I have opened this door choose not to walk through it. A few do, however, usually saying, "So you're a Mormon?" I then ask if they'd like to learn more about us.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve are the missionary committee of the Church and oversee all aspects of missionary work. President Hinckley became president of the Church 12 years ago yesterday--March 12, 1995. Under his prophetic guidance a great deal has been accomplished. Let me give you some numbers describing what has happened during those 12 years:<br><br>• Approximately 387,750 missionaries have entered the mission field, which represents almost 40 percent of the missionaries who have ever served in this dispensation.<br><br>• About 3,400,000 converts have been baptized, which is the equivalent of more than one-fourth of the total current membership of the Church.<br><br>• The total number of missions in the Church has increased from 303 to 347.<br><br>• The number of converts increased by almost 30,000 in 2006.<br><br>• Retention as measured by sacrament meeting attendance, priesthood ordinations, and tithing faithfulness has increased significantly.<br><br>I am very enthusiastic about where we are at this time in missionary work. But, as President Hinckley always counsels the Brethren, "We can still do better."<br><br><i>Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service</i> was first introduced in October 2004. President Hinckley commenced this effort in an address to all General Authorities. He called for the missionaries to learn the doctrine and teach the principles by the Spirit in their own words and avoid rote recitations of the discussions. The First Presidency subsequently "raised the bar" on missionary worthiness standards and instructed the Missionary Executive Council to bring forth the new guide to missionary service.<br><br>Every member of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve participated to a significant degree. The Missionary Executive Council, under the direction of Elder M. Russell Ballard, and the Missionary Department were inspired in their efforts. It literally felt like the windows of heaven were opened and the Lord's inspiration poured out to bring forth this great resource.<br><br>I was deeply touched when President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of Twelve, speaking of <i>Preach My Gospel,</i> said, "It was designed beyond the veil and put together here."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Over 1.4 million copies of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> have been acquired by members of the Church. I hope you will all become familiar with this great missionary guide. It will help strengthen you to live worthily to receive sacred temple ordinances. For you young men, it will help prepare you for mission service. For you sisters, it will help you apply doctrine in a future role as a wife or mother, and, if you choose to serve a full-time mission, you will be prepared to preach the gospel.<sup>17</sup><br><br>There are great blessings, including eternal joy, in helping to bring souls unto Christ.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Among the blessings of being a full-time missionary are the lifelong relationships you develop with missionary companions. Let me share one account with you that will help those of you who have not served missions to understand this better. This is from a letter a junior companion wrote to his senior companion who had trained him 33 years earlier. I quote in part:<br><br><i>I want you to know how much you have meant to me as I have often thought of you over the years since we served together 33 years ago. You have been one of the guiding influences in my life.</i><br><br><i>I appreciated you keeping all the mission rules. ...</i><br><br><i>I remember a particularly cold and rainy day. It was about a half hour before the time to go back to the apartment. It had been raining all day, and I was wet and tired. We had stopped our bikes on the corner of an intersection. ... We had done everything on the list we had prepared that morning; there was nothing else to be done. You looked at your watch, which showed a half hour left in our day. Then you looked over at me. I knew what you were thinking. I knew you were trying to decide whether or not to go home. After all, we were both wet, and we were far from our apartment. I tried to look as cold and as tired as I possibly could in the hopes that I could sway you in your decision.</i><br><br><i>"Let's knock on the doors of the houses on this street," you said. With that, we spent one more half hour in the rain and cold. And with that, you taught a new missionary what it meant to keep the mission rules. ...</i><br><br><i>From that moment on, when I wanted to go home early I didn't! The blessings earned in those last few minutes of every day resulted in at least two conversions that I had while laboring later in my mission. I think it might be appropriate for you to list</i> me <i>among your converts. I love you, Elder.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Other blessings of serving a mission are having the opportunity of being nurtured under the guidance of a mission president who has been called by inspiration; developing gospel knowledge and study habits that will serve you well throughout your life; and achieving the enormous strength that comes from doing something that is very challenging. Having increased faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the restoration of His gospel is a most significant blessing.<br><br>But the most important reason for going on a mission and being committed to missionary work throughout your life is because it is doctrinally what the Savior has asked us to do.<br><br>The last chapters of Matthew, Mark, and Luke; the last two chapters of John; and the first eight verses of Acts contain the only New Testament accounts of the risen Christ. Suppose for a minute that you had been a disciple of the Savior during His life here on earth. Suppose you had believed His teachings. Can you imagine how wonderful it would have been to actually behold the risen Lord? Can you imagine how attentive you would have been to His message?<br><br>There may have been other things the risen Lord taught that were not recorded, but the overwhelming message in each of the accounts was to preach His gospel.<br><br>The next-to-last verse in Matthew is a good example: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<sup>20</sup><br><br>We could go to almost any part of the Book of Mormon for the same message. Think of Alma and his lifelong commitment to bring souls unto repentance even when he was the head of state.<br><br>What about missionary work in this dispensation?<br><br>I am particularly impressed with section 112 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It was the only revelation recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants for 1837, and it was received on the same day the gospel was first publicly preached in England--which was the first time the gospel was preached outside of North America (July 23, 1837). Elder Kimball's wife, Vilate, sent him a letter that summer in 1837. She wrote, in part:<br><br><i>I know not where to begin to write or what to say to you first for the multitude of thoughts that rush upon my mind. You see I have filled a good part of my sheet with a revelation which I thought would be more interesting to you than anything else I could write. I copied it from Elder</i> [Thomas] <i>Marsh's book as he wrote it from Joseph's mouth.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>There is much that could be said about section 112, but verse 21 is particularly significant for those preparing to serve missions. It states:<br><br><i>And again, I say unto you, that whosoever ye shall send in my name, by the voice of your brethren, the Twelve, duly recommended and authorized by you, shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation whithersoever ye shall send them.</i><br><br>That describes our missionaries today. Every missionary is called to serve by the prophet and assigned to a field of labor by one of the Twelve Apostles.<br><br>As I see missionaries all over the world--including here in North America--teaching investigators in so many languages, it is inspiring to reflect on D&amp;amp;C 90:11:<br><br><i>For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power.</i><br><br>Missionary work is not just one of the 88 keys on a piano that is occasionally played; it is a major chord in a compelling melody that needs to be played continuously throughout our lives if we are to remain in harmony with our commitment to Christianity and the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>My specific challenge to each of you is to make a commitment to be a missionary for the rest of your life.<br><br>I interviewed a new missionary a few months ago who had been a member for just over a year. He had just arrived in the mission field. He told me how his friend, who was a Latter-day Saint, had gone on a mission and then referred his name to the missionaries in his hometown. Those missionaries then taught and baptized him.<br><br>If you look at your group of friends back home, there are many who would respond to the gospel if you would have the faith to share the message of the Restoration with them.<br><br>What we desperately need is for member-missionary work to become a way of life--for the Savior's mandate to share the gospel to become part of who we are.<br><br>I pray that this generation of leaders here at BYU, along with your colleagues across the world, will follow the Savior's counsel and the prophetic counsel of all of the prophets of this dispensation to preach the gospel throughout your lives.<br><br>I would like to echo and reaffirm the words of Alma the Younger as recorded in Alma 5:45:<br><br><i>And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself? Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.</i><br><br>I bear my personal witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ, that Joseph Smith is the prophet of this dispensation and that missionary work is divinely appointed and the lifeblood of the Church, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Quentin L. Cook was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 13 March 2007.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <i>Americans' Views of the Mormon Religion,</i> poll conducted by the Gallup News Service, February 22–25, 2007; http://galluppoll.com/content/default.aspx?ci=26758; see also "Opinions Are Diverse on 'Those Mormons,'" <i>Deseret News,</i> 3 March 2007, A01.<br><br>2. <i>HC</i> 4:540.<br><br>3.

<br>
Brothers and sisters, isn't language interesting?<br><br>For example, a bus station is where a bus stops. A train station is where a train stops. On my desk is a work station. It is where...<br><br>At church we hope those who sit on the stand understand how long we can stand to sit.<br><br>When they grow on vines, blackberries when green are red. Wireless BlackBerries when read in class make green instructors blue.<br><br>The title of my talk--Live Right Now--also has dual meaning. "Live right now" can mean "live--right now." It can also mean "live right--now." Both meanings testify to the supernal blessings of choice--what the scriptures call "moral agency" (D&amp;amp;C 101:78).<br><br>"Live--right now" doesn't mean eat, drink, and be merry for my class project isn't due until tomorrow! It means that, while we learn from the past and plan for the future, we make decisions in the present. The nature of mortality is we live--right now.<br><br>"Live right--now" is also key to joy in both time and eternity. The metrics of faith, repentance, covenants, and receptiveness to the Holy Ghost are all and always tied to our living righteously. Today's choices shape tomorrow's decisions.<br><br>Choice is as eternal as we are. Our opportunity to exercise moral agency in mortality is one of God's great gifts. Yet we make many of life's most important choices before we are constitutionally qualified to run for Congress (age 25)! Faith, marriage, career--these and other important decisions loom as large as an 18-wheeler barreling toward you at breakneck speed, and you have the uneasy feeling objects in the rearview mirror are even larger than they appear.<br><br>Choices--we may put them off but we can't escape them. Choices reveal, define, and refine us. We have the gift of the Holy Ghost. When we make mistakes--and we all do--there is always a way back. And the way back is the way forward. The Savior's Atonement helps us see the Lord's promises fulfilled in our lives.<br><br>As part of living right now, let me speak in turn about choice, promptings, and promises.<br><h2><b>Choice</b></h2><br>First, choice.<br><br>I once substituted in a teenage Sunday School class. These were good kids, but they challenged me as I walked in. "Brother Gong," they said, "Sunday School is boring. We've heard everything before."<br><br>I thought for a moment, then asked, "Have you ever talked about the quintessential existential dilemmas of moral agency?"<br><br>The class said, "Huh?"<br><br>I asked if they were willing to learn together.<br><br>They were, so we did.<br><br><i>Quintessential</i> means in a "pure and most concentrated form"; <i>existential</i> means "grounded in the experience of existence"; and <i>dilemma--</i>well, you know a dilemma means "a problem involving a difficult choice."<br><br>So quintessential existential dilemmas (QEDs, for short) are the challenges inherent in making life's most important and defining choices. The terminology may be new, but the dilemmas essential to real choice are as old as the Fall. Maybe new words can help us think more deeply about our choices as we seek to live right in the right now.<br><br>Please remember mortality involves, well, real choices! "There is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11) so we can act for ourselves, being enticed by the one (sweet) or the other (bitter) (see 2 Nephi 2:15–16). The remarkable truth "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25) assures us existential choice need not engender forlornness, anguish, and despair (as described by Jean-Paul Sartre) but, ultimately, the joy for which men and women are.<br><br>Let's consider four illustrative examples of what I mean by QEDs.<br><br>First QED: We are enjoined to "be anxiously engaged in a good cause" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27) but not to run faster than we have strength (see Mosiah 4:27; D&amp;amp;C 10:4). Often everything happens at once: big class assignment, family home evening, service project, extra work shift--and the cute guy or girl on the second row in American Heritage finally smiled shyly and asked if you could get together. How do we diligently do all things "in wisdom and order" (Mosiah 4:27)?<br><br>Another QED: We know we should pray but may not know what to pray for. The scriptures instruct that we "must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place [we] shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate [our] performance unto [our good]" (2 Nephi 32:9). Yet the scriptures also remind us we do not know "what we should pray for as we ought" (Romans 8:26). Left on our own, we quickly discover "there is none that doeth good, no, not one" (Psalm 14:3; see also Moroni 10:25, Matthew 19:17, Mark 10:18).<br><br>We do understand neither waiting to be told all things nor doing everything on our own leads to happiness. Those who wait for absolute inspiration find themselves paralyzed, sometimes susceptible to deception from uninspired sources. Those who never seek Heavenly Father's inspiration sometimes get what they thought they wanted. You know the expression: "Be careful what you ask for."<br><br>Choosing to trust in God takes faith. The best guide of all as we seek to choose faith in every footstep is the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. Teaches President Boyd K. Packer:<br><br><i>Once you really determine to follow that guide, your testimony will grow and you will find provisions set out along the way in unexpected places, as evidence that someone knew that you would be traveling that way.</i> ["Spiritual Crocodiles," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1976, 31]<br><br>On occasion, in unexpected places, I have been grateful--as you have been--to find such provisions.<br><br>A third kind of QED reflects our sincere desire to submit our will to Heavenly Father. How do we say "Thy will be done" and truly mean "I want what He wants"?<br><br>Remember the great prophet Abraham? He was told he would miraculously have a son and then commanded to sacrifice that son.<br><br>While they were traveling together in the Holy Land, Professor Truman Madsen once asked President Hugh B. Brown:<br><br><i>"Why ... was Abraham commanded to go to Mount Moriah and offer his only hope of posterity."</i><br><br><i>It was clear that </i>[President Brown], <i>nearly ninety, had thought and prayed and wept over that question before.</i> [President Brown] <i>finally said, "Abraham needed to learn something about Abraham."</i> [Truman G. Madsen, <i>The Highest in Us</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978), 49]<br><br>Happily, most choices are not Abrahamic tests. But mortal choices let us learn and choose something about ourselves. In a sense, mortality is the ultimate "choose your own adventure." Each choice opens new opportunities to choose and closes others.<br><br>As we choose the Lord and obey His commandments, we come to understand and accept His will. Indeed, as we<br><br><i>reconcile</i> [our]<i>selves to the will of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; </i>[we]<i> remember, after </i>[we]<i> are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God that </i>[we]<i> are saved.</i> [2 Nephi 10:24]<br><br>In chapter 10 of Helaman, Nephi became so faithful and obedient the Lord promised, "All things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will" (Helaman 10:5; see also D&amp;amp;C 46:30).<br><br>Each semester our student stake executive secretary and clerks schedule many temple recommend interviews. Over the years Vince Shrader, Clinton Sandy, Hyrum Wright, Jeremy Johnson, Paul Orgill, Stephen Ricks, Andrew McNabb, and others have served faithfully. I love meeting all our members, including happily engaged couples.<br><br>May I share something I've observed about what makes happy couples happy? Happy couples CTR the DTR. They Choose The Right in Defining The Relationship. They let the spiritual lead the physical. In ways small and large, whether just starting to date, courting, or during their engagement, happy couples set distinct, appropriate bounds before marriage that bless all aspects of their lives--now and later. Living right now makes possible living happily later.<br><br>In interviews I sometimes say, "My purpose as your priesthood leader in asking these questions--about testimony, tithing, the law of chastity, etc.--is not to keep you from entering the temple. It is to help you know that when you are in the house of the Lord you are worthy to receive every blessing pronounced upon you."<br><br>The Lord wants us to qualify for every blessing. Indeed, "There is a law, ... And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21).<br><br>Never underestimate seemingly small decisions. This includes how we choose to dress, speak, or otherwise portray ourselves.<br><br>In a Sunday School class in our student stake, I asked, "Do you protect your credit card and financial identity?" Every hand went up. I then asked, "Do you protect your spiritual identity in how you dress, speak, or portray yourself online?" I invited volunteers to share their MySpace or Facebook profiles. Would you feel comfortable showing your profile in Sunday School--or on the big screen at this devotional?<br><br>What would your parents or bishop, or your current or future spouse or children, think about you spiritually if they saw the profile you use today?<br><br>By the way, many employers now review profiles of and other online information about prospective employees before hiring them. Many screen names are functional or fun. But how would an employer feel about hiring winkydink cutiepie pinkygirl hotty14 to write important legal briefs? Would they hire hotstuff dabomb rm34 to put a mature face on the firm's new regional office?<br><br>Life doesn't stop while we wait for answers. As a member of our student stake put it, "The pioneers received inspiration as the wagon wheels turned." Remember the Lord's counsel:<br><br><i>Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 123:17]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley's life is a testimony of how to both pray and work. "Get on your knees and ask for help, and then get up and go to work, and you'll be able to find your way through almost any situation," he says. His good advice for university students and for all of us is also, "If you go to bed at 10:00 and get up by 6:00 a.m., things will work out for you." (In Sheri L. Dew, <i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 167.)<br><br>My wife, Susan, and I courted across two hemispheres. She was teaching in Provo. I was studying at Oxford University in England while trying to learn everything I could about her from across the Atlantic Ocean. Call it "distance education" of the best kind. It's one reason I can honestly say I earned a PhD in international relations.<br><br>Both Susan and I knew what we wanted, but we also sought the Lord's confirming inspiration.<br><br>I prayed many times before I found the right way to ask the right question in a way that felt right for me. It was not just "Should I marry Susan?" That is, "Please tell me what to do." It was also to say humbly, "I want to ask Susan to marry me. Please confirm this decision, which I have made with all my heart." We waited and listened with faith for His quiet confirmation--answers that come according to each varied circumstance.<br><br>During his final visit to BYU, Elder Neal A. Maxwell quoted lines of verse given him by Professor John Sorenson. The verses describe<br><br><i>a great stallion at full gallop in a meadow, who--</i><br><br><i>at his master's voice--seizes up to a stunned but instant halt....</i><br><br><i>... only the velvet ears</i><br><br><i>prick forward, awaiting the next order.</i><br><br>[Mary Karr, "Who the Meek Are Not," <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> 289, no. 5 (May 2002), 64]<br><br>Said Elder Maxwell, "Do you see a new picture of meekness being at 'full gallop' but with 'velvet ears'?" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Blending Research and Revelation," remarks at BYU President's Leadership Council meeting, 19 March 2004).<br><br>A fourth quintessential existential dilemma: How do I distinguish between promptings of the Spirit and my own personal feelings? In this month's <i>Ensign,</i> Elder Dallin H. Oaks reminds us humility precedes inspiration (see "Humility Precedes Inspiration," <i>Ensign,</i> March 2007, 61; quoted from Oaks, "I Have a Question," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1983, 27).<br><br>Humbly seeking inspiration while fully obeying all the commandments will help us determine if we are attracted to that cute girl or guy by spiritual prompting or as a response to a Madison Avenue perfume or aftershave. It can help us know when we are giving or receiving a priesthood blessing that what we are saying or hearing is not only what our own heart may earnestly want (or not want) but is in fact the will, mind, word, and voice of the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C 68:3–4).<br><br>By definition, QEDs involve real choices. We choose not only between good and evil but often between good and good. Happily, we are not alone as we seek to live right now.<br><h2><b>Promptings</b></h2><br>Promptings from Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost can help us live right now. I am grateful Heavenly Father respects perfectly our agency and at the same time--in circumstances and at times He knows best--also prompts and guides us.<br><br>In the spirit of a devotional, let me briefly share four personal experiences where promptings taught me how the Lord will guide us as we make our own best choices while seeking inspiration.<br><br>First, promptings sometimes open unanticipated opportunities to help others.<br><br>With us here today is a wonderful woman who shared this experience. She arrived at her local supermarket and felt prompted to enter through a different door than the one she normally used. She found herself in a less familiar section of the store.<br><br>There she couldn't help overhearing a conversation. It went something like this.<br><br>"Can't we get jam? I like jam with peanut butter. Besides, you chose last time."<br><br>"Maybe so, but we need more protein. Cold cuts have more protein than jam."<br><br>Two young men wearing white shirts and name tags and holding a small calculator were confronting a tight missionary food budget. While cold cuts or jam may not constitute a classic quintessential existential dilemma, the dilemma of choosing cold cuts or jam was real.<br><br>The generous woman said, "Elders, please put both the cold cuts and jam in your basket. I would be so happy if you would let me pay for your food this week."<br><br>She told me, "I was glad Heavenly Father prompted me to go through a different door and allowed me to help those faithful elders in a small way."<br><br>Second, promptings sometimes come when our hearts go out to someone else.<br><br>While serving as a branch president in another country, I interviewed for baptism a young man with a strong testimony. He had traveled many miles over many hours on a trip I knew he could probably afford to make only once.<br><br>As we discussed the law of chastity, he hung his head. "I want to be baptized," he said, "but I am living with someone and we're not married."<br><br>As my heart went out to him, an impression came. It was very clear: "Ask him what he means by being married." I said, "Please tell me what you mean by being married."<br><br>He said, "Well, we went down to the government office and registered as a married couple, but we didn't have money for a family wedding banquet."<br><br>"Wait! You are married in the government's eyes, and not married only in the sense you haven't had a family wedding banquet?"<br><br>"Yes," he said, "we are legally married."<br><br>That worthy young husband was baptized. As I recall, there was later even a family wedding banquet.<br><br>Third, promptings sometimes comfort or prepare us for things Heavenly Father knows are coming.<br><br>Some years ago I awoke one morning with a clear but curious impression: I should use frequent-flier miles to upgrade my parents' airplane tickets for their visit to our family in Virginia. I had the tickets upgraded, then forgot completely about it.<br><br>During the visit my father was very tired one afternoon but wanted to go with me as I ran errands. Although I thought he should really stay and rest, I happily agreed for us to run the errands together. Somewhere between the laundry and the grocery store, I had a quiet feeling my father would not visit again.<br><br>A few months later I was attending a business conference in Kyoto, Japan, when I received word my father had unexpectedly died. I cried for many days. But, as I looked back, I realized I had been lovingly prepared in advance. Earlier small promptings regarding plane tickets and running errands later provided great comfort.<br><br>Fourth, promptings sometimes come at the very instant we need them to help us address questions important to someone else.<br><br>Once, in a country with customs and beliefs different from those of the U.S., I was riding in a car with a fine leader of another religion. He said, "Dr. Gong, I have a test for you."<br><br>I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. I thought he would move to another topic, but he didn't. He was quite serious.<br><br>"Imagine you are traveling in my country," he said. "You are invited inside a very humble home. You're offered a small glass of lime juice to drink. What do you do?"<br><br>At first I wondered if he were testing whether I dared drink the local juice. His was a more difficult question than that.<br><br>I knew the family was offering their best. I thought, perhaps I should thank the family but not drink the lime juice. This would acknowledge their generosity but not consume the precious juice. But might they feel insulted that I thought their offering too little or not good enough?<br><br>Alternatively, I thought maybe I should thank the family and drink the juice. This would acknowledge their generosity but could be awkward if they felt obliged to bring more juice--which they might not have. All this went through my mind in a flash.<br><br>"So what do you think?" my host asked again.<br><br>I was silent for a minute. Then, with a prayer in my heart, I opened my mouth, not yet knowing what I would say. It was then it came. What I said surprised us both.<br><br>"I would thank the family profusely," I said. "Then I would drink part of the juice and say, 'Your generosity is so great, I am unable to finish.'"<br><br>He clapped his hands. "You understand the hearts of my people," he said warmly. In a way that surprised and moved me, it mattered to this great leader that someone understood.<br><br>Sometimes it is "right now," in the instant, that we learn things important to someone else (see D&amp;amp;C 100:6).<br><br>I share these personal examples--which we each have in our lives--to testify Heavenly Father loves us more and knows us better than we do ourselves. We can seek the guiding whisperings of the Holy Spirit. We can be grateful on occasion for pre-positioned provisions along our path. We can "gallop with velvet ears." And we can make our best decisions knowing--on occasions and in circumstances He determines--His promptings will bless us and those around us by opening choices we would not otherwise have known.<br><h2><b>Promises</b></h2><br>As we make our best choices and follow guiding promptings in a consistent effort to live right now, we unlock the Lord's promises in our lives.<br><br>One of the Lord's promises is that His Son will be our Savior and Redeemer.<br><br>Human choices are inevitably incomplete and incorrect, and they often have unintended, or even sometimes destructive consequences.<br><br>Human choices require atonement.<br><br>We have all had experiences where we tried to be helpful and weren't. I once arrived early for priesthood meeting. Thinking I could help ready our classroom, I erased the blackboard dense with writing. As he began our lesson, our dedicated instructor said, with surprise but without criticism, "I came early and put our lesson on the board, but somehow it's been erased." The class turned out fine, but I remember the forbearance of our priesthood teacher who, incidentally, is today's U.S. Senate majority leader.<br><br>That's a simple example. What about the roommate who inadvertently hurts the tender feelings of another roommate in a way that causes her to stop coming to church? What about the friend who accidentally fatally injures his best friend in a car accident?<br><br>In each of our lives things happen that make us stop and consider what is most important. A heart attack, a near drowning, a suicide--the sudden jolt of death, injury, or major changes make us seek at-one-ment. At these tender moments, the four things that matter most find expression as "thank you," "I love you," "please forgive me," and "I forgive you" (Ira Byock, <i>The Four Things That Matter Most</i> [New York: Free Press, 2004], 3).<br><br>Each of these phrases is an echo of the Atonement. In each we feel our Savior's love for us as we extend His love and forgiveness to others. Each eases pain, offers hope and comfort, and reconciles injustices and hurts that come from living in a world of sticks and stones.<br><br>And we don't have to wait for death or trauma. The Savior's Atonement can infuse our role relationships, experiences, and knowledges right now. Our lives become richer, more peaceful, and more whole as we say with all our hearts "thank you," "I love you," "please forgive me," and "I forgive you."<br><br>Atonement ultimately comes because of our Savior's "infinite and eternal," "great and last sacrifice" (Alma 34:13–14). He knows "according to the flesh how to succor his people" (Alma 7:12). He can heal us. He can comfort and bless those hurt by our mistakes, by our imperfect choices.<br><br>As we always remember Him and keep His commandments and always have His Spirit to be with us (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77), we recognize another great scriptural promise:<br><br><i>Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>Face matters. We face the facts. We <i>Face the Nation.</i> As the musical based on Victor Hugo's <i>Les Misé</i> concludes, Eponine, Fantine, and Jean Valjean sing together "To love another person is to see the face of God" (<i>Les Misé,</i> finale, act 2 [French lyrics, Alain Boublil; English lyrics, Herbert Kretzmer; music, Claude-Michel Schö]).<br><br>Do you know the scriptures contain by one count some 635 references to <i>face</i> and some 22 references to <i>face-to-face?</i> This includes precious accounts where great prophets including Moses, Abraham, Jacob, Enoch, the brother of Jared, Moroni, and the Prophet Joseph Smith all saw and spoke with God "face to face."<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar recently testified, "The scriptures contain the words of Christ and are a reservoir of living water." He taught us how to read, study, search, and feast upon the words of Christ ("A Reservoir of Living Water," fireside address, 4 February 2007). I am grateful I can seek and ponder connections, patterns, and themes such as "face" and "face-to-face."<br><br>In our day some say an unknowable God has no face. Some say God must not exist because scientific measures do not detect Him. Some say God exists only as an idea or spirit. How blessed we are to know He has a name, a voice, a face (see D&amp;amp;C 93:1), indeed, "a body of flesh and bones [only glorified]; the Son also" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br>We approach our Heavenly Father in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. To me, this too is a wonderful quintessential existential dilemma. We do not presume overfamiliarity as we speak of or with our Heavenly Father. But neither do we so fear His glory and perfection that we mistakenly think Him unapproachable or distant. He invites us to come to Him, and we do so on bended knee as His children.<br><br>"We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2).<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Let me conclude by offering five suggestions for how we can live right now:<br><br>1. Ponder your patriarchal blessing. Notice where Heavenly Father may give specific direction and where He gives only general guidance and expects you to learn how to make righteous choices.<br><br>2. Ask yourself, Are there things in my life I should start, stop, or continue doing? Seemingly small actions or attitudes carried on over time can set important long-term trajectories. "Out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>3. Study the lives of the great prophets, including Abraham. Ask how you increase your understanding, trust, and experience with the Lord so as to be prepared for challenges and opportunities in your life.<br><br>4. Review circumstances in which you received guiding promptings and how you responded to those promptings.<br><br>5. Count your many blessings. Look for ways to add "thank you," "I love you," "please forgive me," and "I forgive you" to your daily life.<br><br>May we raise our faces toward the promised day when we shall see His face and know that He is, as He encircles us in His eternal arms of mercy and safety (see Alma 5:33, 34:16; see also 3 Nephi 9:14).<br><br>Our journey complete, we will then see no longer "through a glass, darkly; but ... face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12), knowing as we are known, grateful for choices, promptings, and promises that invite us, with a fullness of joy, to live right now.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gerrit W.

<h1>g for That Which Is to Come  - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have had the rare privilege of teaching at BYU for nearly 46 years--a dream that I feared might never be realized because of my being blind. Today I would like to share some lessons gleaned from what I have taught as well as some others from my own life. Specifically, I would like to talk about the progress of the Church until the time I joined the BYU faculty in 1961, what has happened since that time, what lies ahead, and what our individual roles should be in preparing "for that which is to come" (D&amp;amp;C 1:12). I pray that the Spirit will be with us, that we might truly "understand one another, [be] edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22).<br><br>Today is April 3--a significant date in our history. Let's go back 171 years to April 3, 1836. Just one week earlier, at Kirtland, Ohio, the Saints had dedicated their first temple. They had to overcome poverty and persecution as they built the House of the Lord, and truly their sacrifice did bring "forth the blessings of heaven."<sup>1</sup> In the dedicatory service and meetings that followed during the next few days, many present saw visions or spoke in tongues. Joseph Smith's history declared that "this was a time of rejoicing long to be remembered."<sup>2</sup><br><br>These spiritual events reached a climax on Easter Sunday, April 3. After the day's services had been concluded, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery knelt in prayer. They were in the Melchizedek Priesthood pulpits, a "veil" or canvas curtain having been lowered to seclude them from the rest of the room. Joseph recorded that the Savior appeared and accepted the recently dedicated temple and promised, "I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house." The Lord prophesied that "the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice" because of the blessings made known in this temple "and the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands" (D&amp;amp;C 110:7, 9, 10).<br><br>Keys restored by other heavenly messengers on this same occasion have supported different activities of the Church over the years. The keys of gathering brought by Moses (see D&amp;amp;C 110:11) have been linked with missionary work. Significantly, the Church's first overseas mission--to Britain--was opened in 1837, just one year after Moses came.<br><br>And on the same day in 1836 Elijah the prophet restored keys that would "turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers" (D&amp;amp;C 110:15). The years immediately following his visit witnessed an upsurge of interest in family history, with important genealogical associations being organized both in Europe and America at this time. Elijah's keys are commonly associated with temple ordinances and work for the dead; these practices, incidentally, were not restored in Kirtland but rather at Nauvoo.<br><br>After Joseph Smith introduced baptism for the dead, the Saints at Nauvoo eagerly went into the Mississippi River to perform this ordinance. Then, in 1842, the Prophet gave the endowment to selected faithful Saints. Elder James E. Talmage described it as a "course of instruction" <sup>3</sup> tracing our progress from the time of the Creation until when we return to God's presence and emphasizing our need to live by high gospel ideals. In his journal Joseph Smith recorded that he had communicated the priesthood keys and principles by which the Saints could ascend into the presence of God.<sup>4</sup> At about this same time the first couples were married or sealed for eternity. This ordinance promises some of the loftiest blessings the gospel offers.<br><br>Even after the Martyrdom of Joseph Smith in 1844, the Saints at Nauvoo completed their temple. About 5,000 Saints received their eagerly anticipated endowment blessings. On February 3, 1846, however, Brigham Young urged the Saints to prepare to leave Nauvoo immediately before the enemies could hedge up the way, promising to build other temples after they had reached the mountains. Noting the people's "anxiety" to receive their temple ordinances, he agreed to continue another few days.<sup>5</sup> When I think of the eagerness of those early Saints to receive their temple blessings, I wonder if we take our easy access to temples for granted.<br><br>Following the pioneers' epic exodus, the number of temples continued to grow. The original two temples were lost, but four new ones were built in Utah during the second half of the nineteenth century. This total doubled during the first half of the twentieth century as temples were built in Hawaii, Alberta, Arizona, and Idaho. Note that it took half of a century to add just four temples. The pace surely has quickened more recently.<br><br>As I grew up in Southern California, we eagerly looked forward to the time when we would have a temple there. The annual stake temple excursions to St. George or Mesa were spiritual highlights during my youth. I was in high school when the Los Angeles Temple was announced; I was proud to show a copy of the <i>Church News</i> with an architect's rendering of the temple to friends and even teachers--although, as far as I knew, I was the only Latter-day Saint at our school. I anxiously followed the various stages of temple construction before leaving for my mission. Two and one-half years later I was released just in time to attend the temple's dedication. During the 1950s the Church also dedicated its first "overseas temples" in Switzerland, New Zealand, and England.<br><br>During this same time education had been a major component in the Church's work of "perfecting the Saints" (see Ephesians 4:12). Brigham Young Academy, founded in 1875, was the first of about 30 of these Church-sponsored high schools. As college-level courses were added, its name was changed in 1903 to Brigham Young University. During the early twentieth century seminaries and institutes provided part-time religious education to a growing number of high school and college students. With the success of these programs the Church decided during the later 1920s to close most of its schools.<br><br>In 1930, however, Church leaders explained three reasons why they were keeping BYU. First, it would be a place for training teachers. (This is still one of the largest majors on campus.) Second, faithful scholars at a Church university could interpret the discoveries of science and the results of research in the light of gospel truths. And, third, the high standards of its students would be a light to the world.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The Lord has exhorted us, "Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 115:5). In 1930 BYU had only about 2,000 students, but enrollment would explode during the years just after World War II. In more recent times, BYU performing groups, successful athletic teams, and the favorable impression students give to visitors to our campus have enabled you students to truly be a light to the world. I remember President Merrill J. Bateman here in the Marriott Center speaking about the positive impact of what he called "BYU families" on Church units and activities worldwide.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/merrill-j-bateman_zion-university-search-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a> Keep up the good work!<br><br>In 1961, when I joined the BYU faculty, the Church only had about 1.75 million members. There were only 13 temples in service. BYU's student body was about 11,000, and there were still many temporary buildings left over from the postwar boom. Now let's consider the important strides forward that I have witnessed during the years I have been here at BYU. I remember hearing something Dallin H. Oaks said at an Annual University Conference when he was president at BYU:<br><br><i>Often ... I have stood at the window of my office, looking out across the northern part of the campus to the Language Training Mission and the temple. I tell the visitors who share this sight that these three institutions--university, mission, and temple--are the most powerful combination of institutions on the face of the earth. They make this place unique in all the world.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>When I came to BYU two of these three elements were not yet present: There was no MTC and there was no temple. Gratefully I have witnessed not only growth here on campus but the addition of these other two institutions as well.<br><br>Interestingly, the beginnings of what would become the MTC took place during the same semester that I started teaching here. On December 4, 1961, I had the opportunity of attending the inaugural meeting of what was then called the Missionary Language Institute when the first 29 elders arrived. Then, in 1976, the first phase of the current MTC complex was dedicated by President Spencer W. Kimball. Once again it was my opportunity to be present at this meeting. I heard him challenge the missionaries to learn their languages well and later teach them to their children because these skills would be important to the growing worldwide Church. During the three decades since that day, over a half million elders and sisters who received their orientation here have gone all over the world to share the marvelous message of the gospel.<br><br>Returning to the subject of temples, I was a member of the BYU Sixth Stake presidency in 1967 when we were invited to a special meeting. Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner, counselors in the First Presidency, announced plans to build the Provo Temple. Two years later I had the interesting experience of attending the temple groundbreaking. Once again with great interest I closely followed the construction of a temple. Then, during the open house, I helped prepare Braille floor plans and organize a special tour for those who were visually impaired.<br><br>The temple's dedication on February 9, 1972, was a special experience. President Joseph Fielding Smith presided. In his dedicatory prayer, among other things, he petitioned, "Let that great temple of learning, the Brigham Young University, ... be prospered to the full. Let Thy enlightening power rest upon those who teach and those who are taught."<sup>9</sup> As a BYU faculty member, I was and am grateful for that blessing. As we left the temple, we were so moved by the Spirit that we didn't feel like speaking until we were outside. The dedicatory proceedings were carried by closed circuit to several large auditoriums here on campus. Many students told me how those attending here in the Marriott Center had the unusual and impressive experience of seeing thousands of people exiting this huge arena in reverent silence.<br><br>For the next quarter of a century the Provo Temple was the most productive in the Church in terms of endowments for the dead. During that period these ordinances were performed for over 12 million persons--approximately equal to the present worldwide membership of the Church. I, like many thousands of BYU students, have been blessed with the privilege of going to the House of Lord and being strengthened and guided by the sacred ordinances and the Lord's Spirit there.<br><br>The Provo Temple was only the 15th in the Church. Since its dedication the number of temples has continued to grow. New kinds of temples have been designed to meet special needs. A recent article in the <i>Ensign</i> described what happened when President Gordon B. Hinckley could not find a place to build a temple in crowded Hong Kong. He was inspired to have the existing mission office removed and to have a larger building designed that would incorporate sacred temple facilities as well as the public offices and a chapel.<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/12/how-the-hong-kong-temple-came-to-be?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a> Another new kind of temple came about in Vernal, Utah, when the old stake tabernacle, no longer in use, was remodeled into a beautiful temple. In like manner, the historic Latter-day Saint chapel in Copenhagen, Denmark, has been transformed into a temple. (I have shared with my Church history classes the inspirational stories of how missionaries gathered at this chapel as they were evacuated from Germany and Czechoslovakia at the outbreak of World War II.) A combination of these two concepts was seen when a temple was constructed on the upper floors of the Church building in downtown Manhattan.<br><br>Forty-seven temples were in service when Gordon B. Hinckley became President of the Church in 1995. Still, he was anxious to take temples to the people in an even greater way. Last November I had the opportunity to visit the Mormon colonies in northern Mexico and to learn firsthand from the Saints about a special and significant event that transpired there. As President Hinckley participated in the 1997 centennial celebration of the Juárez Academy, he was impressed with the faithfulness of the Saints there. Though few in number, they have provided countless missionaries and over a hundred mission presidents. While riding back to El Paso, President Hinckley pondered the idea of building smaller temples. When he dedicated the Colonia Juárez Temple two years later, he gratefully acknowledged:<br><br><i>It was here in Northern Mexico, that Thou didst reveal the idea and the plan of a smaller temple, complete in every necessary detail, but suited in size to the needs and circumstances of the Church membership in this area of Thy vineyard.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Since then, more than 60 of these small temples have been built on every continent. The most recent, temple number 124, was dedicated in Helsinki, Finland.<br><br>During my time at BYU the Church has continued to grow worldwide. From 1 million members in the pioneer centennial year of 1947, membership grew to 10 million in the sesquicentennial year of 1997--a tenfold increase during that half century. In this latter year, for the first time, more than half of all Church members lived outside of the United States. At the general conference this past weekend the Church reported that its membership now stands at nearly 13 million. With this growth in membership and with the multiplication of temples internationally, the Lord's declaration that the fame of the Kirtland Temple should be known throughout the earth certainly has been fulfilled.<br><br>Now let us turn to a consideration of what is to be accomplished in the future. Prophecy indicates that the Lord's kingdom will continue to roll forth until it fills the earth (see Daniel 2:24–45). But there will be challenges and difficulties to overcome. The Lord has commanded, "Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh" (D&amp;amp;C 1:12). The Master counseled His New Testament disciples, "Watch" and "Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh" (Matthew 24:42, 44).<br><br>An experience I had as a missionary brought this lesson home to me. It was a Saturday morning in Laredo during August. We were expecting the mission president's first counselor the following day to conduct a district conference. I went out early to do some cleanup in front of our chapel. (I had to do this work early to avoid the heat later in the day.) My companion was working inside on some reports. Two other missionaries chose to sleep in. At about 6:30 a car drove up, and out stepped not the president's counselor whom we expected the next day but the mission president himself! He had come unannounced to look at some property we were buying. In subsequent weeks he went around the mission speaking about the Second Coming and likening it to his visit to Laredo when he found two elders working and two sleeping. (I'm grateful I hadn't decided to sleep in on that particular morning!)<br><br>How must we prepare? I have learned that there are three main sources of guidance to which we may turn. Interestingly, President Neil L. Andersen of the Seventy emphasized these same three channels at his CES fireside talk here in the Marriott Center a month ago. The first is personal direction through the Spirit. President Heber C. Kimball warned, "There will be a great sifting time, and many will fall; for I say unto you there is a <i>test,</i> a test, a TEST coming, and who will be able to stand?" He then answered his own question: "The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself. If you do not have it, how can you stand?"<sup>12</sup> Sometime after the Martyrdom, Brigham Young saw Joseph Smith in vision. The Prophet instructed his successor: "Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go."<sup>13</sup><br><br>We often think of revelation guiding the Church only during the days of Joseph Smith or of the pioneers. I am grateful to have been able to teach about evidence of divine guidance in our own day as well. During his 1921 tour of missions around the world, Elder David O. McKay was directed to a secluded garden in Beijing where he could offer a special prayer. Another time he was prompted to leave a volcano overlook just before it crumbled into the lava below. And in Jerusalem he was prompted to take a particular train that enabled him to meet the man with whom he would tour the Armenian Mission.<br><br>Matthew Cowley, president of the New Zealand Mission, instructed his missionary assistant to keep his bags packed so they could leave immediately whenever directed by the Spirit to members who needed help. Elder Norman Seibold was prompted to get off trains at certain stations as he sought to locate fellow missionaries needing help during the evacuation from Germany at the outbreak of World War II.<br><br>Inspiration was also evident in President Hinckley's selection of the site for a temple in Guayaquil, Ecuador. After inspecting a half dozen sites, he was impressed to return to the first one and this time go beyond a row of trees and an area of swampy ground. There they found a dirt road leading to a hill overlooking the whole city. As the group stood looking down, tears filling their eyes, they "knew that a prophet had found the site for the temple."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Often it has been necessary to "go forward with faith" as did Nephi when he went to retrieve the brass plates, not knowing how the desired goal could be accomplished (see 1 Nephi 4:6). At a devotional assembly here in the Marriott Center, Elder Glen L. Rudd related how he drove into a large Caribbean city to find a member who had requested a blessing; even though he didn't have her address, he was prompted to park in a spot that turned out to be right in front of her home.<br><br>I have had to do the same thing. During my second year of college my bishop and I filled out my mission papers, not knowing if I could be called with my disability. I did have the privilege to serve, and that experience has had a far-reaching impact on my life. Enjoying the special spirit at a small district conference attended by one of the General Authorities, I was impressed that I should make teaching at BYU my life's work. While in the mission I also met a certain sister missionary, Dawn Houghton, who would become my eternal companion. Together we had to "go forward with faith." On our way back to California after attending general conference, we decided to get married even though I would be in graduate school and Dawn would need to work to support us. When I reached home, I found a telegram waiting that notified me that I had been awarded a Danforth Fellowship that would take care of all our expenses through my receiving the PhD. Blessings don't always come so quickly!<br><br>From my study of Church history as well as from my own experience, I have learned that these blessings often come only following diligent effort. For example, the Lord has instructed that He will give us a witness of the truth only after we have studied out the matter in our own mind (see D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9). Only after Henry Burkhart had repeatedly requested permission for East German Saints to go to Switzerland for temple blessings did the Communist leaders offer the possibility of building a temple right there in the German Democratic Republic. Likewise, after the Cowan family had seemingly done everything possible to trace our ancestry in Scotland, a friend who was helping us with research was inexplicably attracted to an ordinary-looking book in an English secondhand bookstore. It was on an upper shelf so high that he couldn't read its title. When the clerk climbed a ladder to retrieve the book, it turned out to be a history of the very parish from which the Cowans came. We anticipate it will provide the clues we need. Similarly, it was following months of hard work and sacrifice that we had the totally unexpected experience of being presented an award by President Eisenhower at the White House.<br><br>I have also learned, however, that inspiration and guidance do not always come just when we would like it. Through Isaiah, the Lord has reminded us, "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways" (Isaiah 55:8).<br><br>The scriptures have been a second source of comfort and direction as the Saints have sought to prepare "for that which is to come." Of course the impact of James 1:5 on Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel is well known. Three passages have particularly strengthened me:<br><br>In Ether 12:27 Moroni assured us that the Lord allows us to have weakness so that we might become humbled and that if we have faith in Christ He can transform weaknesses into strengths.<br><br>A Latter-day revelation suggests a close relationship between the Lord and His servants when He promised: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).<br><br>Then I have taken comfort from the Lord's instruction: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10).<br><br>Our living prophets have been a third major source of direction. Truly, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet / To guide us in these latter days."<sup>15</sup> General conferences became important to me early on. As members of our Southern California ward returned from conference, they brought phonograph recordings of selected talks that were played in sacrament meetings. Then, when I was in high school, I rode to Utah and attended sessions in the Tabernacle with my dad. Now I enjoy attending priesthood sessions at the Conference Center with my own two sons.<br><br>We have just concluded a great conference. As I prepared this devotional talk, I gained a greater appreciation for what the General Authorities go through as they prepare their talks. Elder Boyd K. Packer taught the following concerning general conference:<br><br><i>The servants of the Lord will counsel us. You may listen with anxious ears and hearts, or you may turn that counsel aside. ... What you shall gain will depend not so much upon their preparation </i>of<i> the messages as upon your preparation </i>for<i> them.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_follow-brethren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a><br><br>Hopefully we prepared ourselves spiritually to receive the inspired messages from our divinely appointed leaders. Now we should implement Elder Harold B. Lee's counsel:<br><br><i>As the Latter-day Saints go home from this conference, it would be well if they consider seriously the importance of taking with them the report of this conference and let it be the guide to their walk and talk during the next six months. These are the important matters the Lord sees fit to reveal to this people in this day.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Speaking to college students, Elder Spencer W. Kimball counseled:<br><br><i>I hope you will get your copy of the</i> [conference messages] <i>and underline the pertinent thoughts and keep it with you for continual reference. No text nor volume outside of the standard works of the Church should have such a prominent place on your personal library shelves.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>In conclusion, I am grateful to testify that the priesthood keys restored on the third of April 171 years ago have enabled the Lord's work to progress throughout the earth and that He is guiding His Church today. May we ponder our personal part in helping the Lord's kingdom to roll forth. May we profit from the blessings of the temple and from guidance through the Spirit, inspiration from the scriptures, and leadership from our living prophets as we prepare for the Lord's return. These things I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard O.

<h1>ss the Miracle - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Many years ago I discovered a book of poetry entitled <i>In the Stillness Is the Dancing.</i> Within the pages of this book is a poem entitled "Don't Miss the Miracle," compiled from the essay "If I Had Three Days to See," written by Helen Keller in 1933. I would like to begin my address today by sharing this poem with you:<br><br><i>I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things</i><br><i>to interest me through mere touch.</i><br><i>I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf.</i><br><i>I pass my hands lovingly</i><br><i>about the smooth skin of a silver birch,</i><br><i>or the rough shaggy bark of a pine . . .</i><br><br><i>I feel the delightful, velvety texture of a flower,</i><br><i>and discover its remarkable convolutions;</i><br><i>and something of the miracle of Nature</i><br><i>is revealed to me.</i><br><br><i>Occasionally, if I am very fortunate,</i><br><i>I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel</i><br><i>the happy quiver of a bird in full song . . .</i><br><br><i>At times my heart cries out with longing</i><br><i>to see these things.</i><br><i>If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch,</i><br><i>how much more beauty must be revealed</i><br><i>by sight.</i><br><br><i>Yet, those who have eyes apparently see little.</i><br><i>The panorama of color and action</i><br><i>which fills the world is taken for granted . . .</i><br><br><i>It is . . . a great pity that, in the world of light,</i><br><i>the gift of sight</i><br><i>is used only as a mere convenience rather than</i><br><i>as a means of adding fullness to life.</i><br>[Mark Link, <i>In the Stillness Is the Dancing</i> (Niles, Illinois: Argus Communications, 1972), 36–37]<br><br>What does it mean to see? <i>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</i> lists 25 definitions for the word <i>see</i> ([New York: Gramercy Books, 1989], 1290). The first is "to perceive with the eyes; look at." Being both blind and deaf, according to this definition Helen Keller indeed could not see. However, according to other Webster definitions of the word, which include "to perceive," "discern," "recognize," "have insight," and "understand intellectually or spiritually," Helen Keller not only saw very clearly but, through her writing, admonished us to do the same.<br><br>Within the myriad of experiences we encounter every day, how much does each of us really see? How much do we allow the light that illuminates our world to permeate our beings? To what degree do we allow light to enlighten?<br><br>What is light? Again I turn to <i>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</i> (828), which defines <i>light</i> as "that which makes things visible or affords illumination." In the first chapter of John we are told:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</i><br><br><i>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</i> [John 1:1–4]<br><br>Speaking to the people in the temple in Jerusalem, Jesus said, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).<br><br>The Bible Dictionary tells us:<br><br><i>The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ. For instance, Christ is "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (D&amp;amp;C 93:2; John 1:9). The light of Christ fills the "immensity of space" and is the means by which Christ is able to be "in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things." It "giveth life to all things" and is "the law by which all things are governed." It is also "the light that quickeneth" man's understanding (see D&amp;amp;C 88:6–13, 41).</i> [Bible Dictionary, s.v. "light of Christ," 725]<br><br>At the recent funeral of Dr. W. Ralph Andersen, BYU professor emeritus of botany and range science, I was inspired by excerpts from his journal that were read by several of his children. Brother Andersen deeply contemplated the concept of light and truth and seeing with spiritual eyes. He believed that it was the duty of each of us to use our God-given personal authority to seek to know God and to do so by kindling our own light and then walking in that light. The brighter the light, the clearer the vision.<br><br>The gift of life and the gift of light are inseparably connected. And quality of life is directly proportional to the degree to which we use the gift of light--not, as Helen Keller says, "as a mere convenience" but "as a means of adding fullness to life." Doing so allows us to not miss the many miracles in our lives that, in rewarding our faith, demonstrate to us that God knows us as individuals and loves us. When we turn ourselves over to Him and let Him direct our paths, we are blessed with the peace that comes from the realization that whatever we experience in life is as it was meant to be.<br><br>I would now like to share with you a few examples of occasions when I have been fortunate to perceive the hand of the Lord in my destiny. It is my hope that they will serve to rekindle within you memories of and gratitude for your own similar encounters with Him as He has directed your paths in the past. It is also my hope that they will inspire each of us to strive to sharpen our perceptions and help us rejoice in the evidence of God's hand in our lives as our various futures unfold.<br><br>The first example relates to the passing of my mother in October 1994. Our immediate family (Mom, Dad, my younger sister, Barbara, and I) had gathered for the weekend at my sister's home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to celebrate Mom and Dad's golden wedding anniversary. Although their anniversary was on October 20th, we decided to celebrate it the weekend before--from October 14th through the 16th--because I was choreographing a musical at BYU that was scheduled to open shortly after October 20, and I needed to be back in Utah with enough time to fulfill my professional obligations.<br><br>My sister and I prepared a weekend full of surprises for our parents, beginning with four gold-colored, helium-filled balloons with Happy 50th Anniversary printed on them, each balloon symbolizing each one of us. These we tied to a banister just inside my sister's front door to greet our parents when they arrived. We enjoyed the most wonderful time that weekend that we had ever spent together as a family.<br><br>It was important to my sister and me that our parents have a final surprise on the actual date of their anniversary. This, we decided, should be a bouquet of Peace roses, a variety that Mom had chosen as her wedding flowers. As we proceeded to order these flowers, we learned that that particular variety no longer existed, but there was one that was very close--yellow with a tinge of pink around the top of the petals--and they had to be ordered from Holland. No problem. We ordered one-and-a-half dozen of them to be delivered to our parents' home in Edmonton, Alberta, on the 20th. As soon as we hung up the phone, I regretted not having thought quickly enough to order 20 roses to symbolize the date of the anniversary. However, we decided to leave the order as we had placed it. And that was that.<br><br>Early in the morning of October 17th, the day we had designated for my parents and me to return to our respective homes, Mom suffered a severe stroke that ultimately took her life just after midnight on October 19th, one day short of the 50th anniversary. When we arrived home from the hospital that night, one of the four balloons on the banister, out of helium, was lying limp at the base of the other balloons.<br><br>The flowers from Holland suddenly became funeral flowers and were rerouted to Calgary for the private funeral we held there on the 20th. When the flowers arrived at the funeral home, there were not 18 roses but in fact 20. And during the ceremony one rose began to wilt. By the time we took the flowers back to my sister's home, that one flower had significantly withered, leaving 19--for us symbolic of the date my mother passed away. A mere coincidence? I choose to think not. For us it was the Lord's arms around us, telling us in His own way that it was time for our wife and mother to return to Him and that all was well.<br><br>My second example concerns my father, Michael Herbut, who passed away in August 1999. Throughout his life Dad liked to buy things. Shortly before he died he purchased several rosebushes from a catalog and, since he had no garden of his own, bequeathed them to my sister. Although Alberta <i>is</i> Wild Rose Country, domestic roses are very hard to grow there. But my sister wanted to try, and that spring I went up to help her plant the rosebushes. Being a good gardener, she did all she could to assure that the roses would survive. And they did, for a while, in what she named the Michael Herbut Rose Garden. The summer after Dad passed away, while I was visiting my sister, one of the rosebushes was coming into bloom. It was at least the second season that the bush had flowered. Never before had a flower on that bush been anything but pure yellow. At this particular time, however, the rose that was blooming was tinged with pink around the top of the petals, and subsequently the yellow flowers on this bush continued to bloom with pink edges. A tender miracle? I think so.<br><br>My final example has unfolded throughout my lifetime and as a result will be considerably longer than the previous two. In August 1972 I was hired on a one-year appointment as a faculty member in the Department of Dance at Brigham Young University. I was not yet a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was an interesting year. The students were as full of light and conviction then as now--unofficial missionaries who were grounded in their faith, lived what they believed, and extended themselves to me with love, respect, and caring. Although I was not what one would call a "golden convert," their efforts did bear fruit, and I was baptized on August 18, 1973.<br><br>As a child I had grown up in the Russian Orthodox faith and attended Divine Liturgy on Sundays at St. Barbara's Cathedral in Edmonton. The service was delivered in the Russian language, which I did not understand because my parents, like so many children of immigrants at that time, chose not to speak their heritage language anywhere, in favor of English and of assimilation into Canadian culture. There were understandable reasons for this.<br><br>My mother often related stories of unkind words and deeds she and other members of her family experienced throughout their lives because they were "different." Growing up, I was also occasionally a recipient of similar unkind acts. While I was a junior high school student, each class member was routinely required, during a roll call of sorts, to state aloud from their desk their ethnic heritage. For those of us with German and Russian ancestry it was not a particularly joyful activity as our classmates followed our declarations with taunts of "Nazi" or "Commie."<br><br>I hated those days. I would come home from school in tears, begging my mother, "Couldn't I <i>please</i> say I'm Ukrainian?" But even though she was reliving her pain through mine, she would always say the words I wished were not true: "No, Catherine. We are not Ukrainian. We are Russian." The one goal I had in life was to someday marry a man with an Anglo-Saxon surname--like Brown, or White, or Green!<br><br>Although I was ashamed of my heritage, I did believe in God, and I wanted to do what was right, so I attended church regularly, even though I did not understand a word of what was being said throughout the service.<br><br>As a freshman at the University of Alberta, I began to receive gentle promptings to study the Russian language. The reason for this eluded me, but I listened, took a beginning Russian course, and--not being especially talented at language learning (then or now)--shortly after having completed the course, promptly forgot virtually everything I had been taught. Why did I need to learn Russian?<br><br>I finished undergraduate school, worked for two years to save money for graduate school, enrolled at the University of Utah, enjoyed the two years I spent there very much, learned a great deal about modern dance, and graduated. I knew that since I was not an American citizen I needed to return to Canada, which I was not quite ready to do because I wanted to hone the dance skills I had just acquired before returning home to a more "pioneering" environment. I investigated and discovered something called a practical training visa, which allowed international students to remain in the United States for up to 18 months to practice skills they had learned in school by being employed in a discipline-related field. I resolved that the first university position offered to me in the United States would be the one I would accept. That position was offered by BYU. Thanks to the efforts of Clayne Jensen--then dean of the College of Physical Education--my practical training visa was renewed every year for four years until I met and married a wonderful widower from New Zealand who had a vibrant and talented young daughter--<i>and</i> a green card. Because he had a green card, I was able to obtain one, and my "year" at BYU has turned into 34 years and still counting.<br><br>Almost immediately upon becoming a member of the Church, the Spirit of Elijah began to burn deeply within me. I not only faced the fact that I had Russian ancestry but began to embrace it. I became overwhelmingly grateful for all of the sacrifices that both sets of grandparents had made in eking out a better existence for themselves and their posterity in a new land.<br><br>I started studying Russian again--between babies and BYU obligations--learning and forgetting and learning again. I cannot tell you how many times I asked myself, "Why am I doing this? This is crazy. I don't have anyone with whom to speak the language. It must be so that I can read genealogical records someday--if I can ever gain access to them from behind the Iron Curtain."<br><br>Meanwhile, in the summer of 1989, a wonderful opportunity was made available to me. I was invited to accompany the BYU International Folk Dance Ensemble on their tour to Russia, Poland, and England. As the plane touched down at the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, I remember thinking, "We could just as well be landing somewhere on the Canadian prairies. It looks exactly the same." No wonder so many Slavic people settled in western Canada at the beginning of the 20th century. They must have felt a measure of security in the midst of geographically familiar surroundings, in spite of the many hardships they had to face.<br><br>My mother's father had always wanted to return to Russia for a visit before he died, but unfortunately that never happened. For me, going to Russia with the folk dancers was going back for him. I thought about him continually the entire time I was there. I loved being surrounded by the Russian people and their culture. And I got to practice the language! But something told me that the real purpose for my learning Russian had not yet been fulfilled.<br><br>In my excitement to experience Russia, I had completely underplayed my pending opportunity to experience the people and culture of Poland--until I remembered that my father's parents had been born in what today is Poland. I wondered if the folk dancers would be performing anywhere near where these grandparents grew up. As I looked at the map, I remember the following rapidly developing chain of thoughts: (1) Hmmm, interesting, not too far; (2) I wonder if there would be any way I could work it out to get to their villages; (3) No, I HAVE to find a way to get there; (4) No matter what, I WILL find a way!<br><br>The plane landed in Warsaw. We boarded a bus that had been reserved to take us to Mrągowo in the north of Poland. I was sitting in the front seat across from the driver when our tour guide, Danuta, boarded the bus with a clipboard in her hands. As she was looking over the ensemble roster, I heard her say, "Cathy Black."<br><br>Sitting directly in front of her, I responded, "That's me."<br><br>To which she replied, "I see you are from Canada. I worked in Montreal for two years learning English."<br><br>The two of us bonded immediately.<br><br>After just a few hours with the Folk Dance Ensemble, Danuta noticed that there was something special about the group compared to others she had been assigned in the past. She said that the performers and leaders were not self-centered, that they were kind and polite to each other, and that they did not ask for anything unless they really needed it.<br><br>One of the things we did ask for was a room--one that we could use for a church meeting the next morning. Danuta procured the room and asked whether guests could attend this church meeting. Of course the answer was yes, and she was warmly encouraged to join us, which she did. It was a beautiful testimony meeting during which Danuta was moved to tears a number of times. Following the meeting I gave her my triple combination, and she immediately began to read about Joseph Smith. The next day we boarded the bus back to Warsaw. At the end of that journey Danuta informed us that we would have a different guide to accompany us to the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland and that she would come the next day to say good-bye to us.<br><br>Before she left that day I explained to her my obsession about going to visit my grandparents' villages and asked her if there would be any way that she might help me do so. Danuta took down the last names of my ancestors and the names of their villages and told me she would see me tomorrow.<br><br>As had been the case in Russia, 1989 was also a very difficult time economically for Poland. Shelves were bare of essential merchandise, and having a telephone, let alone a car, was a luxury. When Danuta arrived to meet us at the bus the next day, she had acquired a car, a driver, and two contacts she had called who agreed to meet with me in the Carpathian Mountains. One of these people was a priest and the other a gentleman by the name of Mieczysław Herbut, who said that he was sure we were not related because he came from a different part of Poland than my grandparents. Pressing him, Danuta asked if he would be willing to meet with me anyway, in spite of his reservations. He said he would.<br><br>We were scheduled to meet at a restaurant in Nowy Sącz. Danuta, our driver, and I arrived first and visited while we waited for Mr. Herbut. As he walked through the door, tears welled up in my eyes. Let me show you two photos--one of Mieczysław Herbut and one of my father, Michael Herbut. This is one miracle that nobody could miss! Even more uncanny than the remarkable physical resemblance of these two men was the identical nature of their mannerisms. It was absolutely unbelievable! After receiving the photograph of my father, Mieczysław, who learned English during World War II while a German prisoner of war, wrote to my father informing him that he knew he had discovered a twin brother. The two men continued to correspond with each other until Mieczysław's death in the mid-1990s. Although we have not yet been able to verify a genetic relationship between these two men, I am working on it.<br><br>In addition to visiting my grandparents' villages and meeting with people there, Danuta and I searched genealogical records, and I was able to add a generation to my family tree. Since then Danuta has joined the Church, has become proficient in genealogy, and has helped many Americans find their Polish ancestors. By searching Polish records on my behalf, she has helped me access several generations to add to my family tree. In 2005 she was called to codirect the newly created LDS Warsaw Family History Center. I never cease to marvel at the privilege that has been mine to have been part of this amazing series of events.<br><br>And there is yet another dimension to this story. On the 1989 trip we discovered that the family names on my father's side were not in fact Russian names but belonged to a Slavic minority population known as Lemkos, who had identified themselves as Russians at the time my grandparents left for North America. This discovery has resulted in a serious academic research agenda for me, which has included trips back to Poland for the express purpose of studying the dance and rituals of the Lemko people.<br><br>In the latter part of the 1990s the prompting to study Russian arose yet again. This time I hired a tutor to speak with me once a week over several months. Then, on Sunday, March 19, 2000, while reading a front-page feature article in the <i>Deseret News</i> entitled "The Orphans of Vladivostok," I was overcome by the desire to adopt a Russian orphan. I shared my thoughts with my husband, positive he would say, "We're too old." We were almost empty nesters. To my surprise he replied, "Why not?" As we discussed it further, we decided that it would be best for us to adopt two children rather than one and that we would like them to be sisters between the ages of six and 10.<br><br>We had never before talked about adoption of any kind; we did not even know where to begin. We decided to start by contacting our adult children to seek their approval. That obtained, we were led, through a series of timely events, to an agency specializing in Russian adoptions. Interestingly, one of the directors of the agency told us that on the very weekend that I was reading the article in the <i>Deseret News,</i> they had e-mailed their contact in Russia to ask if they could get two or three more children, whom they felt certain they could place. They were told that two sisters, ages seven and eight, had just been approved for adoption.<br><br>We were able to afford this adoption because of an inheritance left to us following my father's passing. The first piece of physical documentation we received concerning the children was a photograph. One of the little girls bore a striking resemblance to my mother's youngest sister. The photograph was followed by written information about the girls. In it we discovered that the one who looked so much like my mother's sister also had the same birthday as my father. When we discovered the girls' surname, it turned out that it was the very name that my parents had planned to give my sister had she been a boy. These, and other similar "coincidences"--some too personal to share--made it clear to my husband and me beyond a shadow of a doubt that these two beautiful children were meant to be part of our family.<br><br>Although the process was anything but smooth, miracles continued to happen, and in late October 2000 the judge in Russia pounded her gavel and those two little Russian sisters became legally ours. It was wonderful to have basic Russian language skills to be able to help ease the girls into their new environment. As they have become fluent in English, my promptings to learn Russian have stilled, and I am at peace in knowing what the ultimate purpose was for which I needed to know the language.<br><br>The longer I live, the more deeply I appreciate my relationship with the Lord. I marvel that He knows me, cares about me, and literally leads me, guides me, and walks beside me every step of the way--just as He does for each of you (see "I Am a Child of God," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 301). There are evidences of His presence all around us, just waiting to be discovered and acknowledged. What joy and peace we can receive from the recognition of the many miracles in our lives! May we strive constantly not to miss them but to see them clearly is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Catherine H.

<h1>07 Commencement Address - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Well, thank you very much, President Hinckley, university trustees, President Samuelson, Congressman Cannon, BYU faculty and staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, members of the class of 2007.<br><br>Thank you for the warm welcome to Provo, Utah--home to one of the finest universities in the United States of America. I've enjoyed my time here today. I was pleased to meet with the First Presidency. And it's always an honor to be in the company of this university's chairman, a distinguished American and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Gordon B. Hinckley.<br><br>I count it a privilege to be a part of this ceremony. I'm grateful for the honor that I've just received--and humbled, as well. My wife, Lynne, reminded me that I'm not the first in the family to have ties to Brigham Young University or to this state. Lynne's father grew up right here in Provo, and two of her great-grandparents graduated from Brigham Young Academy, which grew into this fine university.<br><br>Further back, only a year after Brigham Young arrived in this valley, Lynne's great-great-grandmother was baptized into the Mormon faith. She arrived here in a train of 50 wagons of Welsh immigrants and set to work with all the others who crossed the Mormon Trail to make the desert bloom. My wife has done a lot of research, and she's very proud of her Utah heritage. And, as of today, she has a higher opinion of me, too--now that I have an honorary degree from Brigham Young University.<br><br>But this day belongs to the fine young men and women who've actually earned their degrees. And I'm delighted to share the occasion with you, and I bring congratulations and good wishes from the president of the United States, George W. Bush.<br><br>I've had the experience of seeing my own children collect college and graduate diplomas and begin a new journey. It's an experience like no other. And so, as a tribute, I think we should have a round of applause for all the moms and dads here today as well.<br><br>Graduation always produces a mix of emotions. There's a sense of pride at having set a high goal and reaching it. There's also a little bit of sadness at leaving a place you love and feeling as though a curtain is falling on a very special time in your life. But there is also a great spirit to BYU, and this university will always be part of you. We had a glimpse of the character of BYU again last Friday, when this campus held a candlelight vigil to remember the victims of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. More than a place of learning, BYU is a community of faith and kindness and compassion.<br><br>As you leave your alma mater, you'll carry many fond memories of your years on this campus. You'll recall the long hours of hard work in the library and the lab, the sound of the national anthem in the morning and evening, and the teachers and the friends who have enriched your life.<br><br>You'll remember those places you call the Hfack, the Swickitt, the Wilk, and the Marb. I'm told you probably won't miss your visits to the Testing Center or your dealings with the Traffic Office. But you'll remember that every year you've been at BYU the school has been ranked number one in the category of Stone Cold Sober. And you'll remember, of course, the Cougar basketball team beating Utah your senior year and the day in the football stadium when you saw Jonny Harline's answered prayer.<br><br>Above all, you'll carry the distinction of earning a degree from BYU--a place with impressive alumni throughout this nation and far beyond. The values of this school have been a guide to generations. BYU alumni are men and women at home in the world--working and achieving and reflecting great credit on this university and on the LDS Church.<br><br>I also want to note that BYU has a lengthy tradition of military honor and service. And this week members of the ROTC in the class of 2007 receive their military commissions, and I want to thank all of them, on behalf of all of us, for the commitment they've made. They join the ranks of a great force for justice, freedom, and security--and we're proud of their brave service to the United States of America.<br><br>In addition to those of you receiving your bachelor's degrees this afternoon, I'm told we have many men and women who have earned graduate degrees, including a number who've earned their PhDs. Their presence here reminds me that I was once in a PhD program myself and met all the requirements--except for the dissertation. I'll get started as soon as I come up with a topic.<br><br>After putting in these years of hard effort as students at BYU, something tells me you're probably not up for another lecture before you leave, so I'm going to keep this short. I know that it's the custom for graduation speakers to draw from their experiences to share some of the lessons they've learned along the way. So as you begin this new chapter in life, let me offer a few thoughts of my own. There is one very practical lesson that comes immediately to mind. It goes back to the year 2000, when then Governor Bush called to ask if I would help him find a running mate for vice president. The lesson I want to share with you is this: If you ever get asked to head up an important search committee, say yes.<br><br>That decision seven years ago set me on a path I was not expecting to take. I believed that my time in public office had passed. And my career in politics itself was an unplanned enterprise. On the day of my own graduation from the University of Wyoming, I had no ambitions of holding higher office. If you'd asked me at the time what I planned on doing, I could have described in some detail what the next 10 years would be like. First would be graduate school, then wrapping up that PhD, and, down the road, with luck, a faculty position at a university. It all worked out very differently. Within a few years Lynne and I were living in Washington, D.C., and beginning a journey in government and public life that neither of us had ever imagined.<br><br>Many of you will leave BYU today with definite plans of your own. And setting a plan for your life can be a good thing. It keeps you focused on the future and gives you a standard for measuring your progress. Yet I would guess that 10 years from now many of you will find yourselves following a very different course--all because of an opportunity that came out of the blue.<br><br>Be on the watch for those certain moments and certain people that come along and point you in a new direction. I think, for example, of the first time I met my friend Don Rumsfeld. It was back in the 1960s, when he was a congressman and I was interviewing for a fellowship on Capitol Hill. Congressman Rumsfeld agreed to talk to me, but things didn't go all that smoothly. In fact, he pretty much threw me out of his office. Don's impression of me was that I was kind of a detached, theoretical, impractical academic type. And I thought he was a brash young politician with a cocky attitude. And we were both right.<br><br>We didn't click that day, but later on it was Don Rumsfeld who noticed my work and offered me a position in the executive branch. Later on, when Gerald Ford became president and made Rumsfeld his chief of staff, it was once again Don who gave me a position of great responsibility in the White House. Standing here today, I can promise that there will be people like this in your own life who keep an eye on you and reward your efforts and help bring out your strengths. Sometimes others know better than we do just what our talents are and how we can make good use of them. For all the plans we make in life, sometimes life has other plans for us.<br><br>Those of us who've been around a while can also recall a few times when life took an unexpected turn, and not always in a positive direction. As I mentioned a moment ago, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming. My college experience, though, began at a place called Yale--but I didn't finish there. Instead, I dropped out after a few semesters. Well, actually, "dropped out" isn't quite accurate. "Was asked to leave" would be more like it. Twice. The second time around they said, "Don't come back."<br><br>You, too, may face some disappointing turns of your own--times when you fall short, knowing you could have done better. And when that happens, don't give up or let your doubts get the best of you. I have met some very successful people in my day, men and women of talent and character who have risen to the very top of their fields. And it's the rare one who hasn't had a taste of failure or a false start along the way. Setbacks in life can stop you dead in your tracks or they can inspire you forward. Either way, you'll look back on them as turning points. They are crucial days in your life when you see the starkest kind of choice and know that it belongs to you alone.<br><br>One of the things I love most about our country is that we have such opportunities. America is still the country of a second chance. Most of us end up needing one. And when we've gone on to accomplish something, we can be that much more grateful.<br><br>And gratitude, in general, is a good habit to get into. It is usually a correct appraisal of our situation. Most of us are able to succeed and to rise in the world because someone helped out along the way--whether it was a memorable teacher or a boss who handed us a great opportunity or the person who took a chance and gave us the first big break in our career. A grateful heart is an honest understanding of all that we have been given and all that is expected in return.<br><br>There is always the temptation to forget this, to carry ourselves with an air of entitlement as if good things come to us by right. They rarely do. And life has a way of working out better when we don't take things for granted, when we have a long memory for what others have given us, when we look for the blessings, great and small, that come with every day we're alive on this earth.<br><br>For all of you, this day in the Marriott Center will forever stand out as a marker of gifts well used and hard work rewarded. It has been my privilege to share it with you and your families. I congratulate you. I hope your future is filled with the kind of happiness you feel today. And, again, I thank the university for this honorary degree. I leave here as a proud member of the Brigham Young University Class of 2007.<br><br><em>Dick Cheney was vice president of the United States of America when this commencement address was delivered at BYU on 26 April 2007.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>hip, Sacrifice, and Ownership - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my great pleasure to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. On a personal note, I should tell you that in January of this year my wife, Bertha, and I celebrated the payment of our last tuition bill. Our youngest child, Heather, is with us today as a graduate, and no two people are prouder or happier for her than are we.<br><br>As new graduates, many of you may be focusing on the possibilities that lie ahead to create wealth for yourselves. Might I suggest that you consider wealth creation as a commodity made up of financial, human, and intellectual capital. Business people know that they must spend 70 to 80 percent of their time growing assets. In families, growing the human and intellectual assets is often overlooked. The members in the family are the human capital. Their collective life experiences and knowledge make up the intellectual capital. The financial capital supports the growth of the other two. James E. Hughes, Jr., suggests these concepts tous in his book, <i>Family Wealth.</i><br><br>He reminds us that<br><br><i>in the mid-eighteenth century, Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded the House of Rothschild. This creator of the Rothschild fortune had five sons, each of whom he set up in the banking business in one of the era's five principal European financial capitals: Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Paris, and Naples. He lent them the money to get started at lower than normal interest with the proviso that they pay him back. He directed that each son keep the profits of his individual bank once the original loan had been repaid. He also charged interest in the form of intellectual currency. He requested each of his sons relay to him every bit of financial information he gained in his city. He agreed to share this intellectual interest with his other sons. In modern terms, he created aneffective information network.</i><br><br><i>Mayer Amschel Rothschild also used a powerful investment technique to manage the risk to his family's human capital. By sending each son to a different city, he diversified his human assets into five separate investments, thereby increasing the probability that at least one of the branches would survive political and economic risks. Ultimately, only the London and Paris branches survived and continue to prosper. Today, some 250 years later, the name Rothschild is synonymous with wealth.</i> [James E. Hughes, Jr., <i>Family Wealth: Keeping It in the Family: How Family Members and Their Advisers Preserve Human, Intellectual, and Financial Assets for Generations</i> (Princeton: Bloomberg Press, 2004), 32; adapted by permission]<br><br>Mayer Amschel Rothschild understood that two important elements of a family's wealth are its human and intellectual capital. He saw to it that all family members were well educated and that they worked. He also provided specialized mentorship opportunities as his sons entered the workforce.<br><br>Like the Rothschild children, you have been given a figurative loan, if you will, in the form of a financial subsidy of your tuition by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You represent the human and intellectual capital of your own families and, in a broader sense, of the Church.<br><br>You have been carefully schooled and taught while here. Many of you have had stewardship opportunities as undergraduates in mentored learning experiences with faculty--experiences usually reserved only for graduate students. On Sundays and other times during the week you have had chances to provide charitable service in your wards and in the community, volunteering and sacrificing your precious study time for those timeless elements of spiritual development that will serve you well later in this life and in the life to come. I hope you have captured stewardship training on how to be good, upstanding citizens of this peaceable country and how to be keepers of your faith.<br><br>We often refer to the warm feelings we have on campus as the Spirit of the Y. Having experienced that spirit, you can now go forth and continue to cultivate it wherever you may reside. As you give back with your time, talent, and treasure to your alma mater, you will perpetuate the process that has been going on here since 1875 when Brigham Young started this school with the charge to its first principal, Karl G. Maeser, that he "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God"--or, in other words, he should provide secular learning in the household of faith (in Reinhard Maeser, <i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).<br><br>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I congratulate you and welcome you most warmly into this great association of nearly 360,000.<br><br>Just as you have passed through the halls at BYU, I hope the Spirit of the Y has passed through you and become a part of you. May your every dream and worthy aspiration become reality I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J. Craig McIlroy was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 26 April 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>th the Grateful &quot;One&quot; - to April 2007 graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates and families, honored guests, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is my happy responsibility and privilege to express again our warm welcome to you on this very significant day in your lives and in the history of Brigham Young University. We appreciate your patience and persistence. Your devotion to the cause and the occasion that brings us together is commendable. For all of these things, and especially for the accomplishments of those of you being recognized, I offer our profound congratulations and hearty appreciation.<br><br>It is often observed with a touch of both irony and humor that we describe the formal ending of your university experience as a commencement. I'm personally grateful that we don't describe these as "end-of-the-road exercises." You have so much excitement to experience, contributions to make, and growth yet ahead of you.<br><br>The designation of commencement is entirely proper here--as it is at other universities--because today we acknowledge your qualifications and great potential for success in the future that you are now formally entering. Many of you will continue with further education--some here at BYU and most at distinguished graduate institutions throughout the world. A large number will enter the world of work or one of the honored professions, and yet others will anxiously fulfill the dream of turning full-time attention to the exalted role of mother. Whatever your plans and whatever your next steps, please know that you go with our confidence in your prospects and our gratitude for our association together these past few years.<br><br>Today and in the convocations tomorrow we will award 6,285 degrees, which include those completed last December. While most are bachelor's degrees, 717 are master's degrees and 190 are doctorates. As always, there is a tremendous age span in those receiving baccalaureate degrees, with the youngest graduate being 19 and the oldest 61. Fifty-four percent of the graduating class is already married, and I have it on good authority that those numbers are likely to increase significantly in the days and months ahead. Interestingly, 30 percent of the undergraduates honored today have attended other institutions of higher learning prior to enrolling at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I have been impressed that in comparison to almost all student bodies across this great land, you stand out in a number of ways. One way is the amount of debt that you have accumulated tends to be smaller and the default rate on various student loans is far, far below the national average. For all of these things we commend and thank you. Please continue to be careful. Do not mortgage your future by unwise economic choices in the immediate years ahead.<br><br>In this context let me remind you yet again of a different kind of debt you have all incurred--different in that it cannot be tallied in a checkbook or bank balance, but it is real just the same. I speak of the tremendous debt owed by each of you to your spouses, parents, families, and other direct financial benefactors. I speak also of the faithful members of the Church worldwide, many living in relative poverty and without realistic hope of ever enjoying a BYU education either themselves or through their families. They pay their tithes and offerings with complete confidence in the leaders of the Church who so carefully and generously make the incomparable BYU experience possible for us. I hope you will always remember their sacrifice and generosity in your prayers.<br><br>In a similar vein, I wish to express our gratitude as a university community for the so very many who have generously contributed to the beautiful new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center. This remarkable building, which will be referred to as the Hinckley Center, is rapidly nearing completion just to the south and west of the Marriott Center. Some 70,000 people--including thousands of students and thousands of alumni from around the world--have had a part in this project that will be, we hope, a fitting memorial to our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, and a much-needed enhancement to our already beautiful and functional campus.<br><br>In addition, I hope we will commit ourselves today--and continue in this commitment throughout our lives--to contribute in every way we can to build our nation, our families, our church, and our alma mater. Gratitude is easily verbalized but often difficult to actualize.<br><br>You remember the account of Jesus meeting the 10 men with leprosy. All of them called to the Lord and pled for mercy or to be cured. The Savior told them what to do and they did it, resulting in the cleansing of their leprosy. Sadly, there was only one of the 10 who thought to return and thank the Lord. Think of Jesus' question to the one thoughtful and grateful man: "Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?" (Luke 17:17; see Luke 17:11–19).<br><br>BYU and its graduates--you--excel in almost every category and consideration. I am convinced that we will never forget our significant debt and will ever recognize the privilege it is to be part of this grand and heaven-blessed institution. I am sure you will always wish to stand with the grateful "one" and not the neglectful nine. We promise you that we will not forget you and will do all we can to remind you of your special blessings and privileges as graduates of Brigham Young University. We ask that you also keep us in your prayers and thoughts as we keep you in ours. We need your ongoing help to have BYU become even better in the years ahead. Your continued participation and splendid examples as you go throughout the world will mean a great deal to those who follow you here in the days ahead.<br><br>Again, I congratulate and thank you and those supporting and sustaining you. As you commence your brilliant futures, I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you and yours in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 26 April 2007.</em><br><br>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.

<h1>ng to the Savior’s Invitation: “Come” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson, for that kind introduction. And thank you, Brother Kooyman, for your prayer. Brother Kooyman and I first met in Athens, Ohio. We served together in a branch presidency there. Our families enjoyed many wonderful experiences together. We were fortunate enough to both receive offers to come to BYU in 1997. Each week Brother Kooyman and I come to the devotionals together. Attending the devotionals each week has provided the perfect opportunity for us to maintain our friendship and to be spiritually edified together. Brother Kooyman, I hope we enjoy this week's talk as much as the previous 250 devotionals we have attended together.<br><br>Also, sisters, thank you very much for the music this morning. I love uplifting music and the positive effect it can have on our spirits. Good music helps us respond to the Savior's invitation to come. That is the focus of my remarks today.<br><br>Before I move directly into my remarks, may I extend to you an invitation? Focus on the promptings from the Holy Ghost during our time together this morning. Listen for at least one idea that you will apply in your life within the next week. I invite you to do the same thing as you come to the devotionals each Tuesday. If we leave the devotionals each week with a determination to do something with what we have learned and felt, then we will truly be edified together as a campus community.<br><br>In the Old and New Testaments (Exodus 24:1; Isaiah 55:3; Matthew 4:19, 11:28–30; Mark 1:17; John 6:35; John 14:6; Revelation 22:17); in the Book of Mormon (1 Nephi 6:4; 2 Nephi 9:41, 45, 51; 2 Nephi 26:33; 2 Nephi 28:32; Jacob 1:7; Omni 1:25–26; Alma 29:2; 3 Nephi 12:3, 20, 23–24; 3 Nephi 18:28–33; 3 Nephi 21:20, 27; Mormon 9:27; Ether 5:5; Moroni 10:30, 32); in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;amp;C 10:67; 18:11; 20:59; 45:5, 46; 132:12); and in modern-day hymns ("Come, Follow Me"; "Come unto Jesus"; "Come unto Him") there are clear invitations from Heavenly Father, from Jesus Christ, and from prophets and apostles to come unto the Savior.<br><br>My goal today is to direct our attention to the invitation to <b>C</b>ome unto Christ through the <b>O</b>rdinances and covenants of the gospel, <b>M</b>inistering to others with a humble attitude of self-<b>E</b>valuation. I want to use the word <i>come</i> to organize my comments today. Each of the four letters in the word can serve as a reminder of four important points I would like to make.<br><h2><b>Come unto Christ</b></h2><br>First, the letter <i>C</i> reminds us to come.<br><br><i>Come</i> is a verb of movement. The use of the word in the context we are examining is as an imperative or command. We could consider that this invitation is not merely a suggestion but rather a commandment that we move from where we are to where Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ would like us to be. We are the ones who must make the effort to move.<br><br>Of the many invitations in the scriptures to come unto Christ, I would like to draw attention to two. Think about the need for movement as we read these verses. First, in Matthew we read an invitation from the Savior Himself:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i> [Matthew 11:28–30]<br><br>Something that I notice when I read the invitations to come unto Christ is that there is usually the invitation followed by a promise. Read these verses again and notice the invitations followed by the promises. To help us visually, Ihave noted the invitations with underlined text and the promises with bold text.<br><br><i><b>Come unto me,</b> all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and <b>I will give you rest.</b></i><br><br><i><b>Take my yoke upon you,</b> and <b>learn of me;</b> for I am meek and lowly in heart: <b>and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</b></i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><br><br>We see a similar pattern in the invitation extended by Moroni at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Yea, <b>come unto Christ,</b> and <b>be perfected in him,</b> and <b>deny yourselves of all ungodliness;</b> and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and <b>love God with all your might, mind and strength,</b> then is <b>his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ;</b> and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, <b>ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</b></i> [Moroni 10:32]<br><br>If we are to move closer to the Savior Jesus Christ and respond to these invitations, we must yield our whole hearts to Heavenly Father. In this way He will know of our sincere desire to become one with Him and His Son. These are clear invitations followed by clear promises. We are to come unto Christ. It is an invitation extended with promises.<br><br>I love singing the hymn "Come unto Jesus." The fourth verse is particularly meaningful tome:<br><br><i>Come unto Jesus from ev'ry nation,</i><br><i>From ev'ry land and isle of the sea.</i><br><i>Unto the high and lowly in station,</i><br><i>Ever he calls, "Come to me, to me."</i><br>["Come unto Jesus," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 117]<br><br>I have the opportunity every day to interact with colleagues, international graduate students in our department, and students enrolled at the English Language Center "from ev'ry land and isle of the sea." These colleagues and students remind me of the Savior's love for all of our Heavenly Father's children and of His desire that we respond to the invitation to come, no matter where we live.<br><br>Remember the <i>C</i> in the word <i>come</i> and come unto Christ.<br><h2><b>The Ordinances and Covenants of the Gospel</b></h2><br>The second letter in the word <i>come</i> can remind us of the ordinances of the gospel: <i>Come unto Christ through the ordinances and covenants of the gospel.</i><br><br>From <i>True to the Faith</i> we read:<br><br><i>In the Church, an ordinance is a sacred, formal act performed by the authority of the priesthood. Some ordinances are essential to our exaltation. These ordinances are called saving ordinances. They include baptism, confirmation, ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood (for men), the temple endowment, and the marriage sealing. With each ofthese ordinances, we enter into solemn covenants with the Lord. . . .</i><br><br><i>Ordinances and covenants help us remember who we are. They remind us of our duty to God. The Lord has provided them to help us</i> come unto Him <i>and receive eternal life. When we honor them, He strengthens us.</i> [<i>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 109, 110; emphasis added]<br><br>Notice the link between ordinances and covenants. When we enter into an ordinance of the gospel, we also make covenants with our Heavenly Father. I would like to review briefly with you two kinds of ordinances that we participate in that help us to respond to the Savior's invitation to come: the ordinance of the sacrament and temple ordinances.<br><h3><strong><i>The Ordinance of the Sacrament</i></strong></h3><br>We are reminded every Sabbath day about the covenants that we have made at baptism by participating in the ordinance of the sacrament. As you sit in sacrament meeting and listen to the sacramental prayers, do you listen with your ears or with your heart? I appreciate so very much the blessing of reciting the sacrament prayers in my mind as I listen to the appointed priesthood holders bless the bread and the water.<br><br>The sacrament reminds me not just of the covenants I made at baptism but also of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The Atonement of Christ truly qualifies Him to invite you and me to follow Him into the presence of our Heavenly Father. Recall the invitation from Christ to come unto Him that we read in Matthew. We are all "heavy laden." We each have cares, concerns, and sins that cause us to be heavy laden. It is through our repentance that we can receive rest. It is through our continued obedience to the commandments that we can receive rest. It is through the atoning sacrifice of the Savior that it is possible for Him to make a promise of rest.<br><br>As we desire to respond to the Savior's invitation to come, we will have to leave behind our weaknesses and our sins. The cleansing power of repentance allows us to experience the peace that Christ promised. Each week we can partake of the sacrament and feel the cleansing power of the Atonement in our lives.<br><br>In his general conference talk in October 1989, Elder David B. Haight taught:<br><br><i>Our most valuable worship experience in the sacrament meeting is the sacred ordinance of the sacrament, for it provides the opportunity to focus our minds and hearts upon the Savior and His sacrifice.</i> ["The Sacrament--and the Sacrifice," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1989, 61]<br><br>Next Sunday I invite you to listen to the sacramental prayers with new ears and with your heart. By worthily partaking of the sacrament you are responding to the Savior's invitation to come.<br><h3><strong><i>Temple Ordinances</i></strong></h3><br>Temple ordinances are the second of the ordinances that I wish to remind us of this morning. Everything that we do in the Church should point us as individuals and as families to temple ordinances. All of the ordinances of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ invite us to improve our lives and to come to the Savior. Temple ordinances require that we be prepared to make sacred covenants with our Heavenly Father.<br><br>The ordinances of the endowment and the sealing of husband and wife are sacred temple ordinances. A simple definition of the word <i>endowment</i> is "gift." In the Merriam-Webster online dictionary we see that the word also means "natural capacity, power, or ability" (http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/endowment). As we participate in the ordinances of the temple, we receive a gift from our Heavenly Father. We also learn about our natural capacities. We receive power--and Heavenly Father increases our abilities. We are reminded of the role of Jesus Christ in our lives. We are reminded that through His atoning sacrifice we can cleanse and purify ourselves and prepare ourselves to enter back into His presence.<br><br>Our family had the opportunity this past week to enter the Salt Lake Temple with our youngest son and his fiancée for their marriage and sealing. What a blessing to witness such a powerful ordinance with powerful blessings.<br><br>After we have participated in temple ordinances and made these sacred covenants for ourselves, we have the opportunity of returning to the temple again to perform these same sacred ordinances for deceased family members. We can assist our family members who did not have the opportunity of participating themselves to receive the promised blessings ofthese ordinances and extend tothem the invitation to come unto Christ.<br><br>I challenge each of you to obtain a temple recommend and then remain worthy to use it. Go to the temple often. Think about how the ordinances you have participated in draw you closer to Jesus Christ. Think about how you are responding to the invitation to come unto Christ.<br><h2><b>Ministering to Others</b></h2><br>Third, the letter <i>M:</i> <i>Come unto Christ through the ordinances and covenants of the gospel, ministering to others.</i><br><br>As we minister to others, we provide service. It is through true service to others that we demonstrate to Heavenly Father the purity of our hearts.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught in the 1986 October general conference:<br><br><i>To follow in the footsteps of the only perfect personwho ever lived, we must expect to stretch our souls....</i><br><br><i>. . . Examples improve society more than sermons. Most people would rather see a sermon than hear one.</i> ["Brother's Keeper," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1986, 20, 23]<br><br>Service that stretches our souls is the most meaningful. My father clearly taught me the importance of soul-stretching service--of living a sermon. I grew up in Perry, Utah. The stake in which I grew up had a dairy farm and fruit orchards that provided regular opportunities for service. On one occasion it was time to harvest the hay, and our ward was assigned a particular day to work. My dad was always one of the first to volunteer for these priesthood assignments. I recall him reminding me one evening that the next day was our assignment and that we needed to be at the Church farm at 5 p.m. We arrived a few minutes before five. Additional brethren and young men arrived, and we worked together to bring inthe hay.<br><br>I remember that we had been working for an hour or so when some of the brethren began to leave. Some who had arrived after we had were already leaving. I looked at my dad and suggested that we could go as well. He smiled and said it didn't matter what the others were doing. We had agreed to serve for the entire time of the assignment, and there was still work to be done. The response was kind and clear; I had better stop watching others and stay focused on my opportunity to serve as I had agreed to do. That example of soul-stretching service has helped me so many times in mylife.<br><br>I appreciate the challenge that Sister Bonnie D. Parkin gave us at the devotional on February 13 of this year. She asked us to find our personal ministries and to serve others around us. She said:<br><br><i>Personal ministry can answer prayers. We can offer a daily prayer that enlists the help of the Lord Jesus Christ as we ask: "Help me to be the answer to someone's prayer today." The Lord consistently answers this prayer as we tune our eyes and ears todiscerning the needs of those around us. . . .</i><br><br><i>As you leave the Marriott Center today, you will have immediate opportunities to practice your personal ministry. Please, never suppress a generous thought.</i> ["Personal Ministry: Sacred and Precious," BYU devotional, 13 February 2007]<br><br>For those of you who attended that devotional, how many have asked in your prayers to be the answer to someone else's prayers? Letus be living sermons of service.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland challenged us to come unto the Savior through service to others. He stated:<br><br><i>The people around us need a lot of help, and I think the Lord expects us to join in that effort. I think that is what he meant when he said,</i> "Come; <i>see what Ido and watch how I spend my time." . . .</i><br><br><i>On the example of the Savior himself and his callto his apostles, and with the need for peace and comfort ringing in our ears, I ask you to be a healer, be a helper, be someone who joins in the work of Christ in lifting burdens, in making the load lighter, in making things better. . . . Someone sitting within reasonable proximity to you tonight is carrying a spiritual or physical or emotional burden of some sort or some other affliction drawn from life's catalog of a thousand kinds of sorrow. In the spirit of Christ's first invitation to Philip and Andrew and then to Peter and the whole of his twelve apostles, jump into this work. Help people. Heal old wounds and try to make things better.</i> ["Come unto Me," fireside address given at BYU, 2 March 1997; emphasis added]<br><br>Through soul-stretching service to others werespond to the Savior's invitation to come.<br><h2><b>Self-Evaluation</b></h2><br>Finally, let us use the last letter in the word <i>come</i> to remind us to be engaged in self-evaluation. <i>Come unto Christ through the ordinances and covenants of the gospel, ministering to others with ahumble attitude of self-evaluation.</i><br><br>Over the years I have learned that evaluations we make of our own performance can fall on a continuum, with Superficial Self-Evaluation on one end, Critical but Healthy Self-Evaluation in the middle, and Hypercritical Self-Evaluation at the other end.<br><br>Let's start with Superficial Self-Evaluation at the left end of the continuum. This type of evaluation lacks the depth of reflective thought. We skim over our weaknesses and view our strengths as better than they perhaps are. Without much thought we declare ourselves in good spiritual condition and worthy of more blessings from Heavenly Father.<br><br>On the right end of this continuum would be Hypercritical Self-Evaluation. At this end of the continuum would be those who find fault with every aspect of their lives. These individuals pick apart their good lives and service in the kingdom. They believe that there is very little good in what they have accomplished or in the service they have rendered.<br><br>Our goal should be to engage in self-evaluation and reflection that is in the middle of this continuum: Critical but Healthy Self-Evaluation. When we engage in critical but healthy self-evaluation we can be honest with ourselves. We can clearly see our strengths and our weaknesses. We know what we can do to improve our weaknesses. We recognize that through the atoning sacrifice of our Savior we do not have to be perfect today, and we can know what things we must do to strengthen ourselves.<br><br>I have found that three times in particular provide perfect settings for deep, personal self-evaluation and reflection: during daily, personal scripture study; while partaking of the sacrament each week in sacrament meeting; and when we are in the temple.<br><br>One of the first ways to receive insights from Heavenly Father as we engage in deep self-evaluation is through our individual study of the scriptures. Daily scripture study is one of the best ways I know of to become aware of my strengths and weaknesses. We must each find the time and place that is best for us to meaningfully study the scriptures. I have found that for me the best time is in the early hours of the morning. I love arising early and spending time in the scriptures and in prayer before turning my attention to other activities for theday.<br><br>In a recent fireside for young adults, Elder David A. Bednar taught us a pattern for effective scripture study:<br><br><i>You and I must look to and</i> come unto Christ, <i>who is "the fountain of living waters" . . . , by reading ... , studying . . . , searching . . . , and feasting ... upon the words of Christ as contained in the holy scriptures. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The central and recurring theme of the Book of Mormon is the invitation for all to</i> "come unto Christ, <i>and be perfected in him." . . . The teachings, warnings, admonitions, and episodes in this remarkable book of scripture all focus upon and testify of Jesus the Christ as the Redeemer and our Savior.</i> ["A Reservoir of Living Water," fireside address given at BYU, 4 February 2007; emphasis added]<br><br>As I have read the Book of Mormon multiple times, I continue to find the questions asked in the book of Alma to be the most meaningful self-evaluation questions:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day:</i> Come <i>unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth? . . .</i><br><br><i>And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.</i><br><br><i>I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying:</i> Come <i>and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.</i> [Alma 5:14–16, 61–62; emphasis added]<br><br>I challenge you to reread the entire fifth chapter of Alma. This chapter provides excellent self-evaluation questions that we can ask ourselves.<br><br>During the quietness of the sacrament is a second time when we can engage in deep self-evaluation. Heavenly Father will bring to our minds the things that we have done that require that we make improvements. He will also bring to our minds the peace that will confirm that we are making progress.<br><br>Finally, as we regularly enter the temple we can use the perfectness of that quiet environment to reflect and pray. Within the walls of the temple Heavenly Father has provided many answers to my concerns.<br><br>During a recent visit to the temple I whispered to my wife that I could sit in the celestial room forever.<br><br>She smiled and said, "But we'd better be about our work."<br><br>The quietness of the temple can provide a refuge from the cares and concerns of the world. We leave there better prepared to move back into the world and to be instruments in our Heavenly Father's hands in serving those around us.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>As I conclude this morning, let me remind you of the challenge I gave at the beginning. My desire is that you will depart from the devotional today with at least one idea that you can apply in your lives to become a better Latter-day Saint. I also hope that you can use the word <i>come</i> to remember the Savior's invitation.<br><br>Let me close with a scripture that helps me more fully understand this invitation to come. This invitation is accompanied with perhaps the greatest blessing of all:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who <b>forsaketh his sins</b> and <b>cometh unto me,</b> and <b>calleth on my name,</b> and <b>obeyeth my voice,</b> and <b>keepeth my commandments,</b> <b>shall see my face</b> and <b>know that I am.</b></i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:1; emphasis added]<br><br>What greater promise could we receive? This is the blessing that I seek, and I invite you to seek the same blessing.<br><br>I testify that Christ wants each of us to respond to His invitation to come. May we <i>come unto Christ through the ordinances and covenants of the gospel, ministering to others with a humble attitude of self-evaluation.</i> In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil J. Anderson was a professor of linguistics and English language when this devotional address was given on 8 May 2007.</i><br><br><i>©Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ic Priorities” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be with you this morning. You have just heard that President Samuelson is traveling today. I am disappointed. I had hoped to borrow a blue tie from him for today's devotional. I actually considered buying one but wasn't sure I would ever have occasion to use it again! President Samuelson is a great leader, a devoted Latter-day Saint, and a dear friend and colleague in the Seventy. He and I were in undergraduate school together--at the University of Utah. I can assure you that it crossed neither of our minds in those days that he would be the president of Brigham Young University or that I would be speaking to the student body here! How interesting and unpredictable is the course of life.<br><br>In discussing this assignment with a trusted friend in the Seventy some time ago, he suggested speaking to the topic of "prophetic priorities." That thought resonated with me, and Ihave chosen it as my topic today. This has been the subject of General Authority training for some time now as we try to focus on what the current prophet is teaching and the direction in which he is leading. I am grateful for his suggestion, as it has given me the opportunity to think and to study this theme even more carefully. The citations I will use are those of our current prophet. Other prophets have also had much to say about these and other priorities, and I commend their teachings to you as well.<br><br>There is an interesting line in the movie <i>Anna and the King.</i> As our current prophet approaches the end of a long and productive life, think of these words in the context of that life and the impact he has had on the Church and on the world:<br><br><i>It is always surprising how small a part of life is taken up by meaningful moments. Most of them ... are over before they start, although they cast a light on the future and make the person who originated them unforgettable.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Of course there will not be time this morning to discuss with you an exhaustive list of these prophetic priorities. In preparing for this talk I counted well over 30 from President Hinckley's recent speeches and writings. Rather, I will limit the number discussed to six.I will not attempt to speak of them in any particular order of importance. They are:<br><br>1. Temple work and building temples<br><br>2. Paying tithing<br><br>3. Avoiding unnecessary debt<br><br>4. Extending forgiveness to others<br><br>5. The family<br><br>6. Personal testimony<br><br>Before going on to discuss these, however, Iwould like to make an observation. As I have thought about this subject, it has occurred to me that all of our modern prophets have been optimists. That certainly is true of President Hinckley. Virtually every time he speaks, heleaves us with a sense that the future is bright, and we feel optimism, hope, and the desire to do a little better. He manages to do so even while warning of the dangers and pitfalls that beset us and even while, at times, chastising us.<br><br>Everything we do in this Church requires optimism. The building of temples is a sign of great optimism. The creation of new stakes and new missions; the opening of new areas to missionary work; the building of hundreds of meetinghouses every year, year after year; the tremendous humanitarian effort we carry forth; the continued support of this great educational institution--all are signs of great optimism.<br><br>And so, what is the role of a prophet? It is to warn the people; it is to preach and teach of the Savior; it is to proclaim the restored gospel to the world; and, yes, it is to continue to lead, build, promote, and encourage personal growth among all of God's children and to establish the Church in all the world in an optimistic way, in spite of and in the face of terrorists, doomsayers, economic ups and downs, wars, and rumors of wars.<br><br>I love the optimism in what is said to be an inscription on an old Yorkshire church tablet:<br><br><i>In the year 1652 when through England all things sacred were either profaned or neglected, this church was built by Sir Robert Shirley, ... whose special praise it is to have done the best of things in the worst of times and to have hoped them in the most calamitous.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>So it is, I have found, with modern-day prophets. They teach, they cajole, they encourage, they warn, they build, they move forward boldly in the best of ways even in the worst of times, and they continue to look forward with faith in the most calamitous.<br><h2><b>First: Temple Work and Building Temples</b></h2><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>These unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered therein, represent the ultimate in our worship. These ordinances become the most profound expressions of our theology. I urge our people everywhere, with all of the persuasiveness of which I am capable, to live worthy to hold a temple recommend, to secure one and regard it as a precious asset, and to make a greater effort to go to the house of the Lord and partake of the spirit and the blessings to be had therein. I am satisfied that every man or woman who goes to the temple in a spirit of sincerity and faith leaves the house of the Lord a better man or woman.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>We now have 124 operating temples, with several others announced. This is nearly three times the number operating in 1995, when our current prophet became president. I responded to a very rare invitation by my father to accompany him on a journey through Africa in 1998. I was not a General Authority at the time. In Ghana, after examining a proposed temple site in Accra and approving of its purchase, he announced to the 6,000 members gathered in an outdoor meeting that a temple would be built in their land. The response was instant and unexpected. They stood and embraced their neighbors. Many wept and pointed to the ground as if to say, "We will have a temple right here in our homeland." We had been told the day before of a couple who recently had walked 25 kilometers in order to renew their temple recommends, with no hope ever of seeing a temple. I will never forget my father's response. He said, "We are here to give them hope." I will always remember that experience. That temple was dedicated in January 2004.<br><br>I plead with you to be worthy to hold a temple recommend at the time in your lives when it is appropriate, to never let it lapse, andto use it frequently. You will be blessed as a result. How grateful I am for the magnificent blessing of temples.<br><h2><b>Second: Paying Tithing</b></h2><br>Said our prophet:<br><br><i>I am profoundly grateful for the law of tithing. To me it is a constantly recurring miracle. It is made possible by the faith of the people. It is the Lord's plan for financing the work of His kingdom.</i><br><br><i>It is so simple and straightforward. It consists of thirty-five words set forth in section 119 of the Doctrine and Covenants. What a contrast with the cumbersome, complex, and difficult tax codes with which we live as citizens.</i><br><br><i>There is no compulsion to pay tithing, other than the commandment of the Lord, and that, of course, becomes the best of all reasons.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>I have a deep testimony of the law of tithing. It has blessed my life. Through observing this law, my faith has increased, my empathy for those in need has deepened, and my appreciation for the Lord's blessings has grown. My testimony is stronger as a result of my observance of this law. I am at a loss to give expression for my gratitude to the Lord for the blessings Iattribute to the law of tithing. Don't wait until you think you can afford to pay tithing. There is never a time when you can afford NOT to pay it.<br><h2><b>Third: Avoiding Unnecessary Debt</b></h2><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>We have been counseled again and again concerning self-reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift. So many of our people are heavily in debt for things that are not entirely necessary. When I was a young man, my father counseled me to build a modest home, sufficient for the needs of my family, and make it beautiful and attractive and pleasant and secure. He counseled me to pay off the mortgage as quickly as I could so that, come what may, there would be a roof over the heads of my wife and children. I was reared on that kind of doctrine. I urge you as members of this Church to get free of debt where possible and to have a little laid aside against a rainy day.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>When I was 12 years old, my father took me along to look for a new car. Nothing is more exciting for a boy than to shop for a new car with his father. Our car was old and well worn. On the outdoor lot of a car dealer was a brand-new 1953 Plymouth. It was just the ticket, my father thought. A four-door sedan at a reasonable price. After some rather intense negotiating, my father said, "Would you take $1,600 cash?" I was stunned. I didn't think anyone in the world had that much money, let alone my father! The offer was accepted, and that car served us well until I returned from my mission over nine years later. When I turned 16, Ilearned to drive in that car.<br><br>A few years ago, my father reminisced about that car over lunch.<br><br>"That old Plymouth was a great car," he said.<br><br>I reminded him that one of my friend's fathers bought two cars in 1957, just four years after we had acquired the '53 Plymouth--one was a Plymouth Fury, the other a Studebaker Golden Hawk. You're too young to remember those speedsters. Both had big V-8 engines and were built to be fast! My friends and I took measure of a car in those days by just how fast it would go over Parley's Summit, a long climb to a high point on the four-lane highway east of Salt Lake City.<br><br>"Both of my friend's cars could do 100 miles an hour over that summit," I said, making sure my father understood that my friend had reported that to me and that I was not present towitness it.<br><br>Curiosity finally got the best of him. "What about the old Plymouth?" he said.<br><br>"Thirty-seven," I reported, "in second gear."<br><br>"Still, it was a wonderful car," he said.<br><br>"It was a flathead six," I complained. "It had no radio, no air-conditioning, no power windows, no power brakes, no power steering, no power seats, no power."<br><br>"It never broke," he said.<br><br>"It couldn't," I said. "It had no moving parts!"<br><br>"You didn't suffer a bit," he said. "And it was paid for."<br><br>He had me. I hadn't suffered, and I knew itwas paid for because I had been there when he bought it and had watched him write out the check for $1,684, including taxes and license.<br><br>Be careful with your finances, my dear young friends. You don't need the finest car or truck, the latest iPod, a big flat-screen television, or the latest laptop to be productive and happy. You will be happy when you can comfortably meet your obligations and put a roof over your head and feed your families.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Extending Forgiveness to Others</b></h2><br>Said President Hinckley:<br><br><i>I think</i> [forgiveness] <i>may be the greatest virtue on earth, and certainly the most needed. There is so much of meanness and abuse, of intolerance and hatred. There is so great a need for repentance and forgiveness. It is the great principle emphasized in all of scripture, both ancient and modern....</i><br><br><i>There are so many in our day who are unwilling to forgive and forget. Children cry and wives weep because fathers and husbands continue to bring up little shortcomings that are really of no importance. And there also are many women who would make a mountain out of every little offending molehill of word or deed....</i><br><br><i>... Somehow forgiveness, with love and tolerance, accomplishes miracles that can happen in no other way.</i><br><br><i>The great Atonement was the supreme act of forgiveness. The magnitude of that Atonement is beyond our ability to completely understand. I know only that it happened, and that it was for me and for you. The suffering was so great, the agony so intense, that none of us can comprehend it when theSavior offered Himself as a ransom for the sins of all mankind.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>A number of years ago I read a little book first published in 1953. It is called <i>Too Late the Phalarope</i> and was written by Alan Paton, the author of <i>Cry, the Beloved Country.</i> As with the latter book, it is set in South Africa. It relates the story of a young husband and father of Afrikaans descent who commits a terrible indiscretion. He humiliates himself, disgraces his community, and brings shame tohis family. He serves time in prison. His aunt longs for his family and others to forgive him and to begin the process of healing from their deep and mortifying wounds. The book contains some poignant passages regarding forgiveness. Here are two:<br><br>"There's a hard law ... that when a deep injury is done to us, we never recover until we forgive."<sup>7</sup><br><br>"[Would that men could] have turned to the holy task of pardon, that the body of the Lord might not be wounded twice, and virtue come of our offences."<sup>8</sup><br><br>I pray that you will cultivate the ability--the gift--to forgive, to let go, to put offense behind you. It may be difficult, but it is necessary. The Lord Himself commanded us to forgive seventy times seven. And He further said: "For he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin."<sup>9</sup> If there exists fracture within your family or with a friend, pray, work, mend, and seek the faith and strength to forgive. Joy, relief, peace, and happiness will be your reward.<br><h2><b>Fifth: The Family</b></h2><br>In 1995 the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles issued "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." It is bold and unequivocal. When President Hinckley announced this proclamation, he said:<br><br><i>With so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth, with so much of deception concerning standards and values, with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn. In furtherance of this we of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles now issue a proclamation to the Church and to the world as a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history....</i><br><br><i>We commend to all a careful, thoughtful, and prayerful reading of this proclamation. The strength of any nation is rooted within the walls of its homes. We urge our people everywhere to strengthen their families in conformity with these time-honored values.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>There can be no mistake as to where the prophet of God stands regarding families. Many of you are married, many not yet. When I think of my own parents--father and mother, man and wife--I sometimes think of the words of Shakespeare found in act 2, scene 1, of <i>KingJohn:</i><br><br><i>He is the half part of a blessd man,</i><br><br><i>Left to be finished by such a she;</i><br><br><i>And she a fair divided excellence,</i><br><br><i>Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>I like to think that Shakespeare borrowed that idea from what Paul wrote to the Saints in Corinth: "Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."<sup>12</sup><br><br>I know marriage and family can be a sensitive subject on this campus. Those of you here, particularly you men who are of sufficient age, have received a great deal of counsel on the subject of dating, courtship, and marriage. Fortunately for you, I do not have time to add to that counsel, only to endorse it and encourage you. I had an experience in connection with the passing of my mother three years ago that affirmed in my heart and soul the grand and magnificent principle of the eternal nature of marriage and of families. It left a deep and lasting impression on my soul, sweet and tender and powerful, for which I will ever be grateful to a loving Father in Heaven.<br><h2><b>Sixth: Personal Testimony</b></h2><br>President Hinckley has repeatedly counseled and urged each of us to work to obtain our own testimony and to live by it. I quote hiswords:<br><br><i>The marvelous and wonderful thing is that any individual who desires to know the truth may receive that conviction....</i><br><br><i>It will take study of the word of God. It will take prayer and anxious seeking of the source of all truth. It will take living the gospel, an experiment, if you please, in following the teachings. I do not hesitate to promise, because I know from personal experience, that out of all of this will come, by the power of the Holy Ghost, a conviction, a testimony, a certain knowledge.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>I will repeat the essence of what I told the students at Ricks College in a talk I gave there six and a half years ago.<br><br>Some of you struggle with certain doctrines or practices of the Church, past or present; they just don't quite seem to fit for you. I say, so what? That's okay. You're still young. <i>Be patient, but be persistent.</i> Keep studying them, thinking about them, and praying about them. Everyone has questions. I suppose even the prophets themselves had and have some questions. But don't throw away the jewels you do have in the meantime. Hold on to them; build on them.<br><br>Did you know that the two greatest intellectual achievements of the first half of the last century, the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, are in some points in conflict with each other? They cannot both be right in every detail. These are not my words but the words of Stephen Hawking, the great British physicist. Yet scientists rely on both of these theories every day to advance scientific knowledge, knowing that someday the differences will be understood, reconciled, and corrected.<br><br>So it is with the gospel and our testimonies, yours and mine. This is not to suggest that the gospel is imperfect, but our understanding of it sometimes is. Like the scientist who uses relativity and quantum mechanics, we do not discard the gospel or our testimony because not every piece "fits" today. Years ago a Church leader used the following metaphor: Have you ever watched a stonemason build a rock wall? He will sometimes pick up a rock that just does not fit anywhere in the niches in the wall. But does he abandon the wall and walk away? No, he simply sets the rock aside and keeps building until a niche appears where it fits and then proceeds until the wall is finished. So perhaps should we temporarily set aside questions that we continue to struggle with and that we cannot quite seem to answer today, having faith that at sometime in the future a niche will appear in the rock wall of our testimony where they fit perfectly. Don't abandon the rock wall of your testimony because one or two rocks don't seem to fit. That has been my personal experience.<br><br>Temples and temple work, tithing, avoiding unnecessary debt, forgiveness, family, personal testimony--these are but a few of the priorities of our current prophet. I encourage you to pay close attention to them and to incorporate them into your lives so as to experience the blessings that will flow from adherence to them. These are difficult and trying times. It would be easy to become discouraged as we look to the future. But remember the optimism of the prophet, which is real and palpable, and remember that, as was the case with Sir Robert Shirley, it is President Hinckley "whose special praise it is to [do] the best of things in the worst of times and to [hope] them in the most calamitous."<br><br>I bear testimony of the truthfulness of these things. I bear witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, the only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, who lives and who leads this church with a sure and divine hand, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>es of a Balanced Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in the small community of South Ogden, Utah. As boys, my older brother and I lived on our bicycles. We rode our bikes everywhere. With the aid of clothespins, we would attach cards on the bicycle frame next to the spokes so that the snapping sound of the cards would imitate the rumbling sound of a motorcycle engine. At least that was our intention. The more cards the better. They wouldn't last long, and soon we would have to replace them with newer cards.<br><br>Other than creating an annoying sound for our neighbors, there was one problem this practice seemed to cause. Some of the spokes began to loosen. Of course my older brother, being 18 months smarter than I, thought he knew exactly what to do: tighten them up. With the help of a special tool we eagerly tightened all the spokes--even the spokes that didn't need tightening. We gave them all an extra tug or two just to be sure they wouldn't loosen again.<br><br>Soon we began our first test run of our newly tightened rims and wheels. To our surprise the tires were wobbly and crooked. What we didn't know was that all the spokes needed to be perfectly balanced in tightness to keep the rim and tire straight so they wouldn't rub against the bicycle frame.<br><br>Could it be that sometimes our lives are similar to this? Do we have a few loose spokes? Let's review some of our spokes today and see how we are doing in creating a smooth and balanced ride through life.<br><h2><b>Spoke Number One: Include Laughter EachDay</b></h2><br>I have learned that the ability to find the humor in life, to laugh at everyday family calamities, helps keep life in perspective. If we will learn to laugh and play more with our family and friends, not only will we feel better but so will they.<br><br>As Brigham Young put it:<br><br><i>I will take the liberty of suggesting to my brethren who address the congregation that our sermons should be short, and if they are not filled with life and spirit let them be shorter.</i> [<i>JD</i> 12:27]<br><br>Sister Hinckley would say concerning her counsel of laughing your way through life: "You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (quoted in Virginia H. Pearce, ed., <i>Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999], 107; see also "At Home with the Hinckleys," <i>Ensign,</i> October 2003, 24).<br><br>Humor, used with sensitivity, can unite spouses. While I was serving as bishop of a singles ward, an engaged couple asked me if they could have their wedding reception at ourhouse.<br><br>I quickly replied, "Of course you can."<br><br>I forgot to tell my wife. When she received their wedding invitation a few days before the big event, she happened to notice the address of the reception. When I got home from work she asked me if I had forgotten to tell her something important.<br><br>After considerable thought I said, "No, not that I can think of."<br><br>"Are we having a wedding reception at our house?" she asked.<br><br>From the expression on her face, I could tell I was in trouble.<br><br>"Oooooh, you mean <i>that</i> reception," I replied.<br><br>This is when you hope your wife has a good sense of humor. I quickly helped her prepare our home for the wedding reception--under her able direction, of course.<br><br>Most family calamities, given enough time, provide humor and laughter--like the time I took our misbehaving two-year-old son, Tyler, home from sacrament meeting. (We live right next door to the church.) After turning on cartoons for my son, I fell asleep and didn't wake up when my five-year-old showed up to take Tyler back to Primary.<br><br>Sacrament meeting was not quite over, andthe bishop was pouring out his soul to the congregation when the two children returned. The trouble was, Tyler had stripped down to moon boots and training pants and picked up his popgun rifle on the way out the door. It became whisper quiet when Tyler marched upthe aisle with his rifle, took aim, and shotthe bishop. It sure woke up the congregation.<br><br>Of course it wasn't funny then. Time helps humor emerge gradually. The trick is finding the humor in the event now.<br><br>So perhaps a laugh a day does keep the doctor away. As the scriptures say: "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine" (Proverbs 17:22).<br><br>Does this mean we go around laughing all the time? Of course not. But we certainly could laugh a lot more than we do.<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Two: Pray</b></h2><br>"Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10).<br><br>When I turned 12 years old, I went on my first overnight campout with the Scouts. With eager hands I packed my hand-me-down camping gear and headed to the mountains with the troop. I ended up sleeping in a large tent with several other boys, including my older brother. Being the newest and youngest Scout, I felt somewhat intimidated by it all. It was nice to have my older brother with me. He was big and strong and older than most of the other Scouts.<br><br>As we all prepared for bed, I quietly climbed out of my sleeping bag and knelt down to say my nightly prayer. As I was praying, I could hear some of the other boys laughing at what Iwas doing. I was embarrassed and stopped.<br><br>My older brother came to my rescue. Responding to the teasing boys, he said in a loud voice, "If my little brother wants to pray, he's going to pray. Anybody object?"<br><br>Not a word was said, and I went back to my prayer. Ihave often thought of this experience, and I'm thankful for my brother who taught me not to be ashamed to pray regardless of where we are.<br><br>President Faust has said:<br><br><i>Each of us has problems that we cannot solve and weaknesses that we cannot conquer without reaching out through prayer to a higher source ofstrength. That source is the God of heaven to whom we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.</i> [James E. Faust, "The Lifeline of Prayer," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2002, 59]<br><br>Prayer is our direct communication with ourHeavenly Father. We do need to be on the right frequency, however, and be precisely tuned in to communicate. It reminds me of a time when I was trying to listen to a BYU basketball game on KSL while driving home from Idaho. The ball game would fade in and out as I meandered through the mountains on my journey home. And so it is with prayer: One cannot be tuned into the right frequency while engaged in inappropriate behavior. We may from time to time need to adjust our spiritual frequency dial to hear our Heavenly Father with perfect clarity.<br><br>While I was serving as a missionary in Western Canada, our mission president asked one of the elders to bless the food we were about to partake of. The elder blessed the food and everything else he could think of. After the lengthy prayer ended, the mission president tactfully counseled us about public prayers. He said that when we are asked to pray, we should keep the prayer focused on the purpose of the prayer. If you are asked tobless the food, then bless the food and that'sit.<br><br>Francis M. Lyman, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was quoted by Bruce R. McConkie in <i>Mormon Doctrine</i> concerning meeting prayers:<br><br>It is not necessary to offer very long and tedious prayers, either at opening or closing. <i>It is not only not pleasing to the Lord for us to useexcess of words, but also it is not pleasing to the Latter-day Saints.</i> Two minutes will open any kind of meeting, and a half minute will close it. [In <i>MD,</i> 583, "prayer"; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Three: Make the Best ofEachDay, Good or Bad</b></h2><br>As I was growing up, my family would occasionally go to an amusement park located a few miles from Ogden. In those days you would purchase a special pass containing a certain number of tickets for different rides in the park. One of the tickets was for entrance into what they called the fun house. We always saved the fun house for last because once we got in we could stay there for as long as we wanted.<br><br>Inside this attraction were two very large moving barrels. They were connected together, each one turning in the opposite direction. The idea was to see if you could keep your balance and walk upright through these two barrels without falling down. When I tried to walk through the barrels, I immediately fell down. I tried to stand up but fell down again. Being somewhat determined, I tried a third time, only to fall again. Most of the other people had mastered the challenge and either stepped on me or maneuvered around me and continued through the barrels.<br><br>At this point, somewhat embarrassed andslightly in pain, I decided to quit and justsit down and stay at the bottom. Well, the barrels didn't care what I decided to do; they just kept turning. I found myself being tossed and tumbled like I was inside a giant clothes dryer. It didn't take long to realize that giving up was much worse than trying.<br><br>I gathered myself together as best I could and, with some struggle, began to crawl on my hands and knees just to stop from tumbling and to keep my balance. Soon I was able to go from crawling to standing up in short spurts. Finally I could stand up and walk in perfect rhythm with the turning barrel.<br><br>I began to slowly make my way through the first barrel but soon encountered the second barrel going the opposite direction. This required me to quickly switch directions while maintaining my balance. After several miscues I finally made it through the barrels.<br><br>I tell this story because it reminds me of how life is sometimes. Have you ever felt your life moving in opposite directions? Tumbling, falling, standing up, falling again, and wanting to give up? But be advised: You don't want to give up. You never want to give up.<br><br>As Paul put it:<br><br><i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . .</i><br><br><i>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</i> [Romans 8:35, 37]<br><br>We know that we don't have control over all the situations that come into our lives each day. But, then again, it's not so much what comes into our lives as it is how we respond to it. For example, when I think of the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, it is easy to see that Joseph made the best of each situation he encountered. I believe he was a good son. He was obedient and respectful to his parents, but, sadly, his brothers were jealous of him and eventually sold him as a slave. It's kind of hard to imagine that brothers would do that. Of course we know the story doesn't endthere, does it? He was the best slave; he was the best prisoner; he was the best servant; he was the best steward over Potiphar's household. Eventually he became the best ruler in Egypt. And in the end he forgave his brothers and saved his family. He made the best out of each situation that came his way, good or bad.<br><br>The Apostle Paul said: "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God. . . . If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:28, 31).<br><br>Described by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, President Hinckley's philosophy is: "Things will work out. Keep trying. Be believing. Be happy. Don't get discouraged. Things will work out" (Jeffrey R. Holland, "President Gordon B. Hinckley: Stalwart and Brave He Stands," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1995, 12).<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Four: Serve Others</b></h2><br>Spencer W. Kimball said: "When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective" ("Small Acts of Service," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, 2).<br><br>How do we serve? One of the best ways to serve is in our local ward. We should be active in our ward. I don't mean a little active. I mean very active, very involved. This is the one area in which we can probably serve the most. We don't necessarily have to have a formal calling. There are many ways to serve without a calling. The Lord has said: "It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant" (D&amp;amp;C 58:26).<br><br>When sign-up sheets are passed around in priesthood or Relief Society, do we sign up? Or do we only sign up when it fits our schedule? Is that really how to serve? Are we good home teachers, good visiting teachers? Could it be that we are some of the people who passed by the wounded man on the road to Jericho in the parable of the good Samaritan? I hope not. Ihope we are the good Samaritan.<br><br>As the Savior told the lawyer:<br><br><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i><br><br><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i> [Luke 10:36–37]<br><br>While serving as bishop of a BYU singles ward, I knew one young man in the ward who supported everything we sponsored. He came to every family home evening, every activity, every dance, every service project. Anything the ward sponsored, he was there. The reason I bring this up is because he didn't actually need the activities for himself. He had a serious girlfriend in another ward and was soon to be engaged, but still he came. I asked him why he came to all the ward social functions. He humbly replied, "I feel like if I attend, perhaps I can contribute to the success of the event. Maybe I can help someone feel welcome, maybe I can add to the fun. I just think it's another great opportunity to serve." In other words, he didn't attend to see what was in it for him but rather what he could contribute toothers.<br><br>When my older brother and I were growing up, my dad always dragged us to the welfare farm. I say "drag" because we didn't want to go, but dad always took us anyway. Iremember that usually the work was hard and unpleasant, like pulling weeds in the hot sun. I recall my father telling us once that all those people working out there were serving people they didn't even know. He said, "Take a good look and see who is here. These members are the stalwarts of our ward. They don't have to be here. There is no glory, no fanfare, no recognition here--just quiet, behind-the-scenesservice."<br><br>As a newly married student at BYU I was called to serve in a BYU ward bishopric. I tried to serve the bishop as best I could, but my wife and I loved to travel to visit with our families on the weekends as much as possible. This meant getting excused from my church responsibilities.<br><br>After a few months serving this way, I noticed that while the bishop did politely excuse me, he was disappointed that I would be away again. I asked him if it was all right that we visit our families so often. His reply surprised me: "I would like to visit my family as well, but my calling is to serve here."<br><br>I got the message. I was serving when it didn't interfere with my plans--when it was convenient. I learned from this good bishop what it really meant to actually serve the Lord. I thought I knew how to serve before this experience, but I was wrong. Visiting my family was certainly important, but I learned I could do both. With some planning I found time to visit my family after I had completed my calling. There will always be some things you have to give up to do justice to a calling, whether it's in the bishopric or as a home teacher. I've decided that we probably have enough time to do all that the Lord expects us to do--including visiting our families--but we probably don't have enough time to do all the things we would like to do.<br><br>As King Benjamin said: "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Five: Don't Be Distracted byWorldly Things</b></h2><br>It is easy to get caught up in worldly things. The world is always selling something so enticing, so inviting. We are always wanting things and then more things. Everywhere we are told, "Go ahead; you deserve it." Not that wanting things is all bad, but it can be if this becomes the dominant force of your life. The Apostle Paul counseled: "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:18).<br><br>My parents always told me that the best things in life are free. Now I think I know what they meant: family, friends, grandchildren, church, smiles, sunsets, mountains, trees, birds, flowers, and even my dog. Of course, some of these aren't actually free, but they are eternal.<br><br>The Savior said:<br><br><i>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</i> [Matthew 6:24]<br><br>Some people think you can have one foot in the world and one foot in the Church. Is this really possible? And why would you want to anyway? I believe the reason why the Lord told Adam to stop what he was doing on the seventh day and worship Him was to have a reminder of why we are here in the first place. It's a weekly course correction to see if we are on track. I'm sure after Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden of Eden that life was filled with hard work just to survive. But, even so, Adam stopped, paused, and worshipped God on the seventh day--pretty good advice for all of us.<br><br>Nephi told us that in our day good would be called evil and evil would be called good (see 2 Nephi 15:20). Does that sound like the world to you? Have you ever noticed how often religion and spirituality are portrayed as confining, narrow-minded, and weak?<br><br>Be careful about what you accumulate in this life. Paul warned: "For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out" (1 Timothy 6:7).<br><br>We need to remember that all we take with us is who we have become through serving God.<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Six: Be an Example</b></h2><br>Years ago a friend of mine told me an incredible story about his father's first exposure to the Church. His father was in the navy during World War II. While serving on a battleship he became acquainted with two Mormon boys from Idaho. They were nice boys and everyone seemed to like them, but they were different. When the ship would come into port, many of the sailors would go into town to party and drink--but not these two. They seemed to find their own fun and avoid the crowd. When the war ended my friend's father married, settled in Southern California, and became the father of two young children. One Sunday morning while working on his roof, his wife shouted up to him, saying something likethis:<br><br>"Don't you think it's about time that we started taking our children to church?"<br><br>"Good idea," he replied.<br><br>"Yes, but what church?" she asked.<br><br>"Take them to the Mormon Church," he said. "Two of the nicest sailors I ever met were Mormons."<br><br>"But where is the Mormon Church?" she asked.<br><br>"Look it up in the phone book," he answered.<br><br>And so she did. To her surprise she found a Mormon church building not far from their home. She dressed her two small children in their nicest clothes and took them to the LDS Church. They were welcomed with open arms. The ward members took the children directly to junior Sunday School. The children had a great time and asked to go back week after week. Soon the parents were attending also. They were all baptized into the Church.<br><br>The story doesn't end there. The parents were so excited about this new church they had found for their family that they told some of their best neighbor friends about it. Soon other families in the neighborhood were going to the same Mormon ward. From this small beginning, three generations later, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in the Church today. Why? Because two Mormon boys from Idaho lived their religion.<br><br>One of the amazing parts of this story is that these two boys from Idaho had no idea of the impact they had on one person in the navy. Imagine their joy in the next life when they meet all these Latter-day Saints. "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).<br><br>Sometimes when a missionary returns home we hear questions like: Have you made the adjustment to normal life? Have you returned to the earth yet?<br><br>Why in the world would we suggest that? Shouldn't <i>we</i> be trying to be more like <i>them?</i> Wouldn't it be better if all of us acted like recently returned missionaries? Isn't that what a Latter-day Saint should be?<br><br>As President McKay said many times: "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part" (<i>Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David O. McKay,</i> comp. Clare Middlemiss [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1955], 174).<br><h2><b>Spoke Number Seven: Build Your FoundationonChrist</b></h2><br>As a teenager I worked for my brother-in-law doing house construction. It was always interesting to watch the excavation crew with their big bulldozer come out and dig a huge hole for the house. After the bulldozer was finished, we would all climb down into the large hole and begin digging the footings upon which the foundation would rest. It was hard to imagine that this hole would soon become a beautiful new home. But this is where it all begins. Without the foundation, there is no home--at least not a home that would make itthrough the changing seasons of our climate. This is what makes the home strong, firm, and almost immovable.<br><br>This must have been what Helaman meant when he counseled his sons:<br><br><i>Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you.</i> [Helaman 5:12]<br><br>So, yes, it's probably a good idea to check your spokes of life periodically, just as we as boys checked the spokes on our bicycles. Be careful though; keep them not only tight but also balanced for a smoother ride through life.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gary K.

<h1>hman on the Tower - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's wonderful to be with you this morning on the BYU campus. Before I share with you my prepared remarks, I have just a couple of thoughts I would like to express. First of all, thank you for that lovely choir that has come together with a beautiful hymn. I felt of the Spirit, and I pray the Spirit will continue as wemeet here today.<br><br>I just returned a few days ago from an assignment in the South Pacific, where I had stake conferences and trained temple workers in the islands of Fiji and Tonga and visited missionaries in the New Zealand Wellington Mission. I wish I could take you there and let you feel of the faith of these wonderful Saints of the islands, and I wish I could bring them here to see the opportunities that you have. We would both benefit from that. The Church is doing well in those islands, but there are great challenges. They don't have near the opportunities and privileges that you have--especially for education. But how blessed you are and how blessed they are to do what they can in the circumstances that they have.<br><br>Second, the last almost six years I have been a member of the Church Board of Education, which includes the Board of Trustees for Brigham Young University here at Provo and for the other Church Educational System institutions. I meet every other week with the executive board, which consists of two members of the Twelve and the Church commissioner, and then every month we meet with the First Presidency as the Board of Trustees. I just want you to know how much these Brethren love you and how concerned they are that you get a good education, that you are happy, that you are doing well, that you are physically healthy and strong, and that you are achieving what you desire to achieve here at this university.<br><br>This is a remarkable university. President Cecil Samuelson is one of my esteemed Brethren of the Seventy, and we served together in the presidency for several years before he was called to this position. So it's a wonderful privilege to be back here. I'm also grateful for Brother John Tanner, one of your great vice presidents who does all that he does so very well.<br><br>Now, what I would like to do today is to share with you a beautiful parable. Most of the parables are found in the New Testament, where Jesus taught with such beauty and simplicity; however, the parable I would like to share is found in the Doctrine and Covenants and was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland in 1833. It is the parable of the watchman on the tower:<br><br><i>A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive-trees;</i><br><br><i>And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive-trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.</i><br><br><i>Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded them, and planted the olive-trees, and built a hedge round about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower.</i><br><br><i>And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say among themselves: And what need hath my lord of this tower?</i><br><br><i>And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?</i><br><br><i>Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need of these things.</i><br><br><i>And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful, and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord.</i><br><br><i>And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olivetrees.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil?</i><br><br><i>Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and--after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof--built the tower also, and set a watchman upon the tower, and watched for myvineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?</i><br><br><i>And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my vineyard from the hands of the destroyer.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>This parable is found in section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let me summarize what happened in this parable: A loving nobleman had 12 olive trees he wished to protect. He instructed his servants to guard them. They built a hedge to protect against any intrusion. They were also to build a tower where a watchman could watch for the enemy. However, the servants, in the process of performing their work, became slothful, discounted the instructions from the nobleman, and fell asleep. Then the enemy came and destroyed the olive trees.<br><br>It is a simple parable, but it has great application today. Let's review several of thekey elements:<br><br>First, there is a nobleman. We might say for us today that the nobleman is the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord of the vineyard. He is the creator and organizer of this earth. We are privileged inhabitants.<br><br>He has a very choice spot of land where He has planted 12 olive trees. Perhaps the choice land today is where you live--your stake, your ward, your home, your dorm, your neighborhood, and even your country.<br><br>Now what might be the 12 olive trees that the nobleman wished to protect? I believe the 12 olive trees are families. The olive tree figures realistically and figuratively in the gospel, the scriptures, and the life of the Savior as an object of value and sacredness. For example, the olive tree produces olive oil, which is a symbol of purity. In the days of Noah a dove brought back an actual olive leaf to signify that the waters of the flood were abated from the earth. And Jesus Christ spent His final hours among the olive trees of the Garden of Gethsemane. Itruly believe we, as individuals and families, could be considered the favored, valued, sacred olive trees; we are to be protected.<br><br>In addition to the trees and the nobleman, there was a watchman, and he was to stand on a tower. I believe the watchmen today are the prophets and apostles. The Lord has designated President Gordon B. Hinckley as our chief watchman on the tower today. We will be guided and protected from the enemy if we follow his counsel. President Boyd K. Packer is also a watchman on the tower. His biography, written several years ago, is entitled <i>Boyd K. Packer: A Watchman on the Tower.</i><sup>2</sup> Trusted local priesthood leaders, including stake presidents and bishops, are watchmen on the tower to their members and congregations. Certainly a father is a watchman on the tower to his family. Each of you should be a watchman to yourself.<br><br>Now, what of the servants? They are the worker bees. They are all of us today. Every member of the Church could be deemed to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. When we were baptized, we took upon ourselves, by covenant, the name of Jesus Christ and agreed to always remember Him and to keep His commandments. Being a member of the Church and serving in various callings and responsibilities implies that we are servants. We should be willing and prepared to do all that is asked of us.<br><br>In the Holy Land (and I have personally seen them) are remnants or remains of ancient towers--round structures built of rock, like lighthouses near the sea. The purpose of these towers was to provide a structure or facility where the watchman might look out upon the land and see the enemy before he came and destroyed the olive trees.<br><br>Then what might be analogous to the tower today? The tower is a symbolic point of elevation where we may see the enemy before others do. I think today's towers might be revelation, prophets, inspired scriptures, and, certainly, the temple. Revelation from living prophets permits us to see more clearly in a clouded world. Our modern scriptures--the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price--help us understand the Bible more fully. As compared to the world, all of these are opportunities to receive elevated instructions in a troubled world.<br><br>Every aspect of the temple, from its upward-reaching architecture to the inspired teachings and covenant-bearing ordinances, is a tower, apinnacle of elevation.<br><br>Surrounding the olive trees and the choice land was a hedge. A hedge is a barrier. It might be a moat, a ditch, a fence, or some other device that would slow down or prevent the enemy from entering the vineyard and harming the olive trees.<br><br>I believe the hedge that can today slow down and protect us from the enemy might be the standards of the Church, such as the standards in the booklet <i>For the Strength of Youth.</i> The cautions by your parents are standards that will act as a hedge to protect you from the enemy. The counsel of your bishop and local Church leaders is a hedge. The CES Honor Code and standards for admission to this great university are a further hedge and a wonderful measure of protection to you.<br><br>Now, what of the enemy? Obviously, in the parable the enemy is Satan. That has not changed today.<br><br>Satan seeks to destroy. Early in the Prophet Joseph Smith's ministry the Lord warned Joseph of those who might attempt to alter the words of the Book of Mormon translation:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up toiniquity against that which is good. . . .</i><br><br><i>Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>In the parable, Satan destroyed the olive trees. Today he seeks to destroy families.<br><br>How may we protect our families today? Ioffer five suggestions.<br><br><b>First: Listen to and follow the prophets and apostles.</b> They will warn you of impending dangers.<br><br>On April 6, 1830, the day the Church was organized, the Lord instructed the new Church concerning the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i><br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Like the Saints in 1830, when the Church was organized, we have need to listen to the prophets and apostles today. The world is in turmoil. There is much of wickedness, war, andconfusion.<br><br>We read in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Yehear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your doors."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Further, speaking of our generation, we read:<br><br><i>And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shallcover the land.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>The great and satisfying safety in this period of "overflowing scourge" and "desolating sickness" is found in the next verse of this section, which reads as follows: "But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved."<sup>7</sup><br><br>This refers to modern-day prophets and apostles.<br><br>On so many social issues today, when many well-recognized faiths and organizations are caving in to popular appeal, we as a church remain firm and unchanging. Examples include gender identity, the sanctity of birth and life, morality (versus the "new morality"), the sanctity of the body, profanity, proper observance of the Sabbath Day, dress standards (versus sloppiness of dress), pornography, and many others.<br><br>We do not change. If it was wrong in Old Testament days, it is wrong today. If it was wrong in New Testament days, it is wrong today. All this because we have living prophets who "stand in holy places, and [are not] moved."<br><br>The Lord anticipated this when the Church was organized through the Prophet Joseph Smith. We read in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish inBabylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</i><br><br><i>And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets. . . .</i><br><br><i>And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to translate through the mercy ofGod, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>There is one other area today where we need to be guided by prophets and apostles. In the current political arena that we find ourselves in today, there is much confusion in the world about who we are. Right now our Church--and, by implication, all our members--is under a big microscope, and the world is looking in. "Who are these Mormons?" theyinquire.<br><br>Some of us may interpret this inquiry as persecution, but, in reality, it is just confusion on the part of the inquirer.<br><br>Speaking of persecution, President GordonB. Hinckley recently counseled GeneralAuthorities to not worry about being persecuted. He noted that it has been going on since the War in Heaven. He further counseled us that the Church is in good condition and thatwe should just work harder to move the work forward. He concluded by saying that he would worry more about us if people did not speak evil of us. This is good counsel from a prophet.<br><br><b>Second: Be grateful the Church has provided towers.</b> Revelation from on high is for our benefit, especially modern-day revelation received through living prophets.<br><br>The inspired scriptures are to help us see theenemy and be prepared before he comes. Are we continuing to read the Book of Mormon daily, as counseled by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 2005? Are we pondering the scriptures and incorporating their truths into ourlives?<br><br>Those of us who are privileged to enter temples and participate in sacred ordinances know that they are truly towers where we are warned and where we will see and can distinguish the enticings of Satan before they engulf us.<br><br>Speaking of temples, Ezekiel wrote, "And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Regular temple worship will protect our families from Satan.<br><br><b>Third: Keep the standards.</b> Remember the hedge. Especially you young adults, carry a copy of <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> with you at all times. It comes in two sizes: one for your wallet and the other for your scriptures. I have always carried the small <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> in my wallet.<br><br>Live the standards. Be clean. President Hinckley has warned the youth and young adults over and over again of the evils of pornography. Pornography can destroy you just as the enemy destroyed the olive trees.<br><br>There are so many uplifting gospel standards today to help us. None should be viewed as limitations of personal freedom. They should be seen as a hedge of protection against an encroaching enemy. Consider these standards:<br><br>1. I will choose the right. I know I can repent when I make a mistake.<br><br>2. I will use the names of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ reverently. I will not swear or use crude words.<br><br>3. I will do those things on the Sabbath that will help me feel close to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. I will keep my mind and body sacred and pure, and I will not partake of things that are harmful to me.<br><br>5. I will dress modestly to show respect for Heavenly Father and myself.<br><br>6. I will only read and watch those things that are pleasing to Heavenly Father.<br><br>7. I will only listen to music that is pleasing to Heavenly Father.<br><br>8. I will seek good friends and treat others kindly.<br><br>One of the strongest hedges that all of you have is the counsel of your parents. Honor and listen to your parents. Be cooperative. Be happy. Make your home, whether you live with or away from your parents, truly a choice spot of land where the Lord can allow you, a precious olive tree, to grow and develop free from Satan's influence.<br><br><b>Fourth: Believe that you are like an olive tree of old; that is, you are precious.</b> You are a member of the restored Church. Do you truly realize the great blessing that has come into your life to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?<br><br>This Church is the only true church on the face of the earth today. It is the only place where we can go for revelation from living prophets. It is the only place where we can enter into sacred covenants administered by men who hold the holy Melchizedek Priesthood.<br><br>The Lord told Moses: "I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is fullof grace and truth."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Do you believe that the Lord has a work for you to do? Do you believe that you are in the similitude of the Only Begotten, who is Jesus Christ?<br><br>I bear witness and testimony that each of you is a special olive tree in the eyes of the Lord. He loves you.<br><br>And now, in conclusion:<br><br><b>Fifth: Remember the responsibility of being a faithful servant.</b> In the parable the servants began to second-guess. They wondered if the nobleman really had need of a tower. They thought that maybe it was such atime of peace that there was no need to build the tower and protect the olive trees.<br><br>They began to be at variance one with another. They became slothful. They hearkened not unto the commandments of their Lord, and they fell asleep. They were wrong.<br><br>We must be certain that we, as servants, humble, ordinary members of the Church--parents, youth, children, leaders, and teachers--not fall asleep in performing tasks assigned to us from the Lord.<br><br>I believe if we are faithful servants, we will truly see the enemy come before he can destroy our families.<br><br>I bear my testimony that you will be protected from the evils of Satan if you look for the watchman on the tower and faithfully follow all the counsels we receive from the Lord and our leaders, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Earl C.

<h1> Gladly We’ll Walk in the Light” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor to represent my colleagues in the Department of Visual Arts and to be invited to share a few thoughts about my discipline of photography with you today. During the first decade following the organization of the restored Church, the evolutionary steps leading to the invention of photography were taking place. To non-photographers it is probably just an interesting coincidence. But, as a photographer, I find it significant that photography, which literally means "drawing with light," was invented about the same time as the light of the gospel was restored to the earth.<br><br>A photograph is created as light passes through a lens and forms an image on a substrate that is sensitized to light. The material records only the light, not the darkness. So-called photogenic drawings were miraculous to the various inventors in the first third of the nineteenth century. And they continue to mystify practitioners today.<br><br>The word <i>light</i> is frequently used in conjunction with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Weuse the word in two principle ways: the light that illuminates and the light that enlightens and gives understanding. As one who teaches the art of drawing with light, I have frequently incorporated the scriptural aspects of light in my classes. I admonish my students to go to the Topical Guide and examine the scriptures that refer to light and then apply those scriptures to their lives and to their photography.<br><br>For example, the first few verses of Genesis record that God created light and divided it from darkness. While light was created on the first day, according to Genesis, it was not until the fourth day that God created the sun, moon, and stars (see Genesis 1:3–5, 16–19). It would leave one to wonder whether the light created on the first day was light that illuminates or light that enlightens.<br><br>Ecclesiastes 11:7 says, "Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun." As a photographer, I seek the sweet light--light that bathes my photographs with a warm glow and unusual brilliance.<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus identified His disciples as "the light of the world" (Matthew 5:14) and counseled them to "let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). My goal as a photographer has been to follow that counsel. Having produced hundreds of photographs that have been seen around the world in books, magazines, exhibitions, and on the Internet, I frequently ask myself: "Are my photographs a reflection of my testimony and are they being used to promote the values that I believe in? Am I using my talent as suggested in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants: 'for the benefit of those who love [the Lord] and him that seeketh so to do' (D&amp;amp;C 46:9)?"<br><br>I love the familiar lyrics of Clara W. McMaster's "Teach Me to Walk in the Light":<br><br><i>Teach me to walk in the light of his love;</i><br><br><i>Teach me to pray to my Father above;</i><br><br><i>Teach me to know of the things that are right;</i><br><br><i>Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.</i><br><br>[<i>Songbook,</i> 177; also <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 304]<br><br>Each of the three verses ends with an admonition that seems to grow stronger in resolve and commitment. "Teach me, teach me to walk in the light." And then, "Always, always to walk in the light." And, finally, "Gladly, gladly we'll walk in the light."<br><br>Photography, like other contemporary media, has been used for both good and evil. Sadly, the evils of pornography that are frequently preached about by our Church leaders have their most common roots through the lens of a camera. The seductive influence of advertising that lures us toward evil habits frequently comes through the camera's lens. Practices that we are counseled to avoid are often glorified by a camera. The evils of our day are portrayed as being good, exciting, and sought-after through the lens of a camera. Think about the number of times that sin is packaged or framed in beautiful and enticing photographic images.<br><br>And yet the scriptures focus on the correct picture. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon include these words of Isaiah: "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" (Isaiah 5:20, 2 Nephi 15:20). Isaiah's words are easily understood in this scripture. Unfortunately, photography has frequently been used more like an eclipse than as a medium to exhibit the light.<br><br>Again I ask myself, "How do I know if I am being more like an eclipse or more like the light that glorifies?"<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants teaches:<br><br><i>That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i><br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>It is an interesting question to ask about anything we do: "Does my work edify, and does it celebrate light, or does it promote and endorse darkness and evil?"<br><br>I like the counsel that Paul gave the Thessalonian Saints: "Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness" (1 Thessalonians 5:5). As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we <i>are</i> the children of light! We have the light of Christ! Always, always, we'll walk in the light.<br><br>A few years ago I had the assignment of supervising several students who were completing internships in New York City. Included among the interns were photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, and studio artists. They were working with some very prestigious individuals in their respective fields--individuals of considerable influence and notoriety. Part of my responsibility was to follow up with each of the internship providers and see how our BYU interns were performing. It is sometimes tempting for the interns to try to fit in and do the kind of work that is frequently seen in the world, and they are counseled to be true to their culture and upbringing and to "be just who you are and you'll stand out and be noticed."<br><br>As I contacted the various mentors, Ireceived almost the same response: "They are so refreshing. They are so culturally solid. We love having these BYU interns. Send us more." I recall one very important and highly respected photographer--one who we felt had given us a gift by accepting a BYU intern--thanking me for sending the intern and saying, "He is so non–New York. He is so refreshing. He has changed us." He said it three times: "He has changed us." He then added, "And wethink we've changed him a little as well."<br><br>National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones described the difference between being the best <i>in</i> the world and being the best <i>for</i> the world. To be the best <i>in</i> the world, all of the attention is focused on the individual. To be the best <i>for</i> the world, the attention is focused on others. (See <i>Celebrate What's Right with the World,</i> VHS and DVD [Saint Paul, Minnesota: Star Thrower Distribution, 2001].) These interns--and, hopefully, all of us--are preparing to be the best <i>for</i> the world. Always, always we'll walk in the light.<br><br>I love to read the account of Moroni's visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith on the night of September 21, 1823. In detail Joseph described the light that filled his room and surrounded the heavenly being. He described three visitations consuming the entire night. When each ended, the Prophet observed:<br><br><i>The light in the room</i> [began] <i>to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared.</i> [JS--H 1:43]<br><br>The light that both illuminated and enlightened the young prophet is also the light that the angel ascended upon. It appears to me that in the presence of the angel Moroni--a resurrected being full of light--Joseph's capacity for understanding and recall was greatly enhanced. He knew when the messenger was quoting scripture and when Moroni's words varied a little from the way it reads in the Bible. It would seem to imply that Joseph knew word for word what had been told to him after hearing it three times that night and once again the next day. It would indicate, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, that "if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.<br><br>May I share with you some examples of the light that has illuminated some of my photographs?<br><br>While en route to an appointment with a very important photographer, I passed a stand of trees with morning light streaming through the fog and the trees. With a dutiful commitment to being on time for my appointment, Idrove past the scene. The image of the trees and the light etched deeply in my mind as Idrove until it hurt more to go past the trees than it did to think that I might be late for my appointment. "Go toward the light," I heard myself saying. I turned the car around and went back, hoping that it had not changed and also hoping that the photographer with whom I had an appointment would understand the priority of the photograph.<br><br>Gratefully, I found the light unchanged and I made the photograph. Later, when I drove by the trees after my appointment, the fog was gone and the light had changed and the magic had disappeared. The beauty had been in the light.<br><br>A few hundred yards from Ansel Adams' home in Yosemite Valley is a grouping of five trees. I took a workshop with Mr. Adams in 1974 and would get up each morning to go out and make photographs. Coming upon these trees in the pre-sunrise glow that illuminated them, I began to set up the large-format camera as quickly as I could. It is a cumbersome process that after years of experience I have been able to reduce to approximately five minutes. At that time, however, it took me from 10 to 20 minutes to set up and to make the tedious adjustments to the camera.<br><br>During the setup time, the sun came up. The trees were the same, but the light was different. The light had changed from soft brilliance to harsh contrast. The ethereal morning light had quickly changed, and I missed my opportunity. Without making an exposure I put everything away. The next morning I returned to the same spot 30 minutes earlier and again set up the camera. By the time light readings were taken and the exposure calculated, the sun had fully risen and I missed the shot again. The third morning I came even earlier. Again I set up the camera and calculated the exposure. This time I was able to make the photograph. It is a photograph that is still very important to me, one to which in hindsight I can apply President James E. Faust's counsel: "If you can't be on time, then be early."<br><br>I have to admit that the style of my photographs is not readily accepted in contemporary art circles. The mainstream art community summarily rejects photographs that celebrate the beauty of the land as being overly romantic and derivative. In a recent exhibition of my landscape photographs I wrote the following artist statement:<br><br><i>I recall a discussion in a seminar class during my graduate studies. In it the instructor quoted from an article that went something like this: "When everyone was 'hot,' I was 'cool.' When everyone was 'cool,' I was 'hot.'" I feel my work--my career--is summed up in that quote. I have been doing "cool" color photographs for twenty years while black and white has been "hot." I have been "out" doing pristine photographs of the landscape while contemporary photographs of dirt and grit and decay have been "in." I have never been part of the current trend in photography, but I continue to produce the work that I am passionate about. My photographs are about beauty and the ephemeral things of the world. While I photograph the landscape that seems eternal and unchanging, I am more interested in the light and weather that is constantly changing and fleeting. I am interested in things that humans did not create and have no control over--things that humans stand in awe of in spite of the fact that they have been seen hundreds of times: the colors of autumn, the glow of the land under the ethereal light of sunrise, an emotion-filled sky before and after a storm.</i><br><br><i>In a world where we are preoccupied with challenging the intellect, I choose to nurture the soul. I choose to celebrate the positive things of ourworld.</i><br><br>Again, quoting from National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones: "Instead of complaining about what's wrong with the situation, as we often do, ask what's right with it. By celebrating what's right, we find the energy to fix what's wrong" (see <i>Celebrate What's Right</i>).<br><br>"I saw an angel in the stone," said Michelangelo, "and carved to set it free" (see <i>Celebrate What's Right</i>).<br><br>Early in my tenure as a faculty member at BYU, I began photographing the historic buildings of the Church. These included the old tabernacles and meetinghouses found mostly in Utah and Idaho. When I am standing within the walls of these sanctuaries, I feel their pioneer builders' spirit of testimony and commitment. Working almost exclusively with the native materials that were found near their homes, they transformed inhospitable environments into places of worship where the Light of Christ could be felt. Their devotion to their religion and to their God is seen in the craftsmanship exhibited in every detail of these buildings. The stained glass, the intricately carved woodwork, and the hand-painted pews, doors, columns, and railings all invite the Spirit.<br><br>One such example is seen in the Provo Tabernacle. On the rostrum, located behind the pulpit, is a detailed carving created by Thomas M. Allman that extends the entire width of the stand. In the center is a beautifully carved rendering of a sego lily. During the first winter following the arrival of the Mormon pioneers to these valleys, sego lilies growing wild on the hillsides of the Wasatch Mountains gave needed relief to the destitute and starving Saints. Like manna in the desert, sego lilies fed the children of God. Seen in the Provo Tabernacle behind the pulpit, behind the speaker, it is a reminder that a loving Father in Heaven feeds us both physically andspiritually.<br><br>In addition to the tabernacles and meetinghouses, I also began photographing our beautiful temples. Everything we do in the Church today eventually directs us toward the temple. Nothing we build--save possibly the family--is more important than our temples.<br><br>I have had the privilege of doing several books with my friend and colleague Dr. Susan Easton Black, noted professor of Church history and doctrine. In making the photographs for these books, I have been blessed with the opportunity of traveling to significant Church history sites like the following and seeing them in the most incredible light and ethereal conditions imaginable:<br><ul><br>	<li>The Smith family log home where Joseph was living at the time of the First Vision and also where the visitation of the angel Moroni occurred.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The Sacred Grove. (I have photographed trees all over the world, but none are more important to me than these trees.)</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The log home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., where the restored Church was organized on April6, 1830.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The beautiful and significant valley of Adamondi-Ahman in Missouri.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The Seventies Hall in Nauvoo, which was theoriginal Missionary Training Center.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Joseph Smith's Red Brick Store, where the Relief Society was organized in March 1842 and where the first presentation of the endowment in this dispensation was given inMay of that same year.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The newly rebuilt Nauvoo Temple seen from Parley Street--the view that Wilford Woodruff had when he wrote:<i>I was in Nauvoo on the 26th of May, 1846, for the last time, and left the city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell of Nauvoo for this life. I looked back upon the Temple and City as they receded from view and asked the Lord to remember the sacrifices of His Saints.</i> [<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i> ed. Matthias F. Cowley (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), 248]<br><br>Also done with Susan Easton Black was a book on the Holy Land that included these photographs captioned with the scriptures:</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Shepherd's Hill in Bethlehem: "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The Mount of Beatitudes: "And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught them" (Matthew 5:1–2).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Sunset on the Sea of Galilee: "When they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship" (John 6:19).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Jerusalem, the Holy City: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen dothgather her brood [but] ye would not!" (Luke 13:34).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Thorn bush at sunrise: "And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head" (John 19:2).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>And, finally, the Garden Tomb: "Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him" (Mark 16:6).</li><br></ul><br>One of my journal entries from the Holy Land reads as follows:<br><br><i>I find myself wondering, "Did I walk today where Jesus walked?" My intellect tells me no. But my heart and soul wants to believe that I did, and sowills it to my mind.</i><br><br><i>We came to Jerusalem, to Israel, hoping to draw closer to Jesus, wanting to walk the paths where Jesus had walked. Many times during our stay we lamented that we were not feeling of His presence. The schedule was too hectic or the noise or other distractions got in the way. While there were many times when we were touched emotionally and even spiritually, even to the point of tears, yet there was something more we wanted--something unfulfilled.</i><br><br><i>While sitting on the Mount of Olives, and again while looking into the tomb in the peaceful garden, an answer came to me, similar to the one given to Mary when she came looking for Him: "He is not here,</i> [He] <i>is risen" (Luke 24:6).</i><br><br><i>Simple, yet so profound. We find Him today where He promised we would. We find Him when we partake of the sacrament. We find Him when we are gathered together in His name. We find Him in His holy house. We find Him in keeping His commandments. I came to realize that the important question is not "Did I walk today where Jesus walked?" but rather "Am I walking today where Jesus would have me walk?"</i><br><br>I invite each of you to join with me in the resolve that "Gladly, gladly we'll walk in the light." In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John Telford was a BYU professor of visual arts when this devotional address was given on 12 June 2007.</i><br><br><i>©Brigham Young University.

<h1> and Keeping of BYU’s Human Resources - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. This is a real privilege for me to share my thoughts with you this morning. When Brother Skousen called me, I thought about any number of reasons why he would be calling. Giving a devotional talk was the furthest thing from my mind. But here I am. From the introduction you know that I was recently released as Primary president--one of the choicest positions in the Church. At this point I can guarantee you that doing sharing time in Primary is a lot less intimidating and stressful than standing before you this morning.<br><br>Brother Skousen encouraged me to talk about my work in Human Resources, working with the people who make up the campus community. I hope that what I share with you this morning will give you pause to think about the brothers and sisters who serve you every day and your responses to them. My remarks contain experiences from my time as a student, Human Resources employee, and Primary president.<br><br>In Human Resources we have a mission to promote a working and learning environment that helps BYU's campus community to be the best it can be. That means we work within the framework of the gospel and professional guidelines with the hope of helping those with whom we interact, including students, to be successful, happy, and productive in life and in the workplace. My thoughts today center on how you and I treat those human resources who make BYU's environment a wonderful place in which to study and to work.<br><br>I would like to pose some questions to each one of you. The first is: Why are you here at BYU?<br><br>Certainly one reason is to get an education in an environment of positive gospel values. People in general have a desire to be with those who believe as they do and who have similar values. In our case, we want to learn and work in an environment where religious beliefs are blended with secular learning. The prophet Jacob in the Book of Mormon gave a good reason for wanting to be together in such an environment. He said: "And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul" (Jacob 2:8).<br><br>I don't think you are wounded in the literal sense of the word, but it is truly a blessing to come to BYU where you can learn, participate, and, for many of you, work in an environment that allows you "to hear the pleasing word of God." What great strength comes from that opportunity alone!<br><br>My next question is: How do you and I show appreciation and gratitude to those who provide services for us?<br><br>Do we follow our Savior's admonition to love one another and do unto others as we would have done unto us? How do we express appreciation for the many things we seem to assume are rightfully ours?<br><br>Primary children love stories, and so do adults. So here is the first story of the morning. It comes from my student days. I hope that at its finish its purpose will be clear. I remember coming here as a freshman to live in Heritage Halls, to study, and to make new friends--some of whom are still good friends who stay in touch. They are resources of comfort for me.<br><br>During the summers I was a commuter student. And every morning as I drove past a wonderful garden at the corner of Ninth East and Center Street in Provo, I would admire the flowers and vegetables, and the thought would pass through my mind, "I ought to stop and tell that man how much pleasure his garden gives to me." For three summers I made the same drive and had the same thought. That garden brightened my day and brought joy to me. Then one day the <i>Daily Herald</i> had a special feature on the gardener. It was on the obituary page. I never had the opportunity to thank him for the pleasure his garden had given me. I vowed at that time to let people know how they had brightened my life.<br><br>As you leave this devotional today, I would encourage each of you to look at the beautiful grounds that BYU's human resources in the Grounds Department have developed to create an environment that is conducive to learning and to working. Have you ever said "thank you" or "I appreciate your efforts to make campus beautiful for me" to one of the grounds crew? It only takes a moment. Don't lose an opportunity to recognize the efforts of so many to make life pleasant for you.<br><br>There are others on campus who quietly andefficiently go about their work assignments in order to make life pleasant and the environment welcoming to those who learn and work here. Have you ever thanked, smiled at, or acknowledged the Dining Services people who serve you lunch or snacks? Have you expressed appreciation to the custodial staff members who work early and late to keep campus buildings clean and welcoming? There is always a danger of mentioning specific areas on campus because someone will be forgotten. For example, there are all the people in Physical Facilities, Admissions and Records, the Lee Library, the Health Center, the Press Building, and the Bookstore. I could go on and on naming the human resources found on this campus. All of these brothers and sisters--fulltime and students--are here to make campus a place "to hear the pleasing word of God" and a place to learn those secular things that will help to make each of us productive and worthy of the blessings we receive.<br><br>As members of the Church we have been given guidelines on how we should treat each other. When the prophet Alma was preaching privately to the people, he reminded them of the responsibilities incumbent upon those who sought baptism. He set forth criteria for those who wanted to be part of the fold of God and to be called His people (Mosiah 18:8–11). They included:<br><br>1. To be "willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light"<br><br>2. To "mourn with those that mourn"<br><br>3. To "comfort those that stand in need of comfort"<br><br>4. To "stand as witnesses of God at all times"<br><br>The reward for them would be to be redeemed of God and numbered with those of the First Resurrection. I love the response of those who accepted his invitation to be baptized, and I would hope that each one of us could and would respond in the same manner. In Mosiah we read: "And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts" (Mosiah 18:11).<br><br>As members of the BYU community, you and I are blessed in many ways. We all may not have an opportunity in the same manner as these Book of Mormon people to bear each other's burdens or to mourn with those who mourn or to provide comfort, but on a smaller scale you and I have an opportunity to help a classmate or a roommate who is struggling; we can help a coworker who is ill or who is facing odds that appear to be insurmountable. We certainly can all stand as witnesses for Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. And I would hope that in doing so, we would feel the same joy and want to clap our hands to affirm the joy we feel from actively supporting each other in our efforts to gain an education and to become more Christlike in our behavior toward each other.<br><br>Other very important BYU human resources are the faculty members who are here to help guide and direct your studies. Many have come to BYU out of a love of teaching and a sincere desire to be part of the BYU mission to prepare young people to be successful in their lives and careers. They appreciate the opportunity to teach at a university where the gospel can be shared openly and without fear of offending someone.<br><br>I would like to share with you the story of one professor who left an indelible impression on me--one that lingers with me today years after my college days. This professor's name was Christen Jensen. He was the son of Danish immigrants who had struggled to give their son an education. As a history major I had the privilege of taking a constitutional history class from this man. Nearing the end of a long and service-filled career, he was a legend on campus. He had been acting president of the university twice and dean of two colleges, one of which was the graduate school. He served faithfully in the Church. He was a kind husband and father.<br><br>Dr. Jensen would come to class and sit down at the head of the table in the dean's conference room in the old Joseph Smith Building. As students in the class, we were expected to be prepared and to participate. He would talk, ask questions, discuss, and develop thought processes for an hour without benefit of book or notes. His face radiated a joy in teaching and sharing that was easily apparent. Time in that class passed so quickly that it was hard to realize the class time was over.<br><br>One faculty member said of Dr. Jensen, "Ithink we have never had a more loyal and devoted supporter of great music and important lectures than the beloved Christen Jensen." His obituary in the <i>Deseret News</i> said, "The natural kindness of Christen Jensen, his love for young people, his ready sympathy and devotion to learning are characteristics for which this good man will long be remembered" ("Dr. Christen Jensen," <i>Deseret News,</i> 18August 1961, 18A). Does this description bring to mind the Savior's admonition to love one another and to serve each other?<br><br>Dr. Jensen gave me a love of learning for which I will be eternally grateful. To this day I hope I thanked him appropriately, and I acknowledge today by my words all of those men and women who opened my mind and soul to the joys of learning, including those with whom I have worked and do work.<br><br>I am sure that each one of you has had or will have a similar experience. I challenge you to review carefully your opportunities to interact with these men and women who are prepared to share with you their love of learning and their joy in teaching. A verbal thank you is always appreciated, as are sincerely written notes at the end of a class. These are recognitions of their service and support of you as a student.<br><br>Now, having shared some thoughts about those who educate and those who support those efforts, I would like to turn to you and your experiences on campus and you as a human resource. The BYU Honor Code says that students and personnel will seek to demonstrate the moral values encompassed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. That is a big challenge. In Primary the children sing a song "The Church of Jesus Christ." It goes:<br><br><i>I belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><br><i>I know who I am. I know God's plan. I'll follow him in faith.</i><br><i>I believe in the Savior, Jesus Christ. I'll honor his name.</i><br><i>I'll do what is right; I'll follow his light. His truth Iwill proclaim.</i><br>[<i>Songbook,</i> 77]<br><br>Knowing who you are is very important, but it brings obligations not only to help others and appreciate them but also to follow Christ's example in all ways possible. An understanding of that makes each person, as an individual, a better person and one worthy to receive the promised blessings from Heavenly Father.<br><br>The poet John Donne proclaimed: "No man is an island, entire of itself" (<i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> [1624], no. 17). He explained that there is a unity that makes people part of a whole. From my perspective that means being part of the family of our Heavenly Father. As children of our Heavenly Father, we understand the need to share with others and to serve others--to be part of a whole. President N. Eldon Tanner told Church members on a number of occasions that "service is the rent we pay for living on this earth" (quoting Lord Halifax). King Benjamin told those who read the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i> [Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>Next time you read King Benjamin's teachings, substitute "I" for "ye" and personalize hisinstructions.<br><br>Elder Sterling W. Sill explained our obligation to serve each other when he said: "That man loves God most who puts his own life in harmony with Him, and who serves his fellow men as though his life depends upon it, asindeed it does."<br><br>The author George Eliot made a brief statement that I have posted on the bin above my desk: "What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?" (George Eliot, <i>Middlemarch</i> [1871–1872], chapter 72). Hopefully, while you are at BYU, you will gain a greater appreciation of service and what Heavenly Father expects as you interact with His children wherever and whoever they maybe.<br><br>In the Equal Opportunity Office we work with the laws of the land, particularly Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and its amendments. These laws established certain protected categories of people who must be treated fairly and where discrimination should not occur. These categories include color, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, and disability--the things that sometimes make people appear different. It seems obvious that everyone deserves to be treated fairly, but in some places and situations, this isnot the case.<br><br>As children of our Heavenly Father, we should know that how we treat each other is very important in His eyes. All of His children deserve respect, kindness, and love.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared some thoughts on our behavior with others in the recent April conference. He counseled each one of us about how we should treat each other. First he warned against "cold, caustic, unbridled words," and then he went on to say:<br><br><i>Our words, like our deeds, should be filled with faith and hope and charity. . . . With such words, spoken under the influence of the Spirit, tears can be dried, hearts can be healed, lives can be elevated, hope can return, confidence can prevail.</i> ["The Tongue of Angels," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 17, 18]<br><br>In the Employee Relations/Equal Opportunity Office, we work occasionally with people who have said demeaning and hurtful words to friends or coworkers. We also work with others who in the heat of the moment have said words that have hurt, wounded, and chilled others. Once those words have been said, it is difficult to recall them. To help mend those relationships is a challenge.<br><br>I remember working with one young woman who was offended. She could not understand why she was receiving inappropriate, aggressive e-mails and telephone calls from male friends. She questioned why they would think she appreciated receiving these less-than-polite e-mails and calls. When I visited with the young men, they said they were just joking. Because of the way she had behaved earlier, they thought she would enjoy receiving these edgy messages--messages that sounded like they came from bad TV shows or B movies. Both sides realized that in their behavior toward one another they had crossed over the line of appropriateness and had not followed the counsel of latter-day prophets and the Savior regarding the treatment of others.<br><br>Also in April conference, President Hinckley gave counsel in the priesthood session. As he spoke of his concerns about today's trend toward inappropriate behavior and casual and edgy language, he said:<br><br><i>A filthy mind expresses itself in filthy and profane language. A clean mind expresses itself in language that is positive and uplifting and in deeds that bring happiness to the heart.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "I Am Clean," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 62]<br><br>Just because the idols in today's world use language and behaviors that are less than civil or appropriate, that is no reason members of the Church should be caught in the web of actions that offend and hurt others. On numerous occasions President Hinckley has counseled members regarding civility in the treatment of others. In his book <i>Standing for Something,</i> he noted that civility is one of those virtues that is often neglected and forgotten by people today as they interact with each other. Sometimes people today have an in-your-face attitude that is destructive and harmful to others. (See <i>Standing for Something</i> [New York: Times Books, 2000], 47–58.)<br><br>Once again I turn to my experiences in Primary. Let me repeat the words of a song thechildren love:<br><br><i>If on occasion you have found</i><br><i>Your language is in question,</i><br><i>Or ugly thoughts come to your mind,</i><br><i>Then here's a good suggestion.</i><br><br><i>Just hum your favorite hymn,</i><br><i>Sing out with vigor and vim,</i><br><i>And you will find it clears your mind.</i><br><i>Hum your favorite hymn.</i><br><br><i>Before you say an angry word,</i><br><i>Remember you'll regret it,</i><br><i>For once it's said the harm is done,</i><br><i>And some folks won't forget it.</i><br><br><i>Just hum your favorite hymn,</i><br><i>Sing out with vigor and vim,</i><br><i>And you will find it clears your mind.</i><br><i>Hum your favorite hymn.</i><br>["Hum Your Favorite Hymn," <i>Songbook,</i> 152]<br><br>As you continue your life's journey, I would encourage you to choose good mentors and strong examples to help you develop those Christlike characteristics that the scriptures and latter-day prophets have been so persistent in telling each of us to be mindful always of how we treat others and how we represent the Savior.<br><br>I will share one final story on the treatment of others who appear to be different. Recently, over the Internet, I received a picture story called "The Hippopotamus and the Tortoise." This true story happened in Kenya, where storms and tsunami waves had hit the coastal region. A baby hippo had survived the waves and storms but had lost his mother. After the storm the baby hippo, nicknamed Owen, bonded with a century-old tortoise at an animal rescue facility. This tortoise was a giant land turtle, and Owen weighed about 650 pounds. The turtle replaced Owen's mother. They swam together, ate together, and slept together. They have bonded and now accept each other totally. Their differences are forgotten. The e-mail story ended this way: "This is a real story that shows that our differences don't matter much when we need the comfort of another." (See Isabella Hatkoff, Craig Hatkoff, and Paula Kahumbu, <i>Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship</i> [New York: Scholastic Press, 2006].)<br><br>This brings us back to the scripture from Jacob. I will paraphrase what it says: We come to learn the good word of God in a good environment and to be comforted by those around us (see Jacob 2:8). Just like Owen, we want and need a friend, a mentor, an example--someone to help us and to love us. Hopefully we won't have to suffer a tsunami to learn how much we depend upon each other, how we should treat each other, and how we use and benefit from BYU's human resources.<br><br>As I close my remarks today, it is my prayer that each one of us will remember that individually and collectively we are children of our Heavenly Father. We are His human resources. He loves us. He expects us to accept the responsibilities that come with being brothers and sisters in the gospel. BYU is a special place. It is a place where men and women can join together in an atmosphere permeated by the gospel, but it is also a place where strong secular knowledge can be gained.<br><br>I appreciate this opportunity to talk about BYU's human resources--about you and me and our friends, roommates, and coworkers. We are truly blessed. In following the teachings of our Savior and staying true to gospel standards, we can stand as witnesses of our Heavenly Father and we can give comfort to those around us while we are learning the pleasing word of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Delora Bertelsen was managing director of Employee Relations, Equal Opportunity, and Benefit Services at BYU when this devotional address was given on 26 June 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Children of Light” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
While preparing for this devotional address, I felt prompted to speak about becoming as little children, like the Sunbeam children I have taught in Primary for so many years. I have a very dear place in my heart for these young children who are beginning to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. I could share with you many amusing stories about them that show how their understanding is just emerging.<br><br>Trevor, for example, once sang, "I am a child of God, and he has sent me beer!" And Kevin, in every prayer he offered, prayed that Spiderman would demolish the Green Goblin--only to be interrupted each time by Anna, who would respond with a big sigh and say, "Oh, no! Not again!"<br><br>However, there are serious messages we can learn from children today--lessons that can teach us how to "walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8).<br><br>My love for teaching young children prompted me to search for information about Sunbeams and the beloved children's hymn "Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam" (<i>Songbook,</i> 60–61). I learned that the song was written by Nellie Talbot in 1899:<br><br><i>Racking her brain for material for her Sunday School class in rural Missouri, she thought to herself, "How can you say there's nothing to teach about when you have the sun and the sky and the trees and the flowers!"</i> [www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/i/l/l/illbeasb.htm]<br><br>Edwin Othello Excell, composer of "Count Your Blessings" (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 241) and the predominant arranger of "Amazing Grace," wrote the music to the Sunbeam song, which was originally entitled "I'll Be a Sunbeam."<br><br>As I continued my search for the history of the Sunbeam song, I discovered that it had a connection to the first Sunbeam Band, an organization for the Christian training of young children (see <i>Encyclopedia of Southern Baptists</i> [Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman Press, 1958], s.v. "Sunbeam Band," 2:1314). The Sunbeam Band was formed in 1886, when Anna Louise Elsom, a young mother who taught children ages four to 13 at Fairmont Baptist Church in Nelson County, Virginia, "prayed that God would send someone to help her teach the boys and girls about missions" (www.vaiden.net/baptist.html). Soon George Braxton Taylor, a young pastor "with a 'heart all aglow with a fire for missions,' came right from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville to become the new pastor for the Fairmont Baptist Church" (ibid.). It was this young pastor who organized the first Sunbeam Band.<br><br>His name, George Braxton Taylor, jumped out at me. I thought to myself, "That name sounds familiar. I wonder if we are related." So I went to the Taylor family tree that my father had compiled and found several George Taylors listed--which obviously meant it is a common name in my family. Upon viewing this chart more closely, I found that indeed there was a George Braxton Taylor who was born and lived in Virginia at about the same time as the pastor I had been reading about.<br><br>After going back and forth over a lot of historical and genealogical information, I found that the George Braxton Taylor who organized the first Sunbeam group was the same George on my family tree. It's funny that I found him online when, meanwhile, gathering dust on my bookshelf was a 1908 copy of a book he wrote about his father, who was also a Baptist minister. Looking around my home for more material connected to George Braxton Taylor, I realized that I had two books written in the early 1800s by his grandfather--James Barnett Taylor, a prominent leader in the Baptist church--and I also had James' personal spectacles and handcrafted desk.<br><br>Feeling a familial and even tangible connection to George Braxton Taylor, I became more interested in his service as pastor of Fairmont Baptist Church. It was there that Anna Louise Elsom called her class Sunbeams, "because the sunshine illuminated and warmed the corner of the church where she taught the children" (ibid.). The Sunbeam Band was organized in a way that allowed the children to learn selflessness and the value of hard work:<br><br><i>Membership in the</i> [Sunbeam] <i>band required an initiation fee of one penny, followed by a contribution of one penny a month, all of which went to support missions. Historical documents note that Taylor insisted that the children earn the money they contributed. Most of the children earned their money by selling eggs and even dedicated the chickens to the cause by naming them after missionaries.</i> [Ibid.]<br><br>The Sunbeam Band grew in three years to include more than 10,000 members (see <i>Encyclopedia of Southern Baptists,</i> 2:1314). In 1887 George Braxton Taylor explained the philosophy underlying the program: "The Sunbeam movement was not altogether to do things for children but that children might do things for others and for Jesus," he said. George Taylor also wrote, "Not only can children receive, they can give. They can do their part in sending far and wide the story of Jesus." (<i>Religious Herald,</i> March 1887; www.vaiden.net/baptist.html.)<br><br>Children around the world are proclaiming the story of Jesus. They make this proclamation when they sing "Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam." This hymn teaches principles that are consistent with Pastor Taylor's rationale for creating the Sunbeam Band. I would suggest that while we may not have been in the Sunbeam Band or even in a Sunbeam class in Primary, our Father in Heaven wants us toadhere to the principles taught in the Sunbeam song.<br><br>Most of you probably know only the first verse and chorus of this song. However, there are four verses, and I'd like to give you the opportunity to sing all four verses today.<br><br><i>Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,</i><br><br><i>To shine for him each day;</i><br><br><i>In ev'ry way try to please him,</i><br><br><i>At home, at school, at play.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>A sunbeam, a sunbeam,</i><br><br><i>Jesus wants me for a sunbeam;</i><br><br><i>A sunbeam, a sunbeam,</i><br><br><i>I'll be a sunbeam for him.</i><br><br><i>Jesus wants me to be loving,</i><br><br><i>And kind to all I see;</i><br><br><i>Showing how pleasant and happy</i><br><br><i>His little one can be.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>I will ask Jesus to help me,</i><br><br><i>To keep my heart from sin;</i><br><br><i>Ever reflecting his goodness,</i><br><br><i>And always shine for him.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>I'll be a sunbeam for Jesus,</i><br><br><i>I can, if I but try;</i><br><br><i>Serving him moment by moment,</i><br><br><i>Then live with him on high.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br>["Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam," <i>The Children Sing</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1951), no. 101]<br><br>I would like to highlight four themes found in this hymn that, if followed, will help us "walk as children of light":<br><br>1. Please the Lord at home, at school, at play.<br><br>2. Be loving and kind.<br><br>3. Pray to keep our hearts from sin.<br><br>4. Serve the Lord moment by moment.<br><h2><b>First, to "walk as children of light," we are taught to please the Lord at home, at school, at play.</b></h2><br>After teaching the Sunbeam class for six years, I requested a change in assignment--not because I didn't love my service to these young children but because I wanted a chance to teach my son, Logan, and his class, and they would soon be moving to senior Primary. I was yearning also for greater spiritual and scriptural depth in my lesson preparation.<br><br>Having this request granted, I began to teach the Valiant 9 children. I loved these older children who had such a beautiful depth of understanding of the gospel, but I still longed for the special times I had had with the Sunbeams. One Sunday during Primary opening exercises, I looked at the six rows of children who sat ahead of me and thought, "All of these children before me were once my Sunbeams! They are all just grown-up Sunbeams!" They still had the Light of Christ in their eyes, which were filled with innocence and love.<br><br>I dreaded the thought that any of these beautiful children of our Heavenly Father would make poor choices that would fill their lives with misery and sorrow, but I knew it could happen, because that is part of the plan of salvation. We all have the opportunity to make right and wrong choices, and we will inevitably make some wrong choices. I think Heavenly Father must feel intense sorrow when we, His children, act as if we no longer need Him to lead and guide us. Yet He loves usstill.<br><br>All of us are really just grown-up Sunbeams. So how do we stay as innocent and humble as little children? We must stay close to the Spirit of the Lord. After His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus taught the people:<br><br><i>Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</i><br><br><i>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</i> [John 12:35–36]<br><br>Daily reflection of how close we have remained or how far we have strayed from God's light will enable us to walk away from darkness and choose paths that are filled with His light.<br><br>We are also able to shine with the Light of Christ when we understand that we are children of God. When we worry that we're not enough--not smart enough, not rich enough, not pretty enough, not buffed enough--then we risk losing the Light of Christ in exchange for our own, self-generated light, a light that soon fades.<br><br>Let us shine the Light of Christ at home, at school, at play, at work, and in any other place where we may be found. When we do so, we will feel His love filling our lives with the warmth and peace that can come only from theSon.<br><h2><b>Second, to "walk as children of light," weshould be loving and kind.</b></h2><br>Latter-day revelation teaches us that "little children are alive in Christ" (Moroni 8:12; see also verses 19, 22) and innocent before God. I believe that this purity brings much joy to their lives. If you have spent time watching little children, you will notice how pleasant and happy they can be. It has been estimated that children laugh 200 times a day, while adults laugh only 15 times a day (see Marion Balla, "Communication: The Road to Connection in Families," <i>Transition Magazine</i> 28, no.2 (June 1998); http://www.vifamily.ca/library/transition/282/282.html).<br><br>How can we be more pleasant and happy? The Sunbeam song teaches us that one way is to "be loving, / And kind to all I see." We observe so much hatred, bitterness, selfishness, and greed in this world. We don't need to watch the evening news to know of these human problems; unfortunately, they are playing out before us in our homes and neighborhoods.<br><br>I can't imagine one of my grown-up Sunbeams spending time on the Internet viewing pornography; starving or bingeing and purging food in order to feel valued; harming a child physically; abusing a loved one emotionally; or engaging in any other behavior that belittles, demeans, or harms self or others.<br><br>However, some of our more frequent and less egregious behaviors should concern us more than they do, because these slowly lead us away from things that are pleasant and happy. The behaviors to which I refer are our daily interactions with others, particularly with those we love. Do you ever find yourself treating strangers with more kindness and respect than you treat your family or friends?<br><br>While it may appear to be easier to respect those we don't know well or to love those who are most like ourselves, we have been commanded to love everyone. This includes those who have life circumstances different from our own, whether those circumstances be culture, race, religion, socioeconomic status, ability level, or any of a vast number of human differences.<br><br>Those of us in attendance today are not likely to commit grievous sins against ourselves or others; however, we may fail to be loving and kind by participating in something as simple and common as name calling. It is unthinkable that in this new global millennium we still allow people to demean and humiliate others who "don't belong."<br><br>Let's try this experiment. Think of a term that represents a group with which you would not want to be identified. Now complete this sentence: "You can't do that. You're too (insert derogatory term)." You may have chosen a term that relates to religion, race, size, shape, or other attributes or categorical standing: "You're too lazy." "You're too fat." "You're too blond." "You're too white." "You're too [whatever]." How do we feel when we are included in a group that is designated as less valued?<br><br>What I hear too often on this campus and elsewhere is demeaning language toward a group of people who are least likely to defend themselves: those with disabilities. I think that without intending to disrespect those in this group, many people say, "You're so retarded!" or "You're a moron (or idiot or imbecile)!" All of these are former technical terms for levels of intellectual disability. My friend Reed Hahne explains how we can be more respectful of all of God's children regardless of their abilities or perceived social desirability:<br><br><i>I am a young man who goes to school at Utah Valley State College, where I have a 4.0 grade point</i> [average]. <i>I have to work extra hard in college to earn good grades. I told my mom that there are two things about college that I don't like: homework andtests.</i><br><br><i>I also am a young man with Down syndrome. That is one of my characteristics. It is a part of who I am, but it is not all of who I am. All of us are distinct individuals. Some of you are tall or short. Some of you have blue eyes and blond hair; others of you have black hair and brown eyes. Some of us have to study hard to get good grades, while others have to work really hard to be good swimmers and runners. Everyone is gifted in some way.</i><br><br><i>I just finished performing in the musical</i> Ragtime. <i>I love school and I love performing. I want the same things that all of you want in life. Iwant to be happy. I want to have opportunities to get a good education and a good job. I want people to listen to me and respect me for my abilities and knowledge. I have many characteristics. I am fun to be around--I love people and making new friends. I'm good-looking. I'm a leader and a self-advocate. I love learning new things, trying new foods, and going to new places. Some other gifts that people with Down syndrome have are</i> [things such as] <i>we have lots of love to share, we are loyal and affectionate,</i> [and] <i>we help all of you to slow down and learn lessons about what is really important in life.</i><br><br><i>I know that I have Down syndrome because it is part of God's plan for me and for the earth at this time. I have been told by the Lord that I was sent here at this time to perform special work that only I could do. I have been told that I will have influence upon people that no one else could possibly have and that the Lord has a great work for me to do. I know part of my mission on earth is to be a teacher for other people with disabilities.</i><br><br><i>It is really hard for me when people look at me and see only the Down syndrome. Sometimes people talk to my parents, asking them questions about me when they should talk to me. I have opinions. Sometimes people call each other "retards." This is so very disrespectful in so many ways. If a person has a disability, it doesn't mean that they can't learn; it just means that they may learn a different way and that some things might take them longer to learn. I think people get in the habit of calling names and then use disrespectful words without realizing their meanings.</i><br><br><i>Nauvoo was my second mission. My first mission was at the institute of religion in Orem. Then I went to Nauvoo. While I was there I was called to be an ordinance worker in the Nauvoo Temple. Ilearned all of the temple ordinances. This really surprised many visitors to Nauvoo. I also performed, and I learned all of the scripts for the historic sites. It surprised people that I could do all ofthis. When we are given a chance, people with disabilities can do so many things.</i><br><br><i>It is important to look at each other and see our strengths and know that each of us is a child of God. He loves us,</i> [and] <i>He has given us potential and opportunities to grow on this earth.</i><br><br><i>I have a testimony of Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, and President Hinckley. I read the scriptures every day. Thank you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</i><br><br>To be loving and kind to all we see, let's begin with showing respect to all of God's children through positive thoughts and language. Then naturally we will be more inclined to treat others in Christlike ways.<br><h2><b>Third, to "walk as children of light," we can pray to keep our hearts from sin.</b></h2><br>I recently heard a young man tell his story of how he prayed to keep his heart from sin. At age 12 he began experimenting with drugs and alcohol, which led to many years of addiction and misery. Trying to find acceptance and love, he joined a gang, but still the search for his purpose in life was futile. Despondent and alone, he tried to take his life, but he was not successful--either time.<br><br>According to his native culture, this young man, being the eldest male child in the family, was the rightful heir of his father's vast wealth, possessions, and eventually his tremendously successful business. However, his parents were displeased with the way he was leading his life, so they sent him to a residential school inaforeign place--Utah--with hopes ofreforming him.<br><br>His parents did not realize what reformation would take place in their son. After a short time attending school with many Latter-day Saint students, he noticed how happy they seemed and wondered what made them emanate a special light. While on a hike with school friends, he talked to a girl who was LDS and heard her say that she would give up everything for the gospel. "What is it," he thought, "that makes this gospel so powerful that she would be willing to make such asacrifice?"<br><br>Shortly thereafter he saw an LDS infomercial and decided to call the toll-free number, not realizing that missionaries would be sent to his dorm. After prayerful study, he decided to follow Jesus Christ. He gave up his status in the family, the respect of his parents, the promise of a grand inheritance, and a life of depression and substance abuse.<br><br>Because the light of the gospel shone through his friends, he was drawn to that light. Letting it become more powerful in his life, he gained help from the Lord to turn his heart from sin so that he could be "ever reflecting his goodness, / And always shine for him."<br><h2><b>Fourth, to "walk as children of light," we will serve the Lord moment by moment.</b></h2><br>There are many ways we can serve the Lord daily. However, one of the most powerful ways we can serve Him is to share the gospel with others. I am so very grateful for the missionaries who taught my parents the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>A few years after my parents had married and moved to Las Vegas, they had some concerns about moving into a house on Lacy Lane, partly because there were so many Mormons living on that street. Two months after that move, four-year-old Joni Christensen, a Mormon, invited my older sister, Tami, to attend a Primary Halloween party, and since Tami and Joni were such good friends, my sister also began attending midweek Primary activities.<br><br>Shortly following the party and after my father was asked the golden question by a coworker, two stake missionaries, Faye Boyd and Muriel Hammond, showed up at my parents' home. My father told the missionaries he wasn't a good prospect for their church, but he did want to know what they were teaching his daughter in Primary. The missionaries were probably thrilled to hear that!<br><br>My mother relates her feelings about the message these missionaries brought:<br><br><i>The second time they came to the home, it was the most unbelievable experience. As they were giving</i> [us] <i>the discussion, it was just like a light-bulb experience. I just knew in the depths of my soul that what I had been looking for all of my life I had finally found at the age of 21--that this was the gospel that I had searched so hard to find.</i><br><br>At this time she was pregnant with me. Sherecalls:<br><br><i>I just barely was pregnant with Tina. I wasn't quite sure, but pretty sure. And so I tried to get out of the baptism by telling the missionaries that I would catch cold because it was December. It was down at the old First Ward chapel, and I didn't want to catch cold. ... And then they said that no one has ever caught cold from being baptized.</i><br><br><i>Within five weeks</i> [we] <i>had entered the waters of baptism, and my life would never be the same again. It's by far the most important thing I ever did, and "sweet is the peace the gospel brings." I searched so long and so hard, and when I found the gospel it was so sweet.</i><br><br>Sister Boyd and Sister Hammond served the Lord "moment by moment," and by so doing they changed my parents' lives in such wonderful ways. In turn, my life has been blessed, and I hope that "moment by moment" I can bless the lives of others.<br><br>While imprisoned in Rome, Paul wrote an epistle to the Ephesians, admonishing them to become followers of God. He wrote, "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8). We can follow Paul's admonition to walk as children of light by pleasing the Lord "at home, at school, at play"; by being loving and kind; by praying "to keep [our] heart[s] from sin"; and by serving the Lord "moment by moment." It is my prayer that we will reflect the glory of the Son by being like the Sunbeams all around the world. In thename of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Tina Taylor Dyches was an associate professor of counseling psychology and special education at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 10 July 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>g, Competing, and Individual Worth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In his much-quoted talk on dating versus hanging out, Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>A message given by a General Authority at a general conference ... is given to be heard under theinfluence of the Spirit of the Lord, with the intended result that the listener learns from the talk and from the Spirit what he or she should</i> do <i>about it.</i> ["TheDedication of a Lifetime," CES fireside for young adults, Oakland, California, 1 May 2005; emphasis in original]<br><br>No one is more aware than your speaker today that you are not, in this gathering, listening to a General Authority at a general conference. However, I hope the same principle will apply: that something you hear in the words of the prophets and the scriptures we will consider this morning will impress upon your mind and heart something you personally "should <i>do</i> about it."<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has repeatedly emphasized a harsh reality of which you are all aware. He has said, "The world into which you will move will be terribly competitive" ("Words of the Prophet: A Chosen Generation," <i>New Era,</i> January 1999, 6). He has also said, "You are moving into the most competitive age the world has ever known. All around youis competition" ("A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer for Youth," <i>Ensign,</i> January 2001, 4). In general conference in April 2007, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said that our culture has an "obsession with comparing [and] competing" ("The Tongue of Angels," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 17).<br><br>This morning I would like to review with you certain principles taught in the scriptures and by living prophets that relate to comparing and competing, first in our academic and professional lives, then more generally in our personal lives.<br><h2><b>Preparation</b></h2><br>One way to deal with academic and professional competition was recommended to me by my graduate advisor. He said, "The most important thing you need to do in graduate school is to impress the right people." I thought that the gospel teaches us that we aren't supposed to do things to "be seen of men" (Matthew 6:5), to call attention to ourselves, and to "aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 121:35). And yet my advisor seemed to be saying that if I was going to succeed as a graduate student, that's exactly what I needed to do.<br><br>Of course there is truth in my advisor's observation. Obviously, if you don't impress the coach, you don't make the team; if you don't impress an employer, you don't get the job. Many seek to impress others and aspire to the honors of men by deliberately calling attention to themselves. Jesus chastised those in His time who did "all their works ... to be seen of men" (Matthew 23:5).<br><br>In April 2007 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer said:<br><br><i>To seek after the praise of men, the scriptures caution us, is to be led carefully away from the only safe path to follow in life. ... And the scriptures warn us plainly what follows when we "aspire to the honors of men."</i> ["The Spirit of theTabernacle," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 28]<br><br>John recorded that, in the Savior's day,<br><br><i>among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</i><br><br><i>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</i> [John 12:42–43]<br><br>Those who love the praise of men more than the praise of God seek to please men more than God, fear to offend man more than they fear to offend God, and are more concerned with what others think of them than with what God thinks. Men's commendation and contempt can lead us from the path of safety. In contrast, Jesus, speaking of His Father, said, "Ido always those things that please him" (John 8:29). This is, as President Packer said, "the only safe path to follow in life."<br><br>Is it possible to "impress the right people," as my advisor suggested, without aspiring to the honors of men or seeking to draw attention to oneself? Fortunately, not long after my experience with my advisor, I had the opportunity to pose that question to Elder Russell M. Nelson in a young single adult fireside. Elder Nelson thought for a moment, and then said, "If you are well prepared in everything you do in school and professionally, and do the highest quality work of which you are capable, your work will speak for itself, and the 'right people' will be impressed."<br><br>In his April 2007 conference talk, President Packer spoke in reference to music in the Church, but his words are applicable almost universally. He said, "Excellence does not call attention to itself" ("The Spirit of the Tabernacle," 26). It does not need to. As Elder Nelson taught me in that fireside long ago, and as President Packer taught in general conference, excellence will be obvious to those who need to be impressed. I know from experience that is true.<br><br>One such experience occurred three months ago when I was with a graduate student at a professional meeting. He had worked many hours on wording, rewording, and crafting his talk in order to present as clearly as possible his data and conclusions. He had organized, reordered, and revised his slides to present plainly the most important information in a logical, easy-to-follow sequence. This preparation continued in his hotel room well into the night before his talk. At the end of his presentation, which was the last in that session, many scientists in the audience came to the front to greet him as he stepped down from the podium to commend and congratulate him and even offer to remain in contact regarding his future research. One woman, an official from the National Institutes of Health who administers research grants, pulled me aside from the group and said, "This was tremendous! This is the way science should be done." The student in his preparation neither sought nor anticipated such praise. His goal was simply to make the best presentation possible and represent himself and BYU as capably as hecould.<br><br>To do the highest quality work of which you are capable, sufficient to "impress the right people," requires compliance with President Hinckley's counsel to get "all the education you can" ("Prophet's Counsel," 4).<br><br>From the perspective of a nutrition professor, a college education is like a large buffet: you pay and then serve yourself as much as you want from a wide variety of foods. If after the meal you leave hungry, feeling you haven't gotten your money's worth, it's your own fault. How many of you are getting your money's worth and all the education you can at the educational and spiritual buffet that is BYU? President Hinckley also said, in speaking to priesthood leaders in a worldwide leadership training meeting:<br><br><i>I have been quoted as saying, "Do the best you can." But I want to emphasize that it be the very best. We are too prone to be satisfied with mediocre performance. We are capable of doing so much better.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "Standing Strong and Immovable," <i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: The Priesthood and the Auxiliaries of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary,</i> 10 January 2004 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, 2004), 21]<br><br>Is a young man or woman really getting all the education they can if they are "satisfied with mediocre performance"? President James E. Faust gave this reassuring counsel:<br><br><i>If you prepare to walk down the path of life, you canbe rewarded beyond your dreams and expectations. But to achieve this, you must work very hard, save, be wise, and be alert. You must learn to deny yourselves of worldly gratification. ... Steadiness and toil will serve you better than brilliance.</i> ["The Message: Don't Be Afraid," <i>New Era,</i> July 1998, 7]<br><br>Thus, three keys in dealing with academic and professional competition are being well prepared, working very hard, and doing the very best you can, refusing "to be satisfied with mediocre performance." To do so, President Hinckley urged, "Sacrifice a car; sacrifice anything that is needed to be sacrificed to qualify yourselves to do the work of the world" ("Prophet's Counsel," 4).<br><h2><b>Integrity</b></h2><br>I will mention just one other principle related to academic and professional competition. It is a sad sign of the times that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has had to organize an Office of Research Integrity, whose sole purpose is to try to maintain honesty and credibility in biomedical research by combating the plagiarism and outright fabrication of data by the occasional scientist who buckles under the competitive pressure to publish or perish. In this environment, being a man or woman of integrity will not put you at a competitive disadvantage among those who may be compromising standards of honesty; rather, it will work to your benefit. Here's how.<br><br>While I was at another professional meeting with a graduate student some years ago, we ran into the chair of the session in which the student had presented earlier. After a few pleasantries, this respected scientist said, "You know what I like about your presentations? If it's from BYU, we know it's right and we can trust it."<br><br>President John Taylor prophesied:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i> [<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br>It occurred to me that perhaps the fulfillment of President Taylor's prophecy might have as much to do with integrity and credibility as with publications and professional acclaim. As issues of integrity become more and more problematic in a cutthroat competitive society, those looking for answers will look more and more to institutions and individuals who get it right and can be trusted. Integrity is not a hindrance to your academic and professional success. It is essential to it.<br><h2><b>Comparison</b></h2><br>With respect to comparing and competing in our personal lives, Elder Holland counseled parents:<br><br><i>Try not to compare your children, even if you think you are skillful at it. You may say most positively that "Susan is pretty and Sandra is bright," but all Susan will remember is that she isn't bright and Sandra that she isn't pretty. Praise each child individually for what that child is, and help him or her escape our culture's obsession with comparing, competing, and never feeling we are "enough."</i> ["Tongue of Angels," 17]<br><br>It is difficult to refrain from comparing yourself to others when you know that professors, employers, and others are doing just that. However, a spirit of comparing and competing may be evidence of the sin of pride. President Ezra Taft Benson, in his classic talk on pride, said:<br><br><i>Another major portion of this very prevalent sinof pride is enmity toward our fellowmen. We aretempted daily to elevate ourselves above others and diminish them.</i> ["Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989, 4]<br><br>Those who view their contemporaries as competitors to be beaten rather than as brothers and sisters to be served often believe that others' successes diminish their own. They are therefore more apt to find and point out faults of those around them. Such critics run the risk of losing friends, who may wonder what the critic says to others about them. In contrast, we are commanded not only to "cease to find fault one with another" (D&amp;amp;C 88:124) but also to "strengthen your brethren in all your conversation" (D&amp;amp;C 108:7).<br><br>President Benson also said:<br><br><i>The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others. In the words of C. S. Lewis: "Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. ... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition has gone, pride has gone."</i> <i>(</i>Mere Christianity, <i>New York: Macmillan, 1952, pp. 109–10.)</i> ["Beware of Pride," 4]<br><br>A person who compares and considers herself superior in some way may feel an unjustified sense of accomplishment and expertise. However, the highest score on an exam does not necessarily indicate mastery of the material. If she is satisfied with simply being better than someone else, she may, in the words of President Hinckley, be "too prone to be satisfied with mediocre performance [when she is] capable of doing so much better" ("Standing Strong," 21).<br><br>Such complacence, born of comparison, may creep into spiritual matters as well. It is tempting in a rapidly decaying world to consider ourselves righteous in comparison to what's going on around us. However, there is a danger in assessing our spirituality using such a relative measure. The Lord's standard is high, absolute, and unchanging. The world is rapidly becoming a more wicked place. If we are content to simply be better than the world, comparing ourselves to its standards and practices instead of to the Lord's, we may pride ourselves on the widening gap between us and the world while at the same time being dangerously oblivious to the increasing distance between us and the standards of righteousness we have covenanted to keep.<br><br>Comparison of our weaknesses with others' talents or of our talents with those who are truly gifted can be discouraging and may decrease our sense of self-worth. Such comparison may lead to the sins of envy and ingratitude as we focus on and fret about what we don't have rather than on what we have been given. Compulsive comparison can rob us of the enjoyment we might still experience in the expression of the talents we have been given and in the talents of others. The ability to rejoice in the successes and talents of others increases our capacity for happiness and joy as we experience those feelings each time someone we know succeeds.<br><br>Preoccupation with what others are doing, how they're performing, and how they're being rewarded or treated starts early in life, with children often asking, "How come she gets to ...?" or "Why doesn't he have to ...?" Most outgrow the terminology, but for many the preoccupation persists. Focusing on others' talents and tasks, worrying about what rewards they may be receiving, and feeling we're in competition for that recognition may easily distract us from our own responsibilities, inhibit the development of our talents, and divert us from our personal missions and ministries.<br><br>In the last chapter of the Gospel of John, we read of Jesus' charge to Peter as the two walked along the seashore:<br><br><i>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following. ...</i><br><br><i>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till Icome, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</i> [John 21:20–22]<br><br>The message to Peter and to us is clear: "Don't concern yourself with others' assignments or performance. You worry about what I've asked <i>you</i> to do."<br><h2><b>Individual Worth</b></h2><br>While serving as a stake missionary, I had the assignment of going each Sunday to the Utah County Jail to teach a Sunday School lesson while we were seated on folding chairs in the hallway under the watchful eyes of surveillance cameras. The favorite Bible story of those who came to class was the parable of the talents:<br><br><i>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</i><br><br><i>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</i><br><br><i>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</i><br><br><i>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</i><br><br><i>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</i><br><br><i>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</i><br><br><i>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</i><br><br><i>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</i><br><br><i>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</i><br><br><i>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</i> [Matthew 25:14–23]<br><br>You know what happened to the last servant. The things the inmates liked the most about this story were that the first two servants got the same reward and the Lord didn't compare them one with another. Among other lessons, this parable reinforces the principle that where "much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3) and suggests that where less is given, less may be required.<br><br>To each of us the Lord might say as He did to Moses, "I have a work for thee ..., my son [or my daughter]" (Moses 1:6). Just as the Lord in the parable gave talents and set expectations for each servant individually, so also does He provide for each of us a unique blend of talents and circumstances, including formal Church callings and other opportunities individually customized to accomplish His purposes in our lives and in the lives of those we can bless.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell assured us, "No one else is placed exactly as we are in our opportune human orbits" ("Consecrate Thy Performance," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2002, 37–38).<br><br>When the Jews faced extermination in Persia, the new Persian queen, Esther, who was of Jewish descent, was reminded by her cousin Mordecai: "Who knoweth whether thou artcome to the kingdom for such a time as this?" (Esther 4:14). So might each of you be asked, "Who knoweth whether thou art come to [your particular place and circumstances with your unique blend of talents] for such a time as this?"<br><br>The work the Lord has for us to do may not involve serving in high-profile positions in the Church--which are, sadly, a source of comparison and competition to some. More important is our faithful service in whatever position we are called. Speaking of our Church callings, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>We are all in this great endeavor together. ... Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere. No calling in this church is small or of little consequence. All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "This Is the Work of the Master," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1995, 71]<br><br>In the first general conference to which I paid serious attention, Elder Robert L. Simpson said something that has stuck with me ever since:<br><br><i>There are those who associate high calling in the Church with guaranteed rights to the blessings of heaven, but I wish to declare without reservation that the ultimate judgment for every man will be on the simplest terms, and most certainly on what each has done to bless other people in a quiet, unassuming way.</i> ["Go, and Do Thou Likewise," <i>Ensign,</i> July 1973, 23]<br><br>"Bless[ing] other people in a quiet, unassuming way" is required of all of us who have covenanted "to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8–9).<br><br>This "bless[ing] other people in a quiet, unassuming way" is part of what the <i>Young Women Personal Progress</i> manual calls "my own divine mission" (<i>Young Women Personal Progress: Standing as a Witness of God</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2001], 26) in describing the value of individual worth. Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, former Relief Society general president, in her BYU devotional talk in February 2007, echoed the theme of "my own divine mission" when she said:<br><br><i>Each of us has a personal ministry. ...</i><br><br><i>... It embraces the people who come and go across the path of our life. It extends beyond our temporary callings as presidents, counselors, secretaries, teachers, and so on. ...</i><br><br><i>Our personal ministry is sacred and precious. It allows us to become an extension of the Lord's love.</i> ["Personal Ministry: Sacred and Precious," BYU devotional, 13 February 2007, 2, 7]<br><br>Our personal ministry may not bring to us the recognition and the praise of men. However, it will require the exercise of all the talents and spiritual gifts the Lord has given us as well as those He has given us the capacity to develop. Many of the more notable spiritual gifts are listed in 1 Corinthians 12, Moroni 10, and Doctrine and Covenants 46. However, those are not the only gifts. Bruce R. McConkie wrote, "Spiritual gifts are endless in number and infinite in variety" (<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985], 371). Many more gifts are mentioned in talks on this subject given by Elder Marvin J. Ashton and Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve. Here are some other spiritual gifts:<br><br>asking<br>listening<br>hearing and using a still, small voice<br>being able to weep<br>avoiding contention<br>being agreeable<br>avoiding vain repetition<br>seeking that which is righteous<br>not passing judgment<br>looking to God for guidance<br>being a disciple<br>caring for others<br>being able to ponder<br>offering prayer<br>bearing a mighty testimony<br>receiving the Holy Ghost<br>being able to calm<br>being able to be calm<br>being able to care<br>being able to study<br>having charity<br><br>While showing and discussing these gifts in an institute class, one young woman asked, "What's the gift to weep?"<br><br>Another class member hesitatingly raised her hand and then said quietly, "I can tell you about that." She then made reference, without specific details, to an extremely trying time in her life. During that time a friend came by to offer what help she could. The class member said that after describing her difficulties to her friend, all the friend could do was put her arm around her shoulder and weep. Our class member was blessed by her friend's exercise of the gift to weep, showing that she shared her sorrow, which made the burden a little lighter.<br><br>There are many possible ways to answer Elder Oaks' question about what each of us should <i>do</i> about today's message. We can "pray ... with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with [charity]" (Moroni 7:48), which "envieth not; ... vaunteth not itself, [and] seeketh not her own" (1 Corinthians 13:4–5). We can try making it through a day without a single self-reference that draws attention to ourselves. As Sister Parkin suggested, we can pray, "Help me to be the answer to someone's prayer today" ("Personal Ministry," 6). Or, as Elder Henry B. Eyring urged in April general conference, we can pray, "Please let me serve, this day" ("This Day," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 90). We can resolve to sincerely compliment someone each day, to thank someone each day, or try to go a day without finding fault.<br><br>In closing, let me suggest a scripture that helps me and that I hope will help you to remember this morning's message. President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>The constant and most recurring question in our minds, touching every thought and deed of our lives, should be, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6.)</i> ["Jesus Christ--Gifts and Expectations," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1988, 2]<br><br>In many cases our interpretation of scriptural passages depends on which word or words we emphasize. If this question is read and remembered as asking "What wilt <i>thou</i> have me to do?" it will help us to focus on God's will, His honor, His praise, and His blessings and distinguish them from those of men. If we ask "What wilt thou have <i>me</i> to do?" it will remind us of our uniqueness, our individual and infinite worth, and our "own divine mission" our Heavenly Father expects us to accomplish, regardless of what others accomplish. If we ask "What wilt thou have me to <i>do?</i>" it will remind us to translate our good intentions and what we know into righteous action.<br><br>I do not have the ability to impress upon your minds and hearts as powerfully and indelibly as I desire the glorious reality that each of you individually is of infinite worth to God, your Heavenly Father. Your value to Him is independent of your body mass index; your accomplishments in arts, academics, or athletics; your possessions, popularity, or marital status; your current calling in the Church; or any other thing that can be a source of comparison and competition. His love for you is <i>infinite--</i>quantitatively and qualitatively--and <i>intimate--</i>intensely personal and specific. He knows your name, your successes and setbacks, your triumphs and defeats, your fears, your doubts, your hopes, your desires, your motivations, your thoughts, your words, and your actions. He feels what you feel, He shares your joys and sorrows, and He desires your happiness now and forever.<br><br>May you seek the praise of God and do always those things that please Him. May you cease unhealthy comparison to others and delight in your individuality and uniqueness. May you be faithful in your Church assignments and in your individual, personalized ministries--your own divine missions--using your unique blend of talents and spiritual gifts to "bless other people in a quiet, unassuming way." I testify that God our Heavenly Father lives. I bear testimony that Jesus Christ is His Son and the head of this Church. I testify that the mind and the will of the Lord are made known to us in the words of living prophets and apostles, including the counsel we have considered this morning. Of these things Itestify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>ected Gift - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Echo Hawk: that is the English translation of the name given to my great-grandfather, a Pawnee Indian who did not speak English. He was born in the mid-1800s in what is now called Nebraska. Among the Pawnee, the hawk is a symbol of a warrior. My great-grandfather was known for his bravery, but he was also known as a quiet man who did not speak of his own deeds. As members of his tribe spoke of his good deeds, it was like an "echo" from one side of the village to the other. Thus he was named Echo Hawk.<br><br>According to accounts of the first white men who encountered the Pawnee people, the Pawnee were estimated to number about 20,000. Under the laws of the United States they had the right to occupy 23 million acres of land on the plains of Nebraska. When my great-grandfather was 19 years of age, the Pawnee people were forced to give up their homeland along the Platte River to make way for white settlers. In the winter of 1874 the Pawnee people were marched several hundred miles to a small reservation located near the Cimarron River in the Oklahoma Indian Territory.<br><br>Like so many other tribes before them, the Pawnee had their own Trail of Tears. Tears on that trail from the Platte to the Cimarron were shed for loss of a homeland, loss of the great buffalo herds slaughtered for their tongues and hides, and loss of a way of life. After arriving at that small Oklahoma reservation, the Pawnee people did not number 20,000. They did not number 5,000. Not even 1,000. Less than 700 Pawnee people survived.<br><br>That is a painful history. But the pain was not limited to one generation. In his childhood my father was taken from his parents by the federal government and sent to a boarding school far distant from his home. There he was physically beaten if he spoke the Pawnee language or in any way practiced his native culture or religion. In my generation my oldest sister was sent home from a public school because her skin was the wrong color. I remember sitting in a public school classroom and hearing the teacher describe Indians as "savage, bloodthirsty, heathen renegades." And, as I look back through past years, perhaps the most painful thought is the realization that in my childhood my family had no expectation of achieving a higher education and becoming doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Acollege education seemed beyond our reach.<br><br>But out of that pain was born promise. Of the six children born to my parents, all six of us went to college. Four of us graduated from Brigham Young University. Three of us became lawyers. We have received the best this country has to offer--the full promise of America.<br><br>The most vivid realization of that promise for me came in 1990. That year I ran for the office of attorney general of Idaho. I knew I faced a daunting task because there had not been a member of my political party elected as attorney general in 20 years. There had not been a person from my county elected to any statewide office in 38 years. And, in all the history of the United States, there had never been an American Indian elected to any statewide, state constitutional office (such as governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, or attorney general).<br><br>Furthermore, right after I filed my declaration of candidacy with the secretary of state, a political writer for the largest newspaper in the state wrote an article saying I had no chance to win the race for attorney general. He said: "Larry EchoHawk starts with three strikes against him: he is a Mormon, Indian, Democrat." In response to this challenge, I just went out and worked as hard as I could on thatcampaign.<br><br>On election night I was at a hotel where voting results were being reported. Late that night I received a call from my opponent conceding the election. I remember hanging up the phone and thinking about what I should say to a large group of news reporters who were waiting for me to comment on that historic election. After a few moments of reflection, I walked out to meet the news media and made a statement. Idid not have a written speech. I did not need one. I simply spoke from my heart, repeating words I had heard when I was 15 years old. They were spoken by a black civil rights leader on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial:<br><br><i>I ... have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." ...</i><br><br><i>I have a dream that my ... children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</i> [Martin Luther King, Jr., "I Have a Dream," speech at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C., 28 August 1963]<br><br>That night I felt the power of those words and the realization of that dream. I felt the full promise of America.<br><br>For me life began to change at the age of 14, when two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Lee Pearson and Boyd Camphuysen, came into my home and presented the missionary lessons. Up until that time I knew very little about Christian religion and had seldom attended any church. When the time came for the missionaries to challenge our family to be baptized, they first challenged my dad, then my mother, and then the children, starting from the oldest child and descending to the youngest. By the time they got to me, the second youngest in the family, everyone else had said yes. When they asked me, I remember looking at my dad. He had this stern look on his face, and I knew what myanswer should be.<br><br>I was baptized, but I did not have a testimony of the truthfulness of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I was, however, glad that my family had been baptized. Prior to joining the Church I had doubts about whether my family would stay together because my father had a drinking problem, and this had led to problems within our home. After we were baptized, my father quit drinking and family life was much better. However, I continued to live much the same as I had before I was baptized.<br><br>Fortunately my parents made me go to church every Sunday, and I had the benefit of listening to Sunday school teachers, priesthood leaders, and sacrament meeting speakers. Ipaid attention, but church attendance was not influencing my life.<br><br>Things began to change between my junior and senior years of high school when Richard Boren became my priests quorum advisor. I felt like he took a special interest in me. He was a successful lawyer, and I admired him very much. He told me repeatedly, "You can doanything you want. You can go to college, get a good education, and do wonderful things with your life." He pulled me aside and said, "If you really want to do well in sports, you have to work at it. You have to set goals and develop yourself."<br><br>At this point I was not a particularly good football player. Although I wasn't a bad athlete, I wasn't anything special. With Brother Boren's encouragement and guidance, I set my goal to become a good football player. We set up a program of weight lifting, running, and skills development.<br><br>I was small in size. To become a good football player I had to gain weight. Weight lifting would help, but I had to do more. I began mixing up a special weight-gaining formula to drink. It consisted of raw eggs, powdered milk, peanut butter, and other fattening things. I always put a little vanilla in it to make it taste better. It still tasted awful.<br><br>In one year I gained 20 pounds. When I showed up for football practice at the beginning of my senior year of high school, my football coaches could hardly believe their eyes. I thought I was going to be a defensive back, but when practices started, the coaches had me listed as a quarterback. This was disappointing because the captain of the football team was the starting quarterback. I feared that I would again be on the bench. But I was prepared to compete, and I gave it everything I had on the practice field. After a few days of practice, I came into the locker room and saw my name listed as the first-team quarterback. I had beaten out the captain of the football team!<br><br>A life-changing moment occurred during two-a-day practices before the first game of the season. Between practice sessions I was playing with my brother and two friends. Someone threw a ball. I turned around at the wrong time, and the ball hit me squarely in the eye. Itwas a serious and painful injury. I was taken to the emergency room at the hospital. My eye was swollen shut. I couldn't see a thing out of that injured eye. The doctor told me and my parents that it was too early to tell, but I might lose the sight in that eye. He bandaged both eyes and sent me home.<br><br>I had to lie in bed for a week. You can imagine how devastating this injury was to me because I had worked so hard and the first game of the season was just a week away. I kept saying to myself, "How could this happen? Why me? How unfair."<br><br>But this was a turning point in my life because, as I lay there in bed, for the first time I started to seriously think about the other things Brother Boren had talked about. He had talked about the gospel of Jesus Christ, the teachings of the Book of Mormon, and the power of prayer.<br><br>I remember slipping out of bed to my knees. It was the first time in my life that I had ever prayed intently. There I was, with bandages on my eyes, alone in my bedroom, praying for help. I remember saying, "Heavenly Father, please, if you are there, listen to my prayer and help me not lose the sight in my eye." I said, "I promise, if I can just keep the vision in my eye, I will read the Book of Mormon as Brother Boren has challenged me to do."<br><br>When the bandages came off, at first I could not see out of the injured eye. But gradually, day by day, my sight came back to near-perfect vision within a week.<br><br>My Farmington High School football team had played their first game, and the season was underway. Soon the doctor cleared me to practice with the team. I was able to travel with the team to the next game in Grand Junction, Colorado, but I didn't think I was going to play in the game.<br><br>That night our team fell behind by two touchdowns in the first half. Just before halftime my coach approached me and asked me if I wanted to play. I said yes. During halftime in the locker room the coach came to me and said my doctor and parents had cleared me to play. He said to be ready because I might get a chance to play in the second half of the game. Our team did not play well at the start of the second half. Finally the coach came to me and said, "The next time we get the ball, you are going in to play quarterback." I remember being on the sideline and kneeling on one knee, like football players sometimes do to rest and watch the game. I just dropped my head and said a prayer. I whispered that prayer "with real intent" (Moroni 10:4) because I was about to face my biggest challenge on an athletic field. This would be my chance.<br><br>The coach called me over, told me the first play to run, and sent me into the game. The play was a bootleg, pass-run option. I was supposed to fake a handoff to the halfback, hide the football on my hip, and roll out around the end. If the field was clear, I was supposed to run with the ball. If the field was not clear, I was supposed to try to throw the football to a receiver. I took the snap, faked the handoff, and rolled out around the end. I could tell after just a few strides that I wouldn't be able to run the ball for a gain. The other team had the play well-defended. A defensive end was rapidly pursuing me and was about to tackle me for a loss. At the last second I saw one of my teammates downfield. I planted my foot, and--this is where the weight lifting paid off--I threw the football as far as I could. As soon as I turned the ball loose, I was clobbered. I was on my back when I heard a loud roar in the stadium. I remember thinking, "I don't know whether they are cheering for my side or the other side." I jumped up and looked downfield. I saw my teammate with the ball 68yards down the field in the end zone. It was a touchdown! That was the greatest moment ofmy teenage life. To me, it was an answer to my prayer.<br><br>I played the rest of the game. I passed for another touchdown and ran for two more. Thatnight my team, the Farmington Scorpions, came from behind to beat the Grand Junction Tigers. The next day my name was in the headlines of our local newspaper.<br><br>I had another eventful football game that year in Albuquerque. We played the state championship team harder than they had been played in any other game that year. After the game ended, one of the football coaches from the University of New Mexico came into our dressing room. He introduced himself to me and said, "We like what we saw tonight." He shook my hand and told me that he would be watching me the rest of the year.<br><br>When I recovered my sight after the accident, I had immediately started reading the Book of Mormon. I had not been a good student through junior high and high school. I struggled because my mind was not focused on school. I loved sports but not academics. The Book of Mormon would be the first large book that I had ever read from cover to cover.<br><br>As Brother Boren had suggested, I planned to read 10 pages every night. I never missed a nightly reading. When I finished the entire book, I knelt down and prayed. At that moment I had my first very strong spiritual experience. Iknew then the Book of Mormon was true. Ihad received my most important answer to prayer. Up until that moment I had not realized that Heavenly Father had been watching over me and giving me answers to all my prayers forhealing and for a witness of truth.<br><br>It seemed to me that the Book of Mormon was about my Pawnee Indian ancestors. The Book of Mormon talks about the Lamanites, apeople who would be scattered, smitten, and nearly destroyed. But in the end they would be blessed if they followed the Savior. That is exactly what I saw in my own family's history. When I read the Book of Mormon, it gave me very positive feelings about who I am, knowledge that Heavenly Father had something for me to accomplish in life, and instruction in how I could be an instrument in His hands inserving the needs of other people.<br><br>After I had finished reading the Book of Mormon and football season had ended, I was sitting in a class one day when a student messenger passed me a note. It said I was to go see the football coach. I went down to his office. The door was closed. I knocked, and he said to come in. I opened the door and looked across the room. The head football coach of the University of New Mexico was sitting there. I remember that moment vividly because as soon as I saw him I knew I was going to college.<br><br>Brigham Young University also recruited me, but I wasn't sure if BYU would offer me a scholarship. I remember the meeting with Tommy Hudspeth, the head football coach. He asked me if I had any other scholarship offers. I said, "Yes, I have a full-ride scholarship to the University of New Mexico." I happened to have the scholarship offer from New Mexico in the notebook I was carrying. I handed him the letter, and he read it. He folded it up, handed it back, and said, "You have a full scholarship at BYU if you want it." My hard work, encouraged by Brother Boren, had paid off, opening a door to a college education. But, more important, a seemingly freak accident had opened a spiritual door through which celestial blessings have continued to pour on me and my family. Reading the Book of Mormon and receiving a testimony of it gave me an unexpected but welcome gift in my life.<br><br>Being a student-athlete at BYU for four years was a remarkable spiritual experience for me. I associated with many great men and women and learned important lessons in life under their tutelage. I became a product of the BYU experience. My testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ grew, and I solidified my vision of what I should do with my life.<br><br>There was a companion spiritual influence in my youth: Spencer W. Kimball. He was one of my greatest mentors. At church in New Mexico, people talked about the apostle who had a great love for Indian people. The name of Spencer W. Kimball was revered. Prior to coming to BYU I met him at an Indian youth conference in Kirtland, New Mexico, a largely LDS community about 10 miles outside of Farmington. I remember standing out on a softball field with several other Indian youths, waiting for this apostle to come. There was a lot of anticipation. A car pulled up. Men in dark suits got out and started walking across the field toward all these young Indians waiting for the apostle. As the men approached, I stood there thinking, "Which one is he?" Finally he stepped forward. He started talking to us in a raspy voice. My thought was, "Is this him?" The wonderful thing about him was that he befriended us all very quickly. This was a real feat because it is not easy to get close to Indian youths.<br><br>Later, when I was a student at BYU, I heard him speak several times. Like Brother Boren, he provided a blueprint for my life. When I was a BYU student he gave a speech entitled "This Is My Vision." In this talk he related a dream: "I woke up and I'd had this dream about you--about the Lamanites. I wrote it down. It may be a dream. It may be a vision. But this is what I saw you doing." In one part of the speech he said, "I saw you as lawyers. Isaw you looking after your people. I saw you as heads of cities and of states and in elective office" (for a more detailed description of the 1946 dream, see Dell Van Orden, "Emotional Farewell in Mexico," <i>Church News,</i> 19 February 1977, 3). To me it was like a patriarchal blessing and a challenge from a prophet of God: "Get an education. Be a lawyer. Use your education to help your people." That is what I wanted to do. I carried an excerpt from that talk in my scriptures. At a certain point in my life I read the passage where he said we could become leaders of cities and states, and it was as if it were directed specifically to me. Even though I had never envisioned running for elective office, I knew that I could and should do it.<br><br>I loved President Kimball. The day he passed away, I cried. I was overcome because I had felt his love for me. I had seen so much of the good that he had accomplished for all people. But I was especially grateful for what he had done to lift Native Americans.<br><br>When I graduated from BYU, I decided to become a lawyer for one reason: to help Indian people. After graduating from law school I spent nine years working as the attorney for Idaho's largest Indian tribe, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, located at the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. I saw a marvelous awakening under laws that now help Native Americans to become self-sufficient and economically strong. I have always thought it no accident that Indians were able to survive as a separate, identifiable people. I don't know how the Lord is going to use such people in His ultimate plan, but I see many Native Americans who have been able to earn a college education and do the same kinds of things I have done. There has been a very definite positive cumulative impact.<br><br>During the Vietnam War I volunteered for service in the United States Marine Corps. Soon after I arrived in Quantico, Virginia, for boot camp, I found myself standing at attention in front of my bunk in our barracks along with 54 other Marine Corps recruits. I met my drill instructor when he kicked open the door to the barracks and entered while yelling words laced with profanity. He was a tough, battle-hardened veteran who had been previously wounded in Vietnam. He started at one end of the barracks and confronted each recruit one by one. Without exception, the drill instructor methodically found something about each recruit to ridicule with vulgar language. I dreaded that it would soon be my turn. When it was my turn, the drill instructor grabbed my duffle bag and dumped my personal belongings onto my bunk. I could not see what he was doing because I had my back to my bunk, and we had been instructed to stand at attention with our eyes looking straight ahead. When we spoke to the drill instructor we had to call him "Sergeant Instructor" and yell out our words. The drill instructor looked through my things and grabbed my Book of Mormon. He then walked up to me, and I braced myself for his attack. I expected that he would yell at me as he had done with all the other recruits. Instead, he stood close to me and whispered, "Are you a Mormon?"<br><br>As instructed, I yelled, "Yes, Sergeant Instructor!"<br><br>Again, I expected he would then rip into meand my religion. He paused, raised his hand holding my Book of Mormon, and then, in a very quiet voice, said, "Do you believe in this book?"<br><br>Again I yelled out, "Yes, Sergeant Instructor!"<br><br>At this point I was sure he would yell out disparaging words about Mormons and the Book of Mormon. But he just stood there in silence. Finally he walked back to where he had dumped my personal things and gently laid my Book of Mormon down. He then proceeded to walk right by me without stopping and went on to the next recruit, who he ridiculed and disparaged with vile language. He thereafter did the same with every other recruit.<br><br>I have often wondered why that tough Marine Corps drill instructor spared me that day. But I am glad I was able to say without hesitation that I am a Mormon and that I know the Book of Mormon is true. That testimony is a precious gift given to me with the help oftwo missionaries, a priests quorum leader, and a prophet of God. For this I am very grateful.<br><br>I bear my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as contained in the Book of Mormon, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry EchoHawk was a professor of law at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 7 August 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>s - August 2007 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, Sister Tanner, Elder Kerr, distinguished faculty and officers of Brigham Young University, family members, guests, and, above all, graduates: greetings. It is an honor to be invited to address you in these commencement exercises.<br><br>In considering what I might say to you in brief remarks today, I reviewed some talks given by others in the recent past and came across a graduation speech given at Saint Louis University by the renowned philosopher Yogi Berra. I felt I could open with the same greeting he used: "Thank you all for being here. ... I know this is a busy time of year, and if you weren't here, you could probably be somewhere else." His advice to parents included this: "As parents you'll want to give your children all the things you didn't have. But don't buy them an encyclopedia, make them walk to school like you did. Teach them to have respect for others, especially the police. They are not here to create disorder; they are here to preserve it." To the students he counseled, "Half the lies you hear won't be true, and half the things you say, you won't ever say." Finally, in a comment applicable to me, he said, "To be honest, I'm not much of a public speaker, so I will try to keep this short as long as I can."<sup>1</sup><br><br>We honor today the achievement of those who have qualified for academic degrees. Your degree represents the climax of an extended effort, a happy conclusion. Yet this celebratory gathering is called a commencement. The word <i>commencement,</i> of course, suggests a beginning or the initial steps in a new undertaking. While education that expands the mind and the soul is an appropriate end in itself, we also see it as equipping you with the means to prosper in life and to accomplish things of value. Education can be a preparation for success, even greatness. As you commence the balance of your life today, I would like you to consider for a few moments the greatness to which you might aspire.<br><br>There is a wide variety of ideas about what constitutes greatness in a person. Certainly many have been considered great because of some signal achievement in their lives. Alexander derived his title "the Great" on the basis of conquests; others are considered great for having brokered peace agreements. We may think of self-sacrificing heroes who have alleviated suffering and lifted others out of despair. We think of notable leaders who painted and then achieved a vision--victory in war or a better life for their people. Some have ennobled life itself with the greatness of their art, their acting, their writing, or their thought. Still others find greatness in the invention or creation of something that changes the world. I hope that many of you will indeed perform such great deeds, whether widely heralded or not, whether fully appreciated during your lifetime or not.<br><br>In the business and professional worlds it has become common to speak of "adding value." The concept is that one's efforts should create a benefit that would otherwise not exist. You can readily appreciate that having a job and "adding value" may be two different things. Someone can put in his or her time without really making a significant difference. On the other hand, with diligent effort and a concern to make things better, another person will make a lasting contribution. I hope you will change the world.<br><br>Now I would like you to ponder for a moment a statement made about a hundred years ago by President Joseph F. Smith suggesting that the sort of greatness I have been talking about is secondary and that primary greatness is something else. He said:<br><br><i>Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may make history, but they do not make real life.</i><br><br><i>After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman. . . . It is true that such secondary greatness may be added to that which we style common-place; but when such secondary greatness is not added to that which is fundamental, it is merely an empty honor, and fades away from the common and universal good in life, even though it may find a place in the desultory pages of history.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>You may readily call to mind persons who have achieved notoriety but whose lives lacked greatness in the fundamentals and were empty, even tragic, as a consequence. Despite the gifts or talent they exhibited, their contribution was limited or even counterproductive. On the other hand, you may know individuals, perhaps some of them here with you today, who excelled in "those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind."<br><br>There have been a number like that in my life, one being my mother's father, Helge Swenson, who came to this country from Sweden as an 11-year-old boy and had to make his own way through life with hard work. During much of his youth he worked for and boarded with neighbor farmers; his family was too poor for all the children to live at home and tend exclusively to their own farm. There was little opportunity for formal education in his life. After marriage he maintained his family primarily by farming and service as the Utah County agricultural inspector. He was a great man in my eyes because he was a man of integrity, hard work, and deep spirituality, full of love for others and beloved of all. I loved to be around him and aspired to be like him.<br><br>When I came to BYU from New Jersey as a freshman, my grandparents met me and took me to my dormitory on campus. As we were moving my things into my room in Hinckley Hall, which was then a men's dorm (reserved, I'm sure, for premier students), Grandpa Swenson remarked somewhat wistfully, "If I had had an opportunity for education like this, I would really have amounted to something." His comment surprised me. What did he mean, "amounted to something"? I hoped some day to amount to something by coming close to his level of attainment. He meant, I suppose, that with the advantages of a university education, he could have qualified for any number of prominent positions and enjoyed professional and public recognition for his likely accomplishments on a much broader stage. I'm convinced that with his native talent and strong work ethic he would have been relatively famous and well compensated in life had he been blessed with the same opportunities that I and most of you enjoy. Even so, he would not have been a greater man. His true greatness would still have been rooted in the same qualities of character he already possessed and in the steady discipleship to the Lord Jesus Christ that marked his life to the end.<br><br>I remember the comments of Professor James Q. Wilson of UCLA, who was the commencement speaker in 1994 when my daughter received her degree from BYU. He titled his remarks "The Moral Life." He said:<br><br><i>Commencement speakers are supposed to urge you to rise to the highest challenge, pursue the impossible dream, excel at the loftiest ambitions. Iwill not do that. It is too easy; it is too empty. The easiest thing to do is to support great causes, sign stirring petitions, endorse grand philosophies. The hardest thing to do--and it is getting harder all of the time--is to be a good husband, a good wife, a strong father, a strong mother, an honorable friend and neighbor.</i><br><br>Professor Wilson continued:<br><br><i>The truly good deeds are the small, everyday actions of ordinary life. The employee who gives an honest day's work; the employer who rewards loyalty and service; the stranger who stops to help someone in need; the craftsman who builds each house as if he were going to live in it himself; the man who unhesitatingly accepts responsibility for the children he has fathered; the father who wants the respect of his children more than admission to the executive suite; the mother who knows that to care for an infant is not an admission of professional failure . . . ; the parents who turn off the television even when their children want to watch just one more hour of some bit of Hollywood drivel; the neighbors who join together to patrol a neighborhood threatened by drug dealers; the hiker who carries his own trash out of the park; the landlord who paints out the graffiti without waiting for the city to do it for him; the juror who judges another on the basis of the principle of personal responsibility before the law--these are the heroes of everyday life. May you join their ranks.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Several years ago, when I was serving as executive director of the Family and Church History Department, my wife, Kathy, and I visited officials at the Chinese National Archives in Beijing. In one conversation we spoke of the value of history, particularly family history, in our lives here and now. One of the Chinese officials told me about a tradition of honesty that had come down through many generations in his family. It is referred to by them as "the Four Knows." He had an ancestor who served as a government officer long ago in the days of one of the Chinese dynasties. One day the ancestor was approached for a favor and offered a bribe.<br><br>The man offering the bribe argued, "No one will know."<br><br>My host's ancestor replied, "I will know; you will know; the earth will know; heaven will know."<br><br>That man's refusal to dishonor his position has been remembered and repeated through all the generations of his descendants since. As they teach each other the Four Knows, each is motivated to maintain the family tradition of integrity. He may have earned distinction in his own time anciently, but that man's true greatness lies in how his life has influenced his descendants ever since.<br><br>To say that the truest greatness is "to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind" means that to achieve this foundational greatness we must look to God as we conduct the daily routine and toil of life. Our lives should reflect our understanding that we are responsible to Him for what we do and what we become. We search for His will and commit to it in every aspect of our lives. We live our lives to God. In Paul's words, "Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."<sup>4</sup> If you live not "by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,"<sup>5</sup> you will establish a foundation of enduring greatness. Then, whether some form of secondary greatness follows or not, you will contribute to "the common and universal good in life."<br><br>Jesus said that "every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."<sup>6</sup> We are told that in this day of judgment, if we have rejected God or neglected His counsel, "our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; ... and our thoughts will also condemn us."<sup>7</sup> There is a happy corollary to being judged in these things. It is that the very details of our lives are of interest to God, that He cares about all of it--words, works, even thoughts. His interest and love are infinite in this way, and He will respond to our hopes and pleadings and help us in everything, including matters that seem unimportant or insignificant to others or even to ourselves. Rest assured that you can rely on Him as you strive to establish the foundation of greatness in your life.<br><br>Your greatness in the things God has ordained as primary and fundamental will not come in a day or with one grand act. It will be built over time with the sort of patient, persistent effort that has brought you to the achievement that we are celebrating today. Some years ago, then Elder Howard W. Hunter put it this way:<br><br><i>I believe . . . there is no such thing as instant greatness. This is because the achievement of true greatness is a long-term process; it may involve occasional setbacks. The end result may not always be clearly visible, but it seems that it always requires regular, consistent, small, and sometimes ordinary and mundane steps over a long period of time.</i><br><br><i>True greatness is never a result of a chance occurrence or a one-time effort or achievement. ... It requires a multitude of correct decisions for the everyday choices between good and evil that Elder Boyd K. Packer spoke about when he said, "Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value"</i> ["The Choice," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1980, 21]. <i>Those choices will also show clearly what we are.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Referring once more to the words of President Joseph F. Smith, "We should never be discouraged in those daily tasks which God has ordained to the common lot of man. Each day's labor should be undertaken in a joyous spirit and with the thought and conviction that our happiness and eternal welfare depend upon doing well that which we ought to do, that which God has made it our duty to do."<sup>9</sup><br><br>All worthy endeavors are God's work. As you excel in the common undertakings of life, both in your home and elsewhere, you serve God and glorify Him. Your life blesses the whole human enterprise. And whether that be spiritually or temporally is unimportant. Both are needed in this sphere, and, anyway, to God all things are spiritual.<sup>10</sup> As the Savior counseled His apostles, the great ones are those who minister to others; the chiefest is the one who serves the most.<sup>11</sup> My fervent hope is that with God's help each one of you may attain true greatness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>t Value of Your Boundless Choice - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my great pleasure to congratulate you today on your fine academic achievements. Some of you may in your minds be checking off a box today, feeling you have arrived at a great destination. Others of you may feel you are coming away with more questions than when you started this process. Like some of mychildren in their twenties, you may feel as if you are drowning in a sea of possibilities, trying to sort out the direction you want to go and deciding which dreams, aspirations, careers, and professions you want to chase.<br><br>For a moment let me give you the flip side of that coin. In 1970 I was able to visit the city of Prague. On one street there were lines of people anxiously waiting for bread outside a bakery that had nothing on its shelves. The week before we arrived in Prague, a young college student had in frustration poured gasoline on himself in the center of Wenceslas Square and lit a match. As I gazed down at that burned spot on the ground, I sensed a terrible feeling of desperation and oppression. Those feelings gradually gave way to a rush of intense gratitude for the free land in which I was born and where I lived. I felt as if I was one of the luckiest people on earth. Indeed, today, each of us is.<br><br>By contrast to Prague in the 1970s, we live in a country of vast possibilities. It is the promised land of opportunity where the sky's the limit. So what are the possibilities?<br><br>During the Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine became the voice rallying the newborn American spirit. His words filled the minds of the new patriots and were on the lips of many. He taught that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we gain too cheaply we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value.<br><br>Whatever career or professional path you may choose, I would have you preserve balance in your life. At a time when information pours over us like waves, it is easy to let our lives fall out of balance--with very disappointing results.<br><br>Bob Dunwoody, a business consultant, says that first we must have integrity, then technical competence, and, finally, the ability to add value to our business relationships. He suggests we succeed by slowing down, focusing on our personal relationships, and entertaining the possibility that something new might work. In Bob's words: "Sounds crazy, might work!"<br><br>Perhaps most intriguing is that while he is describing success in business, to me he is really using gospel principles to define success in business and life. Whatever your age, he suggests retiring right now. He believes in asking and listening rather than knowing and telling. According to Bob, only successful people fail, and if you want something, you must give it away.<br><br>President Hinckley has told us that much of what happens in life is a matter of attitude. Netted out, choice becomes a very good thing. The lack of choice has the potential of becoming oppression. I hope you have wisdom beyond your years to appreciate the great value of your boundless choice, the lack of which prompted a young Czechoslovakian student to publicly end his life in a most brutal manner.<br><br>As President Samuelson mentioned, on June23 the Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center was dedicated. We are very excited about this new home for our alumni and a facility that now becomes our new gateway to campus. I encourage you to get involved with your alumni association wherever you may live. Serving others takes our minds off our troubles, gives us a better perspective on life aswe know it, and helps us keep our balance.<br><br>In addition to having a great educational experience, I hope you have been touched bythe Spirit of the Y. Speaking of the BYU experience, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>It has or will become a part of you. . . . It should--itmust--leave an everlasting impression upon you. ... It should become an inseparable part of your very nature. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Cultivate it in your lives and hold its very essence until you grow old and gray.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_byu-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The BYU Experience</a>," BYU devotional address, 4 November 1997]<br><br>As the 90th president of your alumni association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I congratulate you on your fine achievements and welcome you most warmly into this association of nearly 360,000.<br><br>I wish you every success and hope your wildest and fondest dreams come true. Clearly you are the hope of our nation, our church, and your families. May you be successful in the things that matter most in this life and in the life to come, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1>ns of Doing Much Good” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, members of the faculty, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is a pleasure to be together with you on this special day of celebration. Of course we not only celebrate the signal achievements and accomplishments of this distinguished class, but we also gratefully acknowledge the contributions of so many of you who have assisted, encouraged, and supported these impressive graduates during their stretching years of study.<br><br>Today we will grant a total of 2,513 degrees. Most are at the baccalaureate level, but 375 are master's degrees and 36 are doctorates. As you will note in the commencement program, several have also earned special commendation. We are pleased and impressed with each one being recognized today.<br><br>As is frequently the case, the age range of our graduates is almost 50 years. While the graduates are almost evenly split between women and men, 55 percent are now married--and that figure, I'm told, will be increasing significantly in the days ahead. The graduates in this commencement come from 48 states, five U.S. territories, and 55 other countries. We particularly appreciate the families and friends who have traveled great distances to be with and honor the graduates today. Almost a third of the undergraduates and over half of those receiving graduate degrees have attended other institutions of higher education before enrolling at BYU.<br><br>A year ago, in August 2006, I mentioned to the commencement audience our pleasure in having the groundbreaking for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center on the prophet's 96th birthday. As most of you know, last June 23--exactly one year after the groundbreaking--the beautiful new Hinckley Center was dedicated. Again, President Gordon B. Hinckley attended and participated with his counselors, family, many of the Brethren, and special guests. It was a wonderful event. You will likely hear more today about what this magnificent new structure will mean to BYU and to you as alumni. It is a very welcome addition to an already impressive and functional campus, and I express my thanks to the many of you who contributed to this building. As announced, yours will be the very first group of graduates invited to the Hinckley Center tomorrow for our president's reception. We look forward to continuing this tradition in this new, remarkable setting.<br><br>In mentioning these happy events, I must also pause in remembrance of a dear friend, supporter, and leader, President James E. Faust, who passed away early last Friday morning. The entire Church and many others join us in mourning his death. His contributions to Brigham Young University have been significant and numerous. For more than 12 years he has served as the vice chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. Along with President Howard W. Hunter and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, he has had a key leadership role in the long process of establishing our BYU Jerusalem Center. To the end he has been our mentor, our supporter, our guide, and our friend. We will miss him terribly. Our condolences, prayers, and appreciation go to Sister Faust and his wonderful family.<br><br>We are grateful for our marvelous campus with its spectacular grounds and superior facilities. None, however, would be necessary or even possible without the students, who are the fundamental and primary justification for the existence of BYU. We are always grateful for occasions such as today that remind us of this signal reality.<br><br>As we reflect on the importance of our students individually and collectively and acknowledge their efforts, we also must ask ourselves why they make this effort. Few would quibble with the assertion that education is beneficial both to the individual being educated and also to the society in which the individual resides. While we share this general appreciation found almost universally across the higher education spectrum, we also acknowledge that the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides additional insights and doctrinal imperatives for all to place great value on learning and to be lifelonglearners.<br><br>The Lord has said, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). Likewise, He has promised:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Thus while we are delighted that repeated surveys and statistical analyses consistently report that compensation for your life's work will be increased by your BYU education, we believe that, more important, you have made major steps in the process of preparing for the eternities. In addition to participating in sacred ordinances and keeping our covenants and God's commandments that spiritual progress requires, we need to learn, understand, and apply all that we can generally. This is why it makes sense for the Church leadership to commit significant resources to the educational enterprise of the Church, of which BYU is such a central part. This is also why so many faithful Saints throughout the world contribute their tithes and offerings to make this remarkable university possible for those blessed to be able to attend here.<br><br>As we express thanks to our families, professors, and friends for helping along the way, let us also remember the great debt we owe to those who have made this unique experience possible. At BYU we are able to hone our academic skills while strengthening our faith and our capacities for service to God and to our fellow man. Having taken advantage of theBYU experience, you are now especially well equipped to go out into the world and contribute in wonderful and special ways.<br><br>As the Lord promised Hyrum Smith, so He promises you that "if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation" (D&amp;amp;C 11:8). Some of you already have a strong sense about what that "much good" will be. Some of you are still searching. But all of you will be able to see the fruition of this promise if you stay true to your ideals and constantly reflect on the Spirit of the Y, which will continue to be with you and lead you to dojustly, walk humbly, and judge righteously (see D&amp;amp;C 11–12).<br><br>You have been given so much. Now you have the great opportunity and privilege to give back. Of course we will gladly welcome your financial contributions as you join the group of loyal alumni--now more than one-third of a million--who express appreciation for their highly subsidized education by giving back to the university regularly. But above and beyond the financial treasure we hope you will contribute are the character, integrity, and concern for others that are expected of one with the great distinction of being a graduate of Brigham Young University.<br><br>While the reputation and standing of this remarkable institution are measured and evaluated in a number of different ways, ultimately the real value of its contribution is reflected in the graduates that it produces. Thus, with great confidence, we look forward to what you will do in your lives with immense appreciation for the benefit that will accrue to the students who follow you and to the blessings that will come to our sponsoring church and its faithful members by virtue of all the good that you will do.<br><br>As you leave and go on to other pursuits, whether in the workplace, in the home, or in further education, please remember to apply the secrets of successful learning throughout your lives "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>God does live, and this great university is part of His plan and work. Congratulations and best wishes as you go on with our faith and prayers in your behalf. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 16 August 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>periences - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago I had the opportunity of hiking Mount Sinai. It was a very significant experience in my life. I started in the early morning when the stars were still spread across the darkness and watched from the peak of the mountain the world illuminate beneath me as the sun rose. Pilgrims who had come seeking spiritual enlightenment surrounded me, adding a cosmic quality to the journey. I remember thinking I would never experience anything quite like it again. My friend who was with me, however, said that we could have many "Sinai experiences" in our lives and that we should seek these experiences.<br><br>Even Moses had several Sinai experiences as recorded in the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price. In these experiences the Lord not only presented Moses with his mission and the commandments but also gave him a vision of the earth from her creation to the eternal life of her inhabitants. Like Moses, we have Sinai experiences when from a heightened and spiritual perspective we see and wonder at the workmanship of the Lord's hands and come to understand our place in the world and our purpose for the future. Our years at Brigham Young University have provided us such Sinai experiences.<br><br>When Moses saw the world and the people on it, "he greatly marveled and wondered" (Moses 1:8). From the vantage point of our studies at BYU we have seen the world illuminated from a spiritual perspective and have had access to knowledge in a unique way. Professors who are grounded in the gospel have mentored us in theses, research projects, lab work, and term papers. We have had the opportunity to take classes that have taught us to think differently and to use new symbol systems in math, science, music, and language. These new ways of thinking and symbol systems have caused me to marvel and wonder at the workmanship of the Lord and the workmanship of His children. For example, Professor McNamara's introductory astronomy class opened the complexities of the cosmos to me in a marvelous way. Professor Duncan's children's media course introduced me to a new meaning of the word <i>wonder</i> as he tried to help us regain childlike wonder and foster that wonder through the proper use of media. Professor Mason's English classes have helped me to see the power of the written word and the intricately expressive qualities of a poem. I have been awestruck by the power of art and architecture while visiting medieval cathedrals, Muslim mosques, or museum exhibits with Professors Britsch and Benfell.<br><br>To help him understand his eternal identity, the Lord taught Moses on the mount: "Thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6). Our experiences at BYU have helped us to better understand that we are in similitude of the Savior and belong to the great family encompassing all of the people of the earth. In one of his Sinai experiences, Moses was shown all the generations of the earth. While perhaps our vision at BYU has not been that comprehensive, hopefully we are leaving with an enhanced understanding of our brothers and sisters. Devotionals, forums, publications, and activities have connected us with people who speak dozens of languages, have degrees in many fields, and are studying a great variety of subjects. From Professor Toronto's Islamic humanities class to family history courses to films at International Cinema, I feel that I now better understand many of Heavenly Father's children from different places, cultures, and times. Standing in the trenches of the First World War with Professor Tate has given me a greater respect and reverence for life and for the worth of a soul. We are surrounded by returned missionaries who have taught the gospel to the Lord's children in nearly every corner of the globe. At BYU we have learned, like Moses, by example and experience that the immortality and eternal life of man are God's work and glory.<br><br>Once Moses had seen the vision of God's work, the Lord told him, "I have a work for thee, Moses, my son" (Moses 1:6). Here we pause. We can insert our own name. This is our challenge, to find our own work and join it with the Lord's. Throughout our experiences at BYU we have marveled and wondered at the workmanship of the Lord and have come to better understand the purpose and future of God's children. Now we have a work to do. Having experienced Sinai, we must decide how we will return to Sinai and commit to create Sinai-like experiences for others and ourselves. We now leave BYU changed and committed to a lifelong responsibility to serve and learn. In his farewell address Moses admonished the children of Israel to remember the day they stood at Sinai; like them, we too can look back to our BYU experience as a type or pattern for our future lives. We must continue to seek and recognize new Sinai experiences. As Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote:<br><br><i>Earth's crammed with heaven,</i><br><br><i>And every common bush afire with God;</i><br><br><i>But only he who sees, takes off his shoes.</i><br><br>[<i>Aurora Leigh</i> (1857), book 7, lines 820–23]<br><br>I have a testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ in whose similitude we are and in whose work we join. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rachel Ann Seely spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 16 August 2007. </i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> and to Teach More Effectively - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
With you I sense the excitement and anticipation of inspiring events as we begin the 85th annual BYU Campus Education Week. I congratulate you for your decision to participate in this extraordinary activity that you may learn and develop from the experience shared here. There is nothing quite like it in scope and quality in all the world. I share with you a constant, continuing thirst to improve and grow through all of the various means of learning that the Lord has provided for us.<br><br>As I travel throughout the world, it is evident that knowledge is power. Some use it to their own personal advantage. Many of these employ knowledge improperly, severely limiting others in the use of their agency. Yet there are those whose learning, experience, and talent are used to lift, encourage, motivate, and bless others around them. I feel confident that you are among that group. Not only will you benefit from your invested time and effort here, but others will likewise be helped by how you apply and share what you learn. You are following the admonition of the Lord: "And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>1</sup><br><br>As this activity begins, I express gratitude to President Cecil O. Samuelson, Vice Presidents K. Fred Skousen and Sandra Rogers, and Brother Neil Carlile, director of BYU Campus Education Week, for making this event possible. I likewise thank each of the nearly 200 individuals who have invested themselves in thorough, devoted preparation to bless lives in the almost 1,000 classes and activities which are the focus of this week. I congratulate you for being here. May this be an enriching experience for each of us.<br><br>This year's theme, "The Dawning of a Brighter Day," is so appropriate. It emphasizes the wonder of the Restoration of the gospel in this dispensation. Any student of history is aware that the Restoration of the Church with its pure doctrine, priesthood authority, and divine guidance initiated an avalanche of discovery, enlightenment, and inventions that continue to powerfully lift mankind. How grateful I am to our Holy Father for the restoration of truth that came through the Prophet Joseph Smith to benefit all mankind. Joseph Smith is a motivating example of an individual who throughout his brief life continually sought knowledge and willingly shared it with others, even though it would cost him his life to do so.<br><br>My intent is to share thoughts of how to learn and how to teach effectively.<br><br>There are a multitude of available paths through which we may learn and be perfected. Some of these include formal study, pondering, analysis, personal experience, careful observation, mentoring by others, observing outstanding role models, serving willingly, and learning from our own mistakes. It would be unrealistic to attempt to identify, even in headline form, the multitude of avenues through which knowledge flows and experience is gained. For that reason I have chosen to speak of what for me is the most effective path to truth and to the inexhaustible source of guidance and inspiration from our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. That path is by spiritual guidance through the prompting of the Holy Ghost. Together we will lay a foundation to understand spiritual guidance and to discuss how to obtain it and to share it. My sincere desire is to provide motivation for you to expand your capacity to gain knowledge, for your eternal benefit and the blessing of those with whom you will share it.<br><br>Also, there will be mentioned some of the important truths I have learned from seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And since I recognize that many of you are motivated to be here by the desire to help others learn and live truth, I will suggest ways that you might teach these truths. It would be much easier for me to do this if we could have two-way communication. Fortunately, you will almost always have the privilege of encouraging interaction with those you teach, even if it is one-on-one with a family member. Your instructions will be more beneficial and enduring when you promote that participation.<br><br>As we begin I will share a gospel truth that, if communicated effectively and used consistently in your life, would entirely justify every effort you have made to be at Education Week, if that is the only thing you do here. It will help you obtain the most benefit from this hour together, from the balance of your participation here, and in other significant events throughout your life. I notice that many of you have come prepared to take notes on what you hear. While that is of great benefit, I will share a pattern that will provide you even greater access to truth. It is summarized in this statement of principle:<br><br><b>Throughout the remainder of my life, I will seek to learn by what I hear, see, and feel. I will write down the important things I learn, and I will do them.</b><br><br>I suggest that you write down what you see projected above me. If I were to end this message at this point, you would have received one of the most meaningful ways to learn that I could impart. If the principle just shared doesn't seem that important, think again. Many of the vital lessons I have learned and treasure, I have learned by carefully following it.<br><br>You can learn vitally important things by what you <i>hear</i> and <i>see</i> and, even more, by what you <i>feel,</i> as prompted by the Holy Ghost. Many individuals limit their learning primarily to what they <i>hear</i> or <i>read.</i> Be wise. Develop the skill of also learning by what you <i>see</i> and particularly by what the Holy Ghost prompts you to <i>feel.</i> Consciously and consistently seek to learn by what you <i>feel.</i> Your capacity to do so will expand through repeated practice. Significant faith and effort are required to learn by what you feel from the Spirit. Ask in faith for such help. Live to be worthy of such guidance.<br><br>Write down in a secure place the important things you learn from the Spirit. You will find that as you record a precious impression, often others will come that you would not have otherwise received. Also, the spiritual knowledge you gain will be available throughout your life. Always, day or night, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, seek to recognize and respond to the direction of the Spirit. Have available a piece of paper or a card to record such guidance.<br><br>Express gratitude to the Lord for the spiritual guidance you receive and obey it. This practice will reinforce your capacity to learn by the Spirit. It will enhance the guidance of the Lord in your life. You will learn more as you act upon the knowledge, experience, and inspiration communicated to you by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Spiritual guidance is direction, enlightenment, knowledge, and motivation you receive from Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. It is personalized instruction adapted to your individual needs by One who understands them perfectly. Spiritual guidance is a gift of incomparable worth bestowed upon those who seek it, live worthy of it, and express gratitude for it.<br><br>The scriptures define how to qualify for spiritual guidance. Elder Bruce R. McConkie wisely counseled:<br><br><i>However talented men may be in administrative matters; however eloquent they may be in expressing their views; however learned they may be in worldly things, they will be denied the sweet whisperings of the Spirit that might have been theirs unless they pay the price of studying, pondering, and praying about the scriptures.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Over time, through prayer and pondering applicable scriptures, I have found the following pattern for gaining spiritual direction helpful:<br><br><b>To acquire spiritual guidance and to obey it with wisdom, one must: </b><br><ul><br> 	<li><b>Seek divine light in humility</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Exercise faith, especially in Jesus Christ</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Strive diligently to keep His commandments</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Repent constantly</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Pray continually</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Hearken to spiritual guidance</b></li><br> 	<li><b>Express gratitude for guidance received</b></li><br></ul><br>May that suggestion be of some benefit in your quest for spiritual guidance.<br><br>Now we will review how others could be taught the principle of learning I mentioned earlier that you can use. First, I would encourage each one taught to write down the principle:<br><br><b>Throughout the remainder of my life, I will seek to learn by what I hear, see, and feel. I will write down the important things I learn, and I will do them. </b><br><br>Then I would explain how to use each of the three avenues of communication: to hear, to see, and to feel. Further, I would seek to commit each one to live that principle, for every student who would consistently do that would be blessed with greater inspired direction in his or her life.<br><br>I would then illustrate with the following series of graphics how to enhance learning.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8919" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_1.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_1" width="193" height="140" /></a><br><br>My intent is to show some ways you can help others to qualify to be led by the Spirit and to realize that when that direction comes, it should be recorded and obeyed.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8921" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_2.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_2" width="192" height="143" /></a><br><br>Those you teach live in a world subject to challenges and temptations. I am convinced that without the help of the Spirit an individual will have difficulty avoiding transgression in the world today. Should the wrong choices be made, that person becomes bound by sin.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8922" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3" width="196" height="148" /></a><br><br>You can encourage a student to live so as to be influenced by the Spirit and to recognize its guidance in order to be blessed by obedience to its direction. You can play a vital role in that process.<br><br>As you teach the appropriate doctrine and help explain how the Lord communicates through the Spirit, your students will <i>experience</i> being led by the Spirit. They will learn the principles upon which such communication is based. As they apply those principles, they will make the correct choices in life.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8923" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_4.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_4" width="198" height="149" /></a><br><br>All too often a teacher's relation to a student is one of giving counsel with little or no interaction. Often there is no explanation of the reasons why there are commandments, rules, and standards. The teacher becomes just a talking head.<br><br>Most of the teaching in the world is based on one of the five senses--hear, see, touch, smell, or taste. In your classroom you can teach by the power of the Spirit.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8925" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_5.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_5" width="199" height="146" /></a><br><br>Such communication begins by your encouraging each one you teach to participate rather than be a passive listener. In this way you can assess their understanding of what is taught, create a feeling of ownership, and also learn from them. More important, their decision to participate is an exercise in agency that permits the Holy Ghost to communicate a personalized message suited to their individual needs. Creating an atmosphere of participation enhances the probability that the Spirit will teach more important lessons than you can communicate.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8922" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_3" width="196" height="148" /></a><br><br>That participation will bring into their lives the direction of the Spirit. When you encourage students to raise their hand to respond to a question, while they may not realize it, they signify to the Holy Ghost their willingness to learn. That use of moral agency will allow that Spirit to motivate them and give them more powerful guidance during your time together. Participation allows individuals to /i&amp;gt;experience being led by the Spirit. They learn to recognize and feel what spiritual guidance is. It is through the repeated process of feeling impressions, recording them, and obeying them that one learns to depend on the direction of the Spirit more than on communication through the other five senses.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8926" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_6.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_6" width="196" height="146" /></a><br><br>Your capacity to teach is enhanced by the direction you receive from the Holy Spirit. Simply stated, truth presented in an environment of true love and trust qualify an individual for the confirming witness of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8927" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_7.jpg" alt="Scott_Richard_2007-08_image_7" width="196" height="148" /></a><br><br>If you accomplish nothing else in your relationship with your students than to help them recognize and follow the promptings of the Spirit, you will bless their lives immeasurably and eternally. To do this you must constantly seek the guidance of the Spirit to know what to say and how to say it.<br><br>I am convinced that there is no simple formula or technique that I could give you or that you could give your students that would immediately facilitate mastering the ability to be guided by the Holy Spirit. Nor do I believe that the Lord will ever allow someone to conceive a pattern that would invariably and immediately open the channels of spiritual communication. We grow when we labor to recognize the guidance of the Holy Ghost as we struggle to communicate our needs to our Father in Heaven in moments of dire need or overflowing gratitude. Each time we do that we are taking another step in fulfilling the purpose of our being here on earth.<br><br>Our Father expects us to learn how to obtain that divine help by exercising faith in Him and in His Holy Son. Were we to receive inspired guidance just for the asking, we would become weak and ever more dependent on Him. He knows that essential personal growth will come as we struggle to learn how to be led by the Spirit. That struggle develops our immortal character as we perfect our capacity to identify His will through the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. What may appear initially to be a daunting task will become much easier over time as we consistently strive to recognize the feelings awakened by the Spirit. Our confidence in the direction we receive through the Holy Ghost will also become stronger.<br><br>Easy things never produce much beneficial fruit. Neither our Father in Heaven nor His Holy Son take delight in seeing you struggle to overcome obstacles, resolve questions, or find solutions to complex and challenging problems. However, they do rejoice when you willingly recognize that these steps are steps to growth which lead to action that molds your character.<br><br>Have you learned the enduring value of keeping a journal of the very important spiritual experiences or sacred impressions that the Lord has communicated to you? I do not keep a detailed journal of all the events each day, but I try to keep record of some very important matters. The spiritual ones are in a sacred password-protected journal that no one else can access. When I feel authorized by the Holy Ghost, I take some of the truths learned and put them in my family journal or share them in a public message. This is consistent with a principle that the scriptures confirm is true. Some personal matters are for our guidance and edification to help us grow and improve our character, our devotion, and our testimony. These things are not intended for other individuals. Much like a patriarchal blessing is tailored for the person to whom it is given, such matters should be kept reverently protected because of their inherent sacred nature. Any sacred matter that the Lord wants others to know, He can communicate to them directly through the Spirit if they are worthy and in tune.<br><br>To confirm that what I have been talking about is not just pure theory, I will now mention some of the priceless truths I have learned through spiritual guidance over many years.<br><ul><br> 	<li>The scriptures teach and I have been led to confirm that we will never be prompted by the Holy Ghost to do something we cannot do. It may require extraordinary effort and much time, patience, prayer, and obedience, but we can do it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Repeatedly I have been impressed to learn that to reach a goal never before attained one must do things never before done.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>I have been taught that we can make many choices in life, but we cannot determine our final destiny. Our actions do that. It can appear that we control outcomes in our life, but we do not. Worthiness, righteousness, faith in Jesus Christ, and the plan of our Father assure a pleasant productive future, while lying, cheating, or violating the laws of personal purity assure a life of misery here on earth and beyond the veil, unless there is the requisite repentance.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>It is important not to judge ourselves by what we think we know of our own potential. We should trust the Lord and what He can do with our dedicated heart and willing mind.<sup>3</sup></li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>I have been taught by the Holy Spirit and the observation of others that concepts like faith, prayer, love, and humility hold no great significance and produce no miracles until they become a living part of the individual through his or her own experience, aided by the sweet promptings of the Spirit.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We all will have adversity; it is a part of life. We will all have it because we need it for growth and the forging of our righteous character. I have learned that the Lord has a consummate capacity to judge our intent. He is concerned about what we are becoming by the choices we make. He has an individual plan for each of us. This concept is very comforting when we consider how to understand difficult matters such as the early death of someone who seems to be so needed on earth. It is most helpful when we struggle with illness or a severe handicap or try to assess another's tragic suicide.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>I have been led through personal experience to understand an important truth. I know Satan has absolutely no power to force a determined righteous individual because the Lord protects that person from him. Satan can tempt; he can threaten; he can attempt to appear to have such power; but he does not possess it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>I have learned that our mind can strengthen an impression of the Holy Ghost or, sadly, can totally destroy it by casting it out as something unimportant or the product of our own imagination. When spiritual guidance comes, it is well to remember this comment of the Prophet Joseph Smith: "God judges men according to the use they make of the light which He gives them."<sup>4</sup></li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>When facing adversity we can be led to ask many questions. Some of them serve a useful purpose; others do not. It really does no good to ask questions that reflect opposition to the will of God. Willing sacrifice of deeply held personal desires in favor of God's will is generally very hard to do. Yet when done, we are in the strongest position to receive the maximum help from our loving Heavenly Father. Accepting His will, even when it is not fully understood, brings great peace and, over time, understanding.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>It is sometimes very hard to discern an answer to prayer for a matter for which we have very deep personal feelings or something which causes strong emotions to arise within us. That is why it is important to receive valid, inspired counsel when one finds himself or herself in such a circumstance.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>In a quiet moment of pondering I learned that there is a relationship between faith and character. The greater our faith in Jesus Christ the stronger our character, and increased character enhances our ability to exercise even greater faith.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>The Spirit has taught that Satan doesn't have to tempt us to do bad things. He can accomplish much of his objective by distracting us with many acceptable things, thus keeping us from accomplishing the essential ones. We need to frustrate that distraction by identifying what is critically important in our lives. We must give the cream of our effort to accomplish those things. Where there is limited time or resources, this pattern may require that some good activities must be set aside.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>On occasion the Lord will give us vital spiritual guidance by inspiring others to share what they have learned. Such mentors can greatly enrich our life through thoughtful communication of their knowledge and experience. We also can identify living or deceased mentors by careful study and emulation of their productive lives. I am confident that the recent passing of President James E. Faust has brought to the mind of thousands of individuals he has touched personally gratitude for his encouragement and motivation. He had the exceptional capacity to lift and build other individuals. He chose valid reasons to congratulate others as he spoke of them with sincerity and integrity. The result was to edify, lift, and help them to explore a course of life that would bring each greater success and happiness. His encouragement was often brief and concise, yet most effective and enduring.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>One of the most memorable and powerful patterns of communication by the Spirit is through dreams. I have learned that when the transition from being fully asleep to being fully awake is almost imperceptible, it is a signal that the Lord has taught something very important through a dream. When this occurs, I recognize the need to ponder what I remember of the dream, to seek to understand it and its application in my life. Sometimes the dream is symbolic and prayer is required so that through the Holy Ghost the Lord can interpret or clarify the lessons to be understood and applied.Throughout the majority of my teenage and adult life, I have greatly appreciated <b>mercy.</b> It was through a vivid dream that I learned also to cherish <b>justice.</b> Justice provides order and control in our Father's plan of happiness. It assures that whatever we have earned through worthy effort will ever be ours, such as knowledge, the love of dear ones, and the eternal benefits of the ordinances, including those of the temple. Justice assures that no power can take these precious things from us. We could lose them through disobedience, but who would want to do that?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>The Savior's injunction to "ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you"<sup>5</sup> is a gate to spiritual guidance. I have been taught that gentle promptings will encourage us to make the right decisions. When carefully observed, these gentle impressions to our heart can be followed by specific counsel given to our mind. That counsel leads us to know what to do with greater precision. Such detailed direction comes when we readily respond to the initial promptings of the Spirit. At times such spiritual guidance can indicate or imply events that will occur later in life. Our acceptance of such prompting and our willingness to obey it does not mean that the will of the Lord will be changed. It does mean that the impact on our life will be different. There will be far more significant consequence because of our willingness to obey the counsel given by such sacred guidance of the Holy Spirit.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>There is one last priceless gem of spiritual guidance I would share. It has taken a very long time to recognize. Forced obedience yields no enduring fruit. That is why both our Father in Heaven and the Savior are willing to entreat, to prompt, to encourage, and to patiently wait for us to recognize precious spiritual guidance from Them. Once it took me over ten years to discover the answer to an extremely important matter for which I had prayed consistently and earnestly. The complete answer came as I was able to assemble portions of the solution communicated to me in differing ways and at differing times. I was not given the answer directly, but I was patiently and lovingly led to find it.</li><br></ul><br>I close with my testimony. I will try to follow the excellent counsel given by President Spencer W. Kimball. He taught: "A testimony is not an exhortation; a testimony is not a sermon . . . ; it is not a travelogue. . . . Just tell how you feel inside. That is the testimony. The moment you begin preaching to others, your testimony ended. Just tell us how you feel, what your mind and heart and every fiber of your body tells you."<sup>6</sup><br><br>I know that the things I have shared are true for I have learned them. They have been confirmed by the gentle promptings of the Holy Ghost. May some of them be of benefit to you. I positively know that Jesus Christ lives and as one of His Apostles bear solemn witness that He is a glorified, resurrected personage of perfect love. He guides His Church on earth. He loves you. During your presence here He will prompt you. As you seek that prompting and identify it, He will guide your life. He is our Master, our Redeemer, our Savior. I love Him. With every capacity that I possess I bear witness that He lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>t for Excellence - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to be together with you this morning. I hope you have had a pleasant and productive summer because the activities of this week send an unmistakable message: Vacation is over! The time has arrived once again to engage in essential and vital tasks related to our stewardships at Brigham Young University. As we begin a new fall semester, there can be no better reminder of the fundamental purpose and mission of Brigham Young University than our theme, "Education for Eternity."<br><br>Since my arrival at BYU, each summer has been occupied in part by my growing anticipation of a new fall semester and the events of the annual university conference. I take this matter very seriously because, at some point in time, all of you made a well-considered decision to cast your lot and future with BYU. For some of you it was as recent as the past academic year, and for others it occurred several years ago.<br><br>I think it is clear to most of us that the decision to come here was more than just a good professional choice--although I hope that it was and will be. Many of you were recruited vigorously by colleagues, some were drawn back by pleasant memories of previous experiences at the Y, and others have come because of high expectations of what you anticipate finding here. I'm confident that virtually all of you studied your alternatives carefully, prayed about them diligently, and have felt "moved upon" to be at BYU. Thus we all have a heavy responsibility to do what we can and must to make sure that your prayerful deliberations are also experientially ratified.<br><br>Several weeks ago, while reading some of the early sections of the Doctrine and Covenants, I was struck afresh by the emphasis given in the first year or two of the history of the Church on "gathering." Throughout recorded history, God's people have gathered in various ways that have been adjusted or modified to meet particular needs and changing conditions. It occurred to me for the first time that our being together with our students and the entire BYU community is a form of gathering that is approved of and endorsed by heaven. In that regard, let me share some words of the Lord to William W. Phelps that might reflect our current circumstances.<br><br>In addition to his specific work of printing--and we have a wonderful print shop here at BYU--Brother Phelps was informed that his work involved "selecting and writing books for schools in this church" (D&amp;amp;C 55:4). Further, he had been instructed to travel so "that you may be planted in the land of your inheritance to do this work" (D&amp;amp;C 55:5).<br><br>I would suggest that each of us has been gathered and planted here to do important work of various kinds at this, the flagship university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Like Brother Phelps, some of you have and will compose hymns, write articles, and publish books while teaching and serving the wonderful and precious students who likewise have been gathered here. It is an exciting but also sobering thought to be so involved as we find ourselves. It is no small thing to have the opportunity and responsibility to help envision and plant "education for eternity" in the hearts and minds of the impressive students and colleagues who are entrusted toBYU.<br><br>I hope you have had a good season of refreshment and renewal--albeit one too short and still filled with responsibility and necessary obligations. Life has its ongoing purposes and requirements. A change of pace is always attractive even when there are still lawns to mow, weeds to pull, walls to paint, and trash to be collected. We hope it has been a time to deepen family bonds, to connect a little more with friends and neighbors, and to do the things that charge your figurative batteries for the exciting rigors ahead in the next academic year.<br><br>The past year has been remarkable in many respects, and we are grateful for what we have learned and experienced. BYU has never been more highly regarded academically than it is now, and the successes, recognition, and achievements of our faculty and students provide more supporting evidence than ever before that this is so. We have not arrived at where we need to be, but we have positive confirmation that we are on or near the path.<br><br>Among the significant distinctions we have experienced this past year--including in academics, athletics, the arts, and animation--is one that is truly unique: the building and dedication of the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center, which is to be known as the Hinckley Center.<br><br>Never before, to my knowledge, has a sitting president of the Church and chairman of our board of trustees spent two consecutive birthdays with us on the BYU campus. On June 23, 2006, we held the groundbreaking ceremony for the Hinckley Center, and on June 23, 2007, the largely completed building was dedicated. To erect and finish this beautiful, spacious, and functional facility in record time is an accomplishment that is nothing short of miraculous, and we owe a tremendous debt to all who sacrificed in any way to make this happen.<br><br>Of course in this distinction we include the more than 70,000 who contributed financially not only for the construction of the building but also for a maintenance fund that will ensure in perpetuity that this structure will never need to call upon the tithing funds of the Church for its support. Heaven has blessed this enterprise, and so very many people gave more in effort and treasure than could have been previously imagined.<br><br>Last summer and again during my days away from campus this past month, I read a selection of the speeches President Hinckley has given at BYU over the years.<br><br>President Hinckley's messages are always excellent, and for me they seem to be timeless in their relevance for us. Of course there are recurring themes, just as there are in the scriptures, but there is also a freshness or currency that bespeaks of his prophetic insights and his God-directed counsel to us.<br><br>At least a few here today have heard President Hinckley on most, if not all, of the occasions when he has spoken at BYU since his call as a General Authority in 1958. Some of you, like me, are more recent arrivals on this campus but will have access to what he has said in the <i>BYU Speeches</i> volume published annually and available in the Bookstore or library or on the Web. I commend all of his addresses and messages, general conference talks, <i>Ensign</i> and <i>Liahona</i> articles, and the like, but I especially encourage those of the BYU community to study what he has specifically said to and about us. If you do, you will have a much clearer understanding of what it means to be here and why the expectations for each of us are in no way trivial or insignificant.<br><br>Today, in keeping with our conference theme, I want to focus on one notion that President Hinckley mentions frequently. You would be correct if you think that there are multiple ideas he emphasizes. His linkage of academic achievement in an environment of spiritually sustaining faith is consistent. He has always been a clear and stalwart defender and teacher of the Honor Code. He often reminds us of the worth of the widow's mite and our obligation to the tithe payers of the Church. You could undoubtedly think of others.<br><br>At the time of President Hinckley's charge four years ago when I formally became BYU's 12th president, he gave the counsel to continue to make BYU be the best it can be. We have made a little progress, but I see so much more that needs to be done and can be done if we avoid the curse of complacency that is a great risk when there is already so much here that is "pretty good."<br><br>In November 1998 President Hinckley spoke at a devotional in the Marriott Center. His message that day was to our students. Today, not quite nine years later, I occupy the same pulpit and speak primarily to our staff, faculty, and administrators. I believe we should liken these words of the prophet to ourselves--yours truly included--because it seems to me that they are as applicable to us as they are to our students.<br><br>Said he:<br><br><i>I speak to you this morning not only about a little more effort, a little more self-discipline, a little more consecrated effort in the direction of excellence in your studies. I speak of it also in terms of your lives.</i><br><br><i>This is the great day of preparation for each of you. It is the time of beginning for something that will go on for as long as you live. I plead with you: Don't be a scrub! Rise to the high ground of excellence. You can do it. You may not be a genius. You may be lacking in some skills. But you can do better than you are now doing. You are students </i>[and I add, faculty, staff, and administrators]<i> at BYU. Most of you are members of this great Church whose influence is now felt all over the world. You are people with a present and with a future. Don't muff the ball. Be excellent.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Quest for Excellence," BYU devotional, 10November 1998]<br><br>President Hinckley's comments that day were entitled "The Quest for Excellence." I hope we can all agree that we share a quest for excellence. I like the phrase used by Moroni as he described how God's gift of His Son provided "a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11) in replacing the law of Moses. It was not that the law of Moses was not good. In fact, the law of Moses was essential for its time and circumstances. Likewise, what has thus far been accomplished at Brigham Young University has been remarkable and wonderful, but there is still room--and the necessity--to accomplish more excellence in the days and years ahead. That is what is expected of us, and that is what we are promised can happen.<br><br>As I have mentioned before, I am asked with some frequency about my vision and priorities for BYU. I usually point out that one of the great blessings of this institution is that we are led by a board of trustees whom we sustain in their guiding and prophetic callings. We are grateful for the correct principles they teach us while inviting us to govern our daily programs and activities using our best judgment, common sense, and the inspiration we might receive directly.<br><br>In this context I mention the recent passing of President James E. Faust. He served as vice chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees for more than 12 years and for many additional years as one of our staunchest advocates and advisors in making the BYU Jerusalem Center a reality. He was never failing in his guidance, his kindness, and his faith in the mission of Brigham Young University. He will be missed greatly, and we will forever be in his debt. Our prayers and condolences go to Sister Faust, his family, and the Brethren.<br><br>It seems worth mentioning again how regular and systematic our process is of consulting with our board and its representatives. Many of you contribute regularly in department and college councils aimed at optimizing and coordinating our work. You may know that our deans meet about twice a month as a group with the academic vice presidents, usually on Monday afternoons, to consider issues across the university. Likewise, the directors of the university meet frequently with their stewardship lines to carry forward their important activities.<br><br>Perhaps you may know our President's Council meets almost every Monday morning. Monthly we meet with the commissioner of Church Education, with the executive committee of the board of trustees, and with the board of trustees, which is chaired by our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley.<br><br>It is remarkable how President's Council, Deans' Council, and the college council members have specific and unique responsibilities and stewardships but work together with an eye to what is best for the institution as a whole. As I watch the coordination and collaboration across this great campus, I frequently think, "Only at BYU would this be possible." I know that people at other places and institutions work cooperatively and collegially, but the clear focus and priority on the institutional mission first is truly "BYU unique."<br><br>As we met on this occasion last year, we were taking a figuratively deep breath after what was a rigorous but successful university-wide accreditation site visit and review. Shortly we will have an abbreviated, one-day visit by a representative of the Northwest Commission to document our continued progress. I'm confident that the great work that has been done this past year will be reflected in obvious evidence of tremendous progress. I will have more to say about this in a few moments.<br><br>Likewise, we continue to have remarkable and positive support from our board of trustees as well as admiring recognition of BYU's achievements from multiple sources external to the university and the Church. In fact, in my interactions with other university presidents, which my responsibilities require on a regular basis, I'm reminded of a statement made by Senator Lowell Weicker of Connecticut in a meeting I attended many years ago. After a fairly lengthy preamble that described many of the faults and failings of the United States, including the government and its people, Senator Weicker said, "There is only one place in the world worse to live than the USA--that is anyplace else."<br><br>That is how I feel about BYU. We have problems, challenges, difficulties, and occasional disappointments. Things are so bad at Brigham Young University that there is only one place where I would rather not be the president than here. That place is any other university in the world. We can't and won't compare ourselves completely to any other institution because there is not another exactly like us. Of course we will measure some specifics against others as we must and should, but we will never try to be completely like another institution, nor should we expect, given our mandates and resources, another to be exactly like us. We will always compare ourselves to what we must become--thus ourcontinuing and relentless quest for excellence.<br><br>In that context, and in our remaining time this morning, let me touch briefly on five topics we are addressing and will be emphasizing--particularly in the coming academic year. At all levels each of us obviously works on many and various pressing matters. In noting the quintet that I will mention this morning, I mean in no way to reduce the importance or value of other BYU priorities or imperatives. I do feel all represent areas of significant interest and importance in the coming days. These are the five for today.<br><br>1. Becoming the best BYU can be<br><br>2. Student learning outcomes<br><br>3. New facilities planning and funding<br><br>4. Graduate programs<br><br>5. Online education<br><h2><b>Becoming the Best</b></h2><br>I will confess that I have spent many hours--including some late at night and someearly in the morning--thinking about President Hinckley's charge to our campus at the time of my inauguration. While the notion of BYU becoming the best it can be has a number of dimensions, part of "becoming" and "being" the best BYU can be is to live with integrity; that is, to say what we mean and mean what we say. In recent beginning-of-semester devotionals I have spoken--I hope plainly--about such things as dress and grooming, academic honesty, other aspects of integrity in our Honor Code, and loyalty to the doctrines, principles, and people that support and sustain us.<br><br>We place great emphasis on academics and will continue to do so without apology, but we also want to be sure that the promises we make about such things as our BYU student housing policy, for example, are aligned with the realities of our circumstances. We support BYU housing standards in a campus and community environment where most students want such and almost all of our students' families expect them.<br><br>Our chartered housing pilots are proceeding, and we are learning as we go. As is the case in other matters as well, specific policies and procedures will modify and change with evolving circumstances when necessary, but our principles will not be compromised. We are sure and clear that those who accept the privilege and responsibility of being students at BYU must have an appropriate learning and living environment on and off campus that accords with our Honor Code and BYU-approved housing standards.<br><br>Some have said BYU athletic teams could not maintain both the Honor Code and win consistently. We are grateful to our BYU scholar-athletes and their coaches who demonstrate you can be winners--conference and national champions in many cases--not in spite of but because of keeping Honor Code standards. Where integrity is concerned, the choice is not either/or. It is resoundingly both.<br><br>Another part of BYU becoming the best we can be is our ongoing effort to focus and simplify. One way to look at this issue is to do less but do it better. It is almost always temporarily easier to keep adding than to ask critically, "What is really essential?" "What is ultimately most important?" "How can we prevent excellence from being overshadowed by the pedestrian or the merely good?"<br><br>Consistent attention to the alignment of our mission and our daily practice is a vital and constant aspect of BYU becoming the best we can be. As a wise commentator once said, somewhat tongue in cheek, "When all is said and done, almost always more is said than done." It is far easier to identify our challenges than it is to address them, but deal with them we must if we expect BYU to improve and approach the envisioned best it can be.<br><br>I have mentioned previously the dramatic changes I have observed in our College of Biology and Agriculture, which is now the College of Life Sciences. We owe a tremendous debt to all of the faculty, staff, and administration both present and past who have accomplished so much.<br><br>Dean Rodney Brown and his colleagues explain it is part of the shift in focus from farming and the Green Revolution of the 19th century to the Gene Revolution of the 21st century. The knowledge explosion in the life sciences is vast, and BYU is committed to making significant contributions to it.<br><br>Change, including change at the university, is not easy. It takes shared vision, collegial cooperation, and sometimes difficult decisions.<br><br>In restructuring the College of Life Sciences, six departments were discontinued and five new departments reemerged. Low-enrollment and outdated programs were consolidated and eliminated: 40 programs became 21 programs, and a 30-percent reduction in course offerings minimized redundancies.<br><br>This was not easy, perfect, or universally popular. But such changes make possible new things. As best as can be determined, no student in this college who wanted a mentored-learning experience with a faculty member last year was denied one. There were 201 undergraduate student names appearing as authors on peer-reviewed journal papers, and 409 undergraduates were authors of abstracts and presentations at meetings.<br><br>If we had time this morning, we could talk about plans underway in the Marriott School, the McKay School of Education, and several other colleges as well. In sympathy for you, I'll save these important advances for another occasion.<br><br>In a slightly different but related vein, our "BHAG" program exemplifies campus goodwill and cooperation. As you will recall, BHAG stands for Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal.<br><br>Vice presidents Brian Evans and Kelly Flanagan have worked with our colleagues in their respective organizations to meet a BHAG goal of identifying and transferring positions and salary to create additional new faculty fellowships.<br><br>Let me pause here. How many institutions and units--especially hardworking groups--doyou know who voluntarily transfer FTE and salary?<br><br>While we do not expect all BHAG positions to be named, the first six have been designated by Financial Services, Human Resources, Dining Services, and OIT to honor six colleagues who have cumulatively served more than 200 years at BYU.<br><br>As an undergraduate teaching institution with some limited-in-number but superior-in-quality graduate programs, our mission is to learn and teach with academic excellence in a nurturing environment of sustaining faith. One, academic excellence, can and is being accomplished elsewhere. It is at BYU where both academics and a spiritual environment do and will increasingly bless the lives of those who are here. And those who BYU graduates will in turn bless in their service throughout the world.<br><br>An issue of great concern to all of us is the obvious dynamic tension we see and feel between the demands for teaching, scholarship, and citizenship. We experience similar tugs as we attempt to improve how we serve while not expecting or experiencing increased resources to support our vital tasks. These tensions, when properly harnessed, can be helpful to challenge the best from each of us. And yet the temptation is great to respond to the stretching that is taking place by figuratively letting go of one end of the rope rather than enhancing the latent strength within us to rise to the challenges we face. We must all do better in each sphere of our responsibilities.<br><br>For example, on rare occasions I hear that a department may feel that it might be necessary to hire new faculty members who are not particularly interested or able in teaching but who seem to have the capacity to do research, creative work, and publishing sufficiently to achieve continuing faculty status. When our behaviors differ from our stated values and objectives, both we and the institution are diminished and the gulf between what we really are and what we really do as we strive tobe the best we can be is widened.<br><h2><b>Student Learning Outcomes</b></h2><br>Thanks again to each of you who helped BYU prepare for the successful April 2006 site visit by our regional accrediting agency, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. As I reported at our last annual university conference, we were pleased to receive NWCCU reaffirmation of the accreditation of Brigham Young University.<br><br>At the end of October this year we will host an NWCCU commission representative for a one-day visit. Our focused interim report is due a month prior to that visit. Our report will indicate that BYU faculty, students, and administrators across campus are directly addressing the three requirements in Recommendation 1 of the comprehensive site visit report.<br><br>First, BYU has undertaken a systematic process to identify and publish expected learning outcomes for each of our 415 degree programs. This is a significant achievement. I am told that our learningoutcomes.byu.edu Web site has received some national interest as a readily accessed, open, easily updated list of the expected learning outcomes across campus.<br><br>And I am delighted our Student Advisory Council, Deans' Council, University Curriculum Council, University Graduate Council, and many others will be inviting every student on campus this fall to review his or her expected learning outcomes on the learningoutcomes.byu.edu site and in hard copy as will be posted in advisement centers and departments.<br><br>Second, BYU seeks to demonstrate that students who complete their programs have achieved the stated outcomes of those programs. Thank you to each and all who are contributing to what is becoming increasingly regular and systematic assessment of our degree programs using the full range of appropriate primary and secondary sources of evidence.<br><br>The day has come when BYU--and all higher education institutions across the United States--must be able to state who our students are who graduate from our programs and show what they can do with our degrees.<br><br>And, third, BYU is seeking to provide evidence consistently across our programs that the results of its assessment activities lead to the improvement of teaching and learning. In a sense our bottom line is a continual focus on teaching and learning and the improvement of our learning and teaching.<br><h2><b>New Facilities</b></h2><br>We are all grateful for the generosity, hard work, and vision of so very many who make our superb facilities available to us across campus. I have already commented on what some of us regard as miraculous circumstances that led to the groundbreaking of the Hinckley Center on June 23, 2006, and then, exactly a year later, the dedication of this magnificent structure on June 23, 2007.<br><br>As you walk around campus, you see among the many projects underway the major expansion of the Tanner Building for the Marriott School of Management and an addition to the Richards Building to accommodate parts of our dance program and other activities that will be displaced with the razing of the Knight Mangum Building. You will also see the remaining five Deseret Towers buildings come down now that they have reached the limits of their utility in housing our students.<br><br>Many may have heard that the board of trustees has given us approval to raise the funds to construct a new BYU Broadcasting facility to meet our unique opportunities and heavy responsibilities in education as well as in sharing our message and that of the Church literally around the world. We are in the planning phase for a new Office of Information Technology Building. In addition to a rather constant program of campus beautification and infrastructure updating and improvement, we have a task committee carefully examining options for our southeast quadrant of campus as we consider how best to respond to significant facility needs for critical academic programs such as engineering and the life sciences. I have not mentioned all that is on our plate, but you will sense that we are a university that continues to be on the move in many remarkable and important ways.<br><h2><b>Graduate Programs</b></h2><br>While we continually remind others and ourselves that our primary mission is and will be that of an undergraduate learning and teaching institution, we know that in key, selected areas, our graduate efforts reinforce our undergraduate programs by providing to both faculty and students important academic and professional opportunities they would not otherwise have. We are grateful for our BYU graduate programs; and in the special relationships and roles that occur here, we consider them to be vital to our stated mission.<br><br>Having said this, I hope you won't mind me saying again that there is always going to be a very significant and high hurdle for those who might wish to propose new graduate programs. And, no, we are not going to open adental or medical school!<br><br>I hope you will understand when we continue to ask all members of the university community involved with both graduate and undergraduate programs what we might choose to reduce, simplify, or even eliminate aspart of our ongoing efforts to do what we do better. Just as we could not tolerate today the academic program of the BYU of 1907, so must we not jeopardize the BYU of the future by inaction or poor choices.<br><h2><b>Online Courses</b></h2><br>In this digital knowledge age, it is understandable and often productive to see online courses as efficient and enhancing educational tools both on campus and as widely distributed elsewhere. We will continue to think, study, and explore how best to use these tools in ways that enhance and magnify our mission at BYU. These tools are expensive, and, as with all that we do, we must weigh the cost against other good priorities. In this regard we will continue to work with our sister institutions in the Church Educational System, especially BYU–Idaho and BYU–Hawaii, regarding fair, equitable, mutually beneficial, and productive ways to support each other in the online area. It is not only to be expected but also, in my judgment, desirable for each institution to pursue these matters a little differently, and we will assist and cooperate as best we can.<br><br>We salute colleagues across this campus for embracing and using appropriate online tools to enhance our educational processes. In particular we recognize our Division of Continuing Education for providing award-winning online courses in many circumstances.<br><br>At the same time we will continue to be vigilant in preventing others from abusing our efforts to be helpful to those wishing to access our offerings. Likewise, we will maintain our caution regarding online courses as any kind of substitute for the best parts of what we call "the BYU experience." There is something thrilling and perhaps unique about learners and teachers sharing together in the same place, especially with the enlightening influence of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>As we mention the Division of Continuing Education, we anticipate the move of the BYU Salt Lake Center to its downtown Triad Center location this fall. As you may recall, after carefully studying several possible approaches and options, our board of trustees decided to move only the Salt Lake Center and its current program onto the Church Triad Center campus. We are grateful that the facilities have already been dedicated, but those interested may attend an upcoming open house to visit the new facility. The details of this event will be shared later.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In the interest of time and your patience, Ihave mentioned only a few topics and issues from a far more extensive menu before us. While we all will be involved in much more than has been addressed today, I hope we can obtain and maintain a clear focus on the things that really matter most in providing the necessary components of an "education for eternity." For me such focus largely encapsulates my view of our quest for excellence.<br><br>As I repeat my strongly held feelings of appreciation and affection for each of you as well as the very many not gathered physically to our campus today but nevertheless clearly gathered with and to the cause of BYU, I also bear my solemn witness that the work of this institution is the work of the Lord. Like William W. Phelps was in 1831, we are and must be God's agents, planted here to do this work.<br><br>To the extent that I possess the authority, Iinvoke our Heavenly Father's blessings upon each of us, our students, and our families in this marvelous quest for excellence in achieving and providing an education for eternity. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>of Dreams - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
BYU is built of brick and mortar. It comprises libraries and laboratories, classrooms and cafeterias, well-groomed grounds and cluttered faculty offices. It is built of impressive financial resources and of remarkable human capital. But, above all, BYU is and ever has been built of dreams and ideals. Our house of learning is also a house of dreams.<br><br>In the early days of the Brigham Young Academy, the building that housed the school burnt to the ground. Many thought the fire signaled the end of the Academy. Reed Smoot lamented to Karl G. Maeser that the school had been destroyed. But Brother Maeser knew better.<br><br><i>On Sunday, January 27, 1884, flames erupted from the second floor of the building. The cause of the fire was never determined, but it didn't matter. Provo had no fire department and the Academy had no insurance. Townspeople rushed to form a bucket brigade, but their efforts were futile. They removed what books and furniture they could, then they just stood and watched the building burn. Reed Smoot, one of the school's first 29 students, was among them. He would later become a U.S. senator and an apostle of the Lord. He approached Karl Maeser grief-stricken that the Academy had burned down. But Karl set his jaw. "No! Fire has destroyed the house, but the Academy lives on."</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Brother Maeser knew that BYU, like Zion, exists as an idea, an aspiration, and indeed a prophetic injunction to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith"<sup>2</sup> and to "not . . . teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup>3</sup> Such ideals are hardy; fire cannot destroy them, for they reside not in buildings alone but in the minds and hearts of the Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Even so, it took a prophetic dream regarding BYU's future to persuade President Maeser to stay here during those difficult days and years that followed the fire.<br><br><i>Nevertheless, despite Karl's determination, the next eight years were dark indeed. The school occupied several temporary buildings, including the Smoot Drugstore, and finally settled into a warehouse leased from ZCMI. But facilities were makeshift and supplies depleted. Karl struggled to pay the rent. At first the faculty were fiercely loyal, but then their families began going hungry. There was talk of closing the school. Even Karl himself wrote of giving up the cause: "I am</i> worn out and sick in spirit, . . . <i>and with all my love for this Academy, I feel that I owe it to my very life, which is needlessly wearing itself out here in an apparently hopeless task, to accept any change that will promise me opportunities for permanent usefulness."</i><br><br><i>With that he told his wife and his daughter that because there seemed to be no real support or future for a school here, he was going to accept a position at the University of Deseret, where he could get a regular salary and at least adequately provide for his family. Accordingly, his wife and daughter got things packed and then sat on their trunks for several days, until his daughter finally mustered enough courage to ask her father when they were moving. His response was: "I have changed my mind. I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part."</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Such divinely sent dreams have punctuated our history, and the dream that BYU will become in time a great Latter-day Saint university if it remains true to its mission is woven throughout our institutional history. This dream preceded us. It overarches our current imperfect attempts to realize it. And it will outlast our brief contribution to it. Though all else changes, this dream endures. As Karl G. Maeser observed near the end of his tenure here:<br><br><i>Amid the ever-changing scenes of development which the Brigham Young Academy has passed through, whether holding forth in one single room under makeshift arrangements, or enjoying the benefits of more suitable facilities: whether in rented premises . . . , or in her own palatial habitation; ... there must go through it all, . . . "one thing constant": the spirit of the Latter-day Work. As long as this principle shall be the mainspring of all her labors, whether in teaching the alphabet or the multiplication tables, or unfolding the advanced truths of science and art, the future of the Brigham Young Academy will surpass in glory the fondest hopes of her most ardent admirers.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>BYU's history abounds in such seemingly hyperbolic, visionary statements about its future. Such visionary hopes for BYU can seem daunting as well as exhilarating, especially when bogged down in the mundane tasks of grading, resource allocation, assessment, rank advancement, and the like. Yet even amid the quotidian cares and controversies that beset us, the extraordinary truth persists that great expectations envelop this university. The halls here echo with prophetic utterances, such as John Taylor's prophecy:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Such statements are the stars that must guide the good ship BYU as it tacks across academic seas. Quoting Carl Schurz:<br><br><i>Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Over the years thousands of individuals have contributed to the dream of BYU. Every year new students and faculty add their particular hopes and dreams to our collective vision. This past year many of you participated in a process of defining and refining the dream for your programs by developing expected learning outcomes. Some years ago I was privileged to participate in a similar exercise when I was asked to draft the Aims of a BYU Education.<br><br>As important as our contributions to the dream are, it is prophets who have ever provided the fundamental vision that guides our course at BYU. Our theme this year comes from one such prophetic statement, a remarkable talk entitled "Education for Eternity"<sup>8</sup> given by then Elder Spencer W. Kimball 40 years ago at an annual faculty conference just like this. Subsequently, as president of the Church, President Kimball explicitly returned to and developed themes in "Education for Eternity" for "The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<sup>9</sup> delivered in 1975 for BYU's centennial, and then again in the charge given to President Holland upon his inauguration in 1980.<sup>10</sup> Taken together, these three visionary discourses span three BYU administrations and 23 years. They constitute a major prophetic pronouncement upon the unfolding dream of BYU.<br><br>So on this, the 40th anniversary of "Education for Eternity," I want to consider our current accomplishments and challenges in light of President Kimball's talks, which articulate dreams that remain ours to fulfill. In doing so I recognize, of course, that we take our direction now from our living prophet and our current board and from the president they have selected. President Kimball himself frequently reminded us of our duty to follow the directions and policies set by the prophet and board if BYU is to fulfill its mission.<sup>11</sup> Nothing I shall say should be interpreted to diminish our duty to look to current prophets or their right to set the course for BYU. This said, I believe President Kimball's call to excellence is consistent with President Hinckley's challenge to "be excellent" and President Samuelson's exposition of our "quest for excellence" this morning. In addition, we can learn much by reflecting on the words of a former prophet who had so much to say about BYU's mission and destiny and whose teachings, coincidentally, are being studied by the Church this year.<br><br>I have put President Kimball's talks on the academic vice president's Web page so that you can read them in their entirety. Today I shall simply cherry-pick a few ideas for consideration, which for purpose of analysis I have organized under three broad areas: students, programs, and faculty.<br><h2><b>Students</b></h2><br><i>A Refining Host for Brilliant Stars</i><br><br>I was not here when "Education for Eternity" was given in 1967, but I have spoken with those who were. The effect was electric. It was as if Elder Kimball lifted the veil on a destiny few had dared even to dream when he launched into the second half of his talk with these words:<br><br><i>In our world, there have risen brilliant stars in drama, music, literature, sculpture, painting, science, and all the graces. For long years I have had a vision of the BYU greatly increasing its already strong position of excellence till the eyes of all the world will be upon us.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>He then proceeded to enumerate at great length the names of notable men and women whom Latter-day Saints ought to emulate. And I use <i>emulate</i> here in its root meaning: "to strive to equal <i>or surpass.</i>" President Kimball believed that Latter-day Saint artists, scholars, statesmen, and scientists ought to outdo those who lack the grand doctrines of the Restoration and whose lives are sometimes unworthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. He said we should seek to emulate, among others, Wagner, Verdi, Bach, Handel, Paganini, and Liszt in music; da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Thorvaldsen in art; Goethe, Shakespeare, and Shaw in letters; Lincoln in statesmanship; and Pasteur, Curie, and Einstein in science. President Kimball's words were so audacious as to seem almost unbelievable. Yet he repeated this extravagant expectation as Church president in his talk "The Second Century of Brigham Young University." He expected "brilliant stars" to arise from BYU. "This university can be the refining host for many such individuals who will touch men and women the world over long after they have left this campus."<sup>13</sup><br><br>As I reread "Education for Eternity" and the now-familiar charge to become a "refining host" for "brilliant stars," it struck me that President Kimball was thinking primarily about the accomplishments of BYU students, not faculty. After all, it is our students whose achievements will bless the world "long after they have left this campus." Likewise, it is our students who make up BYU's orchestras, orchestras that President Kimball predicts will one day rival in quality the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic.<sup>14</sup> This does not mean that President Kimball lacks high expectations for faculty scholarship and creative work, as we shall see. It does mean that he anticipated that BYU's greatest contributions will come through its students.<br><br>This fact can serve as a salutary reminder for us about the fundamental purpose of scholarship at BYU. It is not, and must never be, to satisfy our own vainglory nor to advance our own careers. Nor even is it solely to advance truth and knowledge, though this is a worthy purpose and one specifically endorsed by BYU's institutional objectives. The primary purpose for the Church's large investment in faculty scholarship and creative work at BYU is to enable us to be a refining host for our students. Hence, we must strive for excellence, as President Kimball says, "not in arrogance or pride, but in the spirit of service."<sup>15</sup><br><br>So how are we doing in realizing the dream of becoming a refining host for brilliant stars? I see exciting indicators that we are making progress up the slopes of the "educational Everest"<sup>16</sup> we are supposed to become. For example, BYU is ranked 10th nationally in terms of where new PhDs received their undergraduate degrees. And some subdisciplines are ranked in the top five as undergraduate incubators for new PhDs.<sup>17</sup> Likewise, BYU is one of the top feeder schools for law, medicine, and dentistry, and in every case our students have acceptance rates well above the national average.<sup>18</sup> To be sure, BYU draws upon a very large undergraduate base, which affects these rankings. Still, the figures are impressive and certainly consistent with President Kimball's charge to become a refining host.<br><br>Similarly, our students in the fine arts are finding great early success. Many of you have read that our animation students have won multiple "student Emmys" the past four years running. In addition, students in illustration, music, theater, dance, and communications have been similarly recognized with prestigious national and international awards. The success of our young artists bodes well for the extravagant expectation President Kimball dared to dream 40 years ago. Maybe the dream is not so far-fetched after all. A senior faculty member in music, after listening to a performance by a student orchestra recently, told me that he felt he was witnessing the fulfillment of President Kimball's dream that someday BYU's student ensembles would rival in quality the great orchestras of the world.<br><br>And so it goes for student performance in many colleges across campus. I shall leave it to your deans to brag about student accomplishments in your areas. It is heartening and humbling to receive reports of our students' achievements. The eyes of the world are indeed beginning to rest upon us through them, as President Samuelson discovered when accosted by the president of another university who incredulously asked him if it was true that one of our life-science students had really published in <i>Nature.</i> It was indeed true, said President Samuelson. Moreover, he told a dumbstruck fellow president the student was an undergraduate.<br><br>But we can do better. In order to strengthen our efforts to become a refining host, the university has reorganized and relocated the Preprofessional Advisement Center, developed initiatives to help BYU students compete more successfully for major scholarships, and focused significant resources on mentored learning. This latter program has been remarkably effective in enhancing the quality of undergraduate education. We intend to continue to fund and foster it.<br><br>However, no amount of reorganization or resources will ensure BYU's preeminence as a refining host without your commitment. This dream depends on the quality of your interactions with students. Above all, we need you to continue to look for ways to help your students see their potential and stretch to achieve lofty dreams. When I interviewed our Rhodes candidates this year, they all said that having a faculty member believe in them enough to encourage them to compete was the single-most important factor in their competing. But they also said that had they been encouraged earlier, as were the successful candidates, they might have been more prepared to win. We canand should become even more effective refining hosts and mentors for our students.<br><br><i>Quality Teaching and Learning</i><br><br>President Kimball felt that "the true measure of an institution of learning [is] the impact it makes on the total lives of its students" and that BYU stood preeminent "when measured with the true measuring rod" of greatness.<sup>19</sup> Note that even 40 years ago President Kimball adduced student outcomes as the best measure of success at BYU. He also cautioned BYU to continue to foster quality teaching andlearning:<br><br><i>While the discovery of new knowledge must increase, there must always be a heavy and primary emphasis on . . . quality . . . teaching at BYU. Quality teaching is a tradition never to be abandoned. It includes a quality relationship between faculty and students. . . .</i><br><br><i>We must be certain that the lessons are not only taught but are also absorbed and learned.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>I think about this injunction often. I quoted it to Russ Osguthorpe when giving him his charge as director of the Center for Teaching and Learning. The center is charged to work with faculty to support quality teaching and quality learning in the spirit of President Kimball's injunction. Our students deserve quality teaching in <i>every</i> class! I am troubled when evaluations are consistently low for a course or for a teacher for years and no remedial action is taken. We can do better. We must do better than this.<br><br>In aggregate, it is difficult to know whether our students are being better taught or learning more now than they did 40 years ago. As Derek Bok observed, no one knows whether we are educating students better now than we did in my generation.<sup>21</sup> Despite huge increases in funding for higher education, we simply don't have the data to know if college students are better educated. I am hopeful that our effort to define, measure, and improve student learning outcomes will help us better understand how well our students are learning. More important, I hope that these efforts will help us actually get better. It is not enough to define objectives and collect data. We must close the assessment loop by making data-driven improvements. Let me again encourage you to seize the mandate from Northwest to make meaningful, cost-effective improvements.<br><br>I'm convinced that significant improvements can result from rather simple, low-cost, low-tech strategies like giving frequent feedback. The <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> reported recently on a study by memory researchers that confirmed the not-surprising findings first published in the late 1930s that frequent quizzing greatly increases long-term learning.<sup>22</sup> Measuring what students know not only increases retention but changes what they know. I have found the practice of asking students to write "captures" during the first five minutes of class about the readings, or the last five minutes of class about the lectures, to be a simple but effective learning technique. It not only helps my students learn, it helps me learn what they are learning. I encourage you to do something this semester to improve teaching and learning in your classes.<br><br>John Taylor's prophecy refers to the day when Zion will lead the world "in everything pertaining to <i>learning.</i>"<sup>23</sup> Calling attention to this phrasing, Russ Osguthorpe has suggested that there may be deeper meaning in this prophecy about BYU's destiny as a house of learning than we have heretofore considered.<br><br><i>Dividends Through Service and Dedication</i><b></b><br><br>President Kimball was keenly aware that, given the growth of the Church,<br><br><i>a smaller and smaller percentage of our LDS college-age students will attend BYU. . . . More and more, it will be a privileged group who are able to come here. Those who are blessed to attend BYU have a great responsibility to make certain that the Church's investment in them provides dividends through service and dedication to others as they labor in the Church and in the world. Your challenge is to assure that this investment does bear fruit.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>This continues to be a challenge, albeit one ameliorated for international students somewhat by the emergence of an inspired Perpetual Education Fund program. We have a heavy responsibility to ensure that we are doing the best we can to admit students who will take advantage of the investment the Church is making in them. To this end we have modified our admission process to look more carefully at the personal characteristics of applicants in the hope of not passing over those who promise both to enrich our environment here and to yield the dividends President Kimball refers to after they graduate. Moreover, although the students we admit are indeed "a privileged group,"<sup>25</sup> admission to BYU ought not to favor those from economically privileged backgrounds. Therefore we are augmenting needs-based scholarships to help those most in need of help. The largest scholarship every BYU student receives, however, remains a "tithing scholarship." It is my hope that over time we will foster a spirit of giving back to BYU comparable to the ethic that prevails in the Perpetual Education Fund.<br><br>Given the growth of the Church and the ever-smaller percentage of youth who can attend BYU, we in the central administration feel a heavy responsibility to be judicious about any request for additional resources from the Church. We thus continue to look first internally to meet our needs and ask colleges and departments to do the same, recognizing that even without making requests for new funding, BYU receives generous guideline increases year in and year out amounting to millions in new funds each year. Under President Samuelson's able and frugal leadership, I expect this pattern of internal reallocation tocontinue.<br><h2><b>Programs</b></h2><br><i>Peaks and Planks</i><br><br>President Kimball urged BYU to become an "educational Everest."<sup>26</sup> He felt that, while BYU was a great university, "a much greater one it can yet become!"<sup>27</sup> Such aspirations for BYU to get better coincide with President Hinckley's charge for BYU to be the best it canbe.<br><br>Yet neither then nor now should the need for BYU to grow in stature be confused with a mandate for BYU to grow in size. Even in 1967 there were enrollment caps. President Kimball predicted that these will actually help BYU channel "energy formerly given to growth and expansion" into "making our dreams come true."<sup>28</sup> The same principle holds today. If BYU is to become an educational Everest, it will not be by getting bigger but by getting better. We must do more by doing less.<br><br>The metaphor President Kimball repeatedly used for the painful work of reallocation is that of a ship that must be kept seaworthy by taking out old planks:<br><br><i>The BYU must keep its vessel seaworthy. It must take out all old planks as they decay and put in new and stronger timber in their place. It must sail on and on and on.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>I have used the metaphor of pruning.<sup>30</sup> Whether the metaphor is planks or pruning, BYU must engage in the discipline of ongoing reallocation of resources. "These changes do not happen free of pain, challenge, and adjustment,"<sup>31</sup> President Kimball remarked, commending the university for its efforts to change the academic calendar, manage the curriculum, and realign disciplines.<br><br>I commend you, too, for your efforts to reallocate and focus. During this year and next, the academic side of the house will have reallocated 30 FTEs and about 12 million dollars. This represents very hard work. Thank you! Our colleagues on the support side of the university are doing the same hard work. We are the beneficiaries of six new faculty FTEs that were made available through their belt-tightening. They have done this out of a desire to enhance student learning and in a spirit of consecration. I am profoundly grateful for their sacrifice, as I know you are.<br><br>President Kimball believed that there must be ongoing pruning for BYU to become more fruitful. We are trying to do this at the central level for university-wide programs and institutes. But it is departments and colleges that can best ask and answer questions about whether you have the right focus and the right number of programs. You know best if you are spread too thin or if a degree program is weak. I commend colleges and departments that are asking hard questions in order to get better--such as the College of Life Sciences, whose heroic restructuring the president praised this morning; sociology, which eliminated its PhD to concentrate on undergraduate programs where BYU enjoys greater competitive advantages; education, which has proposed eliminating two doctoral degrees in order to create one much stronger one; management, which is consolidating its centers and institutes to focus on serving students in a targeted way around core college goals; and engineering, which is focusing its work around five imperatives needed to offer world-class engineering programs in the 21st century--to cite only a few examples of many.<br><br>Such work is not "free of pain," but, wisely done, it can produce much good. Limits force us to think seriously about what we do best and where we must do better. They force us to focus, which is the necessary prelude to developing what President Kimball calls "peak[s] of educational excellence"<sup>32</sup> on an educational Everest.<br><br><i>Not an Educational Factory</i><br><br>President Kimball admonished, "We do not want BYU ever to become an educational factory."<sup>33</sup> This is another phrase that frequently comes to my mind as I observe trends at BYU and in the academy generally. The warning seems ever more timely as higher education drifts toward consumerism and commodification. Education is no mere commodity, nor are students merely consumers. President Kimball quoted President McKay, who observed that "a university is not a dictionary, a dispensary, nor is it a department store. It is . . . an exercise in thinking, preparing, and living."<sup>34</sup> Similarly, President Kimball observed that BYU "must concern itself with not only the dispensing of facts but with the preparation of its students to take their place in society as thinking, thoughtful, and sensitive individuals."<sup>35</sup> Unless we approach the assessment movement wisely, seizing it to serve our own mission and aims, we risk introducing a factory mentality into BYU. Let us keep these principles in mind as we assess our programs and teach our students.<br><br>It is difficult to resist a mass production mentality when we must teach so many students. But resist it we must. Elder Ballard forcefully admonished chairs and deans just yesterday to remember in all we do the worth of the individual. Each soul is precious. Somehow we must attend to the one while wealso serve the many. As President Kimball said:<br><br><i>We can do much in excellence and, at the same time, emphasize the large-scale participation of our students, whether it be in athletics or in academic events. We can bless many and give many experience, while, at the same time, we are developing the few select souls who can take us to new heights of attainment.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>Frankly, I do not quite know how to bless the many and the one. I am impressed by faculty who teach large sections well and somehow find a way to connect with struggling individual students. My daughter had such faculty in her introductory physiology and chemistry courses. I know of faculty who teach the masses yet still manage to know students by name and make time to meet with them individually out of class. This is truly commendable, as is the decision by the College of Life Sciences to move from megasection Biology 100 courses to simply very large section courses in an effort to find a scale that balances its need to serve both the many and the one. Again, I don't know how to solve all the problems of scale at BYU, but I'm persuaded that remembering President's Kimball's warning that BYU must never become "an educational factory" will help. We must never forget that education is "not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire."<sup>37</sup> We must never forget the one as we teach the many.<br><h2><b>Faculty</b></h2><br><i>In Pursuit of Excellence</i><br><br>President Kimball held out high expectations for the faculty as scholars, teachers, and citizens. His vision admits no place for mediocrity.<br><br><i>As </i>[LDS]<i> scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br>We must be "bilingual." Religious commitments "do not excuse you from reasonable achievement in your chosen field."<sup>39</sup> In "pursuit of excellence" at BYU, "we must do more than ask the Lord for excellence. Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence."<sup>40</sup> "We must be professional, . . . reaching out to the world of scholars . . . who share our concerns" while remaining "willing to break with the educational establishment" where it has lost its way.<sup>41</sup><br><br>Likewise, as previously noted, faculty must be superb teachers. We should care deeply enough about our students to pray for them daily.<sup>42</sup> As those with dual citizenship in the academy and Church, we should be examples of "individuals who have blended successfully things secular and things spiritual in a way that has brought to you earned respect in both realms."<sup>43</sup> President Kimball spoke pointedly and at great length about our responsibility as citizens to be faithful, devout, and loyal to the Church and its leaders: "Here there should be loyalty at its ultimate best."<sup>44</sup><br><br>You get the point. For President Kimball the dream requires excellence in every area of faculty responsibility. Our written hiring and rank-and-status standards do as well. By policy, the standard for CFS (continuing faculty status) and rank advancement is "high quality" citizenship, teaching, and scholarship. This standard of high quality applies equally to the rank of assistant, associate, and full professor. Yet sometimes we endorse candidates of modest or even dubious quality for essentially lifetime appointments. This does not serve the dream of BYU, nor even conform to stated guidelines. We need to uphold the standard of high quality in all areas if we are to fulfill President Kimball's dream for BYU. And this standard needs to be upheld at the department level.<br><i>Bathed in the Light of the Gospel</i><br><br>President Kimball also challenged "every professor and teacher [to] keep his subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel."<sup>45</sup> This challenge still needs attention. Few of us come to BYU knowing how to fulfill the prime directive issued by Brigham Young to Karl Maeser to teach our subject matters with the Spirit. Graduate school certainly does not prepare us to teach our subjects with the Spirit. It often does not prepare us to teach at all. So where do we learn, and what does it mean, anyway, to teach the alphabet and multiplication tables with the Spirit of God?<br><br>We need to mentor each other in teaching with the Spirit and have more sustained and serious conversations about this fundamental dimension of BYU. To facilitate such conversations, the Faculty Center, under Jim Faulconer's able leadership, will redouble attention to its faith and intellect initiatives. Likewise, we have taken steps to reinvigorate the former "adjunct," now "transfer," religion professor program. It is my experience that teaching religion courses on a college level can have a spillover effect on how one approaches teaching other disciplines.<br><br>Beyond this, however, every faculty member can do at least two simple things urged by President Kimball to fill our classrooms not just with facts but with faith and testimony: (1) We can "teach the gospel . . . by example";<sup>46</sup> (2) We can "grasp the opportunity occasionally to bear formal testimony of the truth"<sup>47</sup> in our classes. I invite all of us, whether we attend Faculty Center seminars on faith and intellect or teach religion classes as transfer faculty, to put into practice this counsel this semester.<br><br><i>No Place for Mercenaries</i><br><br>Finally, let me say something about salaries and sacrifice. President Kimball is clear and direct about faculty salaries: they should be "adequate" but "incidental [to] your grand and magnificent obsession [for] the youth and their growth."<sup>48</sup> "This university is not the place for mercenaries,"<sup>49</sup> he asserted. At the same time he quoted approvingly John Taylor's statement: "Some people say, we cannot afford to pay [teachers]. You cannot afford not to pay them."<sup>50</sup><br><br>We are continuing to monitor and, where possible, make adjustments to faculty salaries--particularly for new and junior faculty in relatively low-paid disciplines, who are hardest hit by the steep rise in housing prices in the valley. We are doing this with targeted internal reallocations that preserve historic differentials from merit decisions.<br><br>Whatever we do regarding salaries, however, we will not entirely keep up with the Joneses in the academic marketplace, especially in the full-professor ranks. Nor should we try. The spirit of sacrifice and consecration must continue to attend our employment at BYU. When I think of the sacrifices made by the founding generation of faculty, who sometimes got paid--if they were paid at all--in turnips, Iam deeply grateful for the generous and stable financial support we receive. I have always felt at BYU that I am paid more than I'm worth to do things I love--like teach and learn. And I am sobered by President Kimball's prophecy that "it will take just as much sacrifice and dedication . . . in the second century of BYU--even more than that required to begin this institution in the first place."<sup>51</sup> For BYU to meet this impending test, we must keep alive the spirit of sacrifice and consecration.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Let me end these remarks by recounting three remarkable visions of BYU. The first is the well-known story of Alfred Kelly, the student commencement speaker who was asked to promote a scheme to sell Upper Campus. Here is a dramatization of his remarkable vision, which altered the destiny of BYU by preserving the land on which we sit--then called Temple Hill--from being sold for a subdivision.<br><br><i>By 1913, a new wave of financial problems was threatening the university's future. BYU faced mounting debt. Faculty salaries were so low the teachers ran farms to survive, returning home to irrigate between classes. Its cornerstone laid in 1907, the Maeser Memorial Building sat silent and unfinished for years. Finally, it seemed, the only way to finance its completion was to divide the land on Temple Hill into housing lots and sell them. A student named Alfred Kelly was selected to promote this idea during a commencement speech, but the assignment troubled him. Early one morning he walked to the top of Temple Hill to pray. What he saw that morning as he looked out across the valley left an unforgettable impression upon all who heard him relate it the day of his address, because what Kelly saw was you.</i><br><br><i>"Gradually the morning light advanced across the valley floor toward the spot where I stood. I closed my eyes partially to the advancing light and was startled by the strange vision that seemed to appear before me. The advancing sunlight took on the appearance of people, thousands of young people who approached me, their arms laden with books. I turned around to find the area behind me illuminated as well. In that light I saw hundreds of buildings, large and beautiful temples of learning. Those young people passed by me and entered in. Then, with cheerfulness and confidence, they turned toward the east and lifted their eyes heavenward, where, again becoming part of the sunlight, they gradually disappeared from my view."</i><br><br><i>Kelly sat down to a stunned silence. Suddenly Jesse Knight leaped to his feet, pledging several thousand dollars to BYU. Others followed suit. Eventually, under the direction of President Joseph F. Smith, the Church assumed the school's remaining debt. Finally, the future of the university had become secure.</i><sup>52</sup><br><br>The Lord evidently had a plan for the ground the campus now occupies--as He always had for BYU. He would not let even its leaders prevent its divine destiny. Such divine intervention on the things that matter most to the Lord is a comfort to me, knowing He can intervene to correct my lapses in judgment or vision.<br><br>Also deeply comforting to me is a less well known but equally dramatic vision that came to President John Taylor during another financial crisis in our early years. Zina Young Williams, the dean of women at the Brigham Young Academy and daughter of Brigham Young, came to President Taylor very distraught because the financial troubles of the school were so severe that they threatened to close it.<br><br><i>After listening to Sister Williams's plea for help, President Taylor took her hand "in a fatherly way" and said:</i><br><br><i>"My dear child, I have something of importance to tell you that I know will make you happy. I have been visited by your father. He came to me in the silence of the night clothed in brightness and with a face beaming with love and confidence told me things of great importance and among others that the school being taught by Brother [Karl G.] Maeser was accepted in the heavens and was a part of the great plan of life and salvation; . . . there was a bright future in store . . . and that Christ himself was directing, and had a care over this school.</i>"<sup>53</sup><br><br>I earnestly hope that BYU today is still accepted in the heavens! It is frankly astonishing to me to think that BYU has a place in the "great plan of life." And it is deeply consoling to learn that Christ Himself has "a care over this school." Gratefully, from time to time I have had sacred personal experiences that have reassured me that heaven still directs this school. These moments of grace have renewed my sense of love and hope for BYU.<br><br>I know many of you have had similar moments of vision and grace. These may have led you here or kindled your love for BYU and hope for its future. Let me share one final such sacred experience. It happened to one of our faculty only weeks ago--again near the Maeser Building, on what seems to be sacred ground. With permission, I quote from a note the president and I received a week ago Friday from an admired faculty colleague:<br><br><i>It is just about 8:30 p.m. on Friday evening. I have enjoyed watching from my office the brief thunderstorm that passed over campus . . . and thought I would write you a short note. I recently met with my department chair and received my letter of appointment. This occasion always makes me feel grateful and introspective about my weaknesses and failings.</i><br><br><i>Not too many weeks ago I was working late and left the Grant Building to walk to my car parked by the former presidents' home. As I left the Grant Building I walked past the Karl G. Maeser statue. It was a beautiful night, and the Maeser Building looked spectacular as it stood on the edge of our campus highlighted by the lights that make it almost glow as a sort of beacon.</i><br><br><i>My wife's great-great-grandparents . . . hosted the Maeser family during their very first months in Utah. Later, my wife's great-grandfather . . . worked on campus and helped build the Maeser Building and initiated student employment on campus. His daughter . . . was one of the first women to receive an MA at BYU. As a result, I always feel a special feeling when I see this building because of her family connection to this place.</i><br><br><i>I do not think there was anyone nearby--it was almost 1:30 a.m.--yet I felt a presence of many people. I do not know what exactly I was experiencing, but there seemed to be other people present. Past students, faculty and staff, or future students? I do not know.</i><br><br><i>As I stopped at that very moment and looked at Karl G. Maeser, I was overcome and began to weep. I felt happy to be at BYU. I know there are many people who could replace me (someday someone will, and they will sit in my office and not even know that I ever sat there), but, for whatever reason, I am at BYU now, and I feel like I need to do better. . . .</i><br><br><i>My heart was full that night, and I feel some of that right now.</i><sup>54</sup><br><br>May all of us be filled with a renewed sense of gratitude to be here and a determination to do better. The lofty dream of BYU provides no occasion for pride or smug self-congratulation--only a clear call to try humbly to be the best we can be. We are indeed blessed to work and teach in a house of dreams. Let us resolve to do our part to put a foundation underneath so that the dreams that have inspired generations may become realities.<sup>55</sup><br><br><i>John S.

<h1> BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to begin our discussion this evening by reviewing a story that we are all very familiar with. It is about a young man who lived in a large city. In many ways it was like the cities we live in today. It was crowded, noisy, and filled with people going about their daily activities of work and play--people who were frustrated and stressed at trying to keep up with the life around them. It was a city filled with temptation. There were many voices crying for his attention--voices that invited him to indulge in selfish desires for things, power, fame, and pleasure; voices that encouraged him to cheat a little here and lie a little there; voices that taunted him to join in because everyone was doing it.<br><br>This young man had many choices to make. He had a family--a family that was probably a lot like many of our families. It was a family that had both strengths and weaknesses. His parents were good people who took seriously their responsibility to teach their children correct principles and desired that their children would follow the Lord. They were parents who probably made mistakes now and then in their attempts to accomplish this. The father was a priesthood leader. He was diligent in fulfilling his responsibilities to his family and to the Church. Some of the children of the family were respectful and obedient. Others wanted to follow their own mind and will--just like in our families.<br><br>This young man was like you young people who are here tonight. He was bright, serious-minded, respectful, diligent, and obedient. He loved his parents and family, and he loved the Lord. He wanted to make the right choices. Like most of you, he listened to his father. But it was hard. And as time went on it became harder and harder. The words of his father separated him from his friends and from the world around him. He wanted and needed to know for himself if the things that his father taught him were true.<br><br>We read in the scriptures how he did that and what happened:<br><br><i>Having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father.</i> [1 Nephi 2:16]<br><br>Faced with life-altering decisions in his life, this young man turned in humility to his Heavenly Father in prayer, and he received an answer to his prayer. This young man's name was Nephi.<br><br>Nephi had a choice to make in his life. It was very much like the choices we all have to make in our lives every day. Even though our world may look very different from his, the influences that were pulling on him were very much like the influences that pull on us. He had to make a choice between the things of the world and the things of the Lord. We have those same kinds of choices. Nephi chose to put his mind and will into the hands of the Lord. He chose to go to the only true source of truth and righteousness in prayer, he chose to listen to the answers the Lord gave him, and he chose to obey. This simple act of prayer not only opened the door to a great life of opportunity and blessings for Nephi, but it also serves as an example to us in our lives today.<br><br>Nephi himself taught in 1 Nephi 19:23 that we should "liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning." And so tonight we are going to talk about the great principle of the gospel that was demonstrated by Nephi. We are going to talk about prayer. We are going to look to the scriptures and to the prophets for understanding. We are going to "liken" these teachings to our own lives.<br><br>As we do so, will you think about prayer in your life and honestly and seriously think about the answers to some questions I am going to ask--such questions as: What should I be praying about in my own life? When and how can I pray? When I pray, do I pray with intensity and faith? Do I feel that my prayers are heard? Do I really believe that the Lord will answer me? Do I understand how the answers to prayers come? Do I recognize and accept the answers, even if they are not what I want them to be? Do I understand what it means to wait patiently on the Lord? Do I pray with real intent, thereby ordering my life according to the answers I receive? Do I go forward and act on the answers I am given?<br><br>Before we answer these questions, let's talk about the principle of prayer. Prayer is simply the process by which we are able to communicate with our Heavenly Father. And it is a two-way communication. Elder Richard G. Scott teaches us that "prayer is a supernal gift of our Father in Heaven to every soul" (in <i>CR,</i> March–April 2007, 5; or "Using the Supernal Gift of Prayer," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 8). No matter who we are, where we are, what our needs are, or what we have done, we are not alone. We have a loving Father in Heaven who has made Himself available to us if we will just turn to Him.<br><br>Prayer does many things. Prayer is one of the ways we can express gratitude. It brings comfort and peace. It is through prayer that we are able to receive a testimony. It helps us to sort out our feelings and thinking as we express our concerns and desires to our Heavenly Father. It can give us specific answers. Our minds can be enlightened because revelation comes through personal prayer. Prayer is where repentance begins, it is through prayer that we can know we have been forgiven, and prayer can help us to forgive ourselves and others. Prayer can help us find direction. It can help us in making decisions.<br><br>We can receive help in very specific ways. It is through prayer that we can find strength, both in spirit and in body. Prayer can provide protection from all sources of harm and evil. We can access every spiritual gift as we ask in sincere prayer. We find answers to all of life's questions as we ask in prayer. I know that there are healing powers in prayer--healing in terms of physical needs and healing of the spirit.<br><br>Prayer involves the individual--you and me--and it also involves the whole Godhead. All three members of the Godhead are involved in this way: When we pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, who is our advocate, answers come from our Heavenly Father by the Holy Ghost. It is through the Holy Ghost that we feel the love ofthe Father and the Son.<br><br>I want you to know that I know that these principles concerning prayer are true. We find these principles taught in the scriptures and in the words of the prophets. I have a personal testimony of the power of prayer because I have experienced many of the blessings of prayer in my own life. But what I really want to talk about tonight is how you feel about prayer in your life--how you are using it to access the powers of heaven. In order to do this, let's go back to those original questions.<br><h2><b>What Do I Need to Pray About?</b></h2><br>The first question is: What do I need to pray about in my own life?<br><br>Think about where you are in your life right now. Do you worry about things? Do you ever feel overwhelmed or confused? I am sure there are challenges and concerns. What are they? In the Book of Mormon, Amulek teaches us some of the things we should pray about. As we read this scripture together, keep track of the specific things mentioned. We are going to read from Alma 34, verses 17–26:<br><br><i>Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</i><br><br><i>Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</i><br><br><i>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</i> [Alma 34:17–26]<br><br>Does this suggest some things that we could pray about? To me it seems to suggest that we need to pray about everything.<br><br>Alma prayed for mercy that he might be saved. He was asking for the Atonement to take effect in his life. He was repenting. He prayed for his family, his possessions, to be a success. He prayed for protection from Satan and temptation. I think that when he was told to pray in his closet and secret places and his wilderness, the Lord wasn't talking about places he could pray--or at least He wasn't only talking about places. I think He was telling Alma to go to the secret places in his heart and in his life and pray for all of his personal struggles and weaknesses.<br><br>If we liken this scripture to our own lives, we can see many things we could pray about. For you this could include such things as your schoolwork, finding a profession, and meeting and finding a worthy and perhaps an eternal companion. What about beginning your families and your homes? What about your health? What about your own personal worthiness? Could it include your personal testimony, your desire to know how you should serve Him, your need to repent, and your need to be strengthened against temptation? Does this suggest praying for the Holy Ghost to guide you in all things?<br><br>When we pray we must be mindful to not just pray for the things we want. We must come to the place where we pray for the things the Lord wants for us. When we do this, we are in essence giving our lives over to Him. We are saying, "I cannot do this by myself. I do not want to do this by myself. I will do it Thy way."<br><h2><b>When and How Can I Pray?</b></h2><br>This leads us to the second question: When and how can I pray?<br><br>We do, of course, have regular prayers that we have all been taught to say--personal prayers in the night and in the morning. We have family prayers and prayers that accompany our gatherings. These are the first prayers we are taught to say. If we are not careful, they can become routine and even rote.<br><br>How many times do we offer a quick morning prayer and then jump up and race out of the door--never giving it another thought? How many times do we fall asleep saying our evening prayers or even skip them all together because we are just so tired? When we consider to whom we are speaking when we pray, how much He has done for us, and how dependent we are upon Him, it gives us pause to think. Taking time to ponder as we pray will give the Spirit opportunity to speak to us.<br><br>Family prayers can be powerful. They can unite family members and strengthen them in times of challenge. They can protect. They can bring comfort and peace. When our children were in the mission field, we would figure out the time difference between our home and the mission and then figure out what time--their time--we would be saying our family prayers at home so that they would know just when we were praying for them. Several of them have said that they felt those prayers and were strengthened by them in very specific ways at the very moment they were needed.<br><br>But we are taught in the scriptures that these formal prayers are not the only way we can approach our Heavenly Father. In Alma 34:27 we read, "Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare."<br><br>We can always have a prayer in our hearts. What does that mean?<br><br>I think it is an attitude of upward reaching from our souls to heaven--to Heavenly Father. It is a fleeting but intense feeling of "Thank you." "Please help me." "What is the right thing for me to do?" "What should I say?" "Iam so sorry." It is the yearning for comfort, strength, and guidance when you are in the midst of a situation. It is the feeling of gladness and joy at something beautiful. It is the recognition of the Holy Ghost operating in your life. It is opening our hearts to continual communication. This kind of praying can be more or less constant as we allow it to be. We control it by our activities, our environment, and the condition of our hearts.<br><br>What are some of the things that can stop this from happening? Loud and constant music, even good music, can just become noise that strangles a prayerful thought before it is ever formed in our minds. Surrounding ourselves with chaos, clutter, and confusion can stifle the Spirit. Becoming too busy and stressed by everyday life can distract our minds from heaven. Allowing ourselves to be in places where we know the Spirit cannot abide will block our prayers. Allowing inappropriate and ugly images to enter our minds through things we see on the Internet, in movies, on television, or in things we read will destroy our connection with heaven. Being angry, irritated, and annoyed by others can close our hearts.<br><br>"But," you might say, "these things are part of our lives every day. How can we avoid them?" I believe that these things can be part of our everyday life if we let them. We are in control--or at least we can be in control.<br><br>It is so important that we each consider ourlives and consider what we must do in order to qualify for the blessings of heaven. We will become aware of how close heaven is if we just reach for it. And the very act of reaching for it can help us put our lives in balance with the things of the Spirit. The closer we are to the Spirit, the more our hearts can be open and flowing to our Father in Heaven. For me, the prayer of the heart keeps me closer to the Lord than anything else I can do. And I can do it any place and any time. It is a lifeline tome.<br><h2><b>Do I Pray with Intensity and Faith?</b></h2><br>Our next question is: When I pray, do I pray with intensity and faith?<br><br>Turn back to Alma 34:17–27. This whole passage of scripture indicates that we need to have both intensity and faith. Notice the words: "<i>exercise</i> your faith," "<i>call</i> upon his holy name," "<i>cry</i> unto him," "<i>pour out</i> your souls," "<i>drawn out</i> in prayer." This is more than just a dutiful prayer offered in a hurry.<br><br>All prayers need to come from deep inside our minds and hearts. How offensive it must be to the Lord--who has offered us so much, who stands ready to give every blessing expedient for our good--for us to hurry through our prayers or sleep through them or have our minds wander or our words be casual and disrespectful, such as using <i>you</i> and <i>your</i> instead of <i>Thee</i> and <i>Thou.</i> How often do we forget Him altogether until we have an urgent need?<br><br>Sometimes our prayers <i>are</i> an urgent plea for help. I remember one such prayer I offered when my then three-year-old son was missing. He had been playing with the other children in our yard. I had taken my eyes off of him only momentarily to check on the baby. But suddenly he was gone.<br><br>Immediately I offered a desperate prayer for help. The thought came into my mind that he was at the swimming pool of an apartment complex about three blocks away.<br><br>Now he had never been to that pool. He had never even been to the apartments. The pool was enclosed in a building and was kept locked at all times. He didn't even know that it was there. But the feeling was strong.<br><br>Running, I called to my 10-year-old son, who was on his bike, to go to the swimming pool as quickly as he could. When he got there he found his little brother and another little boy of the same age who <i>had</i> known about the pool just beginning to wade into the shallow end of the pool. They had all their clothes and shoes on--and even though the door had been open, there was no one else in the area.<br><br>Some prayers are intense, and we need answers right now! Thankfully not all prayers are like that. If we go before the Lord in prayer on a consistent basis, He will be there when we urgently need Him.<br><br>Praying with intensity seems to indicate faith that the prayer can be answered. Faith is simple and childlike for some of us. It may be borne out of love or out of never having had it tried. For most of us faith is something we have to consistently work to have. We might attain great faith through a singular experience, but the next time our faith is tried we seem to have to start all over again in really trusting the Lord. But I promise you that if you pray, believing that Heavenly Father is there, that He loves you, and that He can answer all prayers, your faith will grow and it will become stronger, and you will be able to come to a place in your life where you will know these things are true. Believing is the beginning of faith.<br><h2><b>Do I Really Believe That My Prayers Are Heard and Will Be Answered?</b></h2><br>Next question: Do I really believe that my prayers are heard and that Heavenly Father will answer me?<br><br>Let me tell you about one little boy's prayer. His name is Brayden. He was very young at the time--five or six years old. He had been reading the Book of Mormon with his family. The family would read a few verses each day and then have family prayer.<br><br>One day they read the words in Moroni 10:4:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>It was Brayden's turn to pray that day. He began his prayer in the same usual way, using the same usual words, but then he said something different. He said, "Heavenly Father, is the Book of Mormon true?" Then he paused.<br><br>He paused for so long that his father glanced over at him to see if he needed help in finishing his prayer. But he didn't need any help. He finished by saying simply, "Thanks, Heavenly Father," and closed his prayer. The Spirit entered that home and bore witness to the whole family of the truthfulness of the scriptures. His prayer was one of simple, beautiful faith.<br><br>You are a child of God, just as is Brayden. You are of great worth to Him. He has commanded us repeatedly in the scriptures to "pray always." He has provided the Atonement to bring us back home. Why would He not answer your prayers? He will. I promise He will! But maybe it's not the Lord that we are questioning. Maybe it's our own worthiness we question. Maybe it's our lack of understanding of how God answers our prayers that makes us question.<br><br>In order to better understand and answer how Heavenly Father answers our prayers, let us join this question with the next three questions, which are:<br><br>"Do I understand how the answers to prayers come?"<br><br>"Do I recognize and accept answers, even if they are not what I want them to be?"<br><br>"Do I understand what it means to wait patiently on the Lord?"<br><br>When we qualify ourselves through personal worthiness, Heavenly Father always answers our prayers. Please note the word <i>qualify.</i> We have to be trying hard to be worthy of the Lord's blessings.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee said:<br><br><i>If you want the blessing, don't just kneel down and pray about it. Prepare yourselves in every conceivable way you can in order to make yourselves worthy to receive the blessing you seek.</i> [<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 244]<br><br>We have to be close to the Spirit to know what to pray for and to be able to discern His answers. But this does not mean we have to be perfect or anywhere near it in order to pray and get answers. This is because prayer is one of the ways we are able to repent and one of the ways we are able to become perfected.<br><br>Heavenly Father not only answers our prayers; He always answers them in the way that will bless us eternally. This is a principle that is absolutely true. But there are many ways our prayers may be answered. He may say yes. He may say no. He may say not now. Sometimes we may feel that He is not answering us at all because we are not able to discern the answer. We have to trust in the Lord and trust His timing. We need to learn to recognize the answers when they come.<br><br>Some answers come bit by bit in order to strengthen our faith. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>We cannot force spiritual things. It must be so. Ourlife's purpose to obtain experience and to develop faith would be frustrated if our Heavenly Father enlightened us immediately on every question or directed us in every act.</i> [<i>The Lord's Way</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1991), 36]<br><br>Some answers have already been given us, and the Lord is trusting us to act on them. Sometimes we are asking between two equally good things and the Lord is giving us a chance to use our God-given power of agency.<br><br>Perhaps in our urgent desire to receive a specific answer to a prayer we are unwilling to put our lives in the hands of the Lord and accept the answer we are given. We want what we want, and we want it now!<br><br>Maybe our problem lies in not recognizing how answers come. We are aware that some prayers are answered in spectacular ways, such as Joseph Smith's First Vision, but most often answers come in more quiet ways. In Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 we read about two ways the Lord answers our prayers:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i><br><br>The first way mentioned is in our minds. These answers come through the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost as thoughts, ideas--knowledge. These may be flashes of inspiration that we recognize immediately, or they may be ideas that we have to work through and that develop over time. They are usually accompanied by a good feeling.<br><br>The second way mentioned is in our hearts. This has to do more with our feelings. We may have negative, confused feelings to warn us that the answer is no. Or the feelings may be sweet, peaceful, reassuring, and comforting. These feelings mean that the answer is yes. These feelings are sometimes likened to a burning sensation that is intense, or the feeling may be very subtle.<br><br>The key principles here are that we have been commanded to pray to our Heavenly Father. He hears every prayer. He will answer our prayers for our best good. When we know this deep in our hearts, we won't get discouraged and turn away from Him. When the answers are not recognizable immediately, we will remain faithful and constant--continually praying to discover His ways. The Spirit can help us, and we will learn to discern how the answers come and what the answers are. It can be different for every person, and it can even be different in each experience we have. I know that as we qualify ourselves to have the Holy Ghost with us constantly, we will be able to more clearly see and understand the answers to our prayers.<br><h2><b>Do I Go Forward and Act?</b></h2><br>The last question is: Do I order my life according to the answers to my prayers that Ireceive? Do I go forward and act?<br><br>I know that the Lord hears and answers prayers. But I also believe that if we continually pray and then refuse to listen and follow, He will not be as accessible to us in the future. In Doctrine and Covenants 101:7–8 we read:<br><br><i>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</i><br><br><i>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</i><br><br>When we receive answers from the Lord, we have to move forward in trust and confidence. I don't think it makes Him happy when we continually seek for another answer when we have already received one. We need to remember what He has given us and act upon it in faith.<br><h2><b>Do I Ever Feel Like I Do Not Want to Pray?</b></h2><br>Now, if you will forgive me, I want to ask one more question: Do you ever feel like you do not <i>want</i> to pray?<br><br>In 2 Nephi 32:8 we read:<br><br><i>For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</i><br><br>President Brigham Young taught: "It matters not whether you or I feel like praying, when the time comes to pray, <i>pray.</i> If we do not feel like it, we should pray till we <i>do"</i> (<i>JD</i> 13:155; emphasis in original).<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, you are at a beginning place in your lives. It is a new school year, a time for new experiences, new relationships--maybe eternal relationships. You are starting your lives in many ways. You have many important decisions ahead of you. Concerning these decisions, Heavenly Father expects a lot from us. He expects us to do all we can do--to think, to work, to stretch our capacity. But if we are willing to do it His way, placing our lives in His hands, it will be so much easier. And we will get it right.<br><br>In the Bible Dictionary we learn:<br><br><i>The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.</i> [Bible Dictionary, s.v. "prayer," 753]<br><br>All we have to do is humbly turn to Him and ask--and then listen and obey. Put simply, life just does not have to be as hard as we sometimes make it. In 3 Nephi 18:18–20 we read:<br><br><i>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may siftyou as wheat.</i><br><br><i>Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</i><br><br><i>And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</i><br><br>Let us follow the example of Nephi. Let us turn to our Father in Heaven in humble prayer. Let us receive the blessings untold that He has reserved just for us and for our families.<br><br>I know that God lives! Jesus Christ lives! They know each of us. They love each of us. They wait for us. May we be quick to respond by turning to Them in humble prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl C.

<h1>the Constitution - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is marvelous to be with you in the early days of this exciting new semester. You have been in school here long enough to have a sense of the heavy burden your class schedule really is, and yet you still have enough time to keep up and be fully prepared for your first set of examinations and papers for the semester. To all of you we both say, "Welcome!"<br><br>Some are with us for the first time, some of you are hoping you can finally finish your degree this semester or this academic year, and some of you have returned from missions or other necessary absences. Whatever your circumstances, we are pleased that you are here and hope you fully understand that there are many disappointed students at other institutions who would gladly exchange places with you. BYU is truly a wonderful place, and we expect and pray that your appropriate hopes and aspirations will be advanced during your sojourn with us.<br><br>As we begin a new semester, we are also sobered by the tragic loss of Camille Cleverley and David Anderson. Our love and condolences go out to their families, friends, and associates. Likewise, we must always remember that in the face of generally happy times, many of our community and their families are suffering with great difficulties and disappointments. Let us never forget our duties to each other and the tender mercies available to all through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Today is a special day in our history. Sharon and I were together literally halfway around the world in Australia six years ago today. We were glad to be together then and are glad to be together today with you. The events of 9/11/2001 have caused most of us to reflect on things of great importance that perhaps we too often take for granted. In some important ways our lives on that day changed forever. In this we continue to mourn for those whose lives were lost and also for their families. Likewise, we will continue to celebrate and remember the many acts of sacrifice, heroism, and service that were attached to the tragic events of that fateful day six years ago.<br><br>At BYU we might well call this the Year of the Constitution. Our incoming freshmen have each been asked to read a book on the Constitution. While I would be happier if Linda R. Monk's book had been entitled <i>Some of the Words We Live By</i> rather than her title of <i>The Words We Live By,</i> we nevertheless endorse your reading of it and other works that educate us about the Constitution of this special land. We, of course, also choose to live by the scriptures and by the words of our inspired prophet leaders as well.<br><br>In our forum assemblies this fall semester we will hear from the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, the U.S. Senate majority leader, and Nathaniel Philbrick, who is a remarkable writer of and expert on our early history. Sister Samuelson was a history major and has some thoughts on these topics that she will share, intersected by some observations and suggestions that I will make. We do not consider ourselves to be constitutional experts, nor do we expect that you will see us as such either. We do love this nation, its Constitution, and its place in and with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b>SGS:</b> As my husband mentioned, we were in Australia on 9/11. We were attending a mission presidents' seminar, and most of the attendees were U.S. citizens. When word was received of the tragedy, the thoughts of everyone there turned first to their own families and then to the many people from all over the world at Ground Zero; the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.; and that hallowed field in Pennsylvania. The schedule of the meetings we were attending was modified, and everyone attempted first to check on the safety of loved ones and then gathered around television sets to watch the events of the day unfold.<br><br>Through the miracle of the Internet and the ingenuity of one of the Area Office personnel, we were able to hear the quickly arranged special broadcast from the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. The music of the Tabernacle Choir was soothing, and the remarks and assurances from President Hinckley were comforting to us all.<br><br>Because it would have been impossible to travel home immediately, even had we wished to do so, we were able to complete the seminar and then spend a delightful day in the beautiful city of Sydney. We enjoyed the sights we visited but were especially touched by the people we saw. We observed long rows of Australians lining up before their public buildings to sign condolence books for their American friends and loved ones. We saw hastily crafted signs placed in store windows expressing sympathy for those who had suffered or lost their lives, and we saw people connecting with each other in loving, remarkable, and, we thought, atypical ways. Total strangers were courteous and expressed sentiments of compassion and concern to each other.<br><br>On our flight from Sydney to San Francisco several days later, we saw people not previously acquainted connecting with one another in sensitivity and kindness. The tragedy had identified for almost everyone an increased appreciation for each other and for the land of America. Seemingly this had nothing to do with politics or even nationality, but it had much to do with appreciation for the blessings of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (see Declaration of Independence) we experience and too often underappreciate.<br><br>During our time together today we hope to reflect with you on the miracles, opportunities, and achievements that have been made possible by the Constitution as well as by the inspired people and blessed circumstances that led to its emergence during the birth of this nation more than two centuries ago.<br><br>Last fall we had the privilege of hearing from David McCullough in a forum assembly. For those not able to hear him, and even those who did, we recommend his wonderful book <i>1776.</i> Likewise, some of our own Church leaders like President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.; President Marion G. Romney; President James E. Faust; and Elder Dallin H. Oaks have written and spoken with great insight on the remarkable Constitution.<br><br>Elder Oaks, for example, has taught how unlikely the "miracle" of the Constitution really was. It was not then, or ever before, fully accepted that the independent 13 states would voluntarily cede many of their tightly held prerogatives to a national government for the good of the country as a whole. Nor was the process of achieving the Constitution easy or straightforward. In 1781 the Articles of Confederation were adopted by the colonies. In reality, only a "weak 'league of friendship' [was] established by [this document]" (Dallin H. Oaks, "The Divinely Inspired Constitution," <i>Ensign,</i> February 1992, 68; see also the Ninth Annual Cache Valley Commemoration of the Signing of the United States Constitution, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, 17 September 2000). The colonies were deeply divided, and the national Congress was powerless to deal with their problems.<br><br>James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were young statesmen who promoted a conference to consider amendments to the Articles of Confederation. They actually favored a much stronger central government but recognized that they would be met with great resistance from some quarters. They convinced George Washington to participate. He had some reluctance, but his influence allowed the process to begin. (See Oaks, "Divinely Inspired," 69.)<br><br>The delegates who attended the conference--keeping in mind that some were delayed from arriving for weeks and others did not come at all--deliberated in secret for almost two months before settling some of the most vexing issues. Our time does not allow detailing all that transpired, but the many acts of sacrifice for the common good by the delegates representing the diverse states form a vital part of the fabric of this nation that might not be as well appreciated as it should be.<br><br>Even when the Constitution was finally drafted, it is important to realize that not all votes on the various articles were unanimous. Often the debate was heated and even acrimonious before appropriate compromise and closure were achieved. And this was only the beginning.<br><br>By the terms of the newly drafted Constitution, the document could not be ineffect until it had been ratified by constitutional conventions in at least nine states. Because in reality it was a compromise document, there was considerable opposition, especially in the major states of New York and Virginia. Elder Oaks has pointed out that while there were 74 appointed delegates, only 55 participated in the Philadelphia Convention, and only 39 of these signed the completed document. It took nine months for nine states to ratify, and it was still a month later before New York, by a vote of 30 to 27, finally ratified the Constitution. Even then it happened only with the promise that a bill of rights would be written. The first 10 amendments, or the Bill of Rights, were ratified more than three years later. (See Oaks, "Divinely Inspired,"70; see also Linda R. Monk, <i>The Words We Live By: Your Annotated Guide to the Constitution</i> [New York: Hyperion, 2003].)<br><br><b>COS:</b> For Latter-day Saints, the Constitution of the United States is considered an inspired document. Of course people of other faiths also love and respect the Constitution and confess the hand of Deity in its crafting and adoption. For us, however, we have the advantage of the word of the Lord in modern revelation to give us additional insights. Let me cite an example.<br><br>During the early years of the Church, some of the Saints were in Missouri and were suffering great persecution. As the Prophet Joseph Smith laid the matter before the Lord, a revelation was given that is now section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants. After candidly explaining that at least part of the trouble had been brought upon the Mormon people as a "consequence of their transgressions" (D&amp;amp;C 101:2), the Lord then gave comfort, promises, counsel, and assurances.<br><br>In D&amp;amp;C 101:76–79 we read that they were instructed "to importune for redress" or relief from the leaders of government in their area. It was explained that the laws needed to "be maintained for the rights and protection of all [people]," that the principle of "moral agency" and accountability should apply to everyone, and that "it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another." After this preamble the Lord then made this significant declaration:<br><br><i>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, andredeemed the land by the shedding of blood.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 101:80]<br><br>I believe this section of scripture is clearly focused on the U.S. Constitution, and yet it apparently asserts that the Constitution of this single land was designed and should be maintained for all and everyone without geographic limitations or restrictions. How could that be?<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave this wonderful insight and clarification. Said he:<br><br><i>The United States Constitution was the first written constitution in the world. It has served Americans well, enhancing freedom and prosperity during the changed conditions of more than two hundred years. Frequently copied, it has become the United States' most important export. After two centuries, every nation in the world except six have adopted written constitutions, and the U.S. Constitution was a model for all of them. Nowonder modern revelation says that God established the U.S. Constitution and that it "should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles." (D&amp;amp;C 101:77.)</i> [Oaks, "Divinely Inspired," 68; see "The Constitution," <i>Wilson Quarterly,</i> spring 1987, 97, 126]<br><br>A large number of you have traveled widely around the world and recognize that many nations and peoples may not currently enjoy the blessings, freedoms, and protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Nevertheless, as Elder Oaks observed, this inspired document has been a major influence for good in providing for the people in many lands an increased understanding of what we regard as God's gifts to His children. We can appropriately hope and pray that the Constitution's influence for good will increase throughout the world as well as in the United States. In the meantime, our experience in Australia might be better understood in the light of the Constitution's international influence.<br><br><b>SGS:</b> Like many of you, my husband and I have lived abroad and have traveled in and through many countries. We have been asked on occasion, quite understandably, why the Restoration of the gospel occurred in the United States and not in Europe, Asia, Africa, or elsewhere. This is a good question. A partial answer might be that in 1830 there was perhaps no other place on earth where conditions--including the inspired Constitution, laws, and protections--were such that the work and the gathering necessary for the establishment of the Church could occur. Afuller understanding can be obtained from the Book of Mormon.<br><br>We all remember the central theme and account of the initial pages of the Book of Mormon. Father Lehi was commanded by the Lord to leave Jerusalem with his family and a few others because of the sinful conditions there. They were instructed that if they were obedient and faithful, they would be led to a land of promise--which turned out to be the case. Further, they were, like others who might come to this land, led by the Lord to be here for His special purposes. (See 2 Nephi 1:1–6.)<br><br>Let's now turn to Lehi's account:<br><br><i>Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he</i> [meaning the Lord] <i>shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</i> [2 Nephi 1:7]<br><br>That is quite a promise and an impressive responsibility for those who have been brought to this land, whether by themselves or by ancestors from several generations preceding their births.<br><br>One of the remarkable blessings of this land for those who can be judged as righteous by the Lord is that it will be a nation of liberty and freedom. In spite of the persecution and unfair treatment that the Prophet Joseph Smith experienced from the time of the First Vision until his death, he understood and appreciated the central role of the Constitution of the United States in insuring these prospects.<br><br>In the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple in 1836, the Prophet included these inspired words:<br><br><i>Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 109:54]<br><br>Hopefully we will join our prayers and our efforts continually to make this so.<br><br>At the time the Church was organized in 1830, the Constitution and Bill of Rights were scarcely 40 years old, and yet they were absolutely necessary for the Restoration to take place because, even in the face of the inconsistencies, frequent unfairness, and limitations of American society, the laws and freedoms by then codified allowed the Restoration of the gospel to begin. Think what might have been the result if there had not been freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly expressly guaranteed. While not everyone in the 1830s necessarily believed fully in the freedom of religion, it nevertheless was and is the law of the land. While not perfect, sufficient protection for the work to progress was available in this new nation and perhaps not possible anyplace else in the world.<br><br><b>COS:</b> While the Prophet Joseph loved the Constitution and realized its inspiration, benefits, and blessings, he was also aware of its limitations. These are his words:<br><br><i>It is one of the first principles of my life, and one that I have cultivated from my childhood, having been taught it by my father, to allow every one the liberty of conscience. I am the greatest advocate of the Constitution of the United States there is on the earth. In my feelings I am always ready to die for the protection of the weak and oppressed in their just rights. The only fault I find with the Constitution is, it is not broad enough to cover the whole ground.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 326]<br><br>On occasion we hear of disputes between interested parties as to what is actually required of us who believe in the inspiration and interest of heaven in the crafting of this document. Must we accept that it is the only or final word on every matter of law? Must we support the assertions of some that it has the same authority as scripture? This is Elder Oaks' observation on these questions:<br><br><i>Personally, I have never considered it necessary to defend every line of the Constitution as scriptural. For example, I find nothing scriptural in the compromise on slavery or</i> [other less significant details]. <i>President J. Reuben Clark . . . said that it was not part of his belief or the doctrine of the Church that the Constitution was a "fully grown document." "On the contrary," he said</i> [continuing to quote from President Clark], <i>"we believe it must grow and develop to meet the changing needs of an advancing world."</i> [Oaks, "Divinely Inspired," 70; J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "Constitutional Government: Our Birthright Threatened," <i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i> 5, no. 6 (1 January 1939): 177, quoted in Martin B. Hickman, "J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: The Constitution and the Great Fundamentals," in Ray C. Hillam, ed., <i>"By the Hands of Wise Men": Essays on the U.S. Constitution</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1979), 53]<br><br>Both President Clark and Elder Oaks highlight their views that we should see divine inspiration in the "great fundamentals" of the Constitution without the need to parse or quibble over every word (Clark, "Constitutional Government," 177). Likewise, I suppose that each of us in our study of the Constitution might come up with a slightly different list of the "great fundamentals." Let me briefly detail the five Elder Oaks has mentioned in "The Divinely Inspired Constitution":<br><br>1. The separation of powers in the three branches of government<br><br>2. The division of powers between the states and the federal government<br><br>3. The Bill of Rights<br><br>4. The principle of popular sovereignty<br><br>5. The rule of law and not of men<br><br>In the interest of both time and my limited expertise, I will not say more about these five "great fundamentals" directly, but I would ask that you consider not only studying the words of prophet-scholars like Presidents Clark, Romney, and Faust and Elder Oaks but also that you try to identify great fundamentals yourselves as you read, study, and discuss the Constitution.<br><br>I mention this because I think there is a great temptation to speak somewhat authoritatively about this remarkable document while not really knowing its particulars. For example, we may take offense when one is critical of the Book of Mormon without first carefully studying it and praying about it. We don't want to be guilty of similar inconsistency with respect to our Constitution.<br><br>We live in an age where much is made about the "right of privacy." The Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights do not mention privacy specifically, although some people suggest that they do. The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution states that "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." Thus, while in the eyes of some the right of privacy has been granted by the courts, if not the Constitution, the basic issue of what really constitutes privacy has not been fully addressed. In our concluding moments today, we would like you to consider with us two or three privacy concepts that have particular and critical application to those of us gathered together atBYU.<br><br>We use this as an example of why we would have preferred Linda Monk's textbook to be entitled <i>Some of the Words We Live By.</i> We are grateful to be able to study the Constitution with the illuminating lens of the restored gospel at BYU.<br><br><b>SGS:</b> First, in a real sense, the idea that anything is completely private or secret is largely illusionary. Increasingly, we hope, we are becoming aware that such things as our cell-phone conversations, our e-mail communications, and the like are easily intercepted or accessed by individuals or audiences not intended nor having legitimate reasons for having them. This is particularly true with information placed, for example, on the Internet, in chat rooms, on personal pages, or other sites. In addition, we are videotaped at ATM machines, in stores, airports, and other public places mainly for our safety and security.<br><br>All of you have likely had the experience of telling an important secret to just one friend. Our written and electronic communications are often "discoverable" in legal proceedings, and you will be able to think of other examples very quickly.<br><br>While our understanding of the true nature of God causes us to see and experience Him in ways that differ from other religious traditions, we hold in common with many the belief that our Heavenly Father is all-knowing and all-seeing. Thus our beliefs about privacy or secrecy, however tightly and strongly held, have only to do with other human beings. There is nothing hidden from heaven. While we respect the mortal privacy of others and highly value our own, we recognize in today's world that there are really very few, if any, secrets on which we can fully depend. Thus our integrity and loyalty to basic principles must govern our lives even when we believe we are not on stage.<br><br>Here at BYU and elsewhere, we should think and talk about the relationships of our dearly held personal rights and freedoms on the one hand with the necessary public behaviors mandated by laws, customs, and common courtesy on the other. We do so because these various manifestations of regulated behavior are important and significant components of free and orderly societies. We emphasize and teach our BYU Honor Code, for example, with great intensity and seriousness. Think about driving on our city streets and freeways without some semblance of order. Think about the increased chaos we would experience in our classrooms if everyone were to speak at once. How would it be to play football without a line of scrimmage or to sing in a choir without someone in authority setting the pitch or signaling the key? All of these and countless other public behaviors such as covering our mouth when we cough or giving up our seat to an elderly or infirm person have grown out of the need to develop cultures and civilizations that function to the benefit of all.<br><br>What an inspired document the Constitution is that helps achieve such a balance between the interests of the individual and the security of the society.<br><br><b>COS:</b> The divinely influenced Constitution may not address any of these details directly, but it does provide the basis for living together harmoniously in a safe environment that is highly respectful of both the individual and society. Among its protections are freedoms we deem to be essential for our personal progress and for the work of the Lord. We express our gratitude for this wonderful document and our testimony that God did guide those who prepared and drafted it "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118), even though it may contain some of the "imperfections" of men (Mormon 9:31). Like the provisions for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution does provide the mechanisms for clarification and improvement over time.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father bless you to have a heightened understanding of the tremendous impact for good that the United States Constitution has in the lives of each of us. Please take advantage of the unique opportunity we will all have this year to learn, understand, and appreciate it more.<br><br>As I add my testimony to what Sister Samuelson has said and my encouragement and blessing as well, let me also suggest in the spirit of what we have mentioned about privacy that what we do when we are not aware that anyone is watching is vital to our progress and who we are. Remember the injunction from Proverbs 23:7: "For as [a man or a woman] thinketh in his heart, so is he."<br><br>We hope you will study seriously and with great effort both the Constitution and your other course work. More important, in all that you expect of yourselves, be sure that you do not neglect your private and personal prayers, your scripture study, or your appropriate acts of anonymous service as well as the public manifestations you make of your devotion to God and country. May this be a goal for all of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when he and his wife, Sharon G. Samuelson, gave this devotional on 11 September 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>to the Faith - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, you have done it again. This is the 10th year that you have done so, and I congratulate you most warmly. I speak of the Princeton Review rankings, where you have come in first out of 366 colleges. You are the most "stone-cold sober" student body in America.<br><br>How proud you ought to feel about this designation--no smoking, no drinking, no drugs. You are living up to the Honor Code of this institution. You will be blessed for doing so.<br><br>Why would anyone on this campus, where education is heavily subsidized by the Church, have any desire to do anything less?<br><br>It is a remarkable thing that on any given Sunday this magnificent physical plant becomes a vast Church campus. Thousands of young people, scriptures in hand, are to be seen hurrying to classrooms and lecture halls that become places of religious instruction. Idonot know where else in all this world there is a similar thing of such magnitude.<br><br>Now, yesterday's <i>Wall Street Journal</i> published the rankings of university business schools, and BYU came in number one in the regional rankings among all the business schools of America (see "Recruiters' Top Schools," Journal Report on Business Schools: The Recruiters' Picks [special section], <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> 17 September 2007, R5).<br><br>What a unique institution this is. Coupled with its associates in Hawaii and Idaho, it is a leader both academically and spiritually. How fortunate you are in the opportunity to attend here. Many others wish to come here but are unable to do so.<br><br>The magnificent physical plant, together with a great faculty, makes it an academic jewel. But the end product of all of this, of course, is you--you thousands of aspiring young scholars.<br><br>I agree that it is a grinding experience to earn a degree here. But the result is something of which you can be extremely proud.<br><br>The by-product of your academic achievement will be a bundle of ethical, moral, and spiritual values. These are summarized in our thirteenth article of faith: "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>This is a short and simple statement, but its implications are enormous.<br><h2><b>We believe in being honest.</b></h2><br>We cannot cheat. We cannot do anything of a dishonest nature. We make a pledge with ourselves to be scrupulously honest in all that we do. This is not always easy.<br><br>In matters of honesty, there are no shortcuts--no little white lies or big black lies. There is only the simple, honest truth spoken in total candor. And I think there is nothing more honest than good, hard work.<br><br>I recently read a book titled <i>No Shortcuts to the Top.</i> It is the story of Ed Viesturs. Ed has climbed Mount Everest six times and has reached the summits of the world's highest mountains without the use of supplemental oxygen. When asked how he did it, he said, "It is just hard, hard work." To accomplish his feat, Ed actually had to climb one mountain twice. The first time, he was forced to turn back just a short distance from the top and did not feel that he could honestly claim the summit.<br><br>An article in a recent issue of <i>Fortune</i> magazine indicated that we<br><br><i>will achieve greatness only through an enormous amount of hard work over many years. ... The good news is that</i> [our] <i>lack of a natural gift is irrelevant--talent has little or nothing to do with greatness....</i><br><br><i>... Nobody is great without work.</i> [Geoffrey Colvin, "What It Takes to Be Great," <i>Fortune</i> 154, no. 9 (30 October 2006): 88]<br><br>Years ago there was a merchandising institution that carried as its motto "Honesty isthe best policy." In recent years we have seen a veritable parade of business executives who have broken this trust with their dishonest acts and have been sent to prison.<br><h2><b>We believe in being true.</b></h2><br>This is different than honesty. It means that we stand tall, look the world straight in the eye, and march forward. It means that we are true to the faith of our fathers. In the words of Evan Stephens:<br><br><i>Shall the youth of Zion falter</i><br><br><i>In defending truth and right?</i><br><br><i>While the enemy assaileth,</i><br><br><i>Shall we shrink or shun the fight? No!</i><br><br><i>True to the faith that our parents have cherished,</i><br><br><i>True to the truth for which martyrs have perished,</i><br><br><i>To God's command, Soul, heart, and hand,</i><br><br><i>Faithful and true we will ever stand.</i><br><br>["True to the Faith," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 254]<br><br>I have mentioned before the experience of my youth when my brother and I would sleep outside during the summertime. We would lie down in the bed of a big farm wagon and gaze into the heavens. The whole sky seemed to move--all but the North Star, which remained in its permanent and predictable place.<br><br>It was a thing of stability in a world of shifting values. It became an expression of a desire to pattern one's life after the Polar Star, this astronomical wonder, to be true and dependable--true to God, true to self, and true to fellowman.<br><br>William Shakespeare said: "To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man" (<i>Hamlet,</i> act 1, scene 3, lines 78–80).<br><h2><b>We believe in being chaste.</b></h2><br>I observed a very interesting thing the other day. In Salt Lake City, early on a Saturday morning, the Key Bank building was brought down with a series of well-placed detonations. It all happened in three or four seconds, with a great cloud of dust that rolled to the northwest. The process is called an implosion, in contrast with an explosion.<br><br>The building was constructed nearly 30 years ago. I suppose construction extended over a period of at least a year, maybe two. Now it was gone in seconds.<br><br>That, my friends, is the story of so many lives. We nurture them ever so carefully over a period of years. Then we find ourselves in highly charged circumstances. Mistakes are made. Chastity is compromised. There is an implosion, and a ball of dust is all that is left.<br><br>I was reminded of this when I recalled a young man and a young woman who came to my office. He was a handsome boy and she was a beautiful girl. They were university students. Their future looked bright and beautiful. But they gave in to temptation. Now they were going to have a baby. Their dreams of the future literally collapsed. They would be married. He would work at a low-paying job with the meager skills that he had.<br><br>Tears filled their eyes as they talked with me. But there was no escape from the reality that faced them. Their lives had suffered an implosion, and a tower of dreams had come tumbling down.<br><br>Do not let this happen to you. Do not sell yourself short by compromising your commitment to morality. You are, each one of you, children of a divine Father in Heaven. You were created after His design in the image of your Creator. Your body is sacred. It is the temple of your spirit. Do not defile it with sin.<br><br>Now, hearkening back to the illustration of the tower that collapsed, I remind you that in its place will be constructed a new and beautiful building. Similarly, those who have transgressed can turn to their Redeemer, our Savior Jesus Christ, and, through the power of His Atonement, be made clean and new again. The Lord has said, "Be faithful ...; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>Understand that you are being chased. Satan is chasing after you, and you had better run as fast as ever you can.<br><h2><b>We believe in being benevolent.</b></h2><br>What does this mean? It means that we are kind, thoughtful, reaching out to those in need at all times. The word literally means that we are doing good. The very word, derived from the Latin <i>bene,</i> denotes reaching out to those in distress and need and assisting them in any way possible.<br><br>We believe in being benevolent as individuals. The Center on Wealth and Philanthropy has ranked Utah at or near the top in terms of charitable giving (Second Annual Survey by Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy, 16 November 2006).<br><br>We believe in being benevolent as a church.Our humanitarian efforts reach across the earth--most of which are devoted to the assistance of those who are not members of the Church. Never forget that it is through the benevolent and faithful donations of tithe payers around the world that your education is subsidized at this university. How grateful we all should be, and how liberal in giving we should be according to our ability.<br><h2><b>We believe in being virtuous.</b></h2><br>This may have nothing whatever to do with sexual morality; that is covered by the word <i>chaste.</i> Virtuous, in this case, I believe, means having strength--the strength to do whatever needs doing. Great virtue comes in doing well and consistently the everyday, often rather tedious tasks of life. Blaise Pascal said that "the strength of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special exertions, but by his habitual acts" (<i>Pensées</i> [1670]).<br><br>Your virtue will be attained through deliberate practice of those things that bring strength and purity to your life--such things as prayer; consistent study of the scriptures; timely payment of your financial obligations, especially an honest tithe; careful adherence to the law of health, which we call the Word of Wisdom; and faithful observance of all the commandments of God. These and other goodly practices performed on a habitual basis will yield great virtue.<br><h2><b>We believe in doing good to all men.</b></h2><br>This is no easy thing. It requires mercy, self-discipline, and determination. The Lord has told us that we must even reach out in forgiveness and love to those who despitefully use us. All men deserve our respect.<br><br>A story is told of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who served as both a judge and the mayor of Nauvoo. He was confronted with the case of Anthony, a man of African descent and a former slave. Anthony was accused of a rather serious violation of the law. When Joseph confronted Anthony, he pleaded for mercy, indicating that he needed the money from his illicit activities to purchase the freedom of his child, who was still living in slavery. Joseph expressed his sympathy for Anthony's plight but insisted that the law must be observed and that a fine would have to be imposed.<br><br>The next day, in a sincere effort to do good to his fellowman, Joseph gave Anthony a fine horse that he could use to buy the child's freedom.<br><br>God is no respecter of persons. All are deserving of our consideration. Love and mercy must be the foundation principles of ourrelationships.<br><br>Have you ever heard of Dr. Norman Borlaug? Relatively few have, although he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Recently, at the age of 93, he was given the Congressional Gold Medal.<br><br>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> recently carried an editorial on him, but I have not seen his name in any other publication. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> pays him this remarkable compliment: "He has arguably saved more lives than anyone in history. Maybe one billion" ("Borlaug's Revolution," <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> 17 July 2007, A16).<br><br>Think of that for a moment. Then unroll the scroll inscribed with the names of the great benefactors of mankind.<br><br>Dr. Borlaug first came to notice when in 1944 Mexico was in the throes of a famine. Stem rust, a fungus, was devastating the cropland. The doomsayers, of whom there are always many, predicted starvation.<br><br>But Dr. Borlaug rolled up his sleeves and went to work. He developed a new strain of rust-resistant wheat. He worked on fertilizers and irrigation. A miracle happened. The harvest became so great that farmers began to market their wheat internationally.<br><br>He then turned his attention to Pakistan and India. In China, the Philippines, and Indonesia he did for rice what he had done for wheat in Mexico. He is one of the great pioneer scientists of our time, largely unknown and unsung.<br><br>I have never met him. I suppose I never will. The only things I know about him are what I have included after reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s brief editorial. But with that meager knowledge, I salute him and honor him. The whole world is in his debt.<br><br>Now, my brothers and sisters, there it is. I am now in my 98th year. I have been around a very long time. I have seen much of life, its triumphs and its failures. I am convinced that there are more triumphs than failures.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph wrote a remarkable statement when he penned those few words that make up the thirteenth article of faith. As we ponder them, reflect on them, thoughtfully and carefully consider them, they will become guideposts of our lives. If we do so, we shall be better people. Life will be challenging but more interesting, and the blessings of the Lord will come upon us, for we shall be doing what He would have us do.<br><br>I congratulate you on your presence here on this beautiful campus. Many others would wish to be here, but they have not been accepted. How fortunate you are, and how much we appreciate you and love you.<br><br>I am told that you are honoring Karl G. Maeser as part of Homecoming Week. He pioneered the establishment of this institution. But for the generosity of one or two men, this institution would have failed. I have said before that my father, Bryant S. Hinckley, came here as a very young man and studied under the direction of Dr. Maeser. He later taught here, and this has strengthened my affinity for this great institution. Since Dr. Maeser's presidency there has been a long line of dedicated presidents, culminating in the presidency of Dr. Cecil O. Samuelson, who is doing a remarkable work and in whom we as trustees have every confidence.<br><br>May the blessings of heaven attend all of you is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was president of The Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was delivered on 18 September 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>tract with BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, like me, you have undoubtedly noted the caliber of the devotional and forum speakers this semester. It may never again be equaled. From the introduction just read, you also know that I am not a prominent Church leader, a university president, a U.S. senator, a Supreme Court justice, or an astronaut. I will therefore request your prayers that what I say might be of interest and of value.<br><br>Several years ago our son Spencer was interviewing with prospective employers as he prepared to graduate from BYU with a degree in finance.<br><br>One large company invited him to Chicago for additional "in-house" interviews, meetings, and social gatherings. Spencer was joined by a cohort of qualified candidates from other fine academic institutions from across the country. It soon became clear, however, that from this process only a few positions would be offered.<br><br>Several other recruits whose flights had arrived at the same time, one of whom was Hispanic, joined Spencer on the ride from the airport to corporate headquarters. Because he had served a mission to Venezuela, Spencer engaged this new friend in conversation in her native Spanish, much to the surprise of the other passengers. As days passed, the group learned that the guy from BYU refused alcohol at dinner, was married, had been a missionary, and preferred to retire comparatively early. Although he was friendly and amusing, compared to the cohorts, he was definitely different.<br><br>On the last day of the visit, the group was given a hypothetical situation that required each person to prepare a presentation arguing for a specific corporate program. Spencer was assigned to argue that the corporation should donate funds to a local low-income, home-building project. Although little time was given to prepare, Spencer's presentation began: "A wise man once said that no other success can compensate for failure in the home." The company representatives were intrigued. They leaned closer and became attentive; they had never heard such profound counsel before. Spencer continued to expound gospel-centered principles about the importance of the home to society as he argued for the contribution. Ultimately Spencer got the job offer. Why? Because he was different--in a good way.<br><br>Experiences like Spencer's are not unique. They are repeated over and over as faithful graduates leave BYU to make their mark on the world. They happen because you are extraordinary.<br><br>The Apostle Peter taught:<br><br><i>Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Consider the ways in which you are unique. You have made sacred covenants with the Lord to keep His commandments. In exchange you have been promised the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. Many of you have sacrificed--or will sacrifice--your time and resources to represent the Lord as His emissary in the mission field. You may have learned a new language, been exposed to a different culture, and learned to love and serve in a profound way. You attend a university that believes learning happens best when it includes the influence of the Spirit. You agreed to abide by a university honor code, which suggests that you are a person of integrity. You have the priesthood and/or accept callings in your ward or stake. In so doing you act as the lay ministry in the Church and develop skills of leadership, teaching, organization, and service. In addition to university counselors, you have access to Church leaders who can provide you with help and guidance in times of trouble or indecision. Finally, you know where you came from, why you are here, and where you are going.<br><br>Yes, you are a peculiar people. In fact, your education is deemed so important that the board of trustees has determined that the vast majority of the funds necessary to maintain BYU and provide you with a degree should come from the tithing funds of the Church. You are, in effect, all on scholarship. Such a funding decision is not inconsequential, as these resources could otherwise be put to use to bless the lives of Church members throughout the world, including many living in relative poverty. Such a unique arrangement implies a contract of sorts between the university and its students. After all, the scriptures teach that "unto whom much is given much is required."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Years ago I served as elders quorum president in our California ward. One of my responsibilities was to home teach Helen Royston, a convert to the Church and one of the widows in our ward. She was barely five feet tall, and I imagine she didn't weigh 100 pounds. For as long as I can remember, Helen faithfully taught Primary, including classes with some of my own children. Her home was modest, and it always seemed to be filled with an impossible number of visitors who were in need of a refuge or just down on their luck. Helen made her living working in a laundry. I often wondered how such a little, older lady could withstand such difficult work. I calculated that during her career she must have steam pressed literally millions of articles of clothing.<br><br>During ward council meeting one Sunday, we were considering an expenditure that was on the borderline between necessary and extravagant. After some discussion our wise bishop said, "Remember, we are spending Helen Royston's tithing." That resolved the issue. I have never forgotten that council meeting. Since that day, each time I hear the story of the widow's mite I think of Sister Royston. It guides me today in my role as the chief financial officer of this university. How amazing it is that funds considered sacred are made available for your education and benefit.<br><br>It is equally interesting to consider the generosity of numerous donors who have contributed to enhance your education through new facilities, mentored learning, scholarships, and other endowments. Some of these donors are wealthy. Many are not. Regardless of financial situation, each has made a freewill offering to bless your life. I consider these offerings as sacred as the widow's mite, for they were made voluntarily and were not compelled or demanded. As you walk across campus you might consider the library addition, the Student Athlete Building, the N. Eldon Tanner Building, Miller Field, the Joseph F. Smith Building, the Indoor Practice Facility, the Museum of Art, LaVell Edwards Stadium, the Monte L. Bean Museum, the Marriott Center, and the newly completed Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center. All were built from donor contributions. The same is true of the Tanner Building addition, which is under construction, and the BYU Broadcasting Building, which is in the planning phase.<br><br>These contributions were and are made by friends who love BYU, and they love you. Truly the Lord is watching over this place. His spirit has also moved to bring individuals here as faculty and staff to build up this institution.<br><br>In 1952 Ben Lewis, BYU administrative vice president, was intent on establishing a food services program on campus. The postwar boom had dramatically increased the size of the university community, and the need was great. To help find a manager of dining services, Brother Lewis decided to personally visit the restaurants in town to determine which had the best food.<br><br>In the end he concluded that the best food was in a restaurant belonging to Wells and Myrle Cloward. It was located inside the Regal Lanes Bowling Alley, where FatCats now stands. Brother Lewis approached the Clowards about coming to work for BYU, but they turned the offer down. It had taken years of hard work to build up their business, and it was starting to pay off.<br><br>Again Brother Lewis unsuccessfully approached the Clowards. Then late one evening a fire broke out in the bowling alley. By the time anyone could respond, the building was destroyed. When Brother Lewis heard the news, he exclaimed: "My prayers have been answered!" In later life Brother Lewis noted that he hadn't prayed specifically for a fire, nor set the one that consumed the bowling alley, but he knew he needed help in getting the Clowards to come to BYU. Soon thereafter Wells and Myrle Cloward accepted Ben Lewis' offer and came to work for BYU.<br><br>Beginning with a small cafeteria in the basement of the original Joseph Smith Building, the Cloward family worked together serving students. With humble beginnings and continual progress, they established what would become one of the largest and most successful university food service programs in the nation.<br><br>The experience of the Clowards is emblematic of the many faculty and support personnel who have decided to serve at BYU, even though more financially rewarding and supposedly prestigious opportunities are available elsewhere. Our faculty and staff are among the most talented individuals in their fields. Many are nationally and even internationally known experts.<br><br>Earlier this year Dining Services determined to fund a new faculty position. They reasoned that, aside from serving good food, providing an additional faculty position would be the most direct way they could bless the lives of our students. How would they do it? With the next available retirement of a Dining Services employee, the position would not be refilled. Instead they would redistribute the work of the retiring employee among the remaining department personnel. Each person would be asked to pick up part of the load, and the savings would be contributed to fund the faculty position.<br><br>At the annual university conference in August, it was announced that Professor Gary Burlingame, a faculty member in the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences, would be the first occupant of the Wells and Myrle Cloward Teaching and Learning Fellowship provided by Dining Services. In addition, since January, six more teaching and learning fellowships have been provided by BYU Financial Services, Human Resources, and the Office of Information Technology--bringing the total number of positions to seven.<br><br>Why did they do it? Why did they voluntarily commit to sacrifice on your behalf? Because they love you.<br><br>Up to this point we have focused on what others have done for you. Let's turn our attention, for a moment, to what you can do to fulfill your part of the contract.<br><br>First, be grateful for the gift you have been given.<br><br>The late President James E. Faust taught:<br><br><i>A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression of humility. It is a foundation for the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and well-being.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/12/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a><br><br>Occasionally I am required to address a grievance from a person who feels he or she has been mistreated. Most often the situation is a misunderstanding that can easily be cleared up. However, I have sometimes been surprised by individuals who display an attitude of entitlement. Likewise, I believe that BYU customers are occasionally surprised by an unkind service provider. This is not the BYU way. All individuals within the BYU community should live by the admonition of the Apostle Peter, who said:<br><br><i>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature. ...</i><br><br><i>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</i><br><br><i>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</i><br><br><i>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Such is the appropriate attitude for a body of Latter-day Saints. Be quick to express appreciation and to use the two most powerful words in the English language: "Thank you."<br><br>Second, take full advantage of your opportunity to attend BYU.<br><br>Once, when I was serving in a California bishopric, I attended a meeting of the deacons quorum where the adviser was giving a lesson on the importance of education. He explained that he had attended BYU and had been required to earn money for his education by baling hay during the summer.<br><br>Although tuition then was less than $300 per semester, the wage for baling hay was only about $2 per hour, which translated to around two cents per bale. After the hay was baled, fall semester began. One day he walked across campus to attend a class. When he got to the door there was a sign posted that read "Class Canceled." His classmates, upon reading the sign, were gleeful and celebrated as they walked away from the building. (I must confess that my reaction might have been the same.) Suddenly the thought occurred to him: "I've been cheated." The wheels in his head began to turn. "I hefted and stacked 70 bales of hay to attend that class today. I want my money back!" The deacons' eyes got big. They had never considered stacking so many bales of hay for so little. More important, they had never pondered the proposition that someone could relish the opportunity for learning.<br><br>Surveys completed by graduated BYU students indicate that most enjoyed their BYU experience and would make the same choice again. A minority, however, expressed disappointment with their BYU experience. Not surprisingly, those who expressed disappointment often indicated that they did not attend devotionals, ward services, and activities; did not connect with a faculty mentor; and were not positively influenced by religion classes. The Lord revealed a powerful principle to the Prophet Joseph when He said: "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?"<sup>5</sup> Make a commitment to attend devotionals and forums. With the possible exception of this one, they are outstanding. To the extent you are able, attend a lecture outside your major, join a club, provide service, be active in your ward, take a campus job, and attend a performance or a game. Get involved.<br><br>Several years ago one of my sons signed up for the most difficult and advanced BYU math class his prerequisites would allow.<br><br>I asked him, "Is that class required for your degree?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Won't taking it hurt your GPA?"<br><br>"Probably."<br><br>"Well, then, why are you taking it?"<br><br>He replied, "Because it interests me and I will never have this opportunity again."<br><br>When I saw his textbook, filled with the longest equations I had ever seen, I thought, "He's doomed." The class was graded on a straight curve, and, not unexpectedly, his gradewas among those in the lower half of theclass.<br><br>Months later, when I asked him about his experience, he said, "It was gnarly. But I'm glad I took that class because I understand things I never did before."<br><br>Now I have to add in here that we recently talked to that son--he is a graduate student on the East Coast--and he mentioned that he had just set the curve on his graduate mathematics test. I couldn't help but think back to his BYU experience. "Weren't you wise to take that class that was beyond your capacity?" I asked.<br><br>Third, be the kind of person you said you were when you requested admission to BYU.<br><br>In your application you were asked to sign a written commitment that you understood and would abide by the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards. You said you would be honest; live a chaste and virtuous life; obey the law; use clean language; respect others; abstain from alcohol, drugs, tobacco, coffee, and tea; encourage others to comply with their commitment; and participate regularly inchurch services if you are LDS.<br><br>As some of my nonmember friends would say: "What in the world were you thinking?"<br><br>Hopefully you were thinking, "That's where I would like to learn. Those are the kind of people I would like to associate with."<br><br>In large measure, you live up to those standards. You are who you said you were. I congratulate you. Your behavior invites the Spirit to abide on this campus. Because of you, countless visitors have remarked, "There is a different feeling here. What is it about your students and people?"<br><br>The same standards you are asked to follow as students apply to faculty, staff, and administrators. There is no double standard. And, as far as I can tell, none of us is compelled to be here.<br><br>It is interesting that some will come to BYU, ignore their commitment, and then appear surprised when the university must take action. "You mean you were serious?" they ask quizzically. Others, apparently, take it as a challenge to push the envelope of appropriate dress and grooming or to criticize the leaders and doctrines of the Church.<br><br>In the end, living up to the standards we all promised is a matter of personal integrity. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin has taught, "Personal integrity implies such trustworthiness and incorruptibility that we are incapable of being false to a trust or covenant."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>6</sup></a><br><br>In the year 2000, for family reasons, I decided to leave my position as a partner at Arthur Andersen, a large international audit, tax, and consulting firm. A good friend suggested I come to BYU and meet with President Merrill J. Bateman. I did so, and within a few months I was employed here. Three months after my departure, one of Andersen's largest clients, Enron, collapsed in a financial scandal, and the Andersen personnel who worked on that account were charged with fraud and obstruction of justice. The accused individuals and the firm were ultimately convicted, and within a matter of weeks of that conviction, Andersen had been fired by virtually all of its clients. The firm literally ceased to exist. Overnight more than 50,000 people were out of a job and the firm partners had lost their capital. The Andersen personnel who worked on the Enron account incorrectly thought that their responsibility was to dispense advice on sophisticated and ambiguous financial transactions. They forgot that their real responsibility was to protect the public interest and to act with integrity.<br><br>You might think I'm telling you this story todemonstrate divine intervention on my behalf or to illustrate the principle that "timing is everything." Actually, I mention it to persuade you that, along with your testimony, your integrity may be the most important thing you possess.<br><br>Arthur Andersen, the person, was born in 1885, the son of Norwegian immigrants. He was orphaned at 16 and by 23 became the youngest CPA in the state of Illinois and a member of the faculty at Northwestern University. At 28 he opened his own firm, dedicated to the principle of absolute integrity, which he demonstrated time and time again through the Roaring Twenties, the stock market collapse of 1929, the Great Depression, and postwar recovery.<br><br>In my own experience, the people I knew in that firm followed Andersen's example of integrity, including many faithful Latter-day Saints. A small handful of their coworkers, however, managed to tarnish the good name of their founder and the reputation of many thousands of their colleagues.<br><br>Those whose reputations were sullied must have felt like Alma the Younger did when he chastised Corianton: "Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words."<sup>7</sup><br><br>I might add, "And would not allow you to practice accountancy in any state."<br><br>At BYU we make hypocrites of ourselves if we do not behave the way we say we believe.<br><br>Clearly the standard for us is high. At times we will fail and fall short and have the need to make things right.<br><br>A few years ago my daughters were visiting a neighbor couple making a treat. Emma, then six, managed to spill an entire carton of milk on the floor. There was an awkward moment of silence as the group surveyed the damage. Then Emma spoke up: "Everyone makes mistakes." She was right. We all make mistakes. None of us is without sin--no, not one. Thankfully we can look to the Savior to balance the equation of justice and mercy on our behalf.<br><br>Fourth and last, stop to lift a fellow student.<br><br>College has been described as the most selfish time of your life. This is because it is the time when we focus on our own betterment. We gain knowledge, prepare for a career, participate in extracurricular activities, socialize extensively, and possibly find a mate. These are certainly worthwhile endeavors.<br><br>In the midst of your comings and goings, however, you will meet others who are struggling physically or academically. Some are just trying to fit in or are feeling lonesome or depressed. The next time you are preparing to leave your apartment for an event, consider who you could invite along. Missionaries are taught that part of their responsibility is to "invite all to come unto Christ."<sup>8</sup> Surely if all are worthy of an invitation to come unto Christ, they are worthy of an invitation to join a study group or to come to a dance. Let our campus be an inclusive community, not an exclusive fraternity.<br><br>Sister Bonnie Parkin, then Relief Society general president, gave a wonderful devotional address here earlier this year.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bonnie-d-parkin_personal-ministry-sacred-precious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a> She encouraged each student to consider a personal ministry of service. Afterward I began to think seriously about Sister Parkin's message. I considered the many times that President Thomas S. Monson has described visiting the sick, the aged, the troubled, or the dying. It occurred to me that he was, in effect, teaching us the same message.<br><br>When I discussed this concept with one of my sisters who had been a student here in the 1960s, she mentioned that she had a roommate at BYU named Carolyn who had had a personal goal to make a new friend in each of her classes. At the beginning of the semester, Carolyn would survey each classroom and choose someone she could make her friend. During the remainder of the term, Carolyn would take the time to become acquainted and get together. Her classmate would eventually become part of her circle of friends. I wonder whether any of those befriended by Carolyn during those years would today confess that she was one of the few friends they had during college.<br><br>May I invite you to consider a personal ministry of invitation and inclusion? Look around you and the Spirit will instruct you on who to include and invite. When you feel the prompting of the Spirit, obey it! This kindness will bless your life and enrich your BYU experience in countless ways.<br><br>When I was a child, my high school–age older sisters were involved in after-school activities, and both of my parents worked. I was shy and did not like attending Primary, which was held on Wednesday afternoons in those days. I shall always be grateful to LaRae Reynolds, the ward Primary president, who lived just a few houses away. When it came time to leave for Primary, I would hide in the backyard beneath a tree or bush. Sister Reynolds would come looking for me and not give up until I was found and taken to Primary, where I belonged. I suppose I could have come up with a better place to hide, but, you see, I really wanted to be found. Most people want to be found.<br><br>May God bless you, my brothers and sisters, to be grateful, to take full advantage of your BYU opportunity, to be the kind of person we believe you are, and to invite and include those around you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brian Evans was chief financial officer and administrative vice president at BYU when this devotional address was given on 16 October 2007.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 1 Peter 2:9.<br><br>2.

<h1>t Plan of Our God - L. Tom Perry - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the book of Luke we find great multitudes following after the Savior to hear His teachings. We read from Luke 14:<br><br><i>And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</i><br><br><i>For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</i><br><br><i>Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</i><br><br><i>Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. . . .</i><br><br><i>So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</i> [Luke 14:27–30, 33]<br><br>I'm afraid that I find too many are leaving much of life's experience just to chance, without adequate planning and preparation. Surprisingly, I find when I ask many of you students what your major is, often I receive the answer "I haven't decided yet. I'm just filling in general education requirements. I will make that decision later."<br><br>I found a good example in a comic strip in a recent Sunday paper. Dennis and his playmates are gathered around.<br><br>One speaks: "Let's pretend I'm the teacher and you're the students!"<br><br>Dennis replies, "That's a stretch."<br><br>The teacher responds, "Let's all draw a picture of what we want to be when we grow up! Okay, who's first?"<br><br>The first one speaks: "I'm gonna be a fireman!"<br><br>The second one says, "Soccer player!"<br><br>The third: "Ballerina, of course!"<br><br>Then they ask, "Okay, Dennis, what about you?"<br><br>"I don't even know what I'm gonna be for Halloween," he responds. (Hank Ketcham's <i>Dennis the Menace,</i> 21 October 2007.)<br><br>If you want the extreme example of planning, you must turn to the scriptures. See how carefully the Lord has laid out His plan to guide His children to their eternal destiny. Perhaps the example of His careful planning would motivate us to give more energy to spending sufficient time to plan what we want to accomplish in our lives.<br><br>The Lord introduced to Moses His great planning process for His children. He declared: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). His great plan, which included the atoning sacrifice, was to give immortality to all mankind. Through the gift and power of the priesthood, those who would adhere and follow His plan would receive life eternal, the greatest gift God can give to His children.<br><br>In 2 Nephi 9:13, Nephi declared, "O how great the plan of our God!" In Moses 6:62 we read, "And now, behold, I say unto you: This is the plan of salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time."<br><br>As we follow the course of scriptures, we find abundant reference to the Lord's plan that will be accomplished for His children here on earth. A history of the process of following that plan certainly testifies of its completeness and consistency.<br><br>In Moses 4:1 we read of a great council in heaven being held in which Satan came forward.<br><br><i>And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give methine honor.</i><br><br>But that was not the Lord's plan. "But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, saidunto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2). The Savior declared the Lord's plan, and we had the right of accepting that plan and thus being privileged to experience mortality.<br><br>As we follow the history of man's sojourn on earth, you must be impressed with how carefully the Lord has planned for His children during the time that they would have this mortal experience. The periods of time in which the Lord has instructed His children with His gospel plan have been divided into dispensations.<br><br><i>A gospel dispensation is a period of time inwhich the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation.</i> [<i>Guide to the Scriptures,</i> s.v. "dispensation," online at lds.org under Scriptures]<br><br>As I review the dispensations of time, to me each has a special lesson that we can include in our plan as we prepare for our ultimate destiny.<br><br><b>The first dispensation began with Adam.</b> The Lord created man and woman and placed them on earth and gave them opportunities to choose. They were commanded to not partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil, for they were told they would surely be cast out of the garden if they would partake. But that would give them the right of having mortality. They selected of the fruit.<br><br>The Fall was not a disaster. It wasn't a mistake or an accident. It was a deliberate part of the Lord's plan of salvation. We were to be sent to earth to become the offspring of the Lord, innocent of Adam's transgression. Yet our Father's plan subjected us to temptation and misery in a fallen world as a price to comprehend authentic joy. Without tasting the bitter, we'd never be able to understand the sweet. We required mortality's discipline and refinement for the next step of our development to become more like our Father. He was going to guide us through this experience by foreordaining prophets who would come to earth to testify of our Savior and His divine plan and His mission.<br><br>Adam was the first of these prophets with his wife, Eve. They heard the voice of the Lord and initiated the pattern for the dispensations that would follow. Of that momentous event it is recorded:<br><br><i>And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name ofGod, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again inthe flesh I shall see God.</i> [Moses 5:10]<br><br>Adam was the first to preside over a dispensation. He was called the father of all living. Adam stands as one of the noblest and greatest of all men. He received the priesthood and was appointed head of the human family. From him we have the beginning of mortal life. Doctrine and Covenants 78:16 tells us:<br><br><i>Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life.</i><br><br>What does this first dispensation teach us? That all men and women are the literal spiritual offspring of our Heavenly Father. They are born into mortality; they receive physical and mortal bodies. These bodies are created in the image of God, as the book of Genesis tells us:<br><br><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</i><br><br><i>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</i> [Genesis 1:27–28]<br><br>We are promised if we receive the necessary ordinances, keep the covenants, and obey God's commandments, we will enter into exaltation and become more like Him. Psalm 8 gives a little vision of our potential. It states:<br><br><i>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. . . .</i><br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? andthe son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory andhonour.</i><br><br><i>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:</i><br><br><i>All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</i><br><br><i>The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</i><br><br><i>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</i> [Psalm 8:1, 3–9]<br><br>Then, in 3 Nephi 27:27, we are given our charge: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<br><br>In this first dispensation we learn that we are sons and daughters of an Eternal Father and have the right to communicate with Him through prayer and receive answers through inspiration and revelation. Included in our life's plan should be constant and regular communication with the Father of all.<br><br><b>The second dispensation is known as that of Enoch.</b> The Bible states that Enoch walked with God. He established the city of Zion, which became a powerful symbol of righteousness that can be obtained on earth as well as in heaven. Genesis 5:24 declares, "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him."<br><br><b>Next in line we have the dispensation of Noah.</b> He lived in times of great wickedness. He cried to the people to repent, but his words were not heeded. The failure to heed the cries of Noah caused a great flood to come upon the hearers who would not harken, and only Noah and his family were saved. Thus Noah followed Adam in becoming the father of allliving.<br><br>The second and third dispensations teach us great lessons of the results that come from the practice of choosing good over evil. Enoch and all who were with him marked the second generation. They were blessed mightily as a result of their righteousness.<br><br>In the third dispensation, the people who would not follow Noah found that destruction follows the sinner. One of my favorite parts of the scriptures has always been King Benjamin gathering the people together to hear his voice as he realized that he was now an old man and would soon pass on through the veil. He wanted the people to hear him and listen to his words as final instructions from their beloved king. Some of the words that he spoke are recorded in the book of Mosiah, chapter 2:<br><br><i>I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service ofyour fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you. . . .</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</i><br><br><i>And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</i><br><br><i>And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved--</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples. . . .</i><br><br><i>O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</i> [Mosiah 2:17, 22, 34–37, 40]<br><br>The gift of agency is like fire. If properly controlled, it becomes the agency of life. If improperly used, it becomes the agency of death. To choose right will bring exaltation. We literally become sons and daughters of God and enjoy the fulness of His kingdom. If our agency is improperly used, we will be denied the blessings of exaltation.<br><br>Alma declared in Alma 5:40: "For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil." Thus these two dispensations teach us to seek after that which is good and wholesome. In our plan for life, certainly our objective will be to absorb as much of the good as we can possibly find on this earth. Search the scriptures daily. They will lead you to life eternal.<br><br><b>The next dispensation was that of Abraham.</b> Few characters were as prominent in the scriptures as was Abraham. Like Adam, Enoch, and Noah, his divine commission came through the Lord, who declared to Abraham:<br><br><i>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;</i><br><br><i>And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father;</i><br><br><i>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee (that is, in thy Priesthood) and in thy seed (that is, thy Priesthood), for I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee (that is to say, the literal seed, or the seed of the body) shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.</i> [Abraham 2:3, 9–11]<br><br>Latter-day Saints are a covenant people--<i>covenant</i> meaning a binding and firm agreement between two or more people. In the case of Latter-day Saints, a covenant means an agreement with the Lord in which we are promised many blessings by Him on condition that we commit ourselves to be obedient to His laws and commandments. Our plan of life should include always living worthy by making and keeping our covenants. Always live worthy of holding a current temple recommend.<br><br><b>Following Abraham, we have Moses.</b> He was one of the mightiest men who ever lived. He walked and talked with God. He was chosen by God to lead and deliver Israel from the bondage of Egypt. He was privileged to receive for mankind the great law contained in the Ten Commandments. Moses was taught leadership by the Lord in a most effective lesson.<br><br>Leadership requires balance in our lives. President Hinckley has given us the priorities we should have in allocating and balancing our time to achieve the greatest success (see Gordon B. Hinckley, "Rejoicing in the Privilege to Serve," <i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</i> 21 June 2003 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003], 22–23).<br><br>Our <i>first</i> priority would be time for our families.<br><br><i>Second,</i> "By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102).<br><br><i>Third</i> is the opportunity to serve in the building of our Father in Heaven's kingdom.<br><br>And the <i>fourth</i> was most interesting to me. He said to make time for yourself, time to study, and time to meditate, plan, and prepare. Every person needs that time to prepare himself to accomplish the things that he wants to accomplish.<br><br>The dispensation of Moses teaches us and prepares us, by following his example, to follow prophetic leadership and to develop ourselves to be more effective tools in building our Father in Heaven's kingdom here on earth.<br><br><b>Of course the greatest dispensation of all is the meridian of time.</b> Jesus Christ is the central figure in our doctrine as well as in the doctrine of all Christians' faith. He was more than just sinless, good, and loving. He was more than just a teacher. He ministered on earth as a man, though He was the Son of God. He died, was buried, and rose on the third day to make the atoning sacrifice for all mankind so that death would not hold a permanent power. Because of that act all would rejoice and enjoy immortality. Alma declared:<br><br><i>Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.</i><br><br><i>The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</i><br><br><i>And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets--</i><br><br><i>And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.</i> [Alma 40:22–25]<br><br>What did the Savior teach us?<br><br><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</i><br><br><i>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</i><br><br><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</i> [Matthew 5:14–16]<br><br>You are the light of the world. You have been blessed to receive His gospel. Let your light so shine that others may see your good works and be attracted to learning more of God's eternal plan for us.<br><br>Fundamentally, then, we are knowledgeable of the Lord's words as they have been given to us through the ages from His holy prophets. They have guided us into a plan the Lord has established for us. That plan is complete from the beginning of time until we have an opportunity, if we live worthy, to live with Him in the eternities to come.<br><br>To me, the messages of past dispensations remind us that we are sons and daughters of an eternal Father in Heaven. We are privileged to communicate with Him and to receive inspiration and guidance for our earthly probation. The second and third dispensations encourage us to seek after the good and refrain from that which is evil. From the next dispensation we learn that we can bind the Lord in solemn covenant to provide us with the eternal blessings promised us according to our worthiness. The Mosaic dispensation teaches us the principles of leadership that benefit us as we make our way through this mortal experience.<br><br>The dispensation of the meridian of time has the promise of immortality and eternal life through the gift of our Lord and Savior. The Lord will never leave His kingdom without a lawgiver, a leader to direct the affairs of His Church on earth.<br><br>For this reason, this is the dispensation of the fulness of times in which God has set up His kingdom, which is to be an everlasting kingdom and have no end. Our generation, the generation of the fulness of times, has the benefit of all previous dispensations on which we can build our lives as we understand God's dealings with His children here on earth. We are living in the remarkable age of the dispensation of the fulness of times when the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in its fulness.<br><br>You are children of promise. I hope that you do not plan to be just common but plan to excel. There is no place in this world for mediocrity; we need to strive for perfection. You can obtain perfection in so many areas as you seek and work toward the goals you have established. You have a rich heritage; do not be afraid to think and act according to gospel principles and enjoy its blessings as you fulfill on earth the full measure of your creation as a child of God.<br><br>I hope today as you leave this devotional assembly that you will spend more time looking at yourself. God bless you that you may have the desire to go forward and seek your own salvation under this great plan the Lord has given to us. Remember the wonderful promise from Mosiah 2:41:<br><br><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i><br><br>I testify to you in the name of the resurrected Redeemer that God has spoken from the heavens in this age of the world and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. Joseph Smith was a prophet of the most high and received the revelations of God for the benefit of mankind, and the keys of the dispensation of the fulness of times were delivered to him. God grant that we may gain our witness and testimony of the great work in which we are engaged as we prepare and plan for our future here in mortality is my humble prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>ts for Life&#039;s Journey - Thomas S. Monson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My young brothers and sisters, what a glorious sight you are. It is an honor and a privilege for me to be here with you. My responsibility today is great, for I realize that your time is valuable, your talents are many, and your future is bright. Earnestly I seek heavenly help in responding to this challenge.<br><br>I suppose every one of us in this congregation has had a few "heart-stoppers" in his or her life. I know that I have. Before going forward with my general theme, I might mention one or two of them.<br><br>This past general conference marked 44 years since I was called to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in October of 1963. A few days following that conference, I met with my colleagues for the first time in the fourth-floor room of the Salt Lake Temple. Everything was so new to me. We were to partake of the sacrament that day. As we prepared to receive it, President David O. McKay said, "Before we partake of the bread and water, I would like to invite our newest member, Brother Monson, to instruct the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve on the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. We will hear from you now, Brother Monson." That was a heart-stopper for me.<br><br>At the conclusion of the meeting, we moved to the lunchroom reserved for the First Presidency and the Twelve, where we were to eat. As we sat around the table, President McKay said, "Brother Monson, do you believe that William Shakespeare really wrote the sonnets attributed to him?"<br><br>"Yes," I responded, "I do, President McKay."<br><br>He then exclaimed, "Wonderful! So do I; so do I."<br><br>I thought to myself, "I hope he moves away from Shakespeare." I was a business major.<br><br>However, he turned again to me and said, "Brother Monson, do you read Shakespeare?"<br><br>I said, "Occasionally."<br><br>"Fine," he said. "What is your favorite work of Shakespeare?"<br><br>I thought quickly--perhaps more a desperate prayer than a reasoned thought--and replied, "<i>Henry the Eighth.</i>"<br><br>"Which is your favorite passage?" he asked.<br><br>I had a heart-stopping situation right there. Then I thought of Cardinal Wolsey, that man who served his king but neglected his God. I recited to President McKay what Cardinal Wolsey lamented when he was shorn of all his power:<br><br><i>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</i><br><br><i>I served my king, he would not in mine age</i><br><br><i>Have left me naked to mine enemies.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>President McKay said, "Oh, I love that passage, too." Then he changed the subject, forwhich I shall be eternally grateful.<br><br>As we journey through mortality, heart-stoppers will come to each of us.<br><br>My young friends, I commend you for paying the price in time, in effort, in money to obtain your education. Your parents may be sacrificing, skimping, and going without so that you may be given the education which will enable you to excel in today's world.<br><br>Whatever your future pathway may be, may I suggest to you today four guideposts to assist in your respective journeys through school and through life itself.<br><br>First: <b>Glance backward.</b><br><br>Second: <b>Look heavenward.</b><br><br>Third: <b>Reach outward.</b><br><br>Fourth: <b>Press onward.</b><br><br>Let us consider each in its turn. First, <b>glance backward.</b> A review of the past can be helpful--that is, if we learn from the mistakes and follies of those who have gone before, and if we do not repeat them. John Toland, a Pulitzer Prize–winning author, in summing up his monumental work <i>The Rising Sun,</i> declared:<br><br><i>I have done my utmost to let the events speak for themselves, and if any conclusion was reached, it was that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I have suggested merely a glance at the past, for it is not practical to think we can return. Some of you may be familiar with Thornton Wilder's classic drama <i>Our Town.</i> If you are, you will remember the town of Grover's Corners. In the play, Emily Webb dies in childbirth, and we read of the lonely grief of her young husband, George, left with their four-year-old son. Emily does not wish to rest in peace; she wants to experience again the joys of her life. She is granted the privilege to return to earth and to relive her twelfth birthday. At first it is exciting to be young again, but the excitement wears off quickly. The day holds no joy, now that Emily knows what is in store for the future. It is unbearably painful to realize how unaware she had been of the meaning and wonder of life while she was alive. Before returning to her resting place, Emily laments, "Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it--every, every minute?"<sup>3</sup><br><br>May each of us learn to appreciate the gift of life that we have been given. And, in that context, at this time of year when we will soon be celebrating Thanksgiving, I would urge all of us to glance backward in order to recognize those things for which we are thankful--and then to express appreciation to anyone to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. May we express thanks to parents for caring, for sacrificing, for laboring in our behalf. May we express thanks to friends, to professors, and to any others who have helped along the way. May we express thanks to our Father in Heaven for the blessing of life and the chance to return to Him. And may we express thanks to Him for the gift of His Only Begotten Son, who died that we might live.<br><br>May the lessons we learn as we glance backward help us to live more fully each day of our future.<br><br>Now that we have glanced backward, let us <b>look heavenward.</b> From the heavens came the gentle invitation "Look to God and live."<sup>4</sup><br><br>We have not been left to wander in darkness and in silence, uninstructed, uninspired, without revelation. One who knew and taught this truth was President Harold B. Lee, who wrote this inscription on the title page of the triple combination of scripture which he presented to his teenage daughter:<br><br><i>To My Dear Maurine,</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>That you may have a constant measure by which to judge between truth and the errors of man's philosophies, and thus grow in spirituality as you increase in knowledge, I give you this sacred book to read frequently and cherish throughout your life.</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>Lovingly, your father,</i><br><br><i>Harold B. Lee</i><br><br>From the scriptures, from the prophets, comes counsel for our time as we look heavenward.<br><br>You have the blessing of receiving your education at an institution governed by the principles and ideals of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where one of the goals of the university is to build testimonies ofthe restored gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage living its principles.<br><br>Looking heavenward should be our lifelong endeavor. Some foolish persons turn their backs on the wisdom of God and follow the allurement of fickle fashion, the attraction of false popularity, and the thrill of the moment. Their course of conduct resembles the disastrous experience of Esau, who exchanged his birthright for a mess of pottage.<br><br>And what are the results of such action? Itestify to you today that turning away from God brings broken covenants, shattered dreams, and crushed hopes. Such a quagmire of quicksand I plead with you to avoid. You are of a noble birthright. Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal.<br><br>Such a goal is not achieved in one glorious attempt, but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of wise choices, even a constancy of purpose and lofty ideals.<br><br>Amidst the confusion of our age, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of dailyliving, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives.<br><br>By reaching heavenward and seeking Heavenly Father in personal and family prayer, we and our loved ones will develop the fulfillment of what the great English statesman William E. Gladstone described as the world's greatest need: "a living faith in a personal God."<sup>5</sup> Such faith will illuminate our way as the lighthouse of the Lord.<br><br>When you have an abiding faith in the living God, when your outward actions reflect your inner convictions, you have the composite strength of exposed and hidden virtues. They combine to give safe passage through whatever rough seas might arise.<br><br>Wherever we may be, our Heavenly Father can hear and answer the prayer offered in faith.<br><br>Many years ago, on my first visit to the fabled village of Sauniatu in Samoa, so loved by President David O. McKay, my wife and I met with a large gathering of small children--nearly 200 in number. At the conclusion of our messages to these shy, yet beautiful youngsters, I suggested to the native Samoan teacher that we go forward with the closing exercises. As he announced the final hymn, I suddenly felt compelled to greet personally each of these children. My watch revealed that the time was too short for such a privilege, for we were scheduled on a flight out of the country, so I discounted the impression. Before the benediction was to be spoken, I again felt that I should shake the hand of each child. I made the desire known to the instructor, who displayed a broad and beautiful Samoan smile. In Samoan he announced this to the children. They beamed their approval.<br><br>The instructor then revealed to me the reason for his and their joy. He said, "When we learned that a member of the Council of the Twelve was to visit us here in Samoa, so far away from Church headquarters, I told the children that if they would earnestly and sincerely pray and exert faith like the Bible accounts of old, the Apostle would visit our tiny village at Sauniatu, and, through their faith, he would be impressed to greet each child with a personal handclasp." Tears could not be restrained as the precious boys and girls walked shyly by and whispered softly to us the sweet Samoan greeting "talofa lava." A profound expression of faith had been evidenced.<br><br>Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other.<br><br>Should doubt knock at your doorway, just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts: "I propose to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and contentment are there, and I forbid you agnostic, doubting thoughts to destroy the house of my faith. I acknowledge that I do not understand the processes of creation, but I accept the fact of it. I grant that I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible, and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept God's word. I wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it."<br><br>As we look heavenward, we will receive divine direction. I bear witness to you today that the sweetest spirit and feeling in all of mortality is when we have an opportunity to be on the Lord's errand and to know that He has guided our footsteps.<br><br>Very often on Sundays, when I am not otherwise assigned, I will attend a sacrament meeting in one of the care centers located near my home. There, precious souls, all confined to wheelchairs, meet in an attitude of worship. Worthy priesthood holders from the surrounding area are called as bishops or branch presidents to preside over the care center units, and priests and deacons are assigned each week to bless and pass the sacrament. One cannot attend without being uplifted and inspired.<br><br>One Sunday a young man was to play the violin for the benefit of the elderly and incapacitated throng. He began, and as he played, his music became sweeter with each passing minute. Tears came to the young man's eyes as he later mentioned that the notes tumbled through his mind, one following the other in perfect succession, and that he had never played with such pure inspiration as he had that particular day. He proffered, "It wasn't my skill. It was the yearning of this special audience."<br><br>At the same meeting, an elderly lady called out, "I'm cold!" A priest at the sacrament table said nothing, but he arose and walked to her side. He then removed his own jacket and placed it around the shoulders of the lady who was cold. To him I said, "What you have done today you will ever remember. Your act of kindness reflects the nobility of your soul. You have been as the good Samaritan who aided the helpless traveler on the road to Jericho."<br><br>As we look heavenward, we inevitably learn of our responsibility to <b>reach outward.</b><br><br>To find real happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves. No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man. Service to others is akin to duty--the fulfillment of which brings true joy.<br><br>We do not live alone--in our city, our nation, or our world. There is no dividing line between our prosperity and our neighbor's wretchedness. "Love thy neighbor" is more than a divine truth. It is a pattern for perfection. This truth inspires the familiar charge "Go forth to serve." Try as some of us may, we cannot escape the influence our lives have upon the lives of others. Ours is the opportunity to build, to lift, to inspire, and indeed to lead.<br><br>The New Testament teaches that it is impossible to take a right attitude toward Christ without taking an unselfish attitude toward men. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."<sup>6</sup> We may think as we please, but there is no question about what the Bible teaches. In the New Testament there is no road to the heart of God that does not lead through the heart of man.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a true Latter-day Saint<br><br><i>is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>We cannot be careless in our reach. Lives of others depend on us. The power to lead is indeed the power to mislead; and the power tomislead is the power to destroy.<br><br>Many have come into the Church--or at least have come to know and respect the Church--because someone made the effort to reach outward. I share with you a treasured family experience which had its beginning back in 1959 when I was called to preside over the Canadian Mission, headquartered inToronto.<br><br>Our daughter, Ann, who is in the audience today, turned five shortly after we arrived in Canada. She saw the missionaries going about their work and she, too, wanted to be a missionary. My wife demonstrated understanding by permitting Ann to take to class a few copies of the <i>Children's Friend.</i> That wasn't sufficient for Ann. She also wanted to take with her a copy of the Book of Mormon so that she might talk to her teacher, Miss Pepper, about the Church. I think it rather thrilling that just a few years ago, long years after our return from Toronto, we came home from a vacation and found in our mailbox a note from Miss Pepper which read:<br><br><i>Dear Ann:</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>Think back many years ago. I was your schoolteacher in Toronto, Canada. I was impressed by the copies of the</i> Children's Friend <i>which you brought to school. I was impressed by your dedication to a book called the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>I made a commitment that one day I would come to Salt Lake City and see why you talked as you did and why you believed in the manner you believed. Today I had the privilege of going through your visitors' center on Temple Square. Thanks to a five-year-old girl who had an understanding of that which she believed, I now have a better understanding of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br>Miss Pepper died not too long after that visit. How happy our daughter Ann was when she attended the Jordan River Temple and performed the temple work for her beloved teacher to whom she had reached out so many years ago.<br><br>And while we reach outward, we have the responsibility to <b>press onward.</b><br><br>No one has described this life as being easy. Indeed, it has become increasingly more difficult. The world seems to have slipped from the moorings of safety and drifted from the harbor of peace. Permissiveness, immorality, pornography, and the power of peer pressure cause many to be tossed about on a sea of sin and crushed on the jagged reefs of lost opportunities, forfeited blessings, and shattered dreams.<br><br>Anxiously we ask, "Is there a way to safety? Can someone guide us? Is there an escape from threatened destruction?"<br><br>The answer is a resounding yes! I counsel you: Look to the lighthouse of the Lord. There is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no gale so strong, no mariner so lost but what its beacon light can rescue. It calls, "This way to safety; this way to home."<br><br>Press onward we must. The Apostle Paul described life as a race. He said, "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The writer of the book of Ecclesiastes also wrote of this subject, saying, "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong."<sup>9</sup> Actually, the prize belongs to him who endures to the end.<br><br>In the private sanctuary of one's own conscience lies that spirit, that determination, to press onward and to measure up to the stature of true potential. But the way is rugged, and the course is strenuous. So discovered John Helander from Göteborg, Sweden. John was a young adult. He had the same yearnings for the blessings of success as do all. But John is handicapped, in that it is difficult for him to coordinate his motions.<br><br>At an activity of young people in Kungsbacka, Sweden, John took part in an 800-meter running race. He had no chance to win. Rather, his was the possibility of being humiliated, mocked, derided, scorned. Perhaps John remembered another who lived long ago and far away. Wasn't He mocked? Wasn't He derided? Wasn't He scorned? But He prevailed. He won His race. Maybe John could win his.<br><br>What a race it is! Struggling, surging, pressing, the runners bolt far beyond John. There is wonderment among the spectators. Who is this runner who lags so far behind? The participants, on their second lap of this two-lap race, pass John while he is but halfway through the first lap. Tension mounts as the runners press toward the tape. Who will win? Who will place second? Then comes the final burst of speed; the tape is broken. The crowd cheers; the winner is proclaimed.<br><br>The race is over--or is it? Who is this contestant who continues to run when the race is ended? He crosses the finish line on but his first lap. Doesn't he know he has lost? Ever onward he struggles, the only participant now on the track. This is his race. This must be his victory. No one among the vast throng of spectators leaves. Every eye is on this valiant runner. He makes the final turn and moves toward the finish line. There is awe; there is admiration. Every spectator sees himself running his own race of life. As John approaches the finish line, the audience, as one, rises to its feet. There is a loud applause of acclaim. Stumbling, falling, exhausted but victorious, John Helander breaks the newly tightened tape. (Officials are human beings, too.) The cheering echoes for miles. And just maybe, if the ear is carefully attuned, that Great Scorekeeper--even the Lord--can be heard to say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Each of us is a runner in the race of life. Comforting is the fact that there are many runners. Reassuring is the knowledge that our Eternal Scorekeeper is understanding. Challenging is the truth that each must run. But you and I do not run alone. We take confidence from the hymn:<br><i>Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,</i><i>For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.</i><i>I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee tostand,</i><i>Upheld by my righteous, . . . omnipotent hand.</i><i></i><i>. . . . . . .</i><i></i><i>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose</i><i>I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;</i><i>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</i><i>I'll never, no never, no never forsake!</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Let us shed any thought of failure. Let us discard any habit or trait that may hinder. Let us ever press onward. Let us seek; let us obtain the prize prepared for all--even exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God.<br><br>Your future is bright. It is challenging. It awaits you. Do not venture forth alone.

<h1>c Writing, Strategic Living - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm afraid that if my two oldest granddaughters could see me here today, they would be a little disappointed. My daughter heard them telling their other grandmother that I worked at BYU (even though she already knew it). When she asked what I did here, they said I took care of the Y.<br><br>"Oh," she said. "What does she do with it?"<br><br>They told her my job is to protect it and keep it white. (I don't know if I could even make the hike up there!)<br><br>So, I'm apparently off the job right now. I actually think their grandpa added those extra details in talking to them once--and I think they thought it sounded much more interesting than what I really do: teach and write. They know teachers, and, although they like their teachers, teaching is not anything special. And about the writing, they know I have books published, but Lauren, the seven-year-old, is writing a book of her own. So, no big deal.<br><br>Actually, Lauren's book fascinates me. First is the title: <i>The Never-Lasting Love.</i> That really is a catchy title. When I was last at my daughter's home, I asked Lauren if I could read her book. "It isn't done yet," she said. But she let me read what she had written so far. She brought me a sheaf of papers numbered from 1 to 15. Her writing stopped at the top of page 11; the other pages had page numbers on them but nothing else written yet. I read her story--as far as it went. It is a story of a poor girl named Ges who lives with her parents in a faraway time and place. Ges is a nice girl, and the family is a happy one, except that they don't have any food (well, except for birthday cake and ice cream). They have interesting daily routines such as saying good night to each other at the end of every day. One day Ges meets a prince. That's as far as the story went that I got to read. She has now finished it, and I think it ends "happily ever after."<br><br>Lauren's story shows what she knows--and it tells us some interesting things about writing and the writing process. Lauren loves Disney movies, especially fairy tales and stories with princesses and princes in them. Her life has routines at bedtime and cake and ice cream for birthdays. What Lauren knows and likes finds its way into her story. Probably the most fascinating thing about Lauren's story is that she already knew how long it was going tobe: 15pages. That's a lot when you're a six- or seven-year-old writer. It's a lot when you're your age, right? But Lauren wasn't intimidated by the length; she worked on it a bit at a time when she was able, knowing that it would be done someday.<br><br>Many years ago researchers looked at the writing processes of experienced and able writers and compared them to the processes of less experienced or less able writers. Not surprisingly, they found differences. They hypothesized that if less able writers could practice the processes of the more able and experienced writers, those less able writers would become better. They named their findings "the writing process," and they labeled certain broad aspects of it: prewriting, drafting, and revising. You've probably heard something about that before. Within each aspect of the process was a wide range of subprocesses that could occur, but the use of those processes depended on the situation, the task, and the writer. Also, the processes didn't occur in a line--they recurred. That is, writers generally did not complete all the activities that might be labeled prewriting before they began drafting. And they may have done some revising before they were finished drafting. They also may have gone back after a draft was completed and done more inquiry or prewriting activities. The parts of the process weren't sequential.<br><br>Teachers in schools wanted to use these ideas, so they taught a form of the writing process--most often as a line that fit with school and most often not connected to a specific task or situation or writer. In other words, what most of you learned about the writing process probably includes these ideas:<br><ul><br>	<li>We use it for every paper.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We do it the same way for every paper.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We always start with brainstorming or clustering or freewriting.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We begin to draft right after our brainstorming.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We don't correct our writing while we draft.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>We share our writing with peers to have them tell us what they think.</li><br></ul><br>The understanding of the writing process that seemed to develop in schools was not much like what the original researchers anticipated. And, from my experience as a teacher in public schools, as a trainer of teachers, as someone who works with practicing teachers, and as a mom watching my own children, I can see that this false impression of what the writing process is and how it works has not benefited less experienced writers very much at all. Many students often don't even make use of the writing process to aid them in their writing. In fact, many students--none of you, I'm sure--have strained the process by attempting to live up to its supposed principles.<br><ul><br>	<li>They have done their cluster or outline or whatever <i>after</i> they wrote the paper.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>They have printed out two copies of the same paper and written <i>rough draft</i> on the top of one as "evidence" that they used the process.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>They have printed out two copies and then made cross outs and arrows and scribble marks all over one so that it looks as though they have revised, even though they haven't.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>They have sat in peer groups and told each other "good job" without even reading the papers--and then had a great conversation about the prom or the football game or something else more interesting than each other's writing.</li><br></ul><br>The writing process is information about writing that writers can use to help themselves as writers to improve the quality of their written product. It is meant to adapt to each writer's needs in each writing situation. Let's face it: you don't use prewriting or revising when you text someone, do you? You may use a little editing or revising in an e-mail to a professor (maybe), but you probably don't in an e-mail to a friend. When you wrote your essays for your application to BYU, you probably went through several drafts, and you probably asked other people (teachers, friends, or parents) to read them and give you some feedback--feedback that you could choose to use or not. What you know at some level is that the aspects of the writing process are meant to be applied strategically--you already do it to some degree, but maybe you haven't thought about it all the way through yet. Maybe, as my son Joseph told me once, you are still thinking that the writing process is this pointless thing high school teachers made you do, so you've ignored the potential benefits to your current situation as university students. There might be ways to make the writing process more strategic for you--and there are correlations, Ithink, between the way we use the writing process and the way we live our lives.<br><br>Your teachers might have talked about prewriting as the first stage of writing. Prewriting is important, but it's much more than brainstorming or clustering. Those are strategies that help you come up with a topic or narrow a topic. Freewriting may help you explore what you already know about a topic. But the important thing about prewriting is inquiry--it's the investigation that is essential to all good writing. If we don't know enough, our writing will never be very good. And writers who know their subject well can write about anything in an interesting way.<br><br>I have read a lot of nonfiction about topics I don't have any particular interest in: violins (which I don't play), lobsters (which I don't eat), salt (which I take for granted), and Chicago (which I was going to visit). But the writers knew enough about the topics that they could make them interesting even to someone like me--someone who is just curious. Inquiry is an important part of being a strategic writer. You need to know when you need more information and how to get that information.<br><br>Lauren's writing is a good example of one aspect of inquiry. Some of our inquiry comes from our life experiences. Hers did: she watches Disney movies, reads fairy tales, and lives in a family with happy routines. These all came through in her story. And much of our inquiry in some situations comes from our own life experiences: when we give a sacrament meeting talk, when we write in our journals, and when we write letters home from our missions. But for some writing we need to learn more before we are ready to write effectively. So we need to know where to go for that information. We can go to books, certainly. Many of you probably go first to the Internet when you want information. That can work, too. We can talk to people who are knowledgeable about our questions. There are a number of ways to inquire and gain the information we need so that we can write effectively. Knowing that we need to know more, knowing where to go to find out, and knowing how to keep track of what we've learned--these are all parts of being a strategic writer.<br><br>It's similar in life. We also have to do the groundwork. As in writing, there are strategies for living well, for living fully, and for creating the best life. You know many of them: pray, read our scriptures, attend our meetings, fast, serve others, be in the right places, obey. We prepare for living in the same way we prepare for writing: by learning what we need to learn and by doing what we need to do. In chapters 48 to 50 of the book of Alma, Moroni prepared for the possibility of war. We are told that he was not a man of war; indeed he was "aman that did not delight in bloodshed" (Alma 48:11). We are told that he gloried "in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity" (verse 16). Nonetheless he prepared for war. He used strategies to get the most information he could about both the physical and spiritual aspects of his situation, and he used that information to guide his life. And we all know the kind of man he was and the kind of life he led.<br><br>Just as we need to know our subject thoroughly in order to write well, we need knowledge--awide range of knowledge--in order to live to our fullest potential. Certainly knowledge of things of the Spirit is part of that. We are constantly encouraged to study our scriptures for that very reason. But the scriptures also tell us to study other subjects as well. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told to study<br><br><i>things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when Ishall send you again to magnify</i> [your] <i>calling.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:79–80]<br><br>Like Moroni, we are admonished later in that same section of the Doctrine and Covenants to prepare ourselves and, as part of that preparation, to establish "a house of learning" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119). Certainly inquiry and learning are essential to writing, but they are also essential to living fully and being prepared for the Lord's plan to work in our lives. Think how often learning that we didn't know we would use becomes essential to an assignment or calling we have been given. To live well, we need to learn everything we can and then live close to the Spirit so that Heavenly Father can reveal to us specific details of His plan for our lives.<br><br>When they start to write, many writers, like Lauren, think of writing as filling a certain number of pages. When she started, she numbered 15 pages--that's how long her story would be (although it ended up being 17). How many of you, when you are given a writing assignment, first ask how long it's supposed to be? You use the same strategy as Lauren: You think to fill a set number of pages--the fewer the better. But life isn't like that. Life is about filling all the time that we are blessed with. And how we fill those pages of our life matters. How we fill those days and years will create a product that has nothing to do with length and everything to do with quality. Living strategically means making sure our life's time is meaningful, not fluff.<br><br>When we start to write, knowing how to shape our writing for the situation is also part of being strategic. If you haven't already, you will find out soon enough that writing isn't always the same. Good writing in psychology isn't the same as good writing in history or good writing in economics. Each discipline has its own way of gathering and presenting information. Beyond school, that same thing is true. A letter to the editor isn't the same as a letter asking for a job interview. Part of being a strategic writer means figuring out the appropriate shape and expectations for each writing situation. More current research in writing theory has focused on this social aspect of writing--what theorists call genre theory. Some genre theorists claim that the only way to write well in a situation is to be a part of that situation, and they claim that we learn by assimilating the ways that knowledgeable people in a situation write. So we need to learn to ask questions, to observe, and to read widely and carefully in order to find out how to shape writing as we draft.<br><br>In a similar way we often "draft" our lives by observing and imitating the lives of those around us and by following the examples we see in those lives. I have three grandchildren who are three years of age. They are wonderful children--fantastic, actually--but when two of them get together, they remind me of Thing One and Thing Two from <i>The Cat in the Hat.</i> They encourage each other to higher and higher levels of silliness. They remind me how important the influence of the people around us can be. Do we place ourselves in the best places to choose examples that will shape our lives in the way we want them to be? Do we have as friends and associates people we want to be like--people who help us become our best selves? We are blessed to live in a time and place where we have the prophet and apostles and other Church leaders on our television screens (if not in our Church meetings or devotionals) on a regular basis. We have examples of other prophets in the scriptures--and of course the scriptures also give us the example of the perfect model, Jesus Christ. How much advantage do we take of these opportunities to shape our lives after these wonderful examples and to learn to think and act and believe as they do?<br><br>When he was in junior high, my youngest son spent one evening working on a poster that was part of an oral presentation for his English class. As I drove him to school the next morning, I glanced into the backseat of the car, looking for the poster. When I didn't see it, I asked him where it was, thinking that he'd left it at home. He replied that it was in his backpack.<br><br>"In your backpack?" I was astounded. "How?"<br><br>He made folding motions with his hands.<br><br>"Folded? It will be a mess for your presentation!"<br><br>He shrugged. "Other kids fold theirs."<br><br>I asked him: "The kids who get As?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"The kids who get Bs?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"The kids who get Cs?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"So you model yourself after the students who get Ds and Fs?"<br><br>Now for Joseph it was really a matter of being cool. As far as he could see, cool junior high kids in Washington didn't walk into school carrying their posters protected from the rain in large plastic bags. But the point for me was who he was choosing for his models. President Thomas S. Monson, in his recent First Presidency message, noted the same thing: "All of us need points of reference--even models to follow" ("They Marked the Path to Follow," <i>Ensign,</i> October 2007, 5). In the same way I look to models of writing to learn how to shape my own writing, I am living strategically if I make sure that I have good models around me and if I make sure that I consciously try to pattern my life after them. If I choose good models and work at following their examples, then I have hope of earning the kind of life that will be appropriate for the situation I want for eternity--a life with my Heavenly Father.<br><br>For some writing we don't have to worry about much but just getting something down on paper or on the screen. I've mentioned text messages and e-mails. Much of the writing we do--notes, lists, applications--is just getting something down. There isn't a lot of prewriting or inquiry (except the kind that comes from living), and there isn't really a need for revision. But, sometimes, our writing needs revision. And there are strategies for that, too. We can have others look at our writing and give us feedback. If these people care about us, they will be honest but kind so that they help us become better writers. We can compare our writing against standards such as grading criteria or models of similar kinds of writing. We can read our writing out loud to ourselves to hear how it sounds. These are just a few of the ways we can find out what needs to be improved in our writing.<br><br>I'll be the first to admit that revising is hard and feedback can be tough. Last fall I was working on a manuscript for a book that summarized and interpreted new theory so that teachers could use it in schools. I had a contract for the book, but the editor was not entirely happy with the initial full draft. He wanted it revised for audience and tone. When I had written the early drafts, I had cared too much about my secondary audience--the theorists themselves--and not enough about my primary audience: teachers. He was right--the tone was wrong. I needed to revise. I had a good friend and colleague, Penny Bird, read the manuscript. She came to my office, confirmed the editor's evaluation, and suggested some possibilities for my revision. I rearranged some of the parts of the text and gave her another draft. Again she didn't think it worked. We went through this routine several times, each time with Penny asking me important questions about the subject and about what I was trying to do. Finally, after she left one day, I sat down in front of the computer. I had wrestled and wrestled with this text--moving parts around, rephrasing a sentence or paragraph here and there, thinking of teachers more--but I still didn't have something I could send to the editor. It wasn't working. As I sat there with the latest version on the screen, I realized I was going to have to do what I had been avoiding. I was going to have to do what I tell my students revision really is: it is re-seeing. I had to start over again. After all that work, I opened a blank screen and I started writing. That manuscript will be published inMarch.<br><br>My youngest sons used to hate revising their papers. Paul used to ask, "Why can't you see everything I need to change the first time you look at it?" Instead, I would make suggestions, he'd make changes, I'd make more suggestions for revising the next draft, and so on. I told him it isn't easy to see everything at once. When we change one thing, we are able to see what we couldn't before. Thus revision isn't always easy--or fast.<br><br>When our oldest son, Michael, was getting ready to be baptized, we had a family home evening lesson about baptism and the covenants involved. I had cut footprints--maybe more like shoe prints--out of construction paper and had placed them across the floor as though someone had walked there. As we had the lesson, we explained to our children, although only Michael and Aimee were able to understand fully, that baptism was a promise to follow in the Savior's footsteps. I encouraged them to walk in the footsteps as a way to show that promise. As they practiced, they noticed that sometimes they stepped to the side of the footprint instead of directly on it. When I told them that we have to try to be exactly like Him, I'll never forget their response. They looked at each other, clutched each other's hands, and said, "What if we don't?" They looked ready to cry. "What if we step outside?"<br><br>I explained that when that happens we can repent.<br><br>To this they said, "Whew!" then looked at each other and repeated with joy, "We can repent!"<br><br>Repentance and revision have much in common.<br><br>When they revise writing, strategic writers know that they aren't just making cosmetic changes. They know that revision, at its core, reshapes and reconstructs the writing. Revision in life--repentance--isn't always easy either. Repentance isn't about simply rearranging surface features of our lives. It's supposed to change us, to change our natures. Alma asked the Nephites:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i> [Alma 5:14]<br><br>Like effective revision, repentance isn't done at once, either. Like my son's papers, sometimes as we remove one level of the natural man, we find other levels that we might not have noticed before. We refine ourselves, seeing more and more detail as we revise our lives. Elder David A. Bednar, in his most recent conference address, pointed out that becoming the kind of person we want to become--the kind of person who will live again with our Heavenly Father--doesn't happen in one revision either:<br><br><i>Small, steady, incremental spiritual improvements are the steps the Lord would have us take. Preparing to walk guiltless before God is one of the primary purposes of mortality and the pursuit of a lifetime; it does not result from sporadic spurts of intense spiritual activity.</i> ["Clean Hands and a Pure Heart," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 82]<br><br>In other words, it is a process. One that cannot be shortchanged.<br><br>In writing, part of our revision occurs whenwe compare our writing against standards or grading criteria. In comparing, we know what we need to change in order to meet those standards or criteria. In living strategically, we do the same thing. We go to temple recommend interviews so that we regularly check ourselves against a standard. We listen to and follow a prophet, using his example as a standard. We read our scriptures so that we can see the perfect example of right living: the Savior. Then wemake corrections as they are needed.<br><br>I am a writer who (mostly) uses what we know about the writing process strategically. Iwrite lists, e-mails, letters of recommendation, lesson plans, articles, and books--and I can do it because I know how to use the writing plan effectively. Heavenly Father has given us a plan for living that is meant to help us succeed in life. His plan isn't one that will necessarily tell us whether we should eat corn or green beans for dinner or which shoes to wear with a certain outfit, but it is one that can help us make the important right choices in our lives if we let it. Like the writing process, it isn't a plan that's imposed on us. It's there for us to choose to use in order to make the best use of our life's options.<br><br>When our son Paul was young, I bought him antiperspirant for the first time. I tossed it to him and went into the kitchen to put the rest of the groceries away. Several minutes later I passed him in the hall. It was summer. He had on shorts but no shirt. Across his forehead, down his cheeks, down his chest, and down his arms were stripes of white. He looked like a warrior going into battle. When I asked him what he'd put on himself, he said it was the antiperspirant. He figured if it stopped perspiration, he should put it wherever he sweat. It was logical, but it was also funny. Over the years since then, we have told this story many times. For our family it is a reminder that true principles should be applied liberally. That's how I think a comparison to the writing process can apply to our living processes.<br><br>I know Heavenly Father's plan for us can get us where He wants us to be in this life and in the next if we use it in the way we are supposed to. His plan is a process, a plan of growth. I hope we don't use it the way we sometimes use the writing process--skimping on the details of the process and thinking that it's good enough. I hope we don't start with a page limit in mind, a kind of boundary that doesn't allow Heavenly Father's plan for us to work. I hope we know that we have to put in the groundwork with our own effort and learning. I hope we know that there are examples out there for us to follow so that we don't have to draft blindly. And I hope we know that we can revise our lives when we aren't doing what is right, when we aren't making the best decisions. With His plan, what is offered is worth a lot more than what we get when we write, so we should use the plan that much more effectively than we use the writing process. Thefinal draft will be well worth it. I know that. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Deborah Dean was a BYU associate professor of English when this devotional address was given on 27 November 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Do You Really Want to Be When You Grow Up - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You are such a beautiful and impressive sight! I wish each of you could stand where I am standing right now and see what Isee as I look into your faces. You are the ones the Lord is counting on to help prepare for His Second Coming!<br><br>As I have prayed about what I might say to you this morning, I have felt that the most valuable thing I could say, above all else, would be to testify to you that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, love you with a perfect, infinite, and enduring love.<sup>1</sup> There are many things that I confess I don't know, but I know this to be true. I also know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is exactly what it claims to be. I know that, as Joseph Smith said, "The Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior, my Redeemer, and my Advocate with my Heavenly Father. I know that as I am eager to be taught and to repent--willing to change and to strive to become like a little child--my sins can be forgiven. I know that because of His Atonement, when I come unto Him, my heart can be changed. I love Him, and I am grateful, more than I can ever find words to describe, for all that He has done for me.<br><br>The Christian world is about to celebrate the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and, knowing what we know, we ought to be the best Christians in the world in how we treat each other. I believe with all of my heart that if our Savior Jesus Christ were to walk into this room this morning amongst us here, the two most significant characteristics we would observe and feel about Him would be His overwhelming glory and His perfect love for us--each and every one of us, individually!<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know that the Church is true. It is all that it claims to be. <i>It really is true!</i> I am grateful that my Heavenly Father has given me this testimony, and I feel an obligation to share it whenever I have the opportunity. I have found that sharing my testimony is one of the greatest privileges of my life. I have found, as President Boyd K. Packer has taught us, that "as you give that which you have, there is a replacement, with increase!"<sup>3</sup><br><br>As I have felt impressed that sharing my testimony would be the most valuable thing I could do this morning, I have also felt impressed to ask you a personal question. MayI do that?<br><br>Have you ever thought carefully and deeply about what you really want to be when you grow up? It doesn't matter whether you have chosen to be an engineer, economist, psychologist, physician, physicist, sociologist, scientist, printer, plumber, philosopher, or whatever. All of these professions can be wonderful in blessing the lives of others and can bring you great fulfillment when done well. But what <i>attributes</i> do you really want to have as one of our Heavenly Father's children? What kind of person do you really want to be? Most important, what do you want to be like the day you stand in front of God? What kind of character do you really want to have?<br><br>In the quiet, reflective, deep, soul-searching moments of your life, you have probably thought about this and have made at least some decisions. I promise you that one day--ifyou haven't already thought about this carefully--you will, and this experience will help you begin to see the need for the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ. You will begin to see where you are compared with where you really want to be, and you will begin to feel your dependence on our Savior Jesus Christ and His Atonement. As you do this, your heart will begin to be softened and the Holy Ghost will give you impressions of what you should do to be better. Not only that, but you will begin to feel that you <i>can</i> be better because of your faith in Him and what He has done for you. You are of noble birthright. You are one of His children. God will help you do it!<br><br>Our Heavenly Father, because He loves us perfectly, has given us a very special gift along with the privilege of coming to this earth as mortal beings to use this gift with all of the challenges, difficulties, and opportunities that a mortal state provides. This special gift is our moral agency. Because we have been given this precious gift, we are the ones who will choose what we will become. Though each of our circumstances and individual choices will be different, the choices that we make, no matter what our circumstances, will make all of us what we will become. We are our "own judges."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Some years ago I heard of a parable told by an old Cherokee chief who was trying to teach his grandson this principle. "A fight is going on inside me," he said to the boy. "It is a terrible fight at times, and the fight is between two wolves. One is evil--he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, jealousy, and ego. The other is good--he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. This same fight is going on inside of you--and inside every other person too."<br><br>The grandson thought about what his grandfather had said to him for a minute and then asked, "Grandfather, which wolf will win?"<br><br>The old chief simply replied, "The one youfeed."<sup>5</sup><br><br>President David O. McKay, a prophet of God, put it this way:<br><br><i>Each of us is carving a soul this very minute--our own. Is it going to be a deformed one, or is it going to be something admirable and beautiful?</i><br><br><i>Yours is the responsibility. Nobody else can carve it for you. Parents may guide, and teachers may help with suggestions, but each young man and young woman has the responsibility to carve his own character.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>While the Savior walked the earth and taught His gospel in the land of Jerusalem, a certain lawyer, tempting the Lord, asked Him aquestion, saying:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in thelaw?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The Savior also taught us: "Come, follow me."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The opportunity of this life, then, is to use our moral agency to choose to follow our Savior and to learn to love God and our fellow man as God loves us. The book of John says that "God is love"<sup>9</sup> and that "perfect love casteth out fear."<sup>10</sup> We can choose anything wereally want, but the greatest opportunity we have is to choose to become like Christ and our Heavenly Father.<br><br>It is not always easy to love God and our fellow man. At times it takes great effort to do this, and we must learn to school the use of our agency and yield our hearts to God, as the prophet Helaman taught in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Helaman spoke of a people who had learned why they were really here on this earth and acted accordingly. Listen to these words from this prophet:<br><br><i>Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>As we choose to school our agency and practice yielding our hearts to God, we bump into the natural man within us again and again. I would like to share a story with you that helped me understand something about the natural man within each of us and how that natural man can react. When I was a boy I had a wonderful little cocker spaniel dog named Smokey. Smokey liked to play ball by having me throw the ball as far as I could behind the shop in our backyard, by the woodpile, among the fruit trees, or in the garden--wherever. Smokey would not give up until he found that ball and brought it back to me, only to repeat the cycle again and again. Smokey became my best friend, and I loved to play with him day after day.<br><br>Smokey had only one fault. Not only was he obsessed with chasing and retrieving tennis balls, but he was also obsessed with climbing our front fence and chasing after loud trucks passing by on our side street.<br><br>One day I heard a truck coming, and immediately I thought of Smokey. Before I could reach the front gate to stop him, he had climbed the gate and was already halfway across our front lawn, headed for the wheels of the truck at full speed. I called for him to stop as loud as I could, but it was no use. Within an instant he was nipping at one of the rear wheels of the truck, running to keep up. A few seconds later one of his rear legs somehow slipped and got caught under one of the wheels, also pulling his pelvis under the wheel. Smokey was left in the street crying and yelping in tremendous pain. Iran over to him and tried to comfort him. As Igot close enough, he immediately bit my hand as hard as he could. I was astonished. Why would this wonderful dog I loved so much bite me? My mom came out of the house, and somehow we were able to get Smokey in a large burlap bag and into the car. At the vet's office we were told that Smokey's body had been so badly hurt that he would have to be put to sleep. Iwas devastated and confused.<br><br>What happened was not an easy thing for a little boy to understand. It took me some years to learn the lesson from the experience. Those who are hurting often strike out and hurt those they love most, simply because they are hurting. Have you noticed that sometimes when we hurt, this is how we treat our Heavenly Father and others? This is not how our Savior acted when He was hurt--when He was despised and spit upon by others and when Hewas crucified.<br><br>It is not easy, but, in the long run, learning to act like our Savior Jesus Christ and to love our fellow man and God no matter what hurt may come to us is easier than any other alternative. With God's help I know we can overcome the natural man and become like Him.<sup>12</sup> Elder Gene R. Cook explained it this way: "As we increasingly think and act like Him, the attributes of the natural man will slip away to be replaced by the heart and the mind of Christ."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Many years ago I learned from a wonderful man who served as my mission president, Elder Glen L. Rudd, that all of us need four things in our lives:<br><br>1. We need to be loved.<br><br>2. We need to be trusted.<br><br>3. We need to be understood.<br><br>4. We need to feel that our work is appreciated.<br><br>When any one or more of these four needs are missing in our lives, we often will act as we ought not to act. Understanding this can be a great help in learning to love others, no matter what they may do. It can also help us see why we are not acting at times as we ought to be acting. When you see a friend or loved one letting the natural man take over and not acting as they ought to, ask yourself which one or more of these four needs might be lacking in their lives--or, for that matter, we should ask this same question when we are not acting as we ought to act in our own lives.<br><br>I want to make you a promise. If you see someone acting as they ought not to act, ask Heavenly Father if there is something you might do to help them feel more loved, more trusted, more understood, or more appreciated for their efforts. If you ask sincerely, really wanting to help because you love them--and God--the Holy Ghost will give you some inspiration--even revelation--concerning what you might do to be of help.<br><br>Do you not see that one of the great mysteries of godliness that many never see is that when we use our agency to choose to give our love away, we gain more love and we become more like our Savior and our Heavenly Father? Does knowing this not give every one of us an added opportunity for service and a way to show love to our fellow men? Can we not see that we must learn to give away what we would hope to gain to become like God?<sup>14</sup> This is what our Heavenly Father does for us. Do we <i>really</i> want to be like Him and our Savior when we grow up?<br><br>I would like to invite one of our precious granddaughters, Emma, to sing one verse of a Primary song that for me says it all. She can sing it so much better than I can say it. Emma just turned five.<br><i>I'm trying to be like Jesus; I'm following in hisways.</i><i>I'm trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say.</i><i>At times I am tempted to make a wrong choice,</i><i>But I try to listen as the still small voice whispers,</i><i>"Love one another as Jesus loves you.</i><i>Try to show kindness in all that you do.</i><i>Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,</i><i>For these are the things Jesus taught."</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Each one of us has a short window of opportunity to learn to yield our hearts to God--that is, to use mortality to become more like our Savior by learning to love others as God and our Savior love us. To illustrate this I will share one last story.<br><br>I knew a man who lived in Sugar City, Idaho, when the Teton Dam broke in 1976. Iheard the story from one of his friends, and I spoke with him some years ago before he passed away to confirm its truthfulness. I share it with you to illustrate how a man can come to love God and yield his heart to Him--can give God his agency, so to speak, because he only wants to do what God would want him to do and not what he himself would want to otherwise do.<br><br>In 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball had asked members of the Church to fix up our homes, our barns, and our yards.<sup>16</sup> President Kimball told us that nonmembers of the Church would judge the truthfulness of the Church by how well we took care of what we had been given, which, by the way, I know to be true. After President Kimball had given the Church this counsel, my friend was out in his front yard one morning painting his fence and planting petunias with his wife. He had painted his barn the week before. His family had about 40 acres of land, and they were raising their seven children with the help of 40 milk cows. You get the picture.<br><br>A neighbor stopped in front of his home. The neighbor asked my friend what he was doing painting his fence and planting those flowers in his front yard. My friend kindly reminded his neighbor that President Kimball had asked us to fix up our homes and our yards. He then said to the neighbor that he wanted to be obedient.<br><br>My friend's neighbor chided him a bit, saying, "Painting your barn and fence and nowplanting those flowers--that's not going toincrease your milk production any."<br><br>My friend simply said something like this: "You are probably right, but President Kimball has asked us to do it and I want to do it."<br><br>Within two weeks the Teton Dam broke and more than 200,000 acre-feet of water came down the Snake River Valley, destroying virtually everything in its path.<sup>17</sup> I don't know if you can envision what more than 200,000 acre-feet of water is like. It was a wall of water about 10 feet high and seven miles wide. Thinking of it more like an engineer, it's 200,000 acres of land covered with more than one foot of water, or one acre of land covered with a column of water more than 37 miles high.<br><br>All of my friend's milk cows died. His barnwas severely damaged. His house was mostly destroyed. The fence in front of his home--the one he had been painting just a fewdays before--was gone, not to mention thepetunias.<br><br>A few days after the flood, my friend saw his neighbor--you remember, the one who chided him a bit for fixing up his place. Only this time he said, "Aren't you sorry now [with a certain spin on the word <i>now</i>] you took that time to paint your barn, fix your fences, and plant those flowers?"<br><br>My friend Marion hesitated for just a moment and then said, "No, they were ready to be taken."<br><br>My friend had learned to use his moral agency in <i>his</i> window of time wisely. By his obedience to a prophet of God he was preparing <i>himself</i> to be taken--preparing himself to stand in front of our Heavenly Father with a character more like our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ. This too is your opportunity and mine, brothers and sisters.<br><br>Would you like your confidence to wax strong in the presence of God? The scriptures teach us how we can do that:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>May I challenge you "to an experiment upon my words" today?<sup>19</sup> In this day of headsets, iPods, and cell phones and with everyone living in their own somewhat isolated world, start with simply looking people in the eye as you leave this devotional today and smile. Say hello as you walk across campus. Your whole day will change, and someone else's will too! Be friendly and kind. Look for the good in others. Praise them for the good they do. Greet people, even those you don't know--maybe especially those you don't know. Lift them up. Who knows, you might even get a date with someone!<br><br>There is way more isolation and negativism in this old world than there will ever be in the celestial kingdom. What we do here and now to work against the natural man (like against gravity, so to speak) will develop our spirituality and help us to become like God. How we decide we are going to treat others here and now can make all the difference in the world--and in you.<br><br>So what do you really want to be when you grow up? Do you want to be a person like our Savior or like somebody who is all by themself? Look for ways to lift others up. "Cease to find fault."<sup>20</sup> Ask our Heavenly Father how you might help someone feel more loved, more trusted, more understood, and more valued and appreciated for their efforts. The Holy Ghost will give you feelings on how to do thisif you ask for them and really want them. The Lord has promised us this.<br><br>I plead with you to earnestly ask our Heavenly Father for the gift of faith in His Son Jesus Christ. When we have faith in Him (which will come as a gift when we sincerely want it and live for it), we can be blessed with hope that His Atonement will apply to us--yes, even we who are imperfect! But to have faith in Him, we must also know what He is like and want to be like Him. If we genuinely ask for this kind of faith in Him, we can have our hearts changed so we will want to love God and our neighbor. We will do all we can tolove one another, just as the Savior did.<br><br>The Savior said, "Come, follow me." I think my little granddaughter Emma got it just right. I too am trying to be like Jesus!<br><br>I love you brothers and sisters. I am grateful for the privilege I have been given to address you today and to bear my testimony of my Savior and of His love for you and for me. I know that He lives and that He will help you and me keep His commandments to love Him and one another and to become like Him. I have come to know that when I yield my agency and my heart to Him--no holding back--He will give me even more agency. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert H.

<h1>in Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As my oldest son, Ryan, was a little more than halfway through his studies on this campus, he and I started what was to become a family tradition of attending Tuesday devotionals and forums together each week. Afterward I would treat him to lunch so that we could discuss what we had learned. This gave me an opportunity to observe how things were going in his life. This tradition has continued with each of our children. Our youngest child, Robyn, asked me a question as we exited the Marriott Center last fall semester: "Dad, when are you going to speak in a devotional?"<br><br>My reply was simple and to the point: "I'll likely never be asked because of all the other qualified people they have to choose from."<br><br>This experience reminded me of a comment I made to my wife, Ralene, soon after we were married and were living in Texas. I told her that we would likely never live near her parents, who lived here in Utah County. Based upon my choice to be a musician, the likelihood of living anywhere in the Intermountain West seemed remote. An unexpected phone call came while I was teaching at Indiana State University, and the invitation to come and join the faculty on this campus was extended. It has proven to be a wonderful blessing for our family and an opportunity for my own personal growth and service. The lesson learned? Never say never!<br><br>As a percussionist, I play a number of different instruments in a myriad of musical styles. I have colleagues who specialize on certain instruments, but my motto has always been "If you shake, scrape, or hit it, I play it." Performing on marimba, vibraphone, and crotales with the Utah Symphony, timpani with Ballet West, a drum set on a jazz gig, or African hand drums in a recording session for a Tahitian Noni infomercial allows me the variety I thrive on. There is seldom, if ever, a time when I feel like I'm in a rut. With that variety comes the challenge of finding time to know what instrument to practice and in what musical style.<br><br>Keeping balance in my percussion-playing life has always been a challenge. As a young, new faculty member here, I often traveled up to Salt Lake City to rehearse or perform with a variety of groups. Frequently I would rush home after a busy day on campus only to ask Ralene to pack me a sandwich while I changed clothes or loaded some percussion equipment into my truck. My son Ryan--who was then only 10 years old--observed the way my life was going and waited for the perfect opportunity to teach his dad a very important lesson. That moment came one day when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He responded, "I don't know exactly what career I want, but I know what I <i>don't</i> want to be--a musician." I was stunned. He then recounted my multiple refueling sessions, with me hurrying home only to leave again for another engagement.<br><br>I reflected upon what he said and was reminded of an experience from my own childhood when I watched the Ed Sullivan variety show on television. Now a variety show was as popular then as reality TV is today. Along with acts like the Beatles, comedians, singers, and tap dancers, there was a performer who would frequently appear on this show whose act consisted of an array of long wooden poles upon which he would carefully place ceramic plates. With a deft hand he would spin each plate while some silly "oompah" music played in the background. As he spun his fifth or sixth plate, inevitably plate number two or three would start to wobble, and he would have to hurry back to increase their spin before they crashed to the floor. It was a riveting display of skill, timing, and speed. Viewers across the nation watched eagerly to see if he could spin all of the plates on every wobbling dowel.<br><br>As you are turning in projects, papers, and preparing for finals, perhaps you feel like you are trying to keep too many plates spinning. Our challenge is often deciding how many plates to try to spin and for how long. In 1987 Elder M. Russell Ballard was recovering from a serious illness and felt prompted to speak in April general conference on "Keeping Life's Demands in Balance" (<i>Ensign,</i> May 1987, 13–16). In that address he offered eight suggestions, which I have paraphrased:<br><br>1. Think about your life and set your priorities.<br><br>2. Set short-term goals that you can reach.<br><br>3. Budget wisely and prepare for financial challenges.<br><br>4. Stay close to your spouse, children, family, and friends.<br><br>5. Study the scriptures.<br><br>6. Find time for sufficient rest, relaxation, and exercise.<br><br>7. Hold weekly family home evenings.<br><br>8. Pray as individuals and as families.<br><br>If we view each of these suggestions as an essential pole upon which we need to spin a plate, our ability to deal with the challenges of life will improve.<br><h2><b>Set Your Priorities</b></h2><br>Think about your life and set your priorities. As a young freshman on this campus, I knew I wanted to do something with music. Throughout my childhood my parents arranged for private music lessons, purchased instruments, and provided me the opportunity to attend schools and summer camps that gave me wonderful musical experiences. When I announced to them sometime during my senior year in high school that I wanted to pursue music for a career, they were suddenly less than enthusiastic. Both of my parents were trained musicians, although my father worked as a corporate executive professionally. They had met each other through music--he was a violinist, and she was his accompanist on piano. When they expressed their "nonsupport" in my choice to make music my career, I was even more determined to succeed. I spent many hours thinking deeply about what I wanted to accomplish in my life. Choosing a major was never a problem for me, but deciding on a career path was something that took years of reflection and refinement. Making slight alterations to basic guiding principles is not a problem. The refining process of one's career choice is a method that allows you to tweak your goals through your efforts and hard work.<br><h2><b>Set Short-Term Goals</b></h2><br>Whether you feel your priorities are already set or still in process, our next plate that must be spinning on a regular basis is the habit of setting short-term goals. Without goals it will be difficult for those priorities to become a reality, and we begin the process of living life in "coasting mode." Time passes each of us by whether we are accomplishing much with that time or not. Life on this earth is a precious gift. The process of setting, achieving, and reviewing our goals is a lifelong process. Reviewing what we have or have not accomplished helps us to reevaluate whether the goal we set was realistic or helpful. Having the courage to make changes and then pursue what we desire with the right attitude can make a big difference in our ability to succeed.<br><br>As you travel home at the conclusion of finals for the Christmas holiday, you might consider taking the time to evaluate your experiences this semester. What went well? What would you do differently? You could even set new goals to make next semester or the next important step in your life more rewarding.<br><br>The Church teaches us the importance of this process in Primary as our preteens fulfill the requirements in the <i>Faith in God</i> booklets. The same is true of our Young Men and Young Women programs, where you meet with a member of your bishopric to review your accomplishments in your <i>Personal Progress</i> or <i>Duty to God</i> booklet. You can continue to utilize some of these same concepts and principles in your adult life. How grateful I am for parents, teachers, mentors, friends, and my patriarchal blessing. Each were valuable resources for me in making crucial choices in my life.<br><h2><b>Budget Wisely</b></h2><br>Another important plate to spin well has to do with how we deal with our finances. As the husband in a newly married couple, I assumed the role of chief financial officer in our family. After three months my patient wife sat me down and helped me see that the direction I was taking us wasn't faring too well. Ralene had a degree in personal finance, and my creative, musical concepts of how to spend, save, and invest simply weren't working--largely because the last two elements (saving and investing) were missing from my financial formula! Fortunately I was willing to listen and learn. Each Sunday evening we would sit at the kitchen table to view financial ledger sheets she had prepared. When I started doing freelance work while going to school full-time, our income fluctuated from month to month. She was always able to demonstrate on those ledger sheets how the money I had projected we would earn the next month was already spent. Those were depressing meetings for me. I felt as if I was working hard for little or no gain. With time I was able to learn how to handle my spending habits. I made it a point to always pay the Lord as well as myself while also paying our bills.<br><h2><b>Closeness</b></h2><br>Our relationships with those we love is another essential plate that needs our attention. As our children were growing up, Ralene and Irealized that my time at home was too rare anoccasion. Since she grew up on a dairy farm, we also felt that working side by side with our children was an important part of their education and training. Eventually the idea was born to start a family band. The university steel band that I had formed years ago had met with a great deal of success. There seemed to be a never-ending supply of requests for off-campus performances, and often these came during the summer months when students were home and away from campus. We came up with the idea of a family steel band knowing that we would receive engagements because of the interest demonstrated by the university group. Instruments were purchased, and we began to rehearse. One of our earliest performances was to play poolside at a country club. It was a three-hour job, and we could only play 10 tunes. I knew we weren't ready to accept such a long engagement but took the job anyway because I felt that my children weren't putting enough effort into their personal practice or at our rehearsals. By playing this job they would learn just how much more they needed to prepare.<br><br>The appointed evening arrived. We set up our instruments and tried to look our professional best. We played all 10 of our tunes and took a break. That took up the first hour, and we hadn't had any real musical crisis. We played them again--this time in a different order--and took another break. We were into our final hour of the job. I called a certain tune--"Yellow Bird," a calypso that Harry Belafonte had made famous many years ago. Iwas just about to count off the tune when one of the guests at the party came up to me and asked, "You're not going to play 'Yellow Bird' again, are you?"<br><br>"No sir," I replied, quickly calling another tune and hoping that he was well on the other side of the pool before we even thought of playing "Yellow Bird" again. Needless to say, we learned a great deal from that experience and have since learned from many other opportunities performing at conventions, arts festivals, performing arts tours, and even performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Conference Center.<br><br>The band went through several transformations as children grew into and out of the band. Ryan now works as a scientist in Salt Lake City, Regan performs with the Army Blues Jazz Big Band in Washington, D.C., and Roger is serving a mission in South Korea. With only Robyn remaining at home, we tried to keep the family band going by hiring some of my colleagues and musical heroes. They are great musicians, and it was a thrill to have them in the band.<br><br>At the end of one of our performances, my wife looked at me and said, "This isn't fun anymore. It feels like work." I knew what she meant. Although these newcomers to our band were great musicians, the band had become something more than an ensemble. Our relationship as a family was a part of what made the music happen. We decided that evening to disband the family band.<br><br>This experience reminds me of an important scripture: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Our family band served many purposes. It helped our children save for their missions, learn how to work together, develop their self-esteem, and have fun--all while providing a service to others. But this is a plate I no longer spin in my life, and I can channel those energies elsewhere.<br><h2><b>Study the Scriptures</b></h2><br>Regular study of the scriptures as a family and as individuals has always been a part of our family culture. When our two youngest children, Roger and Robyn, were still preschool age, we each took a turn reading a verse. It was painful to listen to these two read an entire verse of scripture. I would cringe when they had a longer verse to read, but we kept at it. They eventually became great readers, and we learned to better understand the scriptures together.<br><br>When Robyn was a senior in high school and the only one left at home, she came to me and said, "Dad, why do we still need to read the scriptures together as a family? You know I love the scriptures, and, according to Elder Eyring, that is the purpose of family scripture study."<br><br>I went and found the <i>Ensign</i> and read the article. Sure enough, Elder Henry B. Eyring had said:<br><br><i>It's important to read the scriptures together in a way that lets your children know you include them because you love them. However, reading together may break down during the teenage years. Teens may say, "I'd rather read on my own." My encouragement to families in that situation is to see that as victory, not defeat. Your child may be saying, "I'm getting something when I'm alone that I don't get when we're all here together." Take that as a wonderful sign that scripture study is beginning to take hold in your teen's heart. The main purpose is to fall in love with the scriptures and feast upon them, whether we are alone or together.</i> ["A Discussion on Scripture Study," <i>Ensign,</i> July 2005, 25]<br><br>Wow! I had to really alter my thinking. Robyn <i>did</i> love the scriptures and read them every night before retiring to bed. And yet I didn't want to give up that experience because it brought a great spirit into our home. What could we do differently as a family to make our time together more effective for her as well as for us? We counseled together and learned that she wanted help with memorizing her scripture mastery scriptures that year in seminary. She also wanted to read the <i>Preach My Gospel</i> manual that was newly published. We did both. She continued reading scriptures her way in her personal study, and we all learned the scripture mastery scriptures and studied the <i>Preach My Gospel</i> manual together. It was a wonderful experience for all three of us--even though I am a terrible memorizer.<br><h2><b>Find Time to Relax</b></h2><br>Since my career has also been my favorite hobby, I usually have difficulty taking time off from music-making to exercise, relax, and simply recreate. Often our first family vacations consisted of brief camping trips or visits with family. Too many times I considered tours with musical groups as vacations. It took years for my family to convince me that we needed to just "get away" and have time together without work-related distractions. It has been a conscious effort for me to now plan a family vacation where work is not involved. The memories made and the experiences learned have become priceless. I shudder to think of the opportunities missed when I was so busy spinning unnecessary "music-making plates" in lieu of spending time relaxing with my wife and children.<br><h2><b>Family Home Evening</b></h2><br>Another family activity we were fairly consistent with was weekly family home evenings. Our Church leaders have taught us over and over again the importance of this weekly event and the ways that it can strengthen us and help us both individually and collectively. I am very grateful for a wife who took every opportunity to teach principles to our children. She didn't wait for Monday night to teach them. When a question was asked, it was a teaching opportunity. When there was a disagreement, it was a teaching opportunity. My father was the first to point this out to me. When he was visiting our home, he took me aside and asked if I had noticed how Ralene had just instructed one of our children. I am sure he asked that question knowing full well that I wasn't even remotely aware of what she had just done.<br><br>Growing a garden was an important part of our children's upbringing. We always included the children in planting, weeding, and harvesting. One lesson that I learned early one Saturday morning from my wife had to do with weeding the garden. The night before we had had a rehearsal with our family band and were working on a new musical number. Ralene had had some difficulty in making her part fit with the rest of the band. She was a bit anxious and would rush some of the rhythmical figures, and it just didn't groove. We stopped to talk about the problem. Many of the children offered their suggestions to help her, but each time we played that part of the tune, she continued to rush. I didn't realize how frustrating this was for her until I asked her a simple question while pulling weeds the next morning in the garden. "Is this a plant or a weed?" I asked, looking at an array of green sprouts.<br><br>She stared at me wide-eyed and replied, "You can't tell, can you?"<br><br>My response was, "I wouldn't have asked if I knew which of these to pull and which to leave planted."<br><br>Then came the teaching moment. "Now you know how I felt last night in rehearsal."<br><br>Looking down at the ground, I had no idea which of those little green things to leave in the soil. What a great way to help me understand how she must have felt the night before, doing her best to play her notes but not knowing what to do differently to "make it groove."<br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>Elder Ballard's final suggestion for us to keep our balance in this world and in the eternal scheme of things is prayer. As a bishop, when I interview youth, I am amazed at how many young people are faithful at saying their personal prayers at night but seldom pray in the morning. When I ask why they choose not to pray in the morning, the excuses vary, but most center on the fact that they get up too late and simply don't have the time. My next question to them is, "When you sin and make mistakes, isn't it more frequently from the time you wake up until you retire at night, or do those things occur more often from the time you fall asleep until you get up in the morning?" They are quick at getting my point.<br><br>We need our prayers just as much, if not more, at the start of our day. I can recall periods in my life when I was less consistent with morning personal prayers compared to evening prayers. Inevitably I was asking Heavenly Father in those evening prayers for forgiveness for my many mistakes and shortcomings. When I took the time in the morning to gather my thoughts, plan my day, and pray for His help and guidance, my evening prayers were frequently filled with thanksgiving for the good things that had transpired.<br><br>Family prayer is a great way to teach principles and feel love for those with whom we live. There is nothing sweeter than for me to hear my companion pray in my behalf. Hopefully she has similar feelings when I pray for her in our family prayers. Our good neighbor LaDawn Jacob often makes the statement that leaving the house without family prayer is like leaving the house naked.<br><br>Prayer is a tool to help us commune with our Father in Heaven. It is also the vehicle He can use to reveal His will to us.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball's words are direct, but worth our personal reflection:<br><br><i>Do you get answers to your prayers? If not, perhaps you did not pay the price. Do you offer a few trite words and worn-out phrases, or do you talk intimately to the Lord? Do you pray occasionally when you should be praying regularly, often, constantly? Do you offer pennies to pay heavy debts when you should give dollars to erase that obligation?</i><br><br><i>When you pray, do you just speak, or do you also listen? Your Savior said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." (Rev. 3:20.) . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The Lord stands knocking. He never retreats. But he will never force himself upon us. If we ever move apart, it is we who move and not the Lord. And should we ever fail to get an answer to our prayers, we must look into our lives for a reason.</i> ["Prayer," <i>New Era,</i> March 1978, 17]<br><br>In many of the examples shared today, you may have noticed that frequently I was the one making adjustments. It wasn't enjoyable to admit my lack of financial prowess and to attend those budget meetings with my wife, nor was it always easy or fun trying to make music with my family in our first few attempts to rehearse and perform. The gentle rebuke by my young son regarding his career preference, "caving in" to my daughter's desire to memorize scripture mastery scriptures, and pulling weeds in the garden were perhaps uncomfortable situations at first glance that proved to be great blessings in my life, not spineless acts of trying to please. These experiences were shared not to boast, brag, or indict. They were shared because all of us need to make changes.<br><br>We can make changes for the better. We fought for that right in the premortal existence. The ability to make choices is what allows us to "come unto Christ," as Moroni so eloquently stated at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon (Moroni 10:30, 32). There are times when we must push forward and not give in, but there are also times when we need to reconsider and alter our direction or approach.<br><br>This quote by Elder Neal A. Maxwell has been very helpful to me:<br><br><i>I am going to preach a hard doctrine to you now. The submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then we've really given Him the one final thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no lessening of our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy.</i> ["Insights from My Life," <i>Ensign,</i> August 2000, 9]<br><br>Whether we choose to use all eight suggestions offered by Elder Ballard or follow the advice of any number of experts in the field of "life balance," the important thing to remember is that those of us with the gift of the Holy Ghost need to utilize that gift. Having the gift of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon us is one thing. Having the <i>influence</i> of the Holy Ghost in our lives is another. Submitting our personal will to that of our Father in Heaven allows us to receive much-needed inspiration and revelation. We don't have to be an apostle, Relief Society president, or elders quorum president to have that influence in our lives.<br><br>Elder Robert D. Hales reinforced this concept as he spoke to us in our last general conference:<br><br><i>As faithful children, youth, parents, teachers, and leaders, we may receive personal revelation more frequently than we realize. The more we receive and acknowledge personal revelation, the more our testimonies grow. As a bishop, my testimony grew each time I received revelation to extend callings to ward members. That testimony has been strengthened each time I witness General Authorities and officers, Area Seventies, and stake presidents called or given new assignments. More importantly, I am strengthened by the personal revelations I receive in my role as a son of God, a husband, and a father. I am so thankful for the guidance and direction of the Spirit in our home as we seek for direction in family matters.</i> ["Personal Revelation: The Teachings and Examples of the Prophets," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 88]<br><br>Each of us has the ability to receive the direction we need to achieve a balanced life. My hope and prayer is that we will do what we need to do to have the influence of our Father in Heaven in our lives. As we do our part, I testify that He will do His part to bring us eternal life and joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ronald Brough was a professor of music at Brigham YoungUniversity when this devotional address was given on 11 December 2007.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.
