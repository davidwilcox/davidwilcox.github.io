<h1>eakable Gift of the Holy Ghost - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Jensen and I are pleased to be with you. I sincerely thank the choir for not only how they sang, but also for what they sang. Hymns do invite the Spirit of the Lord. They create a feeling of reverence and teach us the doctrines of the kingdom. This is a very humbling assignment, and I have prayed, and continue to pray, for the Holy Ghost to be our true teacher.<br><br>My message is titled "The Unspeakable Gift of the Holy Ghost," a phrase from the Doctrine and Covenants: "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now" (D&amp;amp;C 121:26). You may recognize a few thoughts from a general conference talk I gave in October 2010. With the time given me for this message today, I will expand them further.<br><h2><b>The Importance of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br><b> </b>The importance of the Holy Ghost and that He is an unspeakable gift may be emphasized with two illustrations, each a message in its own right. The first illustration is from the Book of Mormon and the second from an event in Church history.<br><br>When Jesus Christ visited the people in the Book of Mormon, He taught them, blessed their children, instituted the sacrament, and then departed. The people returned to their homes and labored through the night to gather others to be at the place where He said He would appear to them the next day.<br><br>Because of the large numbers, the twelve disciples separated the people into twelve groups to teach them what the Savior had taught them the previous day, and then they prayed. Of all the things for which they could pray, "they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them" (3 Nephi 19:9), giving an emphasis to the Holy Ghost and His importance that is unique in all scripture.<br><br>Following their prayer and in answer to their pleadings, Nephi baptized the disciples, after which "the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire" (3 Nephi 19:13). They received the convincing witness or testimony of Him.<br><br>The Savior then appeared to them:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that Jesus . . . went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:</i><br><br><i> Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen. . . .</i><br><br><i> Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.</i> [3 Nephi 19:19–21]<br><br>I know of no scriptural passage that better expresses how important our Savior feels the Holy Ghost is.<br><br>The second illustration comes from the teachings of President Brigham Young. The Saints were in Winter Quarters and preparing for the migration to the West in the spring. Joseph Smith had been dead for over two and one half years. President Young had a vision, a dream, in which he visited with the Prophet Joseph Smith. As you listen, please note the number of times he emphasized the importance of the Spirit of the Lord:<br><br><i>"Brother Joseph, the brethren . . . have a great anxiety to understand the . . . sealing principles; and if you have a word of counsel for me I should be glad to receive it."</i><br><br><i> Joseph stepped toward me, and looking very earnestly, yet pleasantly said, "Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren if they will follow the spirit of the Lord they will go right. Be sure to tell the people to keep the Spirit of the Lord; and if they will, they will find themselves just as they were organized by our Father in Heaven before they came into the world. Our Father in Heaven organized the human family. . . ."</i><br><br><i> Joseph then showed me the pattern, how they were in the beginning. This I cannot describe, but I saw it, and saw where the Priesthood had been taken from the earth and how it must be joined together, so that there would be a perfect chain from Father Adam to his latest posterity. Joseph again said, "Tell the people to be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and follow it, and it will lead them just right."</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Not only does this account emphasize the importance of the Holy Ghost and seeking His influence, it also brought to my mind these principles and truths:<br><ul><br>	<li>The Spirit of the Lord seeks to bring order--specifically, to organize an eternal family through the ordinance of a temple sealing.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The adversary seeks to disorganize and to destroy (see D&amp;amp;C 10:6–7, 22–27), especially families, as evidenced today by abortion, divorce, and same-gender marriage. I asked myself if the growing practice in your age group of postponing marriage contributes to disorganizing families.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Revelation and knowledge through the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost came in answer to a question, as revelation often does.</li><br></ul><br>From these two illustrations I conclude that the Holy Ghost is vital and that we should earnestly seek His companionship, guidance, and gifts--truly an unspeakable gift.<br><br>I will now focus on three themes: (1) the missions of the Holy Ghost, (2) conditions to receive the Holy Ghost, and (3) how to recognize direction from the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>The Missions of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br><b> </b>The Holy Ghost is sometimes called the Spirit, appropriately called the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, and the Comforter.<br><br>The Holy Ghost has certain missions or responsibilities. I will mention four.<br><br><i>Mission 1--He testifies of or reveals the Father and the Son. </i>The Holy Ghost truly reveals or testifies of the Father and the Son. I experienced this as a young child, even though I could not have articulated it then.<br><br>I grew up believing in God in a wonderful Latter-day Saint home. I was baptized and received the Holy Ghost at age eight. I never questioned the existence of the Father and the Son; rather, in our family there was a full and complete acceptance, a worship and a faith in Them evidenced by regular family prayer, pausing to bless the food at each meal, family night, reading from the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Church attendance, obedience to the commandments, and all the other things we do as Latter-day Saints. I personally could not turn to the scriptures to teach the doctrine that the principal role of the Holy Ghost is to reveal God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, but as a matter of faith, I certainly understood the principle.<br><br>During my mission I began a daily study of the scriptures. My scriptural knowledge, my testimony, and my faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ, were strengthened by divine doctrine, by spiritual experiences, and by personal revelation. I know of myself that these words from the Savior are true: "And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men, because of me" (3 Nephi 28:11; see also the chapter summary to 3 Nephi 27 and 3 Nephi 27:13–20).<br><br><i>Mission 2--He testifies of all truth.</i> The Holy Ghost reveals the truth of all things. Sincere seekers who read the Book of Mormon and pray and ponder with real intent to know of its truthfulness are promised they will know it is true, "and by the power of the Holy Ghost [they] may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5).<br><br>Alma invited the poor people cast out by the Zoramites to conduct experiments with words. Specifically, he emphasized to them that true words planted in receptive hearts would "begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good" (Alma 32:28), resulting in three ways they would know the truth:<br><br>1. "It beginneth to enlarge my soul," evidenced in sincere seekers of truth by tears, a sigh, a nod of the head, or some other body gesture that the Holy Ghost had planted true words in their hearts.<br><br>2. "It beginneth to enlighten my understanding," evidenced by comments such as "that makes sense" or "I have always believed that" or a question, "Are you saying then that . . . ?"<br><br>3. "It beginneth to be delicious to me," evidenced, for example, by investigators with comments like "please tell me more" or "where did you say your church is located?" or "won't you stay a little longer and teach us more?"--meaning they are hungry and want more.<br><br>The testimony of Brigham Young illustrates these truths:<br><br><i>If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been combined in one individual, and that person had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by his learning and worldly wisdom, it would have been to me like the smoke which arises only to vanish. But when I saw a man without eloquence, or talents for public speaking, who could only just say, "I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the Lord." The Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminates my understanding, and light, glory, and immortality is before me; I am encircled by it, filled with it, and know for myself that the testimony of the man is true.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br><i>Mission 3--He sanctifies.</i> The word <i>sanctify</i> comes from the Latin and has two roots: <i>sanct,</i> meaning "holy," and <i>facere,</i> meaning "to do or to make"--literally meaning "to make holy." In our religious use of the word, <i>sanctify</i> simply means to purify or make free from sin, a central message of the restored gospel.<br><br>The gospel is "God's plan of salvation, made possible through the atonement of Jesus Christ [and] includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to enter back into the presence of God."<sup>3</sup><br><br>The sanctifying role of the Holy Ghost is relevant in the context of the Savior's definition of His gospel in 3 Nephi 27:13–20, concluding with this significant verse: "Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20). The Holy Ghost is the sanctifier, and because of Him and through the infinite Atonement we may stand spotless, clean, and pure.<br><br>In different callings where I held priesthood keys as a judge in Israel, particularly as a bishop, I witnessed the cleansing, sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. One experience, the elements of which represent others, truly stands out.<br><br>On a Sunday morning a young man in his early twenties came to see me, his bishop. During the week he and his girlfriend had allowed their emotions and passions to exceed the bounds the Lord had established.<br><br>I listened prayerfully. We read scriptures together, along with words of the latter-day prophets. I gave him a few reading assignments, placed appropriate restrictions on his Church privileges, set up future appointments, and then knelt with him in prayer.<br><br>With each subsequent interview he reported on his reading, especially from the Book of Mormon, and the anguish in his countenance and demeanor was replaced by faith in God and in His Son, by hope and optimism, by firm resolve, and by a change in his heart. Gradually he grew spiritually. Following the appropriate passage of time, and as directed by the Spirit, I lifted the restrictions placed on him and authorized him to partake of the sacrament. As I sat on the stand in sacrament meeting, my eyes were drawn to him when first the bread and then the water reached his row. I witnessed sanctifying light, peace, and forgiveness.<br><br>The Savior's words to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery following their partaking of the sacrament came into my mind: "Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice" (D&amp;amp;C 110:5). Like Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, this young man received a remission of his sins by fire and the Holy Ghost (see 2 Nephi 31:17; D&amp;amp;C 19:31).<br><br>Not only did this young man experience the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost, so also can you and I experience the same freedom from sin Sabbath after Sabbath after Sabbath.<br><br><i>Mission 4--the teacher.</i> With all that can be said about learning and teaching, I summarize it simply by saying that the Holy Ghost is the true teacher. In the ten verses in Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–22, the odd-numbered verses are questions, and the even-numbered verses are the Lord's answers. As I read verses 13 and 14, please note two roles and what each does:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question--unto what were ye ordained?</i><br><br><i> To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth.</i><br><br>The role of the Holy Ghost is to teach. He is the true teacher! My role is not to cover material or get through the lesson; rather, as a holder of the priesthood, I am to preach, teach, expound, exhort, warn, and invite by the Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 20:59).<br><br>My role is to be an instrument in creating an atmosphere for the Spirit to do what He does in the divine process described in verse 22 of section 50: "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together."<br><br>Nephi concluded his writings and expressed his inadequacies as well as his correct understanding of the role of the Holy Ghost:<br><br><i>And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</i> [2 Nephi 33:1]<br><br>Note the preposition <i>unto</i> and not <i>into.</i> Because of our agency, He carries it <i>unto</i> our hearts. If we invite Him, He will carry it <i>into</i> our hearts, as is taught in the book of Revelation: "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20).<br><br>I witness to you that He has other important responsibilities or missions. He is the Comforter. He restrains or constrains, He leads, He warns, and He rebukes. I invite you to study them on your own. I will now speak about conditions to receive the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>Conditions to Receive the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br><b> </b>Conditions or requirements to receive the Holy Ghost are simple. I will mention only three: (1) desire, which for me includes ask, seek, and knock; (2) worthiness; and (3) alertness--both spiritual and physical.<br><br>The words <i>desire, ask, seek,</i> and <i>knock</i> are often found in scripture together, and they are fundamental to receiving the Holy Ghost and His unspeakable gifts. Alma taught that God grants "unto men according to their desire" (Alma 29:4).<br><br>I draw your attention to these words in Doctrine and Covenants 11, a revelation of the Lord to Hyrum Smith. The word <i>desire</i> and its cognates appear eight times. Perhaps one of the most well-known and oft-cited is in verse 21. It brings together <i>seek, desire,</i> the <i>word,</i> and the <i>Spirit--</i>resulting in the power of God: "Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you <i>desire,</i> you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men" (emphasis added).<br><br>Next, <i>worthiness.</i> To have the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, we must keep the commandments. I believe you know what evils offend the Spirit, and I will not mention them. A sentence from my patriarchal blessing has guided me: "Jay, keep your body free from the temptations and evils that present themselves. Live clean and fine for our Heavenly Father's Spirit dwells in clean tabernacles. [He] does not dwell in unclean tabernacles." I found that this is supported in the Book of Mormon: "The Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" (Helaman 4:24).<br><br><i>Alertness--physical and spiritual.</i> We live in a very busy world when many things clamor for our time and attention. It is by design that we encourage punctuality to meetings, especially sacrament meeting, to listen to the prelude music, prepare to have the Spirit, and receive revelation. We fast, we pray, we ponder, we attend the temple, and we learn to be good listeners and observers.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith illustrated being physically and spiritually alert when he received the revelation we call the vision of the redemption of the dead, found in Doctrine and Covenants 138:<br><br><i>On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</i><br><br><i> And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 138:1–2]<br><br>I visualize President Smith seated in a chair, perhaps a wooden chair, at a table with the scriptures in front of him along with pen and paper. He was not lying on a couch or slouched in a chair.<br><br>President David O. McKay emphasized the importance of being spiritually and physically alert with the story of Bishop John Wells, a former member of the Presiding Bishopric, whose son was killed in a railroad accident. A few weeks after the funeral, the mother was resting at home, mourning her son's death, spiritually and physically alert. The son appeared to her and told her that when he realized he was in the spirit world, he first tried to reach his father but could not, and he said to her that his dad was too busy at the office.<sup>4</sup><br><br>In many of our General Authority training meetings, presidents of the Church and apostles have reminded us to not be so busy doing the Lord's work that spiritual impressions cannot get through to us.<br><h2><b>How to Recognize Direction from the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br><b> </b>I find it difficult to teach how to recognize direction, guidance, and spiritual promptings. Such experiences are personal and often tailored to the individual and to the conditions I just described. There are a few patterns, however, that I have experienced, and I have learned from others.<br><br>One is <i>peace to your mind.</i> The Lord taught a struggling Oliver Cowdery a powerful lesson when He reminded him, "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23). I believe receiving peace to the mind is one of the most common ways to recognize direction from the Holy Ghost. Synonyms of <i>peace</i> are <i>serenity, tranquility, harmony,</i> and <i>stillness,</i> while its opposites are <i>confusion, anxiety, distraction, stirred up,</i> and <i>disharmony. </i>We often use the words "I don't feel good about this" or "I don't feel comfortable." Such feelings find their home in the next principle: <i>mind and heart.</i><br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i> Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>I have learned from the First Presidency and from the Quorum of the Twelve, as well as through my own experiences, that revelations to the mind are often specific words, ideas, even sentences, while revelations to the heart are general feelings associated with peace. Illustrations from the life of Enos are instructive: Verses 3 and 9 in his story describe a general feeling with these phrases: "joy . . . sunk deep into my heart" and "I began to feel." In verses 5 and 10 we find complete sentences, each introduced with "there came a voice unto me, saying" and "the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying."<br><br>Receiving feelings to the heart and thoughts in the mind are taught succinctly in these words to Hyrum Smith:<br><br><i>I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i> And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 11:13–14]<br><br>Another one is to <i>study it out in your minds.</i> An oft-quoted scripture about recognizing revelation and promptings from the Holy Ghost is Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–9:<br><br><i>You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i> But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks wisely taught that a person may have<br><br><i>a strong desire to be led by the Spirit of the Lord but . . . unwisely extends that desire to the point of wanting to be led in </i>all<i> things. A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. . . .</i><br><br><i> We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment. Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>President Boyd K. Packer has wisely taught:<br><br><i>You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as </i>compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand<i> do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Another is <i>"your bosom shall burn within you,"</i><b> </b>the phrase from Doctrine and Covenants 9:8. Concerning this burning of the bosom, as a returned mission president I was called to serve on a committee with other returned presidents to find ways to improve proselyting. A suggestion was given to help missionaries experience and recognize the burning of the bosom as taught in Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–9. The committee chairman, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and a former mission president, shared an experience he had had with a member of the Quorum of the Twelve who had toured his mission. During the tour this wonderful mission president taught the importance of these three verses.<br><br>Following the meeting and while driving to the next one, the member of the Twelve pointed out that in his years of experience he had found members who felt a failure in seeking revelation through a burning of the bosom, even after much fasting and prayer. They had not understood that the burning of the bosom is not related to caloric heat but rather to an intensity of feeling--the peace to the mind and feelings to the heart mentioned earlier.<br><br>Many may relate to the converts in the Book of Mormon who "were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not" (3 Nephi 9:20).<br><br>In a revelation to Hyrum Smith, we find four ways to recognize how the Spirit leads us: "Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth [1] to do good--yea, [2] to do justly, [3] to walk humbly, [and 4] to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 11:12).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>How do we know the things of the Spirit? How do we know that it is from God? By the fruits of it. If it leads to growth and development, if it leads to faith and testimony, if it leads to a better way of doing things, if it leads to godliness, then it is of God. If it tears us down, if it brings us into darkness, if it confuses us and worries us, if it leads to faithlessness, then it is of the devil.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Another one: <i>A subject may occupy the mind or weigh continually upon you.</i> This truth from Joseph Smith's epistle on baptism for the dead is another way that the Spirit speaks: "That subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest" (D&amp;amp;C 128:1). Having impressions that persist until we act are real and sacred.<br><br>While presiding over the Colombia Cali Mission, I was studying scripture late one evening, after 10:00 p.m. A thought came into my mind to telephone an elder. I had recently interviewed him and knew he had had a few challenges, and I set the thought aside. The impression came again, and using the same reasoning, again I set it aside. It came a third time, and finally I recognized the impression for what it was, and I telephoned him. His companion was in bed and answered. I asked to speak to the elder I was impressed to call. He said he was not in his bed.<br><br>"Set the phone down and find him," I said.<br><br>He was found across the patio, talking to a young woman who had moved in that day. The elders moved to a new apartment the next day.<br><br>To conclude, I cite a significant experience and wise counsel from President Wilford Woodruff. In his travels he reported that Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and other early Church leaders appeared to him. On one occasion Brigham Young (who had died three years earlier) appeared to him:<br><br><i>When we arrived at our destination I asked President Young if he would preach to us. He said, "No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh. I shall not talk to this people any more." "But," said he, "I have come to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people are doing." Then, said he, "I want you to teach the people--and I want you to follow this counsel yourself--that they must labor and so live as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God.</i>"<sup>8</sup><br><br>I humbly pray that you will desire more earnestly to be worthy of the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that you may grow in the ability to recognize His promptings, that you may "be still and know" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16) the Father and the Son through the Holy Ghost, and that you will express gratitude for Him and His guidance, for to express gratitude invites more of the Spirit.<br><br>By the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, I know that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration and that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. I know the Father and the Son live. They are real. The Holy Ghost testifies of all truth. He sanctifies, and He teaches. We are led today by living prophets, seers, and revelators, true apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. These fifteen men are guided by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jay E.

<h1>ppreciate BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We welcome you this morning at the beginning of a new year and a new semester. We are grateful to be here with you and believe you feel the same way.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>We hope you have had very enjoyable Christmas and New Year's holidays and now look forward to both the excitement and rigors of winter semester. We also hope that you haven't yet completely broken all of your New Year's resolutions!<br><br><b>COS:</b>We have now been at BYU in our current assignments for a few years--not long enough to have grown tired of this adventure but long enough to have developed some experience and also the ability to observe some recurrent patterns in the way things are done, as well as the somewhat predictable ways in which people react to us and to our campus environment.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>That is right. Never have we been in a place in which we have been treated so well by so many helpful and friendly people. But we are still occasionally bemused, if not surprised, by the frequent question posed to us by those wondering where our allegiances are today. It is true that neither of us attended BYU as students. It is also true that we have always been unfailingly loyal to the schools we have attended while there, and especially are we fully committed to where we currently reside. We are dyed-in-the-wool Cougars! Most often, the question seems to be related to athletics, but our responses are both much more inclusive and expansive.<br><br><b>COS:</b>When our absolute loyalty and allegiance to BYU seem to be occasionally questioned or perhaps not fully understood, I often remark that I assume the questioner has never been in the office of the president of the Church. When I was called by President Gordon B. Hinckley to take this leadership assignment at BYU, he said, "We would like you to . . . put on a blue coat." By that he meant he expected and charged us with putting all our loyalties, energies, and enthusiasm behind the cause that we know as Brigham Young University. Even in the face of our obvious inadequacies, we believe we have done so.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>On the very day that President Hinckley introduced my husband as the new president of BYU, he, as the president-elect, was asked at a news conference how he might adjust to this new assignment and set of loyalties. He responded that our shift in priorities had been happily occasioned by the call of the prophet of God. I did not have a blue jacket myself but knew this admonition from the prophet applied equally to me. I then got to go shopping, and what woman doesn't like that opportunity? I know that he and I have never looked back and have been forever grateful since for the remarkable privilege to serve at and be involved with Brigham Young University. While we continue to learn and be positively amazed, we have felt absolutely at home from the very beginning. We already knew the first day that BYU is great, and it has been even better than we could have imagined.<br><br><b>COS:</b>That is probably more than you care to hear about us. We really want to focus today on some of the many things we appreciate about BYU. We believe our gratitude is enhanced and sharpened especially because we did not come to BYU early in our lives and careers. This is not to detract in any way from the other pleasant communities in which we have lived or the other universities where we have learned and served. We are grateful for them all, but BYU is particularly special in ways that perhaps none of us fully appreciates and that may not be fully recognized by those who have not been elsewhere or who have not experienced the disappointment of not being invited to serve at or attend BYU.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>We do not have nearly enough time today to describe all that we appreciate so very much. What we do say will be almost in shorthand form, but hopefully it will reflect our appreciation and gratitude for what has shaped and is influencing the lives of those who are able to have a BYU experience. We believe BYU helps us all be better people, but we must always remember that does not mean that anyone here is better than anyone else not directly connected to this unique university. Nevertheless, we would be very ungrateful not to acknowledge the many special blessings that are part of being at Brigham Young University. Let us just mention some of the things that most impress us, and we will comment more fully on a few.<br><br>We love the people we meet at BYU. This includes, of course, the students, faculty, staff, and administration, but also the many loyal supporters, donors, and friends who contribute in such significant and diverse ways.<br><br><b>COS:</b>We love the Spirit of the Y. We know this means different things to different people. Even those who know little about the university or our sponsoring church often remark about feeling something different and special when on our campus. For those of us who know the history and roots of this great school, we recognize that in large part our current blessings are possible because of the sacrifices for and confidence in the future that so many of our predecessors experienced in much more difficult times.<br><br>We love the beauty and functionality of the campus. The fall 2011 issue of<i>BYU Magazine</i>highlights the history of the physical facilities of this remarkable institution. I hope the story of the development, growth, and maturation of our university becomes better known to all of us as well as to others. In it we find the source of many miracles that perhaps we take a little too much for granted today as we face the challenges and opportunities of our current circumstances.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Most complex organizations, including universities, have mission and vision statements and strategic plans. In that broad sense, BYU is similar to other institutions. However--and this is very important--the content of<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>(Provo: BYU, 1996) differs dramatically from the content of similar documents of almost all other distinguished institutions of higher learning. The mission of Brigham Young University "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (p. 1). Not only is the statement itself quite unique, but such an assertion would not be tolerated or accepted at virtually any other serious university not part of our Church Educational System.<br><br>The aims of a BYU education are an extension of our mission and are expressed as the expected outcomes of the BYU experience. They are, first, to be "spiritually strengthening"; second, to be "intellectually enlarging"; and third, "character building"; leading to, fourth, "lifelong learning and service" (p. 3).<br><br>We believe the mission and aims to be true and reflective of what BYU is and tries to be. They also represent so much of what we observe, feel, and appreciate about Brigham Young University.<br><br><b>COS:</b>In a similar vein, we are very grateful for the BYU Honor Code. As those familiar with our history understand, the Honor Code was instituted by student initiative and continues to be ratified and supported by our board of trustees. Some are confused by what they perceive as imperfections in the Honor Code. What they really do not understand is that it is not based on regulatory control by the administration but rather is a commitment of those accepting the opportunity to be part of the BYU community to live lives of honor. And the expectation rightly is that each of us here will be self-policing with respect to compliance. We have all promised to live our lives in certain ways that admittedly may be at variance with some of the slipping standards of the world. We have promised to be honest in all of our dealings, treat others and the institution with respect, and be personally responsible for all dimensions of our conduct and behavior. Some aspects may seem more important or relevant than others. But, as with the Word of Wisdom (see Doctrine and Covenants 89), living the Honor Code brings blessings that result from obedience to high standards. In our case, by signing our names we have promised not only our conformity but also that we understand the BYU standards of honor and willingly will live them. And, like the Word of Wisdom, the Honor Code is "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all [BYU students]" (D&amp;amp;C 89:3).<br><br>Another admirable dimension of the Honor Code that will not likely be apparent or even considered by you current students is that it stays with you throughout your lives. With few but notable individual exceptions, BYU graduates are known to be honorable people with integrity in all of its dimensions. We hear this from employers, associates, government and military leaders, and others.<br><br>Frequently I receive letters with checks from former students who confess a misdeed that occurred while at BYU--often many years previously. An unnecessary burden has been carried for a long time, and yet there is a drive to make things right even when no one else knows of the transgression, or at least who was responsible. While repentance is always laudable, it is unfortunate to bear such a load for so long. When you make a mistake or commit a sin, own up to it and make it right sooner rather than later. We greatly admire all of you who do exactly that.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>One of the continual challenges of the Honor Code for some is trying to decide how far to push the envelope or how close to the line to walk with respect to matters that they might consider less consequential than major violations like cheating, stealing, and illegal or immoral activities. I hear my husband often telling young men with more than a day's worth of whiskers that they need to get together with Brother Gillette, Brother Bic, or Brother Schick. Some pretend not to understand that they need to shave regularly and frequently, but the look in their eye betrays that almost always they do understand the commitment they have made.<br><br>As you walk across campus and are in classrooms and buildings, you will unfortunately see just a few otherwise attractive and bright students who seem to fail to grasp the importance of modesty in their dress. As a mother who had candid discussions with my own daughters when they were teens and approaching adulthood, I hope you will realize, if you do not already, the vital importance of modesty in dress and apparel. You know what I mean. It is my hope and prayer that all of you will think, consider, and act as you must to be modest in your appearance and reflect the regard you have for the sacredness of your bodies. All of us are examples whether we wish to be or not. Let us again commit to being tastefully modest in our dress and behavior and institute the appropriate changes if necessary. We appreciate those of you who are doing just as is asked of all of us. Please remember that modesty is much more a matter of attitude and respect than it is of hair length, necklines, hemlines, or spandex stretching.<br><br><b>COS:</b>As Sister Samuelson mentions the importance of our appearance and conduct, let us also mention how very proud we are of so many of you--including members of our performing groups, student athletes, and others of the student body--who represent BYU, your families, and the Church so very well when you are in public. Even those with different standards than the ones we have chosen to follow recognize the positive impact that saying what we mean and meaning what we say has on our environment and those interacting with us. I express my thanks for what you do in this respect and add my request that we all continue to strive both to do our best personally and also to help others do so. It is not always comfortable to suggest to others the continual need for sensitivity and judgment in these matters, and we hope you will be wise, thoughtful, and courageous. We also hope as you look outward that you make sure to look carefully and frequently in the mirror. In this we include not only you students but also faculty, staff, and administrators with gratitude for your efforts, thoughtfulness, and great examples. It is both a responsibility and a privilege to understand that none of us is ever completely off the stage.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Before we began this fully immersed experience at BYU, we had the blessing of being on campus several times for various events. At least twice my husband in his General Authority assignments had the privilege of speaking at campus devotionals. Each time it was a highlight for us because of the way we were treated and the great spirit that we felt. We look forward to these devotional and forum assemblies. It is in these gatherings that we are instructed in the important matters of faith and doctrine in our BYU context. Itis wonderful to know that on Tuesday mornings we will be taught and edified and have the opportunity to feel the Spirit if we come prepared. We gather as a community to hear from professors, Church leaders, and others who speak to us in ways and on topics not addressed in the same manner or in the same depth as they typically are in the classroom.<br><br>What a special blessing it was this past November to have President Thomas S. Monson visit campus and speak to us. Most of the young people in the Church around the world never have the experience of being with the prophet in a setting in which he knows us so well and loves us so much. We are grateful to attend and hope that you will also take advantage of this remarkable blessing that is not duplicated or even possible at otherwise excellent universities. We appreciate you being with us today and ask that you invite and encourage your friends and others in the community to always make 11:00 a.m. on Tuesdays a priority to participate in these unique opportunities.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Another distinctive blessing available at BYU, especially for single students, is the network of young adult wards and stakes that has been established. Although for some living off campus there have been modest changes resulting from the inclusion of all single young adults--whether students or not--in these great wards, the experience is a vital benefit of your BYU years. In these units of the Church you have the opportunities for service and growth not always possible in more traditional wards. Because so many members are students, the special challenges of your highly demanding academic programs are better understood and your callings and assignments take into account your student circumstances.<br><br>Over the years, while actively attending stake conferences throughout the world as a General Authority, I have regularly visited with Relief Society and priesthood leaders who have not only met their eternal companions at BYU or in a student ward elsewhere but also learned how to function as effective Church leaders at relatively young ages. Please be active and participate in your own wards.<br><br>We do not discourage you from visiting the wards of friends on occasion or going home for Sunday dinner with your parents and families when you are able. We strongly counsel you, however, to be regularly involved in your own ward so that you can fulfill callings, help bless the lives of other ward members needing friends, and do all that faithful Latter-day Saints should do so that you can always have a current temple recommend, whether for baptisms for the dead or, if you have been endowed, the other ordinances of the temple. With the recent announcement of a second temple in Provo, the First Presidency has made a strong statement of support for you and our neighbors in the area and particularly for the essentiality of temple worship and service for us all.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>My husband, his associates, and I love you students. Nevertheless, we are concerned that some of you miss out on opportunities to learn because you have yet to acquire the necessary habits of study and scholarship. All of you are very bright and come with impressive credentials. Otherwise you would not have been accepted as part of the student body.<br><br>I think my husband won't mind if I tell you that he became a much better student after we got serious in our courting relationship. A lot of our evenings were "library" dates. They improved our academic performance, and they were inexpensive too! He now remarks how some students seem shocked about the expectation that they will spend at least two hours studying and preparing outside of class for every hour in class. What that specific preparation is and how you study will vary. What will not change, however, is that it is impossible for you to get all you can from your classes and course work if you do not make the necessary independent effort to read, study, think, and read and study some more both before and after class.<br><br><b>COS:</b>She speaks the truth! When we arrived at BYU I was immediately impressed with the prominent place that mentoring occupies at our university. As many of you know, my own professional background is in medicine. As a student and a professor, the privileges of being both mentored and then later to be a mentor have been invaluable and fulfilling. My life has been better because of the several who have mentored me. What students sometimes do not understand is that mentoring continues throughout life--at least it continues in my case with my colleagues on the President's Council and with deans, directors, and other leaders. Without exception, these good people know and understand many important facts, principles, and situations better than do I. As they continue to teach, I continue to learn. Likewise, mentoring occurs differently in different disciplines. My advice to you students, whatever your major or your interests, is to do all you can to get to know your professors better and learn all you can from them about life and the gospel and not just about narrow curricular topics.<br><br>As BYU continues to emerge as an excellent and serious university of high quality, many across the country and around the world recognize that we are in the top rank of institutions producing outstanding baccalaureate graduates who then go on to receive PhD degrees and other doctorates at the best universities. These observers know what has happened here but often don't fully understand why. Of course we are blessed with students who are outstanding when they first arrive at BYU, but an understanding of the importance of the BYU experience from the perspective of an outsider may be very limited. Key to what happens here for many students is the mentoring that occurs.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>I think one of the best kinds of mentoring comes from reading. Studies show that today's young people, including university students, tend to read less than did previous generations. They also spend much more--and sometimes too much more--time on social media. Whatever else you do, be sure to increase your love of and proficiency in reading while you study at BYU. Learning to read carefully, critically, and even just for fun will broaden your understanding in many ways beyond the lessons that you are specifically trying to master. I hope you know that our faculty members are concerned about our students becoming better and more proficient writers. Reading well-written literature will be very helpful in developing and honing your own writing and communications skills. And you will likely experience, as I have, the development of a love of reading that will bring pleasure and growth to you throughout your lives.<br><br>We commend many of you who are or have been involved in various reading programs for children in schools and the community. Remember that it is never too soon to begin reading to your children. Not only will it build their love of books and reading, but it will also strengthen your love and bonds with them. In addition, this is a wonderful way to help your little ones develop an early love for the scriptures. The children's book department at the BYU Bookstore knows me well, because I am constantly purchasing books for our grandchildren. I want to help them build their own libraries of outstanding literature and encourage them to develop a love of reading.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Perhaps you are now thinking that we have morphed our emphasis away from things that we appreciate about BYU to things we hope you will consider more seriously. In fact, these are things that seem inseparable to us. Even in areas in which we have serious concerns and direct counsel, we appreciate BYU because we can talk about them candidly in ways that would not be possible or be as well understood at any other university. While this is a diverse community, we are largely united in agreement and understanding of our BYU mission and aims. We understand that our efforts and activities are enriched by our faith and also by the faith and prayers of our apostle and prophet leaders who do so much to protect and sustain BYU and all of us who are here. While we may not understand or fully appreciate all of the factors that go into their considerations about our university, we are grateful to attach our faith, prayers, and efforts to theirs in this great work.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>What was true from the very beginning of BYU when it was still just a tiny, struggling academy primarily teaching children and young adults with very little previous education is also true today.<br><br>I think we all know of Brigham Young's counsel to Karl G. Maeser as he sent him to Provo: "Brother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).<br><br>And other prophets and leaders frequently have quoted this inspired prophecy of President John Taylor:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br>President Taylor and other Church presidents have said much more, and we see the beginnings of recognition and appreciation coming to BYU from across the world.<br><br><b>COS:</b>A day does not go by for me since we have been here at BYU that I do not think of President Gordon B. Hinckley's instruction to help BYU become the best it can be. As I have thought about that general charge, it becomes clearer to me that this is a very special place. We have not yet achieved our full possibilities, but we have made progress.<br><br>Second, if the Lord's prophets are convinced that our potential will be realized, then we should be confident too and also then be committed to doing our parts, individually and collectively, to make it so. I am persuaded that all of this is true, and thus my appreciation for BYU is not constrained.<br><br>Likewise, we appreciate very much the individual miracles that occur at BYU in the lives of those who come here. So many meet their eternal companions in this wonderfully sustaining and encouraging environment. Missionary work takes place in remarkable ways. When Tom Holmoe, our outstanding athletic director, came to BYU as a nonmember undergraduate, he thought it was just to play football. Now he is a Church leader with a great eternal family. Professor Keith A. Crandall, an internationally recognized scientist, assumed he was coming to a fine academic department at BYU and found the Church with its many blessings, including the temple, in addition to the opportunity to make his many scholarly scientific contributions. You will think of others. We could give a long list of students who have been baptized here and then add the even much longer roster of those who have gained solid testimonies of the restored gospel because of their BYU experience. In addition, I mention those of our community but not of our faith who live lives of example and honor and who bring credit to this wonderful university as well as to their own religious traditions. All of these things and so many more contribute to the gratitude we feel for BYU and what it means to us and to the world.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>My dear brothers and sisters, I would express to you my testimony of the gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It has blessed every aspect of my life. I have a testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of His teachings. He has led my life to BYU, and I believe that He has led you here too, because He knew that it would bless you and that you would bless the lives of those you meet. I express this to you with my love in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>COS:</b>As I add my testimony to the things that Sharon has said and the things we have talked about, I would also like to suggest one additional thing that I appreciate about BYU. In over forty-seven years of married life together, in all of the jobs, assignments, choices I've made, and other activities, Sharon has been supportive. But often what I have done I have done alone. Here at BYU, as you have seen today, we have been able to do most of what we do together. And for that I am grateful. And for that I bear my witness that God is in the heavens and that His hand is on Brigham Young University and on all of us. May we be ever grateful and may we do all we can to take full advantage of the remarkable opportunities we have, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>re Organized into Quorums and Relief Societies - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your welcome today at Brigham Young University. I love this university, and I feel blessed by every opportunity to feel the spirit that is unique to this campus. Because of my service on the Church Board of Education, I can testify of the Lord's interest in this marvelous institution, and, in your honor, Iwore my best BYU blue today.<br><br>As I have pondered this opportunity to speak to you, a number of different subjects came to my mind. I thought I might try to add to the teaching you have had about dating, marriage, and establishing eternal families. Or some people suggested that I speak to you about your dress and appearance. I even thought about saying some things about what your mother wishes you had learned before you left home. But the Spirit has persisted in giving me ideas about why we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies.<br><br>Although this is probably an unusual topic for most of you to consider, I hope the Spirit will use me to teach you some things that will bless your lives as you continue to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and contribute to building His kingdom.<br><br>When I was a young girl my father was called to preside over the Brazilian Mission. Atthat time there was only one mission in Brazil. There were no stakes or wards; there wasn't an elders quorum in the country. That means there were no home teachers. There were over forty branches, which were generally presided over by missionaries who conducted a weekly sacrament meeting and sometimes held Sunday School and branch activities. My father had served as a stake president and a bishop prior to his call as a mission president, and he had an understanding of how to establish the Lord's Church. He began to organize branches and districts in the pattern we are familiar with today in anticipation of future stakes and wards.<br><br>To begin the organization, some priorities were followed. First, a branch president and then an elders quorum president and a Relief Society president were called. It was understood that there could be no functioning branch without a quorum president and aRelief Society president.<br><br>As the Prophet Joseph Smith began establishing the Church in this dispensation, the Lord directed him to follow similar inspired patterns. When he set the course for the Relief Society, he told the sisters they were organized "under the priesthood after the pattern of the priesthood."<sup>1</sup> This gave the sisters official responsibilities in the restored Church and the authority to function in those responsibilities. This was a pattern similar to that given to a president of a quorum of elders, who was to counsel with his presidency.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Before we can understand why we are thus organized, it may be helpful to review the definition of a priesthood quorum and a Relief Society. Many people have the mistaken idea that a quorum or a Relief Society is merely a class or a place to sit during the third hour of church on Sunday. Perhaps some of this misunderstanding started to develop when the Church combined its major meetings into a three-hour block on Sunday. Before that time quorum and Relief Society meetings were not connected with sacrament meeting or Sunday School.<br><br>A priesthood quorum is a group of men with the same office of priesthood who are to perform a special labor. Membership in a quorum has been called "a steady, sustaining citizenship."<sup>3</sup> President Boyd K. Packer has said that quorums are "selected assemblies of brethren given authority that [the Lord's] business might be transacted and His work proceed."<sup>4</sup> He also said that "in ancient days when a man was appointed to a select body, his commission, always written in Latin, outlined the responsibility of the organization, defined who should be members, and then invariably contained the words: <i>quorum vos unum</i> meaning, 'of whom we will that you be one.'"<sup>5</sup><br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball taught that "the Relief Society is the Lord's organization for women. It complements the priesthood training given to the brethren."<sup>6</sup> The word <i>society</i> has a meaning nearly identical to that of <i>quorum.</i> It connotes "an enduring and cooperating . . . group" distinguished by its common aims and beliefs.<sup>7</sup> When Joseph Smith organized the sisters, he told them that "there should be a select society, separate from all the evils of the world, choice, virtuous, and holy."<sup>8</sup> President Joseph F. Smith taught that Relief Society has its own unique identity and that it was "divinely made, divinely authorized, divinely instituted, divinely ordained of God to minister for the salvation of the souls of women and men."<sup>9</sup><br><br>The purposes of Relief Society are to increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek out and provide relief for those who are in need.<sup>10</sup> The quorum is to serve others, build unity and brotherhood, instruct quorum members in the doctrines and principles of the gospel, and watch over the Church.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Being part of a Relief Society or quorum is a designation for a way of life. We are to serve in the association of a Melchizedek Priesthood quorum or a Relief Society for a lifetime. From the quorum or Relief Society, we are called to serve in other Church assignments and organizations, such as missionary work, temple service, Sunday School, seminary or institute, Young Men, Primary, Young Women, and so forth. No matter where we serve, we always retain our "citizenship" in and our responsibility to the quorum or Relief Society. President Packer has taught that all service in the Church strengthens the higher priesthood and Relief Society and is a demonstration of our devotion to Relief Society and quorum membership.<sup>12</sup><br><br>It is true that each of us is responsible for becoming a faithful, covenant-keeping disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Some may argue that we can accomplish this as individuals without the benefit of a supporting group. But President David O. McKay said that if priesthood men only needed "personal distinction or individual elevation, there would be no need of groups or quorums. The very existence of such groups, established by divine authorization, proclaims our dependence upon one another, the indispensable need of mutual help and assistance."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as the Lord chose to organize us in this way, it is important for us to seek for a greater understanding as to why we are thus organized and then to seek to fulfill the vision He has for us. To help facilitate that understanding I have drawn heavily from the scriptures and words of prophets to illustrate, only briefly, five important reasons why we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies.<br><br><b>One of the reasons we have quorums and Relief Societies is to organize us under the priesthood and after the pattern of the priesthood.</b><sup>14</sup> Our God is a God of order, and all that He does to build His kingdom is done through His priesthood patterns.<br><br>One of those patterns is the organization of wards and stakes, each with a geographic boundary. Each ward is guided by a bishop who holds the keys, or the Lord's authority, for his ward. He is the shepherd of the Lord's flock within his ward and has the charge to see to the temporal and spiritual needs of that flock. Only he can authorize the ordinances that are essential for the salvation of the members of that flock. His responsibility is monumental and is the more difficult because he is only oneman who cannot possibly watch over all of the sheep at once. The quorum and Relief Society leaders are seen by the bishop as under-shepherds who magnify, enhance, and distribute his watchcare.<br><br>The formation of a presidency is also a priesthood pattern. Every ward elders quorum president and Relief Society president presides over and directs the activities of the elders quorum or Relief Society in the ward.<sup>15</sup> Quorum and Relief Society leaders have a measure of divine authority given to them regarding the government and instruction of those they are called to lead.<sup>16</sup> They are men and women who are "called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands."<sup>17</sup> To preside means to stand guard, to superintend, and to lead.<sup>18</sup> This means that Relief Society and quorum leaders in a ward carry the responsibility to supervise, oversee, and regulate the work of the Relief Society and the quorums on behalf of the bishop.<br><br>Sustaining those who are called to lead is also a priesthood pattern. We do not select our leaders by popular vote as is common in organizations outside the Church. It is an act of our faith in the Lord and those who are called to lead in His Church to sustain their actions and support them in their responsibilities to lead us. When Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society, he "exhorted the sisters always to concentrate their faith and prayers for, and place confidence in those whom God has appointed to honor, whom God has placed at the head to lead."<sup>19</sup><br><br>One of the priesthood patterns we enjoy is the ability to receive revelation. When Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society, he said the sisters were "to get instruction through the order which God has established--through the medium of those appointed to lead."<sup>20</sup> This ability and promise regarding personal revelation is one of the remarkable blessings that come to every quorum and Relief Society presidency. When the Lord said that each of us was to learn our duty and act in the office to which we are appointed,<sup>21</sup> He provided a way for us to do just that. I have seen humble Relief Society and quorum presidencies in many parts of the world leading with great and inspiring ability because they are organized under the priesthood and after the order of the priesthood. They follow patterns that allow them to get revelation for the work they have been set apart to do.<br><br>At the time of the Relief Society centennial the First Presidency wrote:<br><br><i>We ask our Sisters of the Relief Society never to forget that they are a unique organization in the whole world, for they were organized under the inspiration of the Lord. . . . No other woman's organization in all the earth has had such a birth.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br><b>A second reason we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies is to focus Heavenly Father's sons and daughters on the work of salvation and to engage them in it.</b> Quorums and Relief Societies are an organized discipleship with the responsibility to assist in our Father's work to bring about eternal life for His children. We are not in the entertainment business; we are in the salvation business. Entrance into an elders quorum or a Relief Society usually follows a significant investment from the Lord and His leaders in the teaching and preparation of younger members of the Church for such a work. The work of salvation includes missionary work and retaining in activity those who are converted. We are to do all we can to bring back into activity those of our group who have weakened in their faith. The work of a quorum and a Relief Society also focuses on temple and family history work. We carry the responsibility to teach the gospel and exemplify righteous living to one another.<br><br>The work of salvation also includes improving our temporal and spiritual self-reliance. And as a group we ensure that the needy and the poor are cared for. Elder John A. Widtsoe defined the saving work of the Relief Society as the "relief of poverty, relief of illness; relief of doubt, relief of ignorance--relief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman."<sup>23</sup> These same kinds of responsibilities are given to a quorum. They are honorable and heavy responsibilities. They connote a sacred trust and imply a significant contribution to the Lord's work of salvation--a work that is both a burden and a blessing. When quorums and Relief Societies are unified in this work, they each essentially take an oar in the boat--each helping move us toward salvation.<br><br>When we are organized into Relief Societies and quorums, our personal discipleship is extended and we become engaged with others in the saving work that was modeled by the Savior. It is never modest or inconsequential. It forces us to a higher path of discipleship and a greater spiritual maturity. It is often a long-suffering and patient work and can seem thankless because there is usually a noticeable absence of public recognition for the good we do. Elder Widtsoe taught that "to save souls opens the whole field of human activity and development."<sup>24</sup> The work of salvation is guided by the Spirit, who confirms our actions, assures us of the Lord's approval, and supplies the true joy that comes with an affirmation of our success.<br><br><b>A third reason we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies is to help bishops wisely manage the Lord's storehouse.</b> The Lord's storehouse includes the "time, talents, compassion, materials, and financial means"<sup>25</sup> of the members of the Church. The talents of the Saints are to be used to help care for the poor and the needy and to build the Lord's kingdom. The Lord envisions "every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God."<sup>26</sup><br><br>Bishops have charge of the Lord's storehouse, and they depend on the quorums and Relief Societies to help them seek out and care for all in their wards. Every ward is unique and can be said to have its own DNA. This makes it essential that the leaders of the quorums and Relief Societies work in councils to help bishops manage and apportion the Lord's assets. Together they evaluate the strengths and abilities of individuals and ensure that the Lord's sheep are cared for.<br><br>Our Savior taught this principle in many ways during His mortal ministry, and the scriptures contain many examples of how Helooked after those who were in need. In every ward there are always a few dedicated souls who would do all of the work while others would neglect their duty and fail to offer their gifts. Quorum and Relief Society leaders have the responsibility to organize and carry out an inspired ministry to help all brothers and sisters keep their covenants to remember the Savior and consecrate their lives to His work.<br><br>If we were left to ourselves, we might prefer to care only for the popular, charming, and grateful people in our wards. It is much more challenging to care for those who are difficult to love, who have grave and complicated challenges, or who do not seem to appreciate our help. The Savior said:<br><br><i>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</i><br><br><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i><br><br><i>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</i><br><br><i>Ye are therefore commanded to be perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>One of the most significant ways this kind of watchcare is apportioned is through home teaching and visiting teaching. President Henry B. Eyring said, "The only system [that can] provide succor and comfort across a church so large in a world so varied would be through individual servants near the people inneed."<sup>28</sup> Elder Bruce R. McConkie, who served faithfully as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, called an elder "a shepherd serving in the sheepfold of the Good Shepherd." He taught that home teachers "have status" and that "their calls are official." They are "sent by their quorum president, by the bishop, and by the Lord." It was his feeling that "the greatest defect of the home teaching system in the Church is that it remains almost unused."<sup>29</sup><br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>The home teaching program is a response to modern revelation commissioning those ordained to the priesthood to "teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and watch over the church . . . and visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties, . . . to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them; and see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking" (D&amp;amp;C 20:42, 47, 53–54). . . .</i><br><br><i>From the Book of Mormon, Alma "consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men. Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness" (Mosiah 23:17–18).</i><br><br><i>In performing our home teaching responsibilities, we are wise if we learn and understand the challenges of the members of each family.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>A visiting teacher should also consider her assignment "as a call from the Lord."<sup>31</sup> President Kimball said to the sisters, "Your duties in many ways must be much like those of the [home] teachers, which briefly are 'to watch over the church always'--not twenty minutes a month but always."<sup>32</sup><br><br>Visiting teaching and home teaching become the Lord's work when our focus is centered on people rather than on percentages. The perfection of our statistics is often not a good measure of our watchcare. We can never say, "My home teaching or visiting teaching is done!" When we represent the Lord we are always on His errand. President Thomas S. Monson taught, "Home teaching is more than a mechanical visit once per month, that the statistical report of the ward will be pleasing. Ours is the responsibility to teach, to inspire, to motivate, to bring to activity and to eventual exaltation the sons and daughters of God."<sup>33</sup> When we give an account of our stewardship each month, we are to report the spiritual and temporal well-being of those we are assigned to care for. We can also report any service we render. Special or urgent needs should always be reported immediately.<sup>34</sup> The only true measures of our success in this effort are the confirmations of the Spirit for our efforts and when those we are assigned to watch over can say three important things: (1) "My home teacher or visiting teacher helps me grow spiritually"; (2) "I know my home teacher or visiting teacher cares deeply about me and my family"; and (3) "If I have problems, I know my home teacher or visiting teacher will take action without waiting to be invited."<br><br>The Lord said, "And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also."<sup>35</sup> When these measures are our aim, then we organize and function in an inspired rather than a programmatic way.<br><br><b>A fourth reason for why we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies is to provide a defense and a refuge for Heavenly Father's children and their families in the latter days.</b> President Thomas S. Monson has said: "Today, we are encamped against the greatest array of sin, vice, and evil ever assembled before our eyes. . . . The battle plan whereby we fight to save the souls of men is not our own."<sup>36</sup><br><br>We are all in the midst of a mortal experience. We all chose this experience, and the Lord will ensure that we all have one. An age-old anti-Christ deception implies that people who are smart enough or rich enough can avoid challenges.<sup>37</sup> This is not so! In our lives and the world today we are experiencing in full measure the "perilous times"<sup>38</sup> of the last days the Apostle Paul described to Timothy.As our times become ever more difficult, the faithful brothers and sisters in quorums and Relief Societies are to protect the homes of Zion from the shrill voices of the world and the provocative influence of the adversary.<br><br>We have been taught by Elder Dallin H. Oaks that "one of the great functions of Relief Society is to provide sisterhood for women, just as priesthood quorums provide brotherhood for men."<sup>39</sup> It is our blessing to be part of a sisterhood or a brotherhood that provides "a place of healing, love, kindness, care, and belonging."<sup>40</sup> President Packer said: "This great circle of sisters will be a protection for each of you and for your families. The Relief Society might be likened to a refuge. . . . You will be safe within it. It encircles each sister like a protecting wall."<sup>41</sup> He said: "How consoling it is to know that no matter where [a family may] go, a Church family awaits them. From the day they arrive, he will belong to a quorum of the priesthood and she will belong to Relief Society."<sup>42</sup><br><br>Elder D. Todd Christofferson recounted the story of Brother George Goates, who in six days lost his son Charles and three of Charles's small children during the flu epidemic of 1918. That week Brother Goates made the caskets, dug the graves, and helped prepare the burial clothing. His child and grandchildren died during the week he was to harvest his sugar beet crop, which was left freezing in the ground. After the burials, he and another son went to their fields to see if they could salvage any of their crop. When they arrived, they saw the members of his quorum leaving the empty field. His quorum had harvested every sugar beet. It was then that this man who had shown tremendous strength in the previous week sat down and sobbed like a child. He looked up to the sky and said, "Thanks, Father, for the elders of our ward."<sup>43</sup><br><br>Whatever our mortal experience, we can have this feeling of fellowship and have the support and strength of many around us. The Lord said, "Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect."<sup>44</sup> It is in the sisterhood of Relief Society and the brotherhood of the quorums that we should find refuge and protection from the storms of life and the calamities of the latter days.<br><br><b>A fifth purpose for being organized into quorums and Relief Societies is to strengthen and support us in our family roles and responsibilities as sons and daughters of God.</b> Though many of our responsibilities in the Church are parallel, Heavenly Father's sons and daughters each have unique and distinct responsibilities in the family and in the Church. Quorums and Relief Societies are to teach our Heavenly Father's sons and daughters and inspire them to prepare for the blessings of eternal life. Our Father sees the potential of His sons and His daughters to be family leaders. Therefore, everything we do in quorums and Relief Societies is to help the Lord with His mission of preparing His children for the blessings of the eternal life He envisions for us. In these settings we are meant to learn how to become part of our Heavenly Father's eternal family.<br><br>The quorum and the Relief Society assist family leaders and future family leaders and help them establish patterns and practices of righteous behavior and covenant keeping in their lives. Brothers and sisters encourage one another to pray always, pay tithes and offerings, and renew covenants on the Lord's holy day. They are to help one another be sufficiently mature to make and keep sacred temple covenants.<br><br>The quorum and the Relief Society should help us become who our Heavenly Father needs us to become. Joseph Smith taught the sisters from 1 Corinthians about the importance of developing godlike qualities. He said the sisters were organized "according to [their] natures" and were "placed in a situation in which [they could] act according to those sympathies which God has planted in [them]."<sup>45</sup> It is for this reason that the motto of Relief Society, "Charity never faileth," was chosen.<br><br>Sister Eliza R. Snow, second Relief Society general president, said to the sisters:<br><br><i>We want to be ladies in very deed, not according to the term of the word as the world judges, but fit companions of the Gods and Holy Ones. In an organized capacity we can assist each other in not only doing good but in refining ourselves, and whether few or many come forward and help to prosecute this great work, they will be those that will fill honorable positions in the Kingdom of God. . . . Women should be women and not babies that need petting and correction all the time. I know we like to be appreciated, but if we do not get all the appreciation which we think is our due, what matters?</i><sup>46</sup><br><br>It is in the quorum that brothers are taught to "rise up" as "men of God" and "have done with lesser things. Give heart and soul and mind and strength to serve the King of Kings."<sup>47</sup> The work of the quorum and the Relief Society clarifies the unique identities and responsibilities of sons and daughters of God and unifies them in defense of His plan. President Harold B. Lee stated:<br><br><i>It seems clear to me that the Church has </i>no choice--<i>and never has had--but to do more to assist the </i>family<i> in carrying out </i>its<i> divine mission, not only because that is the order of heaven, but also because that is the most </i>practical<i> contribution we can make to our youth--to help improve the quality of life in the Latter-day Saint homes. As important as our many programs and organizational efforts are, these </i>should not<i> supplant the home; they should </i>support<i> the home.</i><sup>48</sup><br><br>As the Lord said to Emma Smith, we are to "lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better. . . . Cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made. . . . Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive."<sup>49</sup> Each of us is a beloved daughter or son of God with sacred personal responsibilities. In our quorums and Relief Societies we are to be taught and inspired to become who our Father in Heaven created us to become.<br><h2><b>Conclusion and Testimony</b></h2><br>There is much work a quorum must do as a quorum and much a Relief Society is to do as a circle of sisters, and there is much that is to be coordinated between them. Because "the Lord's Church is governed through councils,"<sup>50</sup> it is important for the Relief Society president to be included in priesthood executive meetings in which confidential welfare matters are discussed and in which bishops can facilitate the coordination ofhome teachers and visiting teachers.<sup>51</sup><br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>It will be a marvelous day, my brethren . . . when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto, when each such man may appropriately be able to say, "I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs, as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine. Working together, we shall grow spiritually as covenant sons of God. Working together, we can stand, without embarrassment and without fear, against every wind of adversity that might blow, be it economic, social, or spiritual."</i><sup>52</sup><br><br>President Packer recently declared to the brethren of the Church: "We need everyone. The tired or worn out or lazy and even those who are bound down with guilt. . . . Too many of our priesthood brethren are living below their privileges and the Lord's expectations."<sup>53</sup> "In one of the first meetings of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo, Joseph Smith admonished the sisters to 'live up to [their] privilege.'"<sup>54</sup> In a similar vein, President Packer said to the sisters of Relief Society:<br><br><i>Rally to the cause of Relief Society! Strengthen it! Attend it! Devote yourselves to it! Enlist the inactive in it and bring nonmember sisters under the influence of it. It is time now to unite in this worldwide circle of sisters. A strong, well-organized Relief Society is crucial to the future, to the safety of this Church.</i><sup>55</sup><br><br>Much of what has been taught today can be found in <i>Daughters in My Kingdom: The History and Work of Relief Society. </i>This new resource from the First Presidency can help brothers and sisters learn how to fulfill their responsibilities.<i> </i>Through this and other instructions, we "know how to act and direct [the] church, how to act upon the points of [the Lord's] law and commandments, which [He has] given." We are now to "bind [ourselves] to act in all holiness before [Him]."<sup>56</sup><br><br>What the Lord envisioned regarding quorums and Relief Societies has not yet been fully utilized. Many quorums and Relief Societies are at present much like sleeping giants waiting for you to breathe new life intothem.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that the true restored gospel of Jesus Christ is upon the earth. My testimony of that restoration has been strengthened by knowing that quorums and Relief Societies were established so the Lord could organize His sons and daughters under the priesthood and after the pattern of the priesthood. By this means He engages His children in His work of salvation and in wisely managing His storehouse. Quorums and Relief Societies are meant to be a safety and a refuge in these difficult days and to support and strengthen the identity, roles, and responsibilities of Heavenly Father's sons and daughters. We are "called by the voice of the Prophet of God to do it,"<sup>57</sup> and, as we do so, "the angels cannot be restrained from being [our] associates."<sup>58</sup> Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Julie B.

<h1>9;s Two Big Questions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is one of the highest honors I've ever received. When I looked to see who some other forum speakers have been, I quickly felt out of place. In fact, I felt like the speaker I heard a few years ago at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC.<br><br>Some 4,000 guests attend this breakfast each February, including the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet, House and Senate members, visiting heads of state, and world leaders. Past speakers include Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Tony Blair.<br><br>Well, like me, this particular speaker was not especially well known and felt a bit intimidated by his task. He told of sending an email to his pastor the night before, seeking some moral and spiritual support. His pastor wrote back, "Just remember, if you're representing the Lord, you have nothing to worry about--it's the Lord who should be worried!"<br><br>Well, I'm not worried this morning, but I am aware that I'm not smart enough to be addressing a prominent university audience. Being in an academic setting reminds me of a story I heard about a class that had been studying birds for much of the semester.<br><br>They had studied everything you could possibly study about birds--their feathers, their eyes, their color, and their mating and migration habits. Well, the day for the final test arrived. The teacher distributed a single sheet of paper with 10 pictures showing just the feet of 10 birds and a blank line under each one. Hegave the instructions: "Identify each bird by its feet, and you're free to go."<br><br>Just then a guy at the back of the room pounded his fist on his desk and shouted, "This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen!" Hewadded his paper into a ball, threw it toward the trash can, and headed for the door.<br><br>Just as he reached the door, the teacher yelled, "Young man, what's your name?"<br><br>The student ripped off his shoes and socks, pulled up his pant legs, and said, "Here, Teacher! If you're so smart, why don't you tellme?"<br><br>I've always wanted to visit Brigham Young University. Most of you were still in high school when Jerry Falwell went to heaven five years ago. Jerry founded Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, 40 years ago, and in 1980 I went to Liberty, where I played football for four years as a placekicker.<br><br>Since the earliest days of Liberty University, Jerry famously and repeatedly declared, "Iwant Liberty University to be for the evangelical young person what Notre Dame is for the Catholic and Brigham Young is for the Mormon--a world-class university." Well, God gave him enough years to see that dream largely realized.<br><br>Today Liberty has 78,000 students, including 13,000 on campus, making it the seventh-largest school of any kind in the country. As an alumnus and a trustee of Liberty, I've looked forward to the day I would see BYU for myself. So thank you for honoring me with the invitation to speak from this pulpit.<br><br>Dr. Falwell also challenged his students and staff constantly: "If it's Christian, it ought to be better." I love high standards of excellence, and this university certainly models them. Sadly, much of what is done under the banner of "Christian" is done poorly. Nineteenth-century British novelist and poet Dorothy Sayers wrote a fabulous piece titled "Why Work?" She concluded, "The only Christian work is good work well done."<br><br>We are in the middle of an intense political season in this country, and I've been privileged to be an advisor to a presidential campaign--something I've done voluntarily both in this cycle and the last one. I'm not here today to talk about politics, but I do want to share how my involvement with a prominent member of your church led me to try to make a difference on an issue that's not political.<br><br>Incidentally, the last time I was in this state was in September, when I spent a day traveling with Mitt Romney and his personal aide, a young University of Mississippi graduate named Garrett. Mitt told me about a previous trip in Utah during which a man came up to Garrett after an event and, making an assumption, asked, "So, where did you do yourmission?"<br><br>Not missing a beat, Garrett replied, "I'm a Southern Baptist--I'm on my mission."<br><br>As an evangelical Christian, I was well aware of doctrinal differences between your faith and mine. But once I decided to help Mitt Romney, I began to see an all-too-ugly side of a theological divide. Sadly, far too much of the ugliness--though certainly not all of it--came from within my own camp.<br><br>In 2007 I was interviewed by a talented Mormon film producer for a documentary titled<i>Article VI: Faith, Politics, America.</i>The film opens with a moving scene from your semiannual general conference, narrated by the producer. He shares how attending this important church gathering with his family was a highlight of the year for as long as he could remember--except, that is, for what he had to walk past in order to join his extended church family inside the LDS Conference Center.<br><br>Bryan Hall, like many of you, had to navigate a gauntlet of non-Mormon--really anti-Mormon--protesters, preachers, and loud mouths, most of them behaving as sorry ambassadors of the very Jesus Christ they purported to represent. Though I had nothing to do with this scene, which apparently isrepeated every April and October, it convicted and saddened me enough to try to do something about it.<br><br>But first, let me tell you that Bryan Hall and I became wonderful friends through this film. We have shared much of our respective journeys with Christ and have learned from each other in the process. Bryan, you and Melanie honored April and me by having us in your home on Sunday and by coming here this morning. Thank you.<br><br>By the way, I also want to thank Professor Robert Millet and Pastor Greg Johnson--founders of Standing Together--for coming, and for your important work.<br><br>This treatment of Mormons--Latter-day Saints like Mitt Romney and Bryan Hall--by many who claim to be followers of Christ, along with the sometimes violent treatment from those who oppose your church for your strong defense of traditional marriage, prompted me, as an evangelical Christian, to try to inspire a national dialogue about civility.<br><br>Also, though I disagreed with then Senator Obama on many things, I found myself, even as a political conservative, being troubled by the way many people were treating him--ways I also didn't think were Christlike.<br><br>So I decided to launch a civility project. Ibought the appropriate domain addresses and began to develop a plan and a website. I wrote a simple three-point pledge, which I thought anyone in this country could agree to, regardless of political or religious affiliation. Itread as follows:<br><br>1. I will be civil in my public discourse and behavior.<br><br>2. I will be respectful of others, whether or not I agree with them.<br><br>3. I will stand against incivility where and when I see it.<br><br>As I prepared to launch this project following the contentious 2008 election, I decided I needed a liberal counterpart. I didn't want this effort to look like a conservative was lecturing the left on incivility, especially since there was so much incivility within my own ranks. So I reached out to a most unlikely person.<br><br>Lanny Davis was the White House counsel at the end of President Clinton's second term. He is a self-described liberal and a democratic power broker. Lanny is also Jewish.<br><br>I didn't know Lanny at this point, but I had written him a letter some six months earlier. As an avid supporter of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Lanny was on television quite a bit during the primary season. Whenever I saw him on TV, I found myself saying, "Now there's a liberal I really like."<br><br>You see, Lanny was always respectful of his adversaries. He didn't interrupt or raise his voice. He didn't attack on a personal level or on motive--only on policy. So as Hillary Clinton was ending her campaign, I sat down and wrote a letter to Lanny at his law firm in Washington, DC. It began this way: "Dear Lanny, I am an evangelical and a conservative Republican who has spent the past year trying to get Mitt Romney elected president, and I suspect that, politically, you and I may have nothing in common."<br><br>I went on to commend him for his civility in the public square and to encourage him after a hard-fought campaign. We had no further contact for six months, until I sent him an email late one night reminding him of my letter and telling him I was starting a civility project.<br><br>"Could I come to DC and get your thoughts on it?" I asked.<br><br>At 4:36 the next morning I received an email I will never forget. "Mark, I'd be honored to meet you," it said. "Your letter sits in a frame on a bookshelf in my office. Call my assistant and set it up."<br><br>When I went to see Lanny the next month, he was on a call in his office but motioned for me to come in. While he finished his call I surveyed his walls, covered with framed notes and photos of Lanny with members of Congress, a secretary of state, and several presidents, including one of him and his 10-year-old son with President Bush on Air Force One. And there, displayed on his bookshelf, was myletter.<br><br>Lanny hung up the phone, pointed to the bookshelf, and said, "That's the nicest letter I've ever received."<br><br>Lanny Davis and I were, by any assessment, a political odd couple. But, thanks to a simple letter with a civil and respectful tone, we became fast friends. He offered his full help, and on the eve of the inauguration of Barack Obama we launched the Civility Project with an op-ed we wrote together for the<i>Washington Times.</i><br><br>For two years we promoted civility through our website and through national media and various speaking opportunities--opportunities that took me to places like the National Press Club in Washington, a synagogue in Houston, and the West Wing of the White House.<br><br>In the summer of 2010, anticipating an ugly midterm election cycle, we sent a letter to every member of Congress and every sitting governor asking them to sign this simple pledge. Six months later, just three--three out of 585--had done so. One of your recent forum speakers, Senator Joseph Lieberman, was joined by two Congressmen.<br><br>I dissolved the project a year ago after concluding I wasn't able to devote the time and attention it deserved. Days later, Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot at a political event, and the national debate about civility erupted once again.<br><br>Most people viewed this civility project in a political context, but, as a follower of Christ, I had another motive. The Apostle Paul writes in the book of Philippians, "But in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself" (NKJV, Philippians 2:3). It is impossible to follow this admonition to regard you as more important than myself and also stand outside your general conference hurling insults as you walk by to worship with your fellow Latter-day Saints.<br><br>The First Amendment may give me the right to demonize you with public speech, but it doesn't make it right.<br><br>Paul then challenges the Colossians to "letyour speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one" (NKJV, Colossians 4:5). And his final charge in his first letter to the Corinthians is crystal clear: "Let all that you do be done in love" (NKJV, 1 Corinthians 16:14).<br><br>Addressing a general conference, Elder Quentin L. Cook correctly pointed out:<br><br><i>There are some who feel that venting their personal anger or deeply held opinions is more important than conducting themselves as Jesus Christ lived and taught. ... To recognize ... how we disagree is a real measure of who we are and whether we truly follow the Savior. It is appropriate to disagree, but it is not appropriate to be disagreeable. ... If we show love and respect even in adverse circumstances, we become more like Christ.</i>["We Follow Jesus Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 84–85]<br><br>I will not attempt to speak for your church, but I will speak for and to mine: It is never an option to claim Jesus Christ as Savior and behave in an uncivil manner with anyone, under any circumstance. Never.<br><br>I pray I will be known for speech seasoned with grace, for regarding others as more important than myself, and for doing everything in love. In these days of political divisiveness, I urge all of us to defer to what Abraham Lincoln described in his first inaugural address as "the better angels of our nature."<br><br>Vice President Brent W. Webb mentioned in his introduction of me that I had written a book titled<i>The Little Red Book of Wisdom.</i>You might be wondering, "Why would a publisher pay me a lot of money to write a book about wisdom?" Well, that's what my mother wondered when I told her I had landed a contract to write my first book--not because she didn't think I had wisdom to share but because I was still pretty young to write on such a lofty subject.<br><br>You see, most people associate wisdom with age or people in positions of prominence and power. Well, I'm glad wisdom isn't reserved for certain people. It is available to any of us--to all of us. Wisdom does not favor intelligence or education, affluence or sophistication. Its call is to everyone, everywhere.<br><br>Incidentally, as proof that wisdom doesn't favor education, a college that denied me admission because I didn't meet their academic standards hired me several years ago to help them navigate a crisis. At least I was smart enough to accept that money!<br><br>So if wisdom really is available to everyone, how do we get it? I'll suggest three ways.<br><br><i>First, spend time around wise people.</i>The Bible says, "He who walks with wise men will be wise" (NKJV, Proverbs 13:20). I've been fortunate to spend much of my life around wise people, and if wisdom is caught rather than taught, as someone once told me, this principle makes good sense.<br><br><i>Second, read the textbook.</i>Pat Williams is senior vice president of the Orlando Magic and a popular author and speaker. I once heard him tell an audience that reading five books on any given subject makes you an expert on that subject.<br><br>I don't know whether that statement can be proven, but I am certain that reading five books on a given subject will at least make you more expert than the person who has read nothing on the subject.<br><br>Now, suppose instead of reading five books on a subject you read just one book--the most prominent book on the subject. Then suppose you read it dozens, even hundreds of times.<br><br>Many believe that King Solomon was the wisest man who ever lived, and, therefore, that his writings in the book of Proverbs comprise the world's greatest textbook on wisdom.<br><br>The book of Proverbs is conveniently divided into 31 short chapters, and I learned a simple practice years ago from my father. As part of my daily Bible reading, I read the corresponding chapter of Proverbs--meaning Iwill read through the entire book every month, 12 times every year.<br><br>I would estimate I have now read through the book of Proverbs some 300 times--and the Holy Spirit still gives me fresh insights almost every week. He also brings occasional humor. One morning I was reading my Bible while my wife was getting ready.<br><br>"Read me whatever you're reading today," she said.<br><br>Glancing down at the chapter of Proverbs I was about to read, I noticed the chapter heading and said, "It's about 'the wiles of the harlot.' Do you still want to hear it?"<br><br>"No," she replied, "but I want you to hear it!"<br><br>When our son finished high school two years ago, I wrote him a letter and gave it to him the night before his commencement service. The next day there was a note from him on my desk thanking me for my letter. Heclosed that note with a P.S. I'll never forget. It said, "Dad, I've been reading Proverbs every day since eighth grade because of you."<br><br>If I do nothing else as a father, I will have achieved something special by passing along a Bible-reading habit learned from my father years earlier.<br><br><i>Third, we can get wisdom simply by asking for it.</i>Billy Graham once said, "Knowledge is horizontal, but wisdom is vertical--it comes down from above." In other words, God is the source of all wisdom.<br><br>The New Testament book of James tells us, "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach" (NKJV, James 1:5). This is a wonderful promise--and, thankfully, there is no age requirement for asking!<br><br>So, if you want wisdom, even as a college student, spend time around wise people, read the textbook, and ask God for it.<br><br>A chapter in my book is titled "A Turtle on a Fence Post." If you ever see a turtle on a fence post, you know it didn't get there by itself. Someone put it there. And someone--or many someones--has put each of us where we are today.<br><br>I have embraced this picture for as long as I can remember. I often wear turtle cufflinks, as I am today, as a reminder of this principle. I don't believe there is such a thing as a self-made man or woman. I didn't build a successful public relations firm and a wonderful family by myself.<br><br>First of all, I was fearfully and wonderfully made by God with certain abilities and talents--and then was blessed with good health. Other people have also helped to put me where I am--teachers, coaches, co-workers, clients, and my wife--people who invested in my life, gave me opportunities, and supported and encouraged me. The idea that someone could be a self-made millionaire--or athlete or businessman or musician--is absurd any way you look at it.<br><br>I was fortunate to start a public relations firm 20 years ago that was the first in our niche--serving faith-based organizations and causes. Today our clients have combined annual revenues in excess of four-and-a-half billion dollars. But I am well aware of my debt to these clients, my talented staff, and especially God's favor. I may be a self-starter, but Iam not self-made. And neither are you.<br><br>One of those people most responsible for putting me on a fence post was my father--myhero. He was also the wisest man I've ever known.<br><br>Art DeMoss was a successful businessman--and is widely credited with pioneering direct response marketing of life insurance. He founded the National Liberty Corporation in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania--the first such company to sell life insurance without a traditional sales force. Instead, the company relied entirely on direct mail and newspaper and television advertising to sell policies.<br><br>I learned much from my father. For example, he taught me the importance of putting God first in my life by giving Him the first day of every week, the first part of every day, and the first dime of every dollar. He called this, in a simple little booklet he wrote, God's Secret of Success.<br><br>On Labor Day weekend, 1979, just a few days before the start of my senior year in high school, my father dropped dead of a heart attack at age 53. My mother, just 40 years old, was suddenly widowed with seven children under the age of 22.<br><br>Shortly after we returned from the hospital that Saturday afternoon, my mother found a small piece of paper on my father's nightstand.<br><br>In my mind I can still see--in his handwriting--the following words from the 90th chapter of Psalms: "So teach us to number our days, That we may present to You a heart of wisdom" (NASB, Psalm 90:12).<br><br>After my father died, I somehow believed that early death would pass over the rest of my family for a long time. But just seven years later, my 22-year-old brother David was killed in a car accident. In three months I'll turn 50, meaning I'm nearly the age of my father when he died; and I'm more than twice the age of my brother when he died.<br><br>Losing a family member has a way of making one think about death--and about life. TheBible says, "You do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away" (NASB, James 4:14).<br><br>As the Old Testament figure Job tried to grasp his own devastating loss and grief, he wrote these words: "Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months, and have set limits he cannot exceed" (NIV, Job 14:5).<br><br>Winston Churchill's father died at age 39, and England's future prime minister grew up also expecting to die young. In his first autobiography, the young Churchill credited his military exploits in India--and, in general, his fearless first decades--to his awareness of the ticking clock.<br><br>My own father's death at age 53 circled that age in my mind--a red mark made darker and more certain by my brother's sudden death only a few years later. I'm never so lost in living that I don't hear the clock tick or have an eye on the calendar--not in a paranoid sense, but with a sense of purpose.<br><br>Perhaps most important, my father taught me the answers to what are arguably the two most important questions in life.<br><br>I remember my father telling the story of a discussion a man once had with a law school student about his future plans. The conversation went something like this:<br><br>"Son, tell me about your plans after law school."<br><br>"I hope to get a job with a good firm and start making some money," the student replied.<br><br>"That sounds good. And then what?"<br><br>"Well, at some point I want to get married."<br><br>"I hope you do, son. And then?"<br><br>"I want to get a nice house and start a family."<br><br>"Of course, and then what?"<br><br>"Then I want to raise my kids in good schools and earn enough money for a second home."<br><br>"Right. Right. What then?"<br><br>"I hope to be making enough money to slow down and take nice vacations with my wife and children."<br><br>"And then?"<br><br>"Well, I guess I'd like to see my kids get married and start their own families. I hear having grandchildren is even better than having children."<br><br>"Yes, it's true. Then what?"<br><br>"I hope I'll be healthy enough to enjoy my later years--maybe travel some with my wife and see the world. I want to pass along my money to my children so they can enjoy life asI have."<br><br>"And then?"<br><br>The young student paused. "Well, I guess ... I guess eventually I'll die."<br><br>"Yes, yes you will," the man said. "And then what?"<br><br>This story chronicles the standard-issue American Dream. Who in this room doesn't identify with some or most of this young man's vision for his life?<br><br>"And then what?" How would you answer that question?<br><br>Some 350 years ago, French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote these words: "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator." He then proposed the following: "Let us weigh the gain and loss in wagering that God is. Let us consider the two possibilities. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Hesitate not, then, to wager that He is."<br><br>So what could be wiser than admitting our life is not a self-made proposition? What could be wiser than making this eternal choice sooner rather than later? I'm so glad I answered that question as a young boy.<br><br>But once we've answered the "then what?" question, I would suggest we must answer the next most important question in life: "now what?" What do we do now, here on earth, to serve Jesus Christ and make a difference for eternity? Sadly, too many people have no idea.<br><br>At the ripe age of 32, comedian Dave Chappelle certainly had his dream. He had just signed a $50 million deal with the Comedy Central Channel. But the ink on the contract was hardly dry when Chappelle disappeared. He surfaced 8,000 miles away, in South Africa. The hilarious host ran away from the entire third season of<i>Chappelle's Show</i>because, as he later confessed, "The higher up I go, for some reason, the less happy I am." If a person could buy happiness or peace, certainly this young comedian would have been at the front of theline.<br><br>Jack Higgins is one of the most successful authors on earth--his thriller novels having sold more than 250 million copies in 60 languages. When asked by a magazine interviewer what he knew now that he wished he had known earlier in life, the rich writer replied, "I wish I had known when you get to the top, there is nothing there."<br><br>How tragic--one man with so much ... and so little.<br><br>I cannot begin to imagine life on earth without Jesus Christ at the center of it. He's not only all I need--He's all I want! I once heard someone say, "If there were no heaven and no hell, I'd still want to be a Christian just for the joy and fellowship we can experience here on earth." I feel that way every day.<br><br>I would hate to think of watching my mother battle a malignant brain tumor when Iwas still a child without an unwavering trust in the Great Physician, or surviving the loss of my father--when I was only 17--apart from the God who promises to be "a father to the fatherless" (NIV, Psalm 68:5).<br><br>I cannot imagine coping with the sudden death of my kid brother without the One who promises to be "a friend who sticks closer than a brother" (NIV, Proverbs 18:24). Nor would I have wanted to go through college or start a business without the Source of All Wisdom at my side.<br><br>I especially cannot imagine being married for nearly 24 years without having the One who created and ordained marriage, who loves my wife and me unconditionally, as the very cornerstone of our home--for "a three-stranded cord is not easily broken" (CJB,Ecclesiastes 4:12).<br><br>By the way, thank you, April, for being such a remarkable wife and mother. I love you, girl.<br><br>I'll close with two stories of young men--just a few years older than you students--who knew what they were on earth to do. Years ago a young man in Boston named Edward Kimball taught Sunday School at his church, feeling called to invest his life in the lives of young boys and men. In an effort to get to know his students better, he often paid a visit to them at their homes or places of work during the week.<br><br>One Sunday a 17-year-old boy showed up in his class--a boy with some rather rough edges, often bursting out in anger or profanity. Kimball thought about how he might reach this boy and decided to visit him at the shoe store where he worked for his uncle. He was nervous. What would the boy say? How would he be received? He found the boy in the back of the store wrapping shoes and putting them on the shelves.<br><br>Kimball simply put his hand on the teenager's shoulder and mustered up some words about how Christ loved him. Amazingly, right there in his uncle's shoe store, this young man wound up committing his life to Christ. His name was Dwight L. Moody.<br><br>In 1879 Moody was instrumental in the conversion of F. B. Meyer, who went on to become a minister. Meyer mentored someone named J.W. Chapman and led him to Christ.<br><br>Chapman became a pastor and evangelist and started an outreach ministry to professional baseball players. One of those players, Billy Sunday, became Chapman's assistant for many of his evangelistic meetings.<br><br>Having learned from Chapman, Billy Sunday started to hold his own evangelistic meetings, becoming the greatest evangelist of the first part of the 20th century in America. In the 1920s, one of Billy Sunday's revivals in North Carolina was so successful, an associate of his, Mordecai Ham (who had given his life to Christ in one of Sunday's crusades), was asked to come back to Charlotte a few years later to hold a second series of crusades.<br><br>On one of the final nights of Mordecai Ham's evangelistic meetings in Charlotte, North Carolina, another teenager responded to an invitation to follow Jesus Christ. That teenager turned 94 in November, and thanks to a Sunday School teacher in Boston years ago, countless millions of people have heard about Jesus because of the preaching of Billy Graham.<br><br>Our second young man was finishing college last year, though I doubt any of you know who Neil Caudle is. Neil graduated from Spain Park High School in Hoover, Alabama, rated the seventh-best quarterback in America. Besieged with scholarship offers, he signed to play at Auburn University.<br><br>With high hopes and expectations of playing quarterback in the SEC, Caudle's career was marked instead by coaching changes, injuries, limited playing time, and a talented depth chart at Auburn. Just when he thought it was his year to be the starting quarterback, along came someone you have heard of: Cam Newton. This finally caused Neil and his family to wonder if he even wanted to play football at Auburn.<br><br>Well, Neil Caudle persevered, even though he threw only a few passes in his four years there. He suited up for his final game as an Auburn Tiger one year ago in Arizona for the national championship against Oregon. Our daughter was a senior at Auburn, so we went out for the big game.<br><br>I didn't know or notice anything about Caudle until a week or so later when our pastor, who had spoken at a chapel service for the team the night before, told of a picture Neil's mom had captured of the final play of that thrilling game.<br><br>Her photo showed the giant scoreboard and video screen with the score tied 19-19, the play clock showing 19 seconds, and the game-winning 19-yard field goal soaring through the hold of number 19. Teresa Caudle's son, the promising quarterback coming out of high school, was now the holder--number 19. It was his hands, and not those of the Heisman winner, that would be the last to touch the ball as Auburn put the final three points on their national championship season.<br><br>In an email to friends after the game, Neil Caudle's mother wrote, "Neil always felt like he was in God's will, even when things didn't go like he wanted them to. You can do the math and see it is no coincidence. I believe God orchestrated Neil's last college football game to show His power and to affirm to Neil (and to us) that number 19 was right where he was supposed to be all along."<br><br>As a former kicker, I love this story. But what I love most are the stories I have read and heard since about Neil Caudle's role as the spiritual leader on that Auburn team. You see, after the pregame evening chapel service for players and coaches, and after the players' meetings with their position coaches, there was one final meeting before going to bed. Number 19 convened a players-only meeting--a prayer meeting. And the players came to Neil's meeting week after week after week.<br><br>The sports world will remember the 2011 college football champions for Cam Newton, his undefeated season, his Heisman Trophy, and his team's last-second victory over a talented and fast Oregon team.<br><br>But years from now, a hundred players and coaches will remember a humble, unselfish young man who touched the ball only a few seconds each game but held high his faith in Christ and clearly had the answer to the question "now what?"<br><br>Two young men--a Sunday School teacher and a football player. One changed the world; the other still might.<br><br>Two questions: Then what? Now what? Just three simple words--yet both our eternity and our life on earth depend fully on our answers.<br><br>Thank you, Brigham Young University, for inviting me to this stage. Thank you, Elder Clarke and President and Sister Samuelson, for making the time to be here and for your warm reception of April and me. You have all honored us.<br><br>Would you now receive this benediction honoring God?<br><br>"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen" (KJV, 1 Timothy 1:17).<br><br><i>Mark DeMoss was an author and founder of TheDeMoss Group when this forum address was­delivered on 24 January 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Mark DeMoss</i>
<h1>cle of Forgiveness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The New Testament writer Luke described<sup>1</sup> a fascinating scene from the Savior's life in which Jesus, sitting at meat in the house of Simon the Pharisee, was approached by a woman who was widely known to have been a sinner. Her behavior, as she approached the Savior, revealed that she must have had some previous interaction with Him of a very personal and life-changing nature, for she tearfully knelt and kissed his feet, literally bathing his feet with her humble tears before wiping them dry with her tresses and applying precious ointment "as a [servant] might do to his master."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Simon, aware of the woman's past indiscretions, inwardly reproved Jesus for allowing a sinner to approach Him in such a manner. Discerning this unrighteous judgment on the part of Simon, Christ artfully rebuked him, and then, speaking to the woman, He said something truly wondrous: "Thy sins are forgiven." Indeed, a miracle had occurred! A miracle more powerful and momentous than the changing of water into wine or the healing of a leper--a miracle tantamount to the raising of one from the grave, for verily a precious daughter of our Heavenly Father had, in very fact, been born again and saved from spiritual death.<br><br>On hearing this account, one cannot help but ask, as did the Book of Mormon writer Enos when he heard a similar declaration of forgiveness following a long and tearful night of anguished soul-searching and prayerful pleading: "How is it done?"<sup>3</sup>Today I would like to speak to you of what Spencer W. Kimball called "the miracle of forgiveness."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Two weeks ago I was released as bishop after six years of service, having also served as bishop previously in another ward and as a student branch president prior to that. One of the most marvelous things about serving as a bishop or branch president is sitting in private council with individual members of your congregation and discussing their concerns relating to their personal worthiness and their standing before God; for it is during these sacred times that a bishop receives a large measure of the inspiration and understanding that will come to him by virtue of his calling as a judge in Israel. And I can attest that at such times I have been given to understand more fully the role of the Savior and His Atonement in our Heavenly Father's plan and the truly miraculous nature of forgiveness.<br><br>To fully understand this miracle, we must contemplate the grand and glorious plan of salvation authored by our Father in Heaven. Before we came to this earth we lived as spirits<sup>5</sup>with our heavenly parents and siblings, including our Elder Brother Jesus Christ. In that premortal realm a grand council<sup>6</sup>was called, and we were presented with our Heavenly Father's plan, which allowed our further progression. We do not know all the details of that council, but from the scriptures and the writings of latter-day prophets we can imagine how it might have transpired. We were told of a new world (this earth) to which we would come to receive a physical body. In coming to this earth we would not retain a remembrance of our pre-earth life. Rather, we would be given the opportunity to be tested and tried that we might learn by our own experience to choose good over evil.<sup>7</sup><br><br>In this council the Father told us<sup>8</sup>that there were laws and ordinances that we would need to obey and receive in order to prepare ourselves to return to live with Him. We were also told that great blessings would come through obedience to each of the commandments,<sup>9</sup>whereas negative consequences (or punishments, if you will) would be the result of violating God's laws.<sup>10</sup>It was explained to us that God would give to each of us the Light of Christ, or the ability to discern between right and wrong.<sup>11</sup>He would also reveal to us His will through prophets and apostles.<sup>12</sup>Thus the Book of Mormon prophet Lehi taught that "men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Each of us understood the necessity of this earth life, but we also knew that this would be a difficult test and that each of us would undoubtedly stumble along the way and transgress the laws of God, placing ourselves in a situation in which we must be subject to the prescribed punishment. We understood that one of the punishments for sin was to be cut off from God's presence and to be halted in our eternal progression.<sup>14</sup>I can imagine that this potential outcome of the plan would have been very troubling for us to contemplate. In fact, this aspect of the plan was so disconcerting that one-third<sup>15</sup>of our spirit siblings rebelled<sup>16</sup>against this plan and followed Satan, who rose up with great swelling words, claiming that<em>he</em>could save us<em>all</em>and none would be lost nor suffer.<sup>17</sup>The remaining two-thirds of us, however, were willing to accept God's plan. Why? Because it included the possibility for change and growth and improvement through repentance. This gift of mercy would be made possible through a savior--one who would come to this earth, as we read in<em>Lectures on Faith,</em><sup>18</sup>to do the following:<br><br>First: This savior would descend in suffering below that which any other man or woman would suffer.<br><br>Second: He would be subject to temptation beyond that which any other man or woman would be subjected.<br><br>Third: Despite this suffering and temptation, he would keep the law of God in every detail and live a sinless life, thus "showing ... that it is in the power of man to keep the law and remain . . . without sin; and also, that by him a righteous judgment might come upon all flesh, . . . that all who walk not in the law of God may justly be condemned by the law, and have no excuse for their sins."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Finally: This savior's perfection would alsoplace him in a position to carry out his ultimate responsibilities, which would be: first, to atone for the sins of the world by taking upon him the entire burden of the prescribed punishment for the sins and transgressions of all mankind, thus redeeming them from the first spiritual death;<sup>20</sup>and, second, to voluntarily be put to death by those for whom he suffered, that he might rise again from the tomb, thus releasing the bands of physical death.<sup>21</sup><br><br>Can you imagine such a responsibility? It was utterly and completely beyond<em>our</em>ability to serve in this capacity. And yet there was one--even Jesus Christ--who humbly stepped forward and said, "[Father,] here am I."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Yes, it was Christ who stepped forward in the premortal council and accepted the role of Savior. He was the only one who could have filled that role, and we need to know and understand that each and every one of us in the premortal world accepted Christ as our Savior and Redeemer.<sup>23</sup>In so doing, we accepted the terms or conditions of His Atonement. Given the importance of covenants in God's plan and knowing that God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow,<sup>24</sup>I believe that it is entirely reasonable to suggest that in the premortal world Christ<em>covenanted</em>with us that He would fulfill this awesome responsibility to be our Savior, and<em>we</em>in turn covenanted with<em>Him</em>that we would do whatever He asked in return.<sup>25</sup><br><br>It is important for us to understand the need for a savior. This is made abundantly clear in the Book of Mormon, especially in Alma 42,<sup>26</sup>in which we are taught that through disobedience all mankind is fallen and subject to the demands of justice, which consigns us to be forever cut off from God's presence. To paraphrase: God is a perfect being and cannot lie. If He decreed a punishment for disobedience to His laws, including being cut off from His presence, such punishment must be meted out every time the law is broken. Otherwise God would not be truthful. Likewise, this punishment must be meted out to any and all who are disobedient or God would not be just. Fortunately there is a means of providing mercy, which is difficult to fully comprehend. It is, in part, that the demands of the law can be satisfied by one who is without sin voluntarily receiving the full and total punishment on behalf of the disobedient offender--in which case we become subject to the demands of he who suffered for us.<sup>27</sup>In fact, it is only in this manner that we may return to our Father's presence to dwell.<sup>28</sup>We cannot do it by suffering the punishment for our own sins. We can only do it by complying with the premortal covenant we made to accept Christ as our Savior and to fulfill our end of the agreement.<br><br>And so we might ask: What are the terms that we agreed to? What is it that Christ asks of us in exchange for His suffering on our behalf? In section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants, Christ has told us:<br><br><em>I . . . have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer</em>if they would repent;<br><br><em>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</em><br><br><em>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</em><sup>29</sup><br><br>Simply put, Christ asks that we<em>repent</em>in exchange for His suffering. Christ<em>commands</em>that we repent in exchange for His suffering.<sup>30</sup>And, equally important,<em>we agreed</em>to repent in exchange for Christ's suffering.<br><br>Repentance! What is repentance? How do we repent? What does repentance entail? We get some insight into repentance by studying the law of sacrifice, given to Moses as a type to point forward to the coming Atonement of Christ.<sup>31</sup>In Leviticus we read:<br><br><em>If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and lie unto his neighbour . . . or</em>[take]<em>a thing . . . by violence . . . ;</em><br><br><em>Or</em>[find]<em>that which was lost, and</em>[lie]<em>concerning it, and</em>[swear]<em>falsely . . . ;</em><br><br><em>Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or . . . the lost thing which he found,</em><br><br><em>. . . he shall even restore it in the principal, . . . and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth. . . .</em><br><br><em>And he shall bring</em>[a]<em>trespass offering unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, . . . for a trespass offering, unto the priest:</em><br><br><em>And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.</em><sup>32</sup><br><br>Here we clearly see some important elements of repentance. He or she who sinned was to acknowledge their wrongdoing, make restitution for the wrong they had done, and confess their sins to the priest. They were also to make an offering to the Lord through the priest--which offering was to be a ram without blemish. This sacrifice, as we read in Moses,<sup>33</sup>was in similitude of the sacrifice of the perfect Christ. Thus the sacrifice was required to be a male and without blemish.<br><br>The requirements of Christ and the elements of repentance have changed very little from the time of Moses to our day. We are still required to acknowledge our faults, to make restitution, and to confess our sins to the priest or bishop. In section 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "By this ye may know if a man [or woman] repenteth of [their] sins--behold, [they] will confess them and forsake them."<sup>34</sup><br><br>With respect to confession, it would be appropriate to consider the situation of Enos, whom I mentioned earlier. I have observed that many Latter-day Saints erroneously confuse Enos' circumstances with their own, and in their misunderstanding they attempt to avoid involving their bishop or other ecclesiastical leader in the process of their confession and subsequent repentance.<br><br>By way of illustration, one young man who was anxious to serve a mission came to my home late one evening and poured out his heart to me in confession. He had been up in the hills praying for forgiveness. During the mental and spiritual turmoil caused by his sins, his mind had been drawn back to the story of Enos. At length he convinced himself that he would seek forgiveness directly from the Lord in personal, fervent prayer, even if he--like Enos--had to pray all night.<br><br>The young man prayed long, hard, fervently, and tearfully with much energy, anguish, and humility. Yet he did not receive a witness that his sins had been forgiven; rather, he received an overwhelming impression that he should go confess his sins to his bishop. Soon the young man had properly confessed all the transgressions from his past to an authorized representative of the Lord, and together they had established a plan to help him put his spiritual life in order.<br><br>In the fully organized, restored Church of Jesus Christ--which has a complete line of authorized priesthood leaders in every ward, branch, stake, district, or mission--complete repentance of serious sins always involves confession to the proper ecclesiastical leader in addition to humble prayer to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Let us ask a corollary question: Why would this young man, or anyone for that matter, seek to omit this important step in the repentance process?<br><br>After many such experiences I have observed that Satan preys on people's great sense of fear regarding the potential outcome of such a confession. Most members of the Church also admire and respect their bishop, and the last thing they want is for their bishop to know who they really are and to feel disappointed in them. It shouldn't surprise you that your bishop already knows who you are: a precious child of God whose eternal worth is beyond measure. The overwhelming feelings that pour into a bishop's heart at these times are ones of gratitude and love rather than of disappointment: "For this [my] brother [or sister] was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."<sup>35</sup><br><br>The only time a bishop feels disappointed is when he learns that someone failed to take advantage of the opportunity to cast the shackles of sin at Christ's feet and to walk out of the office freed from the heavy oppression of Satan's grasp.<br><br>But, to return to the pattern for repentance outlined in the passage from Leviticus: In addition to confessing our sins and making restitution, we are also still required to make a sacrificial offering to the Lord, but an offering of a different nature. In the Book of Mormon we read the account in which the resurrected Lord, having only recently offered Himself up as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, spoke to the Nephites on the American continent. To them He said:<br><br><em>Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. . . .</em><br><br><em>. . . The scriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled.</em><br><br><em>And as many as have received me, to them have Igiven to become the sons of God; and even so will Ito as many as shall believe on my name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses fulfilled. . . .</em><br><br><em>And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings.</em><br><br><em>And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me</em>a broken heart and a contrite spirit.<em>And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</em><sup>36</sup><br><br>This offering of a broken heart and a contrite spirit is, in my mind, perhaps the most critical aspect of repentance. For it is this offering that indicates the true condition of our souls. How do we know if we have a broken heart and a contrite spirit? I believe that this is exemplified by one who comes forward willingly, of their own volition, and confesses their sins to any they might have offended, and the bishop if necessary, but without any pretense or effort to make excuses. A person who has a broken heart and a contrite spirit understands the significance of their act and wants to do anything and everything within their power to set it right.<br><br>In coming forward and humbly and meekly confessing, it is as if they present before the Lord--and offer up on the altar for all to see--the natural man that is in them, with all of his weakness and depravity. They seek not to hide their faults but openly acknowledge their faults and humbly seek forgiveness. I believe that this is what is meant by putting off the natural man, who is an enemy to God.<sup>37</sup>For by humbly and contritely offering the natural man up on the altar of confession--as a sacrifice, if you will--we rid ourselves of him and "become new creatures"<sup>38</sup>through Christ. Christ then becomes our spiritual Father, or the Father of our spiritual rebirth. For it is through His Atonement that this is made possible. This helps us understand the imagery used by Isaiah, who said, speaking of the Savior, "It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, [then] he shall see his seed. . . . [Then] he shall see . . . the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied."<sup>39</sup><br><br>I cannot read this scripture without picturing in my mind's eye my wife, Holly, after having struggled through the intense and anguishing pain of childbirth, looking down at the product of her travail with tears of joy in her eyes. Our<em>spiritual</em>rebirth has come through the travail of Christ. As Abinidi taught,<em>we--</em>meaning all who have accepted His offering and met the requirements of repentance, as part of the covenant of the Atonement--are His seed.<sup>40</sup>And Christ, in like manner, rejoices in the product of His travail.<br><br>And again I ask, What is repentance? It is that we exercise faith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ by confessing and forsaking our sins and offering up a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit before the Lord. There is no superhuman feat or great thing that we must do to receive God's forgiveness.<br><br>Unfortunately, many sometimes feel as did Naaman, captain of the host of Syria, who was smitten with leprosy.<sup>41</sup>Naaman exercised sufficient faith to approach Elisha, the Lord's prophet, to seek a blessing. But when Elisha sent his servant to tell him that all he needed to do was to dip himself seven times in the river Jordan to be healed, Naaman left in anger, feeling that it was too light a thing to be taken seriously. Fortunately Naaman had a wise servant who asked, "My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?"<sup>42</sup>Naaman did as his servant counseled and was healed.<br><br>I have seen some individuals who have confessed and forsaken their sins with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and yet are unable to accept the forgiveness that comes through the Atonement. They, like Naaman, have sufficient faith to approach the bishop but feel that the Lord can't truly be willing to forgive them without their doing some great thing. They do not understand the miracle of forgiveness or the wonderful gift of grace that the Atonement is.<br><br>Just how miraculous is the Atonement? So miraculous that a very clear type had to be given in the wilderness of Mount Hor to allow us to comprehend that, just as those who exercised sufficient faith to look upon the brazen serpent were healed,<sup>43</sup>"even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal."<sup>44</sup><br><br>Christ taught:<br><br><em>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</em><br><br><em>Take my yoke upon you, and . . . ye shall find rest unto your souls.</em><br><br><em>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</em><sup>45</sup><br><br>My brothers and sisters, we can't work off our sins. I repeat: We<em>cannot</em>work off our sins. It is only through Christ's Atonement that we can be forgiven of our sins. It may be true that service to God and our fellowman can bring us to a state in which we are able to exercise faith in Christ's Atonement sufficient to be healed, primarily by making us more receptive to the Spirit and by helping those who are weak in the faith to have hope that maybe, just maybe, they might be found acceptable before the Lord. However, it is not our works that save us from sin. For unless these works bring us to the point where we can look to Christ and accept His Atonement by meeting the demands of repentance, they truly avail us nothing. The same holds true for mortal suffering. Did not Christ say that<em>He</em>had "suffered these things for all, that<em>they</em>might<em>not</em>suffer"? We cannot enter the kingdom of heaven by suffering for our own sins.<br><br>We should clearly understand that Christ has<em>already</em>suffered and paid the price for<em>all</em>of our sins.<sup>46</sup>It is a mistaken and misleading notion to think that Christ only suffered for the sins of which we repent. Book of Mormon prophets teach that Christ's Atonement was infinite, eternal, and all-encompassing.<sup>47</sup>Christ's Atonement covered all sin, all transgression, all wrongdoing.<sup>48</sup>And because He suffered for our sins, He can come before the Father in the Day of Judgment on behalf of those who have repented of their sins to offer intercession, as expressed by Him in the following scripture:<br><br><em>Listen to him who is</em>[your]<em>advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--</em><br><br><em>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</em><br><br><em>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren</em>that believe on my name,<em>that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</em><sup>49</sup><br><br>So we should have faith! So we should have hope! So we should look to Christ and live! Remember the words of the Lord as spoken through His prophet Isaiah: "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."<sup>50</sup><br><br>And remember also the words of the Lord, spoken with great frankness to Joseph Smith in modern times: "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more."<sup>51</sup><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters: Believe in Christ! Believe His words!<br><br>I bear testimony and solemn witness to the absolute necessity of Christ's Atonement. Without it we cannot be saved. I bear witness of His incomprehensible love. He stands always with hands outstretched, waiting to receive us.<br><br>That we may all look to Christ and live by coming forward and receiving the miracle of forgiveness He offers is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><strong>Notes</strong><br><br>1.

<h1>nd Howard: Lessons from Two Grandfathers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the wonderful music today. Music always brings such a peaceful spirit to these devotionals. I feel blessed to be at Brigham Young University and would like to thank the Lord for helping me in so many ways as a faculty member here. I would also like to thank my wife and family for their support.<br><br>A month ago I woke up at 3:30 in the morning with one of those anxiety dreams in which it is a relief to know that it was only a dream. I dreamed that I had gathered with my family for this devotional address. It was 10:55 a.m., and no one was in the hall. I then realized in my dream that I was in the Joseph Smith Auditorium rather than in the Marriott Center. My family and I ran to the Marriott Center, where President Samuelson was waiting, tapping his watch. In my dream I was quite late for this address; all of the students had been sitting quietly for five minutes, waiting for me to arrive. Today I seem to be in the right place at the right time.<br><br>As I thought about a topic to share today, I thought of the purpose of devotionals. A devotional at BYU is a meeting in which we listen to a religious message that helps us lift our devotions to the Most High God. These messages are intended to lift our spirits and inspire our minds as we progress in our journey toward eternal life. As I tried to listen to the Spirit and contemplate what message I could share that would be uplifting to the students and faculty at BYU, my thoughts kept returning to the same topic: the lessons I've learned from my two grandfathers, Harvey Fletcher and Howard Tonks. I mentioned this topic to some colleagues, and they all said, "I know who Harvey Fletcher is, but who is Howard?" This is the point of my talk.<br><br>I approach this topic knowing that we each have wonderful ancestors who have had experiences that teach us about life. I draw from these two people because of their influence in my life and because of the contrasts and similarities of their lives.<br><h2><b>Harvey Fletcher</b></h2><br>One of my grandfathers was Harvey Fletcher. He became very famous in the field of physics and acoustics, and a building at BYU was named after him. Let me tell you a little about him. He was born in Provo in 1884. As a point of reference, the Brigham Young Academy was started in 1875. Harvey attended the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893 when he was nine. The Salt Lake Temple was dedicated by Wilford Woodruff. Harvey was born into a humble family, the fifth of eleven children. He and his family were great fishermen and would take a covered wagon to the Strawberry Valley to catch barrels full of fish. Utah was a very primitive place, and Harvey loved the outdoors. His first experience with physics was when he sat on top of what is now Y Mountain, viewed the puff of steam from the train locomotive, and timed the arrival of the sound of the whistle.<br><h3><i><b>Lesson 1: Be "Both 'Good' and 'Great'"</b></i></h3><br>When Harvey was in Primary, he delivered a short memorized speech from the pulpit of the Provo Tabernacle. Brother Karl G. Maeser was in attendance, and before Harvey could sit down, Brother Maeser put his hand on Harvey's head and said, "This boy will go a long way in the Church and among the leaders of men."<sup>1</sup>He then said, "This little boy will one day be a great man."<sup>2</sup>The boys Harvey's age teased him about being a "great" man. A few years later, as president of his Aaronic Priesthood quorum, the bishop asked young Harvey to stand up and give a speech to the quorum. Harvey said that he was dumbfounded and stood nervously on one foot and then the other. Then he blurted out, "I would rather be good than great," and sat down.<sup>3</sup>About eighty years later he retold this story to the College of Engineering at BYU in the deJong Concert Hall. Harvey mused, "It wasn't such a bad speech after all, now that I think about it."<sup>4</sup>On Harvey's gravestone the following message was engraved: "Both 'good' and 'great.'"<br><br>So what is the lesson here? To me the lesson is that it is most important to be good. Here, to be good means to be a follower of the Savior Jesus Christ and His teachings as revealed in the scriptures and through modern-day prophets. In part, this lesson is the message ofthe prophet Jacob:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:18–19]<br><h3><i><b>Lesson 2: Do Your Best in School and at Work</b></i></h3><br>As a young man Harvey worked in the grocery business and saved enough money to enter Brigham Young Academy in the fall of 1900. There were two courses of study: commercial and normal. Harvey entered the normal curriculum because it was less expensive. He also said that he entered the academy mainly because his friends were there. He breezed through the mathematics classes, feeling almost like he had studied them before. One of the other classes that he took was physics. He said that he understood the subject by just sitting in the class, listening to the teacher, and plying him with questions; but Harvey did not do any of the assigned work. In particular, he did not keep a laboratory journal. As a result he obtained an F grade.<br><br>Harvey later wrote the following in his autobiography:<br><br><i>It was the first and only grade failure that I ever received. This jolted my pride, and I think from then on I took my education seriously. I repeated the course the next year, obtained the highest grade in the class, A+, and was given my first paid job in the school, an assistant in the laboratory. During the following three years I taught physics and mathematics courses while carrying the regular college courses. At the end of these three years I graduated with a B.S. degree. The next year I was a full-time teacher at a salary of $750.00 a year.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>By the way, there were only six students in the graduating class of 1907. Harvey ended up becoming president of the American Physics Society later in life and was the first LDS scientist elected to the American Academy of Science (in 1935).<br><br>So what is the lesson here? Perhaps it is to do all of your homework in school. Perhaps it is to do your best the first time or you will have to do it over. I think that the real message is that you should do something that you really want to do, no matter how hard it is. Don't be discouraged if it does not work out the way you wanted at first. Keep trying with your besteffort.<br><br>Bishop Victor L. Brown said the following:<br><br><i>At whatever level our children complete their formal schooling, they should have learned how important excellence is in all they do. There is always room at the top in any enterprise, and it is always crowded at the bottom. It doesn't matter what the field of endeavor--plumber, doctor, teacher, lawyer, farmer, carpenter, whatever--if our children learn early in their lives that they should do their very best, they will be eminently better prepared for the responsibilities of life.</i><br><br><i>We should teach our children the importance of schooling as a help in discovering how to think and to learn. They need to know, and we need to be reminded, that schooling is merely the formal part of education. Education should never stop, but should be a continuing activity throughout life.</i><sup>6</sup><br><h3><i><b>Lesson 3: Stay True to Your Testimony</b></i></h3><br>Harvey went to the University of Chicago in 1908 and, under the direction of Robert Milliken, earned a PhD in 1911 by measuring the charge on an electron. Harvey returned to BYU to teach physics but received an offer to become a researcher in New York City at Western Electric, which was the premier physics lab in the country. This lab became the main research lab for AT&amp;amp;T. After several years of persistence from Western Electric, Harvey asked BYU president George H. Brimhall for permission to go to Western Electric. BYU was struggling for prestigious faculty, and President Brimhall told Harvey not to go. However, soon after that Church president Joseph F. Smith attended a board meeting at BYU, and Harvey asked President Smith the same question. After listening to Harvey's story President Smith sat quietly in a thoughtful mood for a few minutes and then said:<br><br><i>Yes, I want you to go and take this position, but promise this, that you will keep your testimony strong and keep up your Church activities. If you do so you can do more good for the Church in New York City than you could do here at the BYU at the present time and you will be successful in your work. We need more Mormon boys to go out into the world of business and scientific research to represent our ideal of living.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Harvey took his small family to New York City in 1916 and stayed there until he retired. He served first as president of the Manhattan Branch for ten years and then in the district presidency, stake presidency, and high council for thirty-five years. He was an emissary for the Church in the scientific world. He went around the world giving lectures about science and religion. Let me show a video recording of Harvey Fletcher bearing his testimony to the scientific world. This clip was made in the 1960s. [A film clip was shown with the following testimony:]<br><br><i>There's a great tendency in this day and age to think that as one becomes mature one must throw off his belief in God just as one discards his belief in Santa Claus. Just where would such a position leave us? We would be forced then to admit that this beautiful world of ours is not the product of design and planning but of mere, undirected chance, that your dearest friend is simply a jumble of atoms and molecules that just happened to land together to make a dear and loving personality. I, myself, have a firm belief that God lives and that life has purpose for each of us living here upon earth. I did not obtain that faith through scientific reasoning but rather through spiritual experiences which are hard to explain to others but nevertheless are very real. True religion never hesitates to be held up by investigation by men of science.</i><br><br>So what is the lesson here? In my mind the lesson that I have learned is to stay true to your testimony. I have met many people in science who seem to ignore God because they cannot prove that He exists. There is no logical argument that can persuade someone that the Church is true. The only way to know of the existence of God is to have a personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, as explained in Moroni 10:5: "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."<br><h2><b>Howard Tonks</b></h2><br>Now let me switch to talk about my other grandfather. His name was Howard Tonks. He was never famous. He was born in Morgan, Utah, in 1895. While Howard was still a child, his family moved to Victor, Idaho, and started a dairy and sheep farm. Victor is a small town on the Idaho side of the Teton Mountains near Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Victor is where the trains turned around because they could not make it over the pass to Jackson. Needless to say, in the early 1900s Victor was a very small place, even compared to Provo. Howard was the eighth of eleven children. His father raised sheep and dairy cows.<br><br>So what lessons did I learn from Howard, a person from such a small town who was raised on a farm?<br><h3><i><b>Lesson 4: Serve Faithfully in Callings</b></i></h3><br>Howard Tonks was called to serve a mission to Australia on November 17, 1916, by President Joseph F. Smith. It is interesting to me that this was the same year that President Smith told Harvey Fletcher to go to work in New York City. Howard left his home in Victor, Idaho, on December 30, 1916, by train; reported at the Office of the First Presidency in Salt Lake City on January 3, 1917; and boarded a steamer in San Francisco on January 31, 1917, bound for Hawaii, then Pago Pago (Samoa), and finally Sydney, Australia. This was during World WarI, and he saw some German battleships and merchant ships being held by the United States in Pago Pago. He finally arrived in Sydney on February 21, 1917 (a three-week voyage!).<br><br>Howard kept a brief journal of his mission experiences that is cherished by his family. Howard served in Melbourne and Perth. It was wartime, and many young men his age were being sent to Europe to fight in the trenches of World War I. He watched as thousands of Australian men were loaded onto ships to go to war. At first Howard was very lonely and a little discouraged. However, he learned to love the Australian and Maori people, and they learned to love him as he brought them the truths of the gospel.<br><br>Howard had to stay in Australia a little longer than the average missionary because of the war. Due to submarine danger there was a genuine concern for ships traveling the oceans. The armistice for World War I was signed in November 1918. Most of the ships were used to bring troops home from overseas, so Howard served until March 1920--a little over three years from when he began his mission. Let me show a photo from a preparation day in which the elders were having a little fun. [A photo was shown of Howard Tonks with several other missionaries.]<br><br>On my first trip to Australia to attend a scientific conference, I was able to read copies of some of Howard's letters to former missionary companions who were still serving in Australia and New Zealand. These letters gave me a love for my grandfather and a love for my brothers and sisters in Australia.<br><br>So what is the lesson or lessons learned from Howard Tonks' mission experiences? First and foremost he was a great example of missionary service. This helped me have a determination to serve a mission. I learned that missions can be hard and that people are not always accepting of your beliefs. I also learned that while serving the Savior in a calling, you serve as hard as you can and do not worry about how long you serve in that calling. I had the privilege of serving in the Ecuador Quito Mission, and at the end I wished that I could have served three years instead of two.<br><h2><b>Harvey and Howard</b></h2><br><h3><i><b>Lesson 5: Be Devoted to Your Spouse</b></i></h3><br>I have to mention how Harvey and Howard met the girls that they eventually married.<br><br>Harvey was attending a stake conference meeting in the Provo Tabernacle and getting drowsy in the balcony. All of a sudden a rose came floating down and hit him in the head. He turned around, and three girls, who were sisters, were giggling. One had a red face, so he knew the culprit: Lorena Chipman. After the meeting he went up to her and asked if he could take her to the dance. She accepted. When he arrived to take her to the dance, all three girls were dressed up and ready to go, so he took all three. He married the girl that hit him with the rose. Now I am not advocating throwing roses at cute guys.<br><br>Harvey was good friends with his two sisters-in-law. One of these sisters, Fern, married Carl Eyring. Carl Eyring died early, and so did Harvey's wife. Harvey married his sister-in-law Fern when he was eighty-five and she was eighty, and they were married for twelve years. So in the end Harvey married two of those three giggling girls from the Provo Tabernacle.<br><br>My grandmother Firl Bagley was born in Charleston, Utah. Charleston is the small town at the far end of Deer Creek where you turn to go to Midway. She was the tenth of eleven children. Her family decided to move to Victor, Idaho, when she was young. Her mother was ill, and they left her in Salt Lake City to recover. However, her mother died when Firl was four years old. Firl's dad could not take care of a farm and eleven kids by himself, so Firl was put in a foster home with a German couple. This couple raised her in Victor until she left to go to Sugar City to high school.<br><br>Howard met Firl in a very interesting way. Firl was in front of the church on a Sunday morning and noticed that a small child had fallen and scraped a knee. Firl reached her first, picked her up, and loved her. Howard was a young returned missionary with black curly hair, a beautiful smile, and a twinkle in his eye. He said to himself, "That girl is going to be my wife."<sup>8</sup><br><br>So what is the lesson here? I don't think the lesson to be learned is to fall in love at first sight with just any person who catches your attention. However, I do think that the lesson is that when you do fall in love, make the commitment 100 percent. Both Howard and Harvey were sealed to their spouses in the temple of God, and they were very devoted husbands. If you are still looking for a spouse, pray that the Lord will guide you and let you know when it is right. If you have made a marriage covenant already to someone with whom you fell in love, stay in love and honor your covenant.<br><h3><i><b>Lesson 6: Have a Positive Attitude</b></i></h3><br>Perhaps the biggest lesson that I learned from Harvey Fletcher was to be personable to all people. Everywhere Harvey went he tried to be friendly to people. Even though he was widely recognized in the fields of acoustics, physics, and science, he was always known as Uncle Harvey to his associates. He never sought recognition--at least he never tried giving the impression that he was better than someone else. He always tried to be happy. Even in his later years, when slowed by a body getting older, he never complained about aches and pains. People at church would come up to him when he was in his nineties and say, "Uncle Harvey, how are you doing today?"<br><br>Hewould smile, shuffle his feet, and respond, "I can still dance!"<br><br>What a beautiful example to me of having a positive attitude and treating other people with respect.<br><h3><i><b>Lesson 7: Be Humble and Try to Be Like Jesus</b></i></h3><br>The biggest lesson that I have learned from Howard Tonks is to be humble and to be close to Jesus Christ. Howard worked hard on the sheep ranch and dairy farm. The climate in Victor, Idaho, is harsh, yet animals still have to be fed and cared for every day. Despite the hard, rugged work, Howard remained faithful to the Lord his whole life. He served on the high council in the Driggs Stake for close to twenty-five years. The stake president wanted Howard as a counselor, but there was no telephone line to Howard's farm. Serving on the high council involved traveling long distances, sometimes in heavy snow using a team of horses and a sleigh. Traveling over the pass to Jackson in the winter was especially difficult.<br><br>Despite having little formal education, Howard was a student of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He loved the scriptures. He would often stand up in a Sunday School class or a priesthood meeting and give insight or correction on a gospel topic. He had a quiet reverence about him, and he inspired me to try to be closer to the Lord.<br><br>Howard developed Parkinson's disease in his old age. He had been struck by lightning three times while working on the farm in Victor, which may have contributed to his disease. Most of my personal recollections of him are as an older man suffering from Parkinson's disease. He still had the twinkle in his eye, but the black curly hair was thinned and gray. Whenever we spoke he was always interested in me and always cheerful. I never heard him complain about anything. He was always gentle and kind and seemed to be a very spiritual person. What a great example of trying to be like Jesus.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>So these are my two grandfathers, Howard and Harvey. I hope that these stories were inspiring to you; they certainly are to me. Let me summarize the lessons learned from these stories:<br><br>1. Be "Both 'Good' and 'Great'"<br><br>2. Do Your Best in School and at Work<br><br>3. Stay True to Your Testimony<br><br>4. Serve Faithfully in Callings<br><br>5. Be Devoted to Your Spouse<br><br>6. Have a Positive Attitude ("I can still dance!")<br><br>7. Be Humble and Try to Be Like Jesus<br><br>I am sure that there are unique stories from your grandparents that are equally inspiring. Perhaps one of my messages today is to learn from our family histories. Both Howard and Harvey were born in large families in small towns. One became an internationally known scientist, bearing his testimony to large numbers of people throughout his life and while working in New York City. The other quietly served a mission, raised a family, worked hard on a farm in Victor, Idaho, and served the Lord with all of his heart whenever called. Perhaps in the eyes of the world one was great and one was relatively obscure. However, in the eyes of the Lord, I think that both were good. Both were valiant servants of our Lord Jesus Christ throughout their lives.<br><br>In the end, when we come before the Savior, the words that I would most like to hear would be "Well done, thou<i>good</i>and faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21; emphasis added). It is my prayer that we can all strive to be<i>great</i>at what we do but<i>good</i>at who we are. I bear testimony that Jesus lives and that He loves us enough to give us His restored Church and His priesthood. I bear witness that He sees what is in our hearts and always invites us to be a little better. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas H.

<h1> of Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Happy Valentine's Day! This is a day when we celebrate love. We think of love letters and hearts, roses and chocolate. Many hope today to<i>receive</i>a message from one they love, and some are planning to<i>deliver</i>a message to one they love. I hope you won't be disappointed.<br><br>My parents loved me dearly--of that I had no doubt. But when I was ten years old, I had to attend boarding school in England while my parents continued to live thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. The separation was an enormous wrench for me.<br><br>On the long flight to England, I remember feeling queasy in the pit of my stomach as I left behind the heat and sunshine of Arabia, flew across the miles, and descended through multiple layers of cloud into the cold, gray scene of London's Heathrow Airport. The rain droplets on the airplane window shot past, and I felt so very, very far from home.<br><br>I arrived at the school in my uniform of gray shorts, sweater, tie, and cap, pulling my great, green trunk of belongings behind me. The loneliness was overwhelming.<br><br>I slept in a dormitory with about fifteen other boys. It was a very foreign experience, complete with rickety, metal-framed beds and the occasional pillow fight. Every morning after making our beds, we boys would stand aside while our bed-making skills and "hospital corners" were graded. There were unfamiliar smells, unfamiliar foods, and<i>very</i>unfamiliar teachers. My Latin master would walk around the room and peck our heads with the tip of his ballpoint pen if we didn't know an answer. And I was very well pecked.<br><br>Out on the fields during our sports time, on a rare clear day, if a plane was flying high overhead, leaving a vapor trail, I would study its course to see if that plane might be heading back to Arabia--feeling a deep pang if it was. Ilonged, somehow, to jump aboard and go back home to my parents.<br><br>The brightest spot in any week came during breakfast time when mail was delivered. I would look anxiously for the telltale blue airmail letter that my mother sent faithfully every week. As the teachers came around the tables with letters to hand out, I would literally be on the edge of my bench waiting to see if one was for me. In so many senses this was Hogwarts, but without the owls and with none of the magic.<br><br>The blue airmail letters were often the highlight of my week, particularly in those early days when my loneliness was most acute. Iwould receive letters from home with such happiness and relief. I would wait until I could be alone to carefully unseal them and then eagerly read the messages of love, reassurance, and advice from my parents. I savored every line and felt, for those moments, closer to home and closer to my parents' love, and I received the courage I needed to continue on for another week.<br><br>There is much in the natural course of mortal life that can make us feel alone and afraid, even while we are surrounded by people, as I was at boarding school. And we all feel far from home at times. In fact, most of you<i>are</i>far from home while you are here at BYU. Perhaps this is a relatively new and painful experience for you and you are still finding it hard to adjust. Homesickness may continue to gnaw at you. For others, maybe you've been away from home for several semesters, or even several years, and you're accustomed to it. And, indeed, for some, perhaps being away from a situation in which you dealt with negative influences and difficult relationships has been a good thing and has given you a chance to begin to become the person you know you canbe.<br><br>We don't send those blue airmail letters much anymore to keep in touch with home, as email, cell phones, Facebook, Skype, and Twitter have replaced old-fashioned letter writing. But messages from home, messages of love and reassurance and guidance, however they arrive at your door or in your inbox, can have a powerful influence in steadying you along your journey while you are away from home. They remind you that you are loved and cherished. Letters, cards, texts, emails, and phone calls from Mom and Dad, brothers and sisters, grandparents, relatives, and friends go a long way to help us when we face challenges and adversity far from the comforts of home. I still gain strength and comfort from a phone call home to my mother in England. She is now ninety years old.<br><br>Of course in so many ways we are all far from home. The metaphor here with our eternal home is clear. We know we were blessed to be in the presence of our Father in Heaven, our Savior, and "many of the noble and great ones" (Abraham 3:22) in our premortal existence. We know we received our "first lessons" (D&amp;amp;C 138:56) from them and had many opportunities "to choose good or evil" and to "[exercise] exceedingly great faith" (Alma 13:3). We know we are here on earth to be proven, "to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]" (Abraham 3:25). Do you ever feel homesick and long for your eternal home and for the love and affirmation and pure truth and light we know exist there? Don't our spirits yearn to be where they know they belong best, there in the presence of our Father, "encircled about eternally in the arms of his love" (2 Nephi 1:15)?<br><br>Our Eternal Father has not let any of us leave home, leave His presence, without the opportunity to access His love and His guidance--every day of our lives. President Henry B. Eyring assures us, "[The Father] offers us, through prayer in the name of His Son, the opportunity to commune with Him in this life<i>as often as we choose"</i>("Exhort Them to Pray,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 2012, 4; emphasis added). Sometimes we forget this. Sometimes we doubt this. Sometimes we cut ourselves off from it. But He has endowed us all with the Light of Christ to enable us to judge right from wrong, to determine light from darkness and truth from error (see Moroni 7:16). As we repeatedly respond to the Light of Christ and train ourselves to "lay hold upon every good thing" (Moroni 7:19), we increase our sensitivity to the things of the Spirit and enhance our ability to receive the messages coming to us from our eternal home. As often as we sincerely seek and are worthy to receive, our Eternal Father communicates with us through revelation--messages that come to us in the reflective moments of prayer, through the words and enlightenment of the scriptures, from the teachings of the prophets, or in the peaceful melodies of heavenly music. His messages are often quiet, and we<i>all</i>know that we can miss them if we are not ready to receive.<br><br>In fact, it is often<i>because</i>we are so busy receiving other messages that we impair our ability to receive the much-needed messages from our eternal home. We now live in a world in which messages surround us, even bombard us. Our smartphones, our computers, and our tablets are constantly buzzing, beeping, and vibrating with every new text, social media update, email, and photograph. It really is instant and insistent messaging.<br><br>This extraordinary technology, of course, can do enormous good. One example of that is how the glorious message of the gospel of Jesus Christ can be shared, streamed, and received through every kind of handheld device. But we must be selective in the messages we choose to receive. It is vital to our spiritual well-being that we do not consume so much of our time receiving good messages, or even better messages, that we make ourselves unavailable to receive the best messages (see Dallin H. Oaks, "Good, Better, Best,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2007, 104–8).<br><br>Just as I could not will one of those blue airmail letters from my mother to appear every morning at breakfast time, we cannot force messages from our eternal home. The Lord decides when and how and what to communicate with us. It is true that "every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth" (Luke 11:10), but we must remember and take heart in the fact that "it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). We cannot demand messages of the Lord. We must wait upon Him. But even as we wait upon Him, we continue to pursue Him and to persist in our petitions.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:<br><br><i>Revelation is not a matter of pushing buttons, but of pushing ourselves, often aided by fasting, scripture study, and personal pondering.</i><br><br><i>. . . Revelation requires us to have a sufficient degree of personal righteousness, so that on occasion revelation may come to the righteous, unsolicited.</i>["Revelation,"<i>First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</i>11 January 2003 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003), 5]<br><br>There have been reminders recently of the golden age of manned space flight, particularly of the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s. These missions were incredible feats of science and engineering. The crew members were the brightest and most able of their class, launched into space atop the Saturn V rocket, still the most powerful machine ever made by man. Before they could land on the moon, however, their spacecraft had to be slowed to enter a lunar orbit. This meant doing something that--as with so much of this endeavor--had never been done before. And that was to travel around the far side, or so-called dark side, of the moon.<br><br>All the way there the crew had been able to be in constant radio contact with mission control in Houston. But when it came time for them to go around the far side of the moon, communication would be lost, as the moon would quite literally be between the spacecraft and the earth. All of the science, all of the engineering, and all of the collective intelligence of the most gifted and dedicated practitioners of this groundbreaking endeavor had not been able to come up with a way for them to communicate while they were around the dark side of the moon. So for forty-five agonizing minutes, all communication was lost with the crew. All they could do at mission control in Houston was wait and hope and wait and pray as each of those forty-five minutes ticked tensely by. What if a problem arose and there were a malfunction of some kind? How would mission control know, and how could they possibly help?<br><br>Well, the spacecraft did emerge from around the far side of the moon, the radio signal was reacquired, and mission control must have erupted with shouts of relief and joyas the safety of the crew was confirmed.<br><br>And so it can so easily be for us. We can be, like those astronauts, astonishingly bright, capable, and gifted in our own ways--shooting for the moon. We can have had the most extraordinary learning experiences and been given remarkable opportunities for growth in our lives. Perhaps we have received exceptional teaching and training from parents, teachers, mission presidents, and leaders and have come far and learned much. We will have caught glimpses of our eternal potential, of our mission here on earth in this mortal phase of our existence. But in order to continue our progression on the course the Lord would have us set, and in order to return safely to our eternal home, we must remain in constant communication with Him. If we place barriers between ourselves and the source of that critical communication--revelation from our Heavenly Father--we will be unable to receive the messages of guidance we need from Him.<br><br>Problems will arise and malfunctions will occur as our mortal lives take their natural course. When they do, will we find that we have cut ourselves off from the one true source of our guidance and direction?<br><br>On this Valentine's Day, let us examine the condition of our hearts and how we are doing in receiving the messages of love, guidance, correction, and revelation from our Father, the great God and Creator of this universe. What barriers do we put between ourselves and the Lord? Do we sometimes figuratively place ourselves on the dark side of the moon, where we cannot hear from mission control?<br><br>There are many conditions of our hearts that may affect our ability to tune in to and receive the messages from our Heavenly Father. I will touch upon only three:<br><ul><br>	<li>Our hearts may be burdened by the cares of daily life and the clamor of the world.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our hearts may be hardened by sin or unworthiness.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Our hearts may be malnourished by a poor digital diet.</li><br></ul><br><h2><b>First: Our Hearts May Be Burdened by theCares of Daily Life and the Clamor of the World</b></h2><br>We may not mean to do it, we may not even<i>know</i>we are doing it, but occasionally we can put ourselves around the dark side of the moon when our hearts become overburdened by the worries, pressures, irritations, and deadlines of daily life. We may not be facing anything all that unusual or experiencing a particularly stretching challenge, but our hearts can become blocked from the peace and comfort the Lord would give us because we are just too troubled and concerned. When we stay up too late and work too hard in order to meet our daily demands, fatigue sets in, we become overtired, and then the world looks to us a much gloomier place; things get out of perspective and out of proportion. There are papers to write, exams to take, research to do, jobs to fulfill, and maybe children to care for. There will be financial worries, family concerns, and questions of the soul over where to go next or what to do when this phase of life is complete. And on<i>this</i>day, how could I<i>not</i>make reference to the worries over dates, or the lack thereof; concerns over whether to become engaged; or indeed the want for such an opportunity.<br><br>You may not even realize just how much the noise and busyness of the world around you affects how you feel and alters your ability to hear and receive the messages your Eternal Father has for you.<br><br>When you are feeling overwhelmed and overburdened, it seems impossible to find a way or a time to slow down, find a quiet space, and draw close to your Heavenly Father. Just the mere suggestion that you might carve out some time from your already overscheduled day increases the sense of pressure you feel. You may doubt that choosing to spend that segment of quiet time will actually yield enough benefit and so think your time is better spent getting on with something else. However, that's when problems arise and small glitches can turn into a major malfunction.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer teaches a vital truth with regard to our hearts being burdened by the cares and clamor of daily life. He says:<br><br><i>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that</i>if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.<br><br><i>Occasionally, it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come</i>seeking and listening. ["The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge,"<i>New Era,</i>January 2007, 4; emphasis added]<br><br>We must each find and then guard a time each and every day to remember these words of the Lord: "All flesh is in mine hands;<i>be still</i>and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16; emphasis added). A segment of time when we can be<i>still,</i>quiet, and removed from our busyness will help recenter us, refocus our priorities, and bring us back into a position in which we can receive and feel the messages our Heavenly Father wishes to send to us. Remember, if our hearts are preoccupied, we may not be able to feel Father's messages. His voice "[is] not a harsh voice, neither [is] it a loud voice; nevertheless, . . . it being a small voice it [does] pierce them that . . . hear to the center, . . . to the very soul, and [does] cause their hearts to burn" (3 Nephi 11:3). When we make ourselves ready and take the step of faith to put Him first at some point in our day (and why not first?), we find peace even in the midst of an otherwise hectic schedule. But we must make the choice to make it happen by putting Him first.<br><h2><b>Second: Our Hearts May Be Hardened by Sin or Unworthiness</b></h2><br>There can be no doubt that hearts carrying sin and unworthiness place barriers between themselves and God. Sometimes a heart can carry sin for so long that it becomes desensitized to spiritual things and becomes incapable of receiving and feeling the messages of the Lord. If there is something you carry in your heart today that is blocking you--in any degree--from truly connecting with your Heavenly Father and feeling His love and His plan for you, resolve now to put it right, let it go, give it up, or throw it out. Hearts become hardened by unworthiness, particularly when we continue to live as if that unworthiness is not actually there. This is compounded and complicated when we partake of the sacrament or participate in other ordinances as if our hearts were clean when really they are not.<br><br>Nephi teaches a beautiful truth when he says:<br><br><i>The Lord God worketh not in darkness.</i><br><br><i>He doeth not</i>anything<i>save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.</i>[2 Nephi 26:23–24; emphasis added]<br><br>In the spirit of that loving, tender reminder that He does nothing save it be for our benefit and that He laid down His life that He might draw each of us unto Him, the Savior Himself says:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:5]<br><br>What is holding you back from giving Him your whole heart, your whole mind, and all your strength?<br><br>Let your hearts<i>feel</i>the reality of Lehi's teaching about your perfectly loving and perfectly forgiving Savior: "Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit" (2 Nephi 2:7). He offered Himself as a sacrifice for<i>you,</i>and His suffering can answer the ends of the law for<i>you.</i>"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). Can we ever hear this promise too often?<br><br>These scriptures, and many others, can bring you the strength and the determination to act, to change, to repent, and to offer up to the Lord your broken heart and contrite spirit. He offered up His life for you. You can offer back your heart.<br><br>"I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:22).<br><h2><b>Third: Our Hearts May Be Malnourished by a Poor Digital Diet</b></h2><br>We may be suffering in many aspects of our lives, without fully recognizing it, because of a poor digital diet. As with so much in life, what we consume is a choice, so don't be surprised that if you spend much of your time consuming one kind of message that you become affected and influenced by it. Spending too much of our time with social media, celebrity or entertainment news, games, and the pursuit of online, time-hungry activities constitutes a poor digital diet. When we choose to consume the attitudes and opinions of the mass media, we will find our own values and viewpoints following suit, and most of the time we don't even realize it is happening. We tell ourselves we're not being affected by these messages, but that is not possible.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar posed these questions:<br><br><i>1. Does the use of various technologies and media invite or impede the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost in your life?</i><br><br><i>2. Does the time you spend using various technologies and media enlarge or restrict your capacity to live, to love, and to serve in meaningful ways?</i>["Things as They Really Are,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 2010, 23]<br><br>A lot of the time we know what we need to change in our digital diet, but we don't do it. We say we're going to start tomorrow (don't diets always start "tomorrow"?), but there is little worth in saying that. The time to act is now. Otherwise we are bound by our own behavior and lack of grit to change it.<br><br>We also need to be aware that many of today's messages in the media can cause us to doubt our faith, compromise our convictions, and view the world through cynical eyes. But we<i>can</i>deflect deceptive messages with our faith intact if we are connected in a vibrant, continuous stream to the source of truth, to the source of light. If we have questions or doubts,<i>we</i>get our answers from the Father and Creator of this universe through the delicate and precious channels of revelation that operate when we remove all barriers to our hearts.<i>We</i>choose to "look to God and live" (Alma 37:47).<br><br>I love what President Boyd K. Packer has taught. He said, "We are not obedient because we are<i>blind,</i>we are obedient because we can<i>see</i>" ("Agency and Control,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1983, 66; emphasis added).<br><br>I recently experienced a reminder to watch my own digital diet when I had been consumed with a particular strand of news stories one day. I had a sense that I had spent too much time on it, but it was only when later I picked up a book by Elder Dallin H. Oaks and read a few chapters that I became acutely aware of the contrast. The difference between the feelings that I experienced was like the contrast between night and day. The news Ihad been so consumed with left me feeling unsettled and uneasy whilst the book brought me peace and a sense of order and calm. This seems to be a lesson we need to learn several times over.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:<br><br><i>Never mind if the world doesn't understand or even mocks this sacred process</i>[of revelation].<i>Paul said, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).</i>["Revelation," 5]<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>We believe that we are that we might have joy (see 2 Nephi 2:25), and that means joy here and now--today!--as well as in eternity. It is hard for us to feel joy, however, when we make choices that block the very messages that bring it to us.<br><br>As you examine the condition of your heart and the barriers you may be putting in the way of your communication with God,<i>you will know what you need to do. You will know what you need to change. I invite you to act now.</i>Be bold in choosing to remove any obstruction to the sweet, comforting, guiding messages of love from your Father in Heaven.<br><br>The most important message any of us could receive or carry is a reminder of who we are and how we are loved by our Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. When the truth and reality of this message sink deep into our hearts, we cannot remain around the dark side of the moon. We are drawn back to Them--back to Their love, back to Their light, and back to Their arms.<br><br>President Dieter F.

<h1>pens When Life Gets One Degree Colder? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a brand-new missionary in England, Iwas assigned to the southern coast for my first area. One Sunday afternoon my companion  and I decided to go tracting in the small town of Sandwich, located just a few miles north of the white cliffs of Dover. After a few hours of  knocking on doors, feeling like we must have talked to every living person in the place--and without any success at all--we sat down dejectedly on  a nearby bench.<br><br>Although it was summertime, it was a rather cold and damp day, as sometimes happens in England. Feeling downcast due to  the lack of response to our efforts to share the gospel, my companion tried to lighten the mood by remarking, "It's okay, Elder. It could be  worse: it could be one degree colder right now."<br><br>His comment was well received and hit home. Life really wasn't bad. We were in a  beautiful country. We had the gospel. We were missionaries on the Lord's errand. In fact, I had more blessings than problems. I felt much better  knocking on doors the rest of the afternoon, armed with an enlightened attitude and a purer perspective--although I was still cold and damp and I  still wished someone would listen.<br><br>As insightful and perceptive as was my companion's point--that "it could be worse: itcould be one  degree colder"--what happens when it does get one degree colder? Or, for that matter, what happens when, metaphorically speaking, it gets ten or  even fifty degrees colder? What happens when the pressure is on, the crowd is watching, and the game is on the line?<br><br>In a college  environment, what do you do when the homework is grueling, the exams are punishing, the roommates are exasperating, and the longed-for eternal  companion is not materializing? Or, after college, whatdoyou doif you don't land a job, you get laid off, you have stress in your marriage,  you have poor health, or your teenagers don't listen? In those times of trial, despair, fear, and worry, the stage is best set for God to show  forth His power. Indeed, it is often in the most dire of circumstances that God's arm is revealed most miraculously.<br><br>Miracles require  faith and generally some amount of courage and hope on our part as well as trust that God will always do His part. We must also remember that  God's ways are not our ways. His response to a given situation might be different than what we want to have happen. In addition, the timing of  His response could vary greatly from our expected timing. Yet in all cases, God's involvement in our lives is carefully crafted to bring about  the greatest good. For "he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world."<sup>1</sup><br><h2><b>Find Courage and  Hope</b></h2><br>Several years ago I gave a lesson in my elders quorum based on the July 2004 First Presidency message written by President Thomas  S. Monson and titled "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/07/miracles-of-faith?lang=eng&amp;amp;_r=1">Miracles of Faith</a>." One part of the lesson particularly struck me because of the uniqueness of a principle that I had not  previously considered--a principle that afterward became even more personally poignant because of imminent events that were to occur in our  home.<br><br>From time to time the Lord puts certain truths into our hearts that affect our future destiny. We may not fully understand His  reason for teaching us these principles at these particular times. Instead, it is often once we have passed through the ensuing experiences that  clarity comes. We can then look back through life's lenses and more fully see that God does prepare a way for us to accomplish what He  commands.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Part of President Monson's message that I shared with my elders quorum read:<br><br><i>Mothers and fathers  who anxiously await the arrival of a precious child sometimes learn that all is not well with this tiny infant. A missing limb, sightless eyes,  a damaged brain . . . greets the parents, leaving them baffled, filled with sorrow, and reaching out for hope.</i><br><br><i>There follows  the inevitable blaming of oneself, the condemnation of a careless action, and the perennial questions: "Why such a tragedy in our family?" . . .  "How did this happen?" "Where was God?" "Where was a protecting angel?"</i>If, why, where, how--<i>those recurring words--do not bring back the  lost son, the perfect body, the plans of parents, or the dreams of youth. Self-pity, personal withdrawal, or deep despair will not bring the  peace, the assurance, or help which are needed. Rather, we must go forward, look upward, move onward, and rise heavenward.</i><br><br><i>It  is imperative that we recognize that whatever has happened to us has happened to others. They have coped and so must we. We are not alone.  Heavenly Father's help is near.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>What struck me was that "the absence of the miracle" could actually be a  miracle in and of itself--the premise being that as God's ways and thoughts are higher than man's, at times the Lord may choose to provide a  miracle counterintuitive to what we may want, knowing full well His own end purpose. Because of the absence of the miracle fixed in our minds,  He is better able to help us grow and thus become happier than we ever could have been had we received the desired miracle for which we had  prayed.<br><br>At the time I initially read this First Presidency message, I naively thought my impression of that principle was because I had  given a blessing to the daughter of a family I home taught, hoping that a dramatic recovery would spark the family back into activity. When the  little girl ended up in the hospital that same day, I thought the absence of the miracle would somehow bless their lives more than if she had  been miraculously healed. However, little did I suspect the extraordinary experience among the challenges that the Lord was already  engineering.<br><br>About a month later my expectant wife, April, and I went to an ultrasound appointment to see whether we were having a boy  or a girl. We learned that we were having our third son. We also learned that there were severe physical complications afflicting his body. He  was missing large portions of his brain, his skull wasn't properly shaped, and the doctors weren't even sure if he would survive till delivery.  During the ensuing weeks it seemed that every time we received additional information it was bad news. I still remember sitting in a room in the  Brewster Building, across the street from the Wilkinson Center, when my wife called to tell me the latest update: Our son didn't have a right  eye. Thinking back to what my mission companion had said, I certainly felt like things were much worse than one degree colder.<br><br>With  faith, and in order to pray more specifically and effectively for our unborn son, we decided on his name early. Previously we had waited until  we actually saw our children to make sure they matched their names. We chose the name Caleb, after the Old Testament Israelite who was a  companion to Moses and Joshua and who was noted for his "fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Caleb survived  his birth, though it became quickly apparent that he would be very much like a newborn throughout his entire life. He would never walk. He would  never talk. He would never feed himself or be able to so much as hold his head up on his own. When we asked how long we might expect him to  live, the doctor replied, "Take him home and never bring him back to the hospital. We can't do anything for him. He has a few weeks to a few  months--outside chance of a year, possibly two."<br><br>I remember being terrified as we walked out of the hospital with our little boy to  take him home. The number of machines and medical equipment we needed to sustain his life was overwhelming. The possibility of losing him was a  constant fear. Simply feeding him required extraordinary effort because he needed to eat every three hours. The process to eat took one hour to  complete. This involved waking up throughout the night: start the pump, sleep for an hour, stop the pump, sleep for two hours, start the pump,  sleep for an hour, and so on. We wondered how we would keep ourselves alive, let alone our fragile son.<br><br>Thankfully, the Lord blessed  us with manymiracles in what seemed like a hopeless situation. Angels in the form of ward members, family members, friends, and medical  personnel came to our aid. We literally had meals brought in for three months. We had a competent and caring nurse, a doctor who made house  calls, and family and neighbors who prayed mightily on our behalf. We could feel heaven's hand upon us. I felt angels walked our hallways and  sat in Caleb's room. Our three-year-old son told us that sometimes he saw Jesus peeking in our windows.<br><br>In Caleb's baby blessing I  promised him that he had completed his task on earth by being born and that he could now rest for a time. But this was not the plan for Caleb  and his mother. In some kind of pact with heaven that I have yet to fully understand, Caleb and April bargained with heaven to do a greater  work. God had matched them up perfectly--Caleb with his fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds and April with her mother's love and daring  optimism.<br><br>April purposefully chose hope and trust inthe Lord. To her core she is happy and optimistic. With God's help she took what  could have been a terrifying trial and reshaped it. She took a corner of heaven and pulled it right down into our home, opening it up for all to  enjoy. Every day became a celebration with Caleb. She made him a birthday cake after his first week, cupcakes for his second week, cookies for  his third week, and so on. She celebrated everything about Caleb, for every day was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the boy who was  sent home without hope.<br><br>In what might have looked like a burdensome task to others, caring for Caleb became a privilege. Though his  body was misshapen and broken, his spirit was whole, noble, and great.<sup>5</sup>Being in his presence was healing and heavenly. I love my  wife and thank her, Caleb, and Heavenly Father for making the time with Caleb not only possible but powerful. It was indeed heaven on  earth.<br><br>Even his missing eye was a blessing. It became his distinctive feature. People were drawn to him, especially children. They  would often ask, "Where is his eye? What happened to him?"<br><br>I would usually say that Caleb was a pirate or that a bear had eaten his  eye. But my wife would explain that in our family, a wink meant "I love you."<br><br>Before Caleb was born, we told our boys that he would  only have one of his eyes. They were concerned for their brother.<br><br>"Don't worry," April would say. "He will just wink at us every  day!"<br><br>Caleb was never able to tell us he loved us with words, but he told us every day with his wink. His little wink was a daily  message of love from heaven. He brought the love of God and the Light of Christ into the lives of all who knew him. His winking eye was a sweet  reminder of his deep love for all of us.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Hope and courage have always characterized the righteous. Ever the optimist,  Joseph Smith was once quoted as saying:<br><br><i>I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties should surround me, if I was sunk  in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith and  keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>It was this type of faithful fortitude that  saved the Nephites from the decree of death declared by the unbelievers if the sign of Christ's birth did not come. It came the very night that  Nephi prayed.<sup>8</sup>Likewise, a measure of firm faith and trust in God preceded the parting of the Red Sea;<sup>9</sup>saved Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abed-nego from a fiery furnace;<sup>10</sup>and helped David defeat a giant.<sup>11</sup><br><h2><b>Recognize God's Ways Are  Higher</b></h2><br>However, not all miracles deliver. Sometimes, according to God's purposes, miracles are seemingly withheld in order for His  greater designs to develop. After all, Abinadi was burned at the stake, the Mormons were driven out of Jackson County, and Joseph Smith was  martyred at Carthage Jail. On a less important scale, but still significant to those involved, lost puppies may not be found, testing center  prayers may not be immediately answered, and Church basketball games may not be played with good sportsmanship in spite of prayers offered  otherwise.<br><br>But that doesn't mean God is absent or doesn't care or hasn't provided a miracle. Again, it is during those times when it  is ten degrees colder that God is involved, He does care, and He is performing His work. We must remember that "as the heavens are higher than  the earth, so are [His] ways higher than [our] ways, and [His] thoughts than [our] thoughts."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Just imagine what would  happen if miracles were left up to us. In my arena of athletics, it would probably go something like this: The Church is true. The Church is the  sponsoring organization of BYU, the Lord's university. The BYU sports teams are flagships of the university. Therefore, no BYU team should ever  lose, which would be irrefutable evidence that the Church is true. What a blessing this would be to the growth of the Church. I can picture the  missionaries talking to an investigator: "Brother Jones, as you know, the BYU football team has never lost, the basketball team has won every  national title, and each of our golfers gets a hole in one on every swing. Don't you think it's about time you were  baptized?"<br><br>Obviously the Lord does not work this way. A plan in which supposedly everything would go right so nobody would be lost was  already proposed and rejected. The plan of salvation, on the other hand, allows for opposition in all things: sadness and sweetness, wrongdoing  and repentance, trial and testimony.<br><br>With so much opposition in our lives at times, it seems like God chooses to work through  underdogs. Take Gideon of the Old Testament, for example. Israel was in bondage to the Midianites. God called Gideon to deliver them, and Gideon  raised an army of 32,000 men.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the  Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hathsaved me.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>God  asked Gideon to reduce his army to 10,000, which was still too many. God then asked him to reduce his force even further to just 300 men to go  against a foe who were "like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for  multitude."<sup>14</sup>With the help of God and against all odds, Gideon and those 300 men bested the Midianites and their tens of  thousands.<br><br>God is clearly not limited by the same constraints that obstruct our mortal way. Left on their own, Gideon and his 300  would have had little chance for victory. But Gideon was not alone, nor is he the only instance of God using small and simple "means to bring  about his great and eternal purposes."<sup>15</sup>God took Enoch, a lad slow of speech, and walked with him.<br><br><i>And so great  was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God . . . ; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled,  even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course . . . ; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was  the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>God also took former  Egyptian slaves and molded them into the mighty Israelite nation. He turned a fisherman into a chief apostle. And He shaped a plowboy into a  prophet.<sup>17</sup>The Lord Himself came to earth in the most humble of circumstances--as a babe in a manger who was born into a carpenter's  family and who became Lord of lords, King of kings,<sup>18</sup>and Savior of worlds without end.<br><h2><b>Trust God</b></h2><br>Such miraculous  transformations come as a result of trusting in God's plan. One night for family scripture study we read the account of the "man which was blind  from his birth."<sup>19</sup>The "disciples asked [Christ], saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born  blind?"<sup>20</sup><br><br>Seeing the obvious parallel in our own home, our young sons asked why Caleb was born blind. In the next verse the  Lord provided our response: "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in  him."<sup>21</sup>Then Jesus healed the man so that he could see.<br><br>Caught up in the grandeur of the story, our boys asked if I could  heal Caleb. I stammered some kind of response that I didn't feel it was the Lord's will for Caleb to be healed. I added that often the healings  recorded in the scriptures were performed by Jesus, prophets, or apostles--very righteous men commissioned by God to perform miracles for  specific purposes of blessing the lives of those involved and increasing the faith of those who would eventually read these  stories.<br><br>Not to be put off, and possibly sensing my apprehensive response, my boys faithfully concluded that it was time to appeal to  a higher authority. It so happened that we were going to the Church Administration Building later that week to attend the setting apart of my  dad as a mission president by one of the Brethren. Knowing that we would be meeting an apostle, my sons requested that I ask him to heal  Caleb.<br><br>Talk about being put between a rock and a hard place. How could I sustain their faith without selfishly imposing on an apostle?  I compromised with my boys by telling them that I would not ask for a blessing on Caleb but that we would leave it in the hands of the  Lord.<br><br>It was a wonderful occasion to be with my dad as he was set apart and to be in the presence of one of the Lord's special  witnesses. He was not inspired to heal Caleb. But as we walked out of his office, he stopped at Caleb's stroller, bent down, and kissed him. He  told him three times that he loved him. He then shook my hand and hugged my wife while whispering in her ear, "I am so proud of you." In the  sight of God, Caleb did not need healing. Instead, it was I who left that office peacefully whole.<br><h2><b>Rely on His Timing</b></h2><br>Trusting  in God means that we also trust in His timing. The man in the New Testament story was blind from birth. I'm not sure how old he was, but he had  waited years for that miracle. Then one day the Master came along and healed him. "In his own time, and in his own way,"<sup>22</sup>God will  respond.<br><br>As an example of the Lord's timing in my life, I had been at my new job in the BYU Athletic Department for about three weeks  when I had to go down to Las Vegas for a business meeting as part of the conference basketball tournament. I woke up very early to make the long  drive in time for my meeting at noon. My wife and I prayed fervently that I would make it safely. Caleb had been in the hospital for a few  weeks, and we had been up many late nights to be with him. Despite every precaution and physical effort I could make, just outside of St. George  I fell asleep in the blink of an eye while driving full speed down the freeway.<br><br>I woke up to find myself heading down a hill into the  median dividing the highway--one set of tires on the pavement, the other set in the weeds and gravel. I quickly spun the wheel to take me back on  the road, but this only caused me to do a 180-degree turn across the lanes of traffic. Thankfully no other cars were near me. Once I got to the  far right side of the road, I had the fleeting thought that I could pull it off and would be able to stop the car on the right shoulder. Not so.  I think the car was still traveling about 60 to 70 miles per hour when I slammed into the sand and sagebrush, flipping the car  over.<br><br>Eventually the car came to an abrupt stop with me hanging upside down by my seat belt. I undid the catch and fell to the  floor--which had been the roof of the car. It was impossible to open any of the car doors. They were all wedged shut because the car had become  fairly flattened to the ground. I climbed through a window, since all the glass in the vehicle had shattered.<br><br>Besides a bruised and  embarrassed ego, I was completely unharmed. The only cut I hadwas a small slice on my hand where a piece of glass had stuck me when I released  myself from the seat belt and fell to the ground. After being checked out by the police (who also issued me a ticket), my sweet grandmother who  lived in St. George somehow let me borrow her car so I could finish my trip to Las Vegas. Iwalked into my meeting about fifteen minutes  late.<br><br>The hard part was telling my boss, Tom Holmoe--who was also at the basketball tournament--that I had destroyed a university  vehicle during my first month on the job. To make a bad situation worse, my seat at the basketball game following the meeting happened to be  directly in front of President Samuelson. Ispent the game pulling glass out of my hair as inconspicuously as possible.<br><br>In my mind the  timing of that wreck was life turning one degree colder. I was trying to make a good first impression at my job. My wife and I were doing our  best to take care of asick child. We had prayed for safety.<br><br>The Lord's timing and purpose were made clear over the following days and  months. Tom is a great boss and has never held the accident and the loss of the car against me. The university eventually replaced the car but  thankfully didn't have to replace me--because I was still alive. The Lord had preserved me from what should have been a fatal accident. Having  come so close to death helped me more fully appreciate my life and the people around me. I especially enjoyed the time spent with Caleb late at  night when I would wake up to take care of him. Not only did it mean I was still alive, but Caleb was too.<br><br>There were times when I  thought Caleb would live a long time. He had so often successfully battled sicknesses and surgeries, illnesses and infections. He had been to  the hospital many times but always came back to us. We loved having him in our home. "Caleb could have quickly returned to heaven but, instead,  he brought heaven to us for seven years."<sup>23</sup><br><br>Twenty-five days ago, in the timing of the Lord, Caleb slipped peacefully away  while being held in the arms of his mother and surrounded by his family. He had spent a courageous day fighting with his might against a vicious  infection brought on by pneumonia. The wonderful doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel at Primary Children's Medical Center had done all  they professionally could to keep Caleb alive. His body was simply too worn out.<br><br>I have heroes in my life: Joseph Smith, Captain  Moroni, Ammon, and others. On that day, my wife was my hero. As she bravely and tenderly leaned down to hug Caleb, she whispered in his ear, "I  love you, Caleb. I am so proud of you. If your body is too tired, it's okay. You can go back. You can return to Heavenly Father."<br><br>For  over seven years her love and God's will allowed Caleb to be a significant part of our earthly experience. But in the very moment when it was  needed, her heart changed. She could let him go. She trusted God because she knew God. She knew that God understood her personally, in a way  that few others could, for God had also lost a son. And through the Atonement of that Son, God can do miracles. He can forgive a sinner. He can  save a lost soul. He can heal a broken heart.<br><br>"With God nothing [is] impossible,"<sup>24</sup>especially when life is hard and it is  ten degrees colder outside. "But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things."<sup>25</sup>God provides the  plan and we contribute the faith and courage. We trust in His timing and in His ways to achieve His purposes, even when--and probably  <i>especially</i>when--such purposes may be unclear from our perspective.<br><br>At a stake conference not too long ago, I had an interview  with a visiting General Authority. He learned about Caleb as part of our discussion. After he acknowledged the hard work it took to care for  Caleb, I thought he would then encourage me to keep it up and to faithfully persevere in the service and sacrifice I was providing. Instead, his  next four words entirely transformed my relationship with Caleb. He simply said, "You are being exalted."<br><br>All this time I had thought  that we were taking care of Caleb. But in reality, God, through Caleb, had been taking care of us. God was making a miracle where I hadn't  expected one. He was performing a miracle on me, on my wife, on our kids, and on all those who came in contact with Caleb. Having Caleb in our  home was an honor and a privilege. It was also a sacred experience.<br><br>Through our faith, courage, hope, and trust, God will bless us--no  matter how cold our lives may feel. I know that God loves us. I know that He hears us and heals us. And I know that He is exalting us. In the  name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallan R.

<h1>age to Choose Wisely - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On the wall of my office in Salt Lake is a copy of the Minerva Teichert painting of Queen Esther. You will remember she was the king of Persia's Jewish queen who was charged to save her people from Haman's slaughter. The problem was that the only way to save her people was for her to personally approach the king without an invitation--a capital crime! (See Esther 4:11.) After soliciting the fasting, faith, and prayers of the Jewish people in her behalf, she left to approach the king, saying, "IfI perish, Iperish" (Esther 4:16).<br><br>The Teichert painting reminds me of how essential courage is in all we do. I love C. S. Lewis' statement that "courage is not simply<i>one</i>of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point. ... Pilate was merciful till it became risky" (<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>[1941], letter 29, paragraph 6; emphasis in original).<br><br>Today I would like to discuss two parts ofour lives in which we especially need courage--one in which things are certain and the other in which they are uncertain. As Rex E. Lee would say, "Let's consider the second one first and the first one second." So let's consider some of the uncertainties of life.<br><h2><b>Uncertainties</b></h2><br>In Moses 1 we read of the amazing interview that God had with Moses. It had so much impact that when it was over, Moses collapsed. After many hours he regained his strength and made the memorable statement "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing,<i>which thing I never had supposed"</i>(Moses 1:10; emphasis added). According to that last phrase, "which thing I never had supposed," Moses was surprised. Brothers and sisters, there are and will be surprises in life! There have been in mine, and there will be in yours.<br><br>This point struck me several years ago when I realized that my wife and I have done several things we never intended to do! These things were never part of our plans--short or long term. For example, we never planned to settle in Houston, Texas. I never intended to be a financial consultant or to start a business. We did not set out to have nine children. We never envisioned serving seven years in Brazil--as mission president and then in the Area Presidency. As a matter of fact, it was a surprise to be called as a stake president, then a mission president, an Area Seventy, and especially a General Authority.<br><br>On the other hand, we had firm plans that I would do the joint JD/MBA program after graduation from college. I had been accepted to Harvard Business School to start that four-year program. The new J. Reuben Clark Law School at BYU was not even on the radar screen. But in the end I attended and graduated from BYU Law School! I have never done the JD/MBA program.<br><br>Once I was in the financial consulting business, I found it so flexible that my plan was to never retire but just slow down to an acceptable level. As it turned out, I retired at age fifty-nine. In that business I learned about the tax advantages of a mortgage. As a result, we decided never to pay off our house. But a few years ago, with the counsel of prophets reminding us, we asked the Lord for guidance, and He directed us to pay off the mortgage. We did it as quickly as possible.<br><br>So how did all of this happen?<br><h3><i><b>Decision Points</b></i></h3><br>Each time my wife and I came to a decision point, we would think it through, counsel together, and make a decision. Then we would pray to seek the Lord's confirmation. We always followed the promptings of the Spirit. If the Lord was silent, we would do what seemed best to us in light of what we already knew.<br><br>On a daily basis we asked in our prayers for the Lord to guide and direct us. We emphasized, as did Jesus, not our will but Thine be done (see Luke 22:42). Sometimes direction would come when we didn't even realize we were at a decision point--such as when we paid off our home mortgage.<br><br>Our experiences have taught us over and over again that God knows best. For example, we succeeded in paying off that mortgage in 1998. It was on January 21, 1999, that President James E. Faust telephoned us in Houston with the call to be a mission president in Brazil. Because our home was debt free, we had the option to keep it while we served. We much prefer to do things the Lord's way.<br><br>So, should we not even make plans?<br><br>On the contrary. Instead we should continue to plan ahead for each aspect of our lives and work diligently to accomplish our goals--but we shouldn't worry about the changes. Elder David A. Bednar said, "Having a career plan is important, but we should not become so wedded to the plan that we fail to recognize or ignore the hand of the Lord guiding us to the individualized learning opportunities He has prepared specifically for us" (personal communication). With hindsight you may learn, as we have learned, that the Lord's changes are better.<br><h3><i><b>Unpack Your Bag</b></i></h3><br>How do we live with uncertainty?<br><br>Part of that question is, how do you handle the temporary stages of life? What if you are going to be here for only a year, two years, or a semester?<br><br>For me the classic answer to this challenge is the Lord's counsel in Doctrine and Covenants 51. The Saints were coming into Kirtland, Ohio, from the eastern states, and Bishop Edward Partridge wanted to know how to handle the situation. Listen to verses 16and17:<br><br><i>And I consecrate unto them this land for a little season, until I, the Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence;</i><br><br><i>And the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act upon this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good.</i><br><br>Think about that situation. The Lord told them plainly that they would be there for a short time and then He would send them somewhere else. But He gave them no indication how long it would be. My inclination would be to not even unpack the wagon! But the divine counsel was to act "as for years."<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer learned while in the military the blessings that come from unpacking your bag and settling down--whether for days, months, or years. For him, it made thedifference between misery and happiness.<br><br>Does that mean you should buy a house if you are going somewhere for a one-year master's program? Not necessarily.<br><br>To me the Lord is telling us to<i>be</i>where we are. Have an<i>attitude</i>of "as for years." Accept a calling, make friends, get to know the area--be there until you are not. Even here at the Y, if you will only be in your ward this semester, unpack your bag and act "as for years."<br><br>The alternative attitude of a transient is not good. We are only here for a little while, so we won't make friends or we can't accept a calling or we shouldn't settle in. That attitude of being a "floater" will rob you and your family of much joy and satisfaction and that ward or community of the many contributions you could make.<br><h2><b>Certainties</b></h2><br>Now, what about things that are certain?<br><br>One of the most certain things in the gospel of Jesus Christ is that we will one day die and there will be a final judgment. We don't talk much about the Judgment Day, but it will happen.<br><h3><i><b>Judgment Day</b></i></h3><br>What do we know about the final judgment? It will occur after the Resurrection. God, through Jesus Christ, will judge each one of us to determine which eternal glory we will receive. This final judgment will be based on our receiving ordinances, keeping the associated covenants, and obeying the commandments of God, and central to all is our acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ (see Guide to the Scriptures, s.v. "Judgment, the Last," scriptures.lds.org).<br><br>The scriptures clarify many other things as well: "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ" (Romans 14:10). "There is none to escape" (D&amp;amp;C 1:2). We will be brought to judgment for all our doings (see 1 Nephi 10:20). Specifically, that includes our works (seeMosiah 3:24), our words (see Matthew 12:36–37), our sins (see D&amp;amp;C 101:78), our thoughts (see Alma 12:14), and even the intents and desires of our hearts (see Moroni 7:9; D&amp;amp;C 137:9). It is important to remember that only He "knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart" (D&amp;amp;C 6:16). Also, for each of us an account of our stewardship will be required (see D&amp;amp;C 70:4). It will be "a righteous judgment" (Mosiah 3:10)--to the point that each will agree that His judgment is just (see Mosiah 27:31).<br><br>For the worthy and righteous it will be a "glorious day" (2 Nephi 9:46). "[They] may have boldness in the day of judgment" (1 John 4:17) because the guiltless have the promise to dwell in the presence of God in a state of happiness that will have no end (see Mormon 7:7).<br><br>The wicked will find it a terrible one--even a "great and terrible" day (2 Nephi 26:3). Their evil plans and designs will "turn to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment" (D&amp;amp;C 10:23). As an example, when Alma the Younger recognized his unworthy state, he suffered the pains of hell and would have preferred annihilation to having to stand before God to be judged (see Alma 36:11–16).<br><h3><i><b>We Judge Ourselves</b></i></h3><br>We also learn from the scriptures that in many respects we judge ourselves. First, we do this by what we choose. Alma explained that "every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey" (Alma 3:27), "whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery" (Alma 3:26). Nephi clarified that those who "have sought to do wickedly ... are found unclean," and since "no unclean thing can dwell with God," they are "cast off forever" (1 Nephi 10:21).<br><br>Secondly, we judge ourselves by the standard we use in our dealings with others. The Savior taught, "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged" (Matthew 7:2; 3Nephi 14:2).<br><br>One way we can add to our grief is to not magnify our callings. President Thomas S. Monson quoted President John Taylor as saying: "If you do not magnify your callings, God will hold you responsible for those whom you might have saved had you done your duty" (<i>JD</i>20:23; quoted in Monson, "A New Spirit Will I Put Within You,"<i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</i>21 June 2003 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003], 20). President Henry B. Eyring warned that "if we fail to do all we can to see that [the people] rise to the Lord's standards, their sorrows will come upon us" ("Standards of Worthiness,"<i>First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</i>11 January 2003 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003], 13).<br><h3><i><b>All Truth Revealed</b></i></h3><br>One of the saddest groups at the final judgment will be that of those who have believed Satan's lie that "no one will ever know." The truth is that "there is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light" (2 Nephi 30:17). "There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known" (Matthew 10:26). "Whatsoever [is] spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that ... spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops" (Luke 12:3). "The rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed" (D&amp;amp;C 1:3).<br><br>How foolish are those who think they are safe because they have lied to the bishop or fooled the stake president or deceived the mission president. Elder Quentin L. Cook recently warned us of a variation of this trap called the "mask of anonymity" ("What E're Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part," CES devotional address, 4March 2012). When we think we are hidden in the crowds or behind a nameless presence on the Web, we think no one will ever know, and we are led to do things totally out of character. The truth is, we know and God knows. It will be so much better for those who fully repent now with the help of a loving priesthood leader than for those who suffer the public humiliation of the truth being broadcast on Judgment Day with the accompanying wrath of a just God.<br><br>Alma asked a very important question of all of us: "Can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God?" (Alma 5:18; see verses 17–25).<br><br>Jacob reminded us that there "we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt [or] a perfect knowledge of [our] righteousness" (2Nephi 9:14).<br><h3><i><b>Good News</b></i></h3><br>The good news is that the Judgment Day is not here yet. There is still time to prepare to meet God!<br><br>Jacob wisely counseled us to "prepare [our] souls for that glorious day when justice shall be administered unto the righteous" (2 Nephi 9:46).<br><br>The first step of preparation is to completely repent--now. One of the Savior's commandments is to "repent ... and come unto me ... that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20). Anytime we read<i>spotless</i>in the scriptures, it is a reminder of what the Lord desires most: our eternal life. We must be spotless at the Judgment Day to receive that reward. The Lord has counseled that it is much better to repent and prepare now for the great day of the Lord than it will be when that day is come (see D&amp;amp;C 43:20–22). Jacob promised that if we "repent ... and enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way [we] shall obtain eternal life" (Jacob 6:11). As King Benjamin taught, let us put off the natural man and become a Saint through the Atonement of Christ (see Mosiah 3:19). Wickedness never was, nor ever will be, happiness (see Alma 41:10). President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "There is a better way than the way of the world" ("Standing Strong and Immovable,"<i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: The Priesthood and the Auxiliaries of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary,</i>10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 20).<br><br>Choose to be good and to do good (see D&amp;amp;C 6:13). Cease trying "to cover [y]our sins" (D&amp;amp;C 121:37). Choose to school your feelings (see Alma 39:9). Choose life, not death; good, not evil (see Helaman 14:31; see also Moroni 7:12–16).<br><h3><i><b>Free Forever</b></i></h3><br>Lehi, in his final words to his family, summarized all of this in these words:<br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from thefall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free ... to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.</i>[2 Nephi 2:26–27]<br><br>That same Alma who suffered the pains of hell for his guilt said, "There could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. ... On the other hand [after repentance], there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy" (Alma 36:21). Let us prepare now.<br><br>How should we deal with these certainties, such as that of a final judgment?<br><h3><i><b>Learn the Truth</b></i></h3><br>Make the effort to study and learn the truth. Then have the courage to accept it and to live accordingly. Satan will sow seeds of doubt and even generate outright lies. He is the one who told Eve, "Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die" (2 Nephi 2:18). He authored the lie described by Nephi in his writings that God will "justify in committing a little sin" (2 Nephi 28:8). Have the courage to claim the promise that "by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5).<br><h2><b>Common Denominator</b></h2><br>So what is the common denominator in handling certainty and uncertainty?<br><h3><i><b>Having the courage to choose wisely!</b></i></h3><br>Many centuries ago, Esau, the older son of Isaac, came back from a day of hunting both tired and hungry. His younger twin brother Jacob had made some savory pottage--a thick soup or stew. Esau wanted the stew. Jacob agreed,<i>if</i>Esau would sell him his birthright. Esau felt he was so hungry he could die, saying, "What profit shall this birthright do to me?" (Genesis 25:32). He sold his birthright to Jacob. The scriptures say, "Thus Esau despised his birthright" (Genesis 25:34; see also verses 29–33).<br><br>What was the birthright?<br><br>The Bible Dictionary tells us it was "the right or inheritance of the firstborn under the patriarchal order" (Bible Dictionary, s.v. "birthright," 625). The spiritual part was the authority to preside and give leadership to the family. The temporal part involved the firstborn receiving "a double portion of his father's possessions" (Bible Dictionary, s.v. "firstborn," 675).<br><br>Esau's selling his birthright for a bowl of stew or a "mess of pottage" (Genesis 25, section summary) qualifies as the epitome of a bad deal. He chose poorly!<br><br>Poor choices are all around us today as well. Some have chosen pornography and lost their temple marriage and family. Others have chosen not to go on a mission or not to marry in the temple. On a daily basis we are sometimes too tired to pray, too busy to study the scriptures, or not interested in going to church this Sunday, or we rationalize that we can go to the temple anytime--it is so close! Brothers and sisters, pottage by any other name is still pottage!<br><br>The Savior asked two sobering questions recorded in Matthew: "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matthew 16:26). Our choosing wisely can have eternal consequences.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father, who knows us and loves us, gave us our agency: "the ability andprivilege ... to choose and to act for [ourselves]" (Guide to the Scriptures, s.v. "agency," scriptures.lds.org). He declared to Enoch, "In the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency" (Moses 7:32).<br><br>Some call this free agency, but there is nothing free about it! The Lord explained to Moses that "Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). The effort to preserve our agency cost the Father a third of His children (see D&amp;amp;C 29:36).<br><br>Choosing wisely is a critical part of His plan of happiness and an integral part of the test of our earth life. God's direction to Enoch was to say to the people, "Choose ye this day, to serve the Lord God who made you" (Moses 6:33). He really does know best. Elijah put it this way: "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him" (1Kings 18:21).<br><br>May we follow Him through the uncertainties in life and in preparing for the certainties that surely will come.<br><br>May we have the courage to choose wisely. It is a leap of courage and of faith. But I am a witness that it is worth it! I am a witness of these things, and I am also a witness of our Heavenly Father, who knows us and loves us. I am a witness of our Savior Jesus Christ, who showed us the way through His great example and who atoned to give us these opportunities to prepare and to improve and to be better. I am a witness of the Holy Ghost, who will guide and direct us as we seek for the Lord's counsel and guidance in our lives that we may choose wisely. I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stanley G.

<h1>eful Words on Media and Agency - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
To say that I am flattered to be standing at this podium would be a gross understatement. I consider this to be an honor of the highest order because of who you are and the enormous impact that this place has had on mylife.<br><br>My relationship to this campus goes far beyond my current titles or even my degrees from this institution. The only word that is intimate enough yet broad enough to encompass my connection to BYU is the word<i>home.</i>BYU is my home. I have lived within walking distance of this very spot more than I have lived anywhere else in the world. I am a child of BYU, not just because I received an undergraduate degree from here but because I was literally a child here--living with my parents and the rest of my family in Heritage Halls during summer pilgrimages to this campus when my father was completing his PhD.<br><br>I have learned on this campus, I have grown on this campus, and I have discovered great things about myself and about you on this campus. Much of my research is dedicated to observations of your generation, and, I have to admit, you have much to be proud of. A recent column in the<i>New York Times Magazine</i>noted that young people today are more averse to risky behavior than their parents were at the same age. Drug and alcohol use, smoking, and sexual activity have all been in sharp decline in your demographic during the past twenty years.<sup>1</sup>Also, financial firm TD Ameritrade believes you are more financially savvy and better savers than your parents,<sup>2</sup>and a study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine suggests that your willingness to improve society at large may actually improve your eating habits.<sup>3</sup>If these are the inclinations of our culture at large, I certainly believe that these trends would only be amplified among the student body of BYU.<br><br>All of this might come as a bit of a shock to your parents, who have spent so much time and effort getting you to eat your vegetables and shielding you from evil--but it does not come as a shock to me. I watch you; I see you doing good. I am acutely aware of my responsibility to add to and not detract from the spirit that you carry.<br><br>While you certainly deserve praise and recognition, you should also recognize that your generation has its own unique characteristics and challenges. For example, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to capture and maintain your attention. I know that many of you are multitasking at this very moment--doing homework, checking your Facebook account, answering emails, texting your friends about your lunch plans, or even shopping. All of these things are available to you here in the Marriott Center through the devices that we carry in our pockets; these tools and technologies are increasingly becoming vital parts of our work, our play, our families, and our very identities.<br><br>I'm addicted, too. If you would have told me at age thirty (just a little while ago) that I would feel completely lost without a cell phone, I would never have believed you. Now my iPhone is almost always within reach. It islikely that my children believe that my most important possession is my MacBook Air, which doesn't just rest on my kitchen counter but is usually open and on whenever Iam in the house. If I hear my children cheering "Go, Mama, go!" from the basement, I know that they are not actually cheering me on but rather my Mii on the Wii. I know that there is excellent cell phone and Wi-Fi service here in the Marriott Center, because on any other Tuesday you would find me answering emails and texting my husband to arrange my own lunch plans. So please understand that my task here today is not to scold or reprimand you for spending too much time on Facebook or for carrying your phone to class (though others might). Rather, I will try to give you some hopeful and helpful words about how our spiritual lives might intersect with the world ofdata and devices that swirls aroundus.<br><br>Out of respect for you, and in fear of this podium and this occasion, I have desperately sought for the Spirit to guide me to the doctrines I should emphasize and the truths I should share. In answer to my fervent prayers, the Spirit has guided me again and again to two doctrines that were central to one of the most revered devotionals ever given at BYU--one that I have personal experience with.<br><br>On January 12, 1988, I sat in this very space in one of the chairs that you are sitting in today. I had just turned twenty. Within the next two years I would be married and working in the public schools as a high school teacher. In that moment, though, I was still preparing for all of that. I was much closer to who you are than to who I am now. I was at the beginning of learning who I was and who I wanted to be in the world. Like you, I was learning that our existence here on earth is difficult, wonderful, terrifying, and beautiful.<br><br>I did not yet know that people die (young and old). I did not know that who I married would have moment-to-moment impact on who I became. I did not yet know that babies don't come just because we think they should, even if our begging is sincere.<br><br>I did know that I was a daughter of our Heavenly Father. I knew that I loved Him and, more important, that He loved me. I knew that the president of the university at the time was wise and that he loved the students here on campus very much. That is why I was sitting in this space ready to receive personal revelation. That revelation came in the form of a devotional talk delivered by then university president Jeffrey R. Holland. The devotional was titled "Of Souls, Symbols, and Sacraments," and in it President Holland provided profound doctrines in answer to the question "Why be morally clean?"<sup>4</sup><br><br>My comments today should not be viewed in any way as an extension or a commentary on those beautiful words. President Holland was quite specific and complete in covering his subject, which needs no elaboration from me, and I encourage all of you to review that talk directly from the perspective and context in which it was originally given.<br><br>However, I believe that two doctrines he spoke of that day--the doctrine of the soul and the doctrine of the sacrament--have profound implications for our mediated interactions with the world.<br><br>First, the doctrine of the soul. In his devotional address Elder Holland taught that "we ... must understand the revealed, restored Latter-day Saint doctrine of the soul, and the high and inextricable part the body plays in that doctrine."<sup>5</sup>In support of that statement, he cited Doctrine and Covenants 88:15: "The spirit and the body are the soul ofman."<br><br>With this in mind, I want to call to your attention the ways in which mass communication technologies impact your body (and therefore your soul). I also want you to be conscious of the ways in which the world is impacted by your soul (and therefore your body).<br><br>In very real ways, communication technologies allow us to project our bodies (or our souls) across vast geographies. The very nature of "our presence" is rapidly changing and expanding. As with all things here in our second estate (see Abraham 3:26), there are some spiritual disadvantages of these new abilities that stand in opposition to their obvious rewards.<br><br>Please know that I am not speaking of theoretical or metaphysical notions. Rather, I am speaking of very practical and actual effects that I know you and I have experienced. For example, my texting or emailing before and even during a devotional has an effect on my presence here. My iPhone enables me to divide my presence. While I might be seated here, part of my attention--part of my soul--is back at the office, where the concerns of the email I am reading are properly housed. Another part of my soul is in the company of the person I am texting--inevitably miles away from the location of my ears. Such a disbursement of my soul has prevented me on occasion from participating in a devotional with my complete presence, and I have learned that receiving a message through the Spirit is dependent upon my willingness to listen to that message with my whole soul.<br><br>In contrast to those occasions, perhaps the reason that Elder Holland's talk has had such a lasting impact on my life is because I did experience it with my whole soul. The physical impact of those words went far beyond the sounds that entered my ears. Those words had an impact on me, and I felt them. I continue to feel them in a manner that has become characteristic of our faith's notion of a testimony. In the Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery was told that the Spirit speaks "in your mind and in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2), which implies that testimonies have a physical component in addition to a rational conception. Therefore, the language of the Spirit is partly a physical language--or, in other words, a true and native language of the soul.<br><br>That language of the soul is not necessarily hindered by the existence of technology in our lives. In fact, the Church has enthusiastically embraced the opportunities that communication technologies have provided to extend the presence of our modern prophets far into the world. Today we often take for granted how President Thomas S. Monson and the living apostles of Jesus Christ are present in our lives through satellite broadcasts, Web streaming, and other digital technologies. We recognize their faces, we know their voices, and we feel their presence as they testify of Him who sent them and of Him whose presence is our ultimate goal and reward.<br><br>We should acknowledge that our cell phones and laptops carry no secret powers that will push us toward one side or the other of the war that began in heaven; they are simply tools that amplify the choices we make through our agency.<br><br>I know that you regularly hear of the pitfalls and dangers that do exist as part of our mediated culture, but there is "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), and in opposition to those things that often dominate our discussions of the Internet and all things mediated is an explosion in the availability of all that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Agency was the issue in the beginning, and agency--personal, private, moment-to-moment agency--is the issue for you and me today.<br><br>In 2 Nephi 2:26, Lehi explained that because we "are redeemed from the fall [we] have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for [ourselves] and<i>not to be acted upon"</i>(emphasis added). I take this as a scriptural promise that our agency will never be overwhelmed by technology. Indeed, I believe that our agency has been enhanced by technology, allowing us at every moment to choose the better parts of our world.<br><br>In the next verse Lehi said, "All things are given [us]" (2 Nephi 2:27). Clearly the phrase "all things" can apply to our world of digital information and Google. All things truly have been given us, good and bad--not just to tempt us on the one hand or to give us the opportunity to demonstrate our righteousness to ourselves on the other. All things have been given to us, and the act of choosing from among those things--or exercising our agency--alters the nature of our eternal souls. Each time we choose light, truth, and righteousness we become more like our Heavenly Father and we develop some of His most important characteristics: we expand our knowledge, we increase our capacities, we grow in our compassion and love for others, and we build our testimonies. All of these rewards come because our most important act of agency is to choose to see things from a perspective of eternity--tochoose to see things through the vision of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Such vision requires faith to see things as they actually are--not as they appear. Your agency gives you a way to develop this type of vision for yourself, and you can also help others--including those who are most dear to you--develop that vision. The records that we keep can be incredibly powerful in building our faith and the faith of those who are most important to us, and that faith will help us see into the eternities<br><br>When I was a child, President Spencer W. Kimball regularly told members of the Church to keep a journal as a record of their faith for the later benefit of their families.<sup>6</sup>When I was about to be married, my BYU stake president gave me some very good advice: He told me to take pictures and document my life and my marriage and my family. He explained that this would benefit my children, because they would see that my husband and I existed before they were born, that we loved each other, and that important things happened that they didn't necessarily remember. He said that a record of our life through pictures would give our children a sense of eternity, because they would have evidence of good, happy, and worthy things beyond their own experiences.<br><br>How are you keeping records of the good, happy, and worthy things in your life?<br><br>We all have the opportunity and the responsibility to be record keepers. Beyond journals and photographs, we now have at our disposal an immense system of record keeping and sharing. Our blogs, family videos, Facebook pages, and tweets are all opportunities to inject goodness, testimony, and faith into the world. But beyond what you contribute to the world, you should know that your digital footprint--your record of experiences, testimony, and faith--will actually have the greatest impact on those who are the most important to you: your closest friends and your immediate family.<br><br>I am so grateful that my sister Anne was a record keeper. She was also a mom, an eighth-grade reading and writing teacher, a Laurel advisor, a runner, a photographer, a sharer of recipes, and a blogger. She loved using technology to improve her life and to reach out to others.<br><br>Two and a half years ago this beautiful sister of mine was engaged in a brutal war with metastatic melanoma. Even while she was fighting cancer, she published stories in the<i>Friend</i>and the<i>New Era,</i>recorded the miraculous experience of her daughter's birth through NPR's StoryCorps program, and regularly blogged about the everyday occurrences of her life. In every one of these instances she shared her testimony, described her existence as blessed, and identified herself as a daughter of God.<br><br>On August 15, 2009, she posted this on her blog, titled "This Home Is Filled with Love and Dreams":<br><br><i>I have no doubt that if it is Heavenly Father's will, I will be healed. But even if I'm not, I have to admit that I feel at peace. The last month has been fraught with panic and frantic anguish, but now I feel differently. I trust Him. I look forward to asking WHY all of this had to happen. I'm not going to ask it now, because I know that He can see the whole picture and I know that whatever His will is, things will be okay. My girls will be okay because they have Ward. I know that Ward will be okay because he has them. And we all have each other--FOREVER--and that's what really matters.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Seven days later Anne passed away. Her body is buried on a peaceful hill in Eden, Utah, where she lived with her husband, Ward, and their three daughters. Most of the time I feel like she is very far away, but when I read those words from her blog, I feel her presence and I know that her spirit and her body--her fierce and gentle soul--are not lost. Those words have power to bring Anne's presence to me, and, more than that, those words have the power to transport a portion of my soul back to a time before cancer and loss and forward to a time of resurrection and reunion. Those words--that testimony--help me feel eternity.<br><br>Anne, like me, was an avid consumer of mediated messages; she read widely and she loved a good movie. However, even before the weight of mortality began to rest on her, she was consistent in her view that she was participating in a process that had eternal significance. She was insistent that everything she read or watched with her children should teach something good or build something good in herself or her family. Similarly, everything she wrote or shared on the Internet was meant to help someone or demonstrate something decent or testify of something great. Her engagement with the world through technology was something more than just entertainment, a hobby, or an interesting way to pass the time. To her, these were holy activities--purposeful, consecrated actions and sacramental exercises of faith that helped her obtain and share the vision of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>That brings me to a second doctrine that Elder Holland talked about in 1988: the doctrine of a holy sacrament. He said:<br><br><i>A sacrament could be any one of a number of gestures or acts or ordinances that unite us with God and His limitless powers. We are imperfect and mortal; He is perfect and immortal. But from time to time--</i>indeed, as often as is possible and appropriate--we find ways and go to places and create circumstances where we can unite symbolically with Him and, in so doing, gain access to His power<i>. Those special moments of union with God are sacramental moments, such as kneeling at a marriage altar or blessing a newborn baby or partaking of the emblems of the Lord's Supper. This latter ordinance is the one we in the Church have come to associate most traditionally with the word</i>sacrament,<i>though it is technically only one of many such moments when</i>we formally take the hand of God and feel His divine power<i>.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>In a world in which<i>all things</i>are delivered to us electronically, a world in which light and darkness are divided by a small number of keystrokes or even the click of a mouse, a world in which what you see is determined much more by the perceptions of your heart than the function of your eyes--in this world we must make our use of technology and media a holy sacrament.<br><br>When we engage with this world through digital devices, we must take every opportunity to "formally take the hand of God and feel His divine power" as He alters our vision to see things as they really are. When we are discerning the myriad of messages that swirl around us every day, we must create those sacramental conditions on a moment-to-moment basis. This means that we must not take our souls to places where the Spirit cannot follow. We must not find ourselves in circumstances that the Holy Ghost cannot abide.<br><br>We must be watchful of our agency in each moment because it is often the unassuming and unprepared-for moments of our lives that have the biggest consequences. Such a moment came for me when I was eighteen. I was participating in the Utah High School State Debate Tournament, and I met my husband for the first time. There are various versions of that day's events, depending upon if you ask my husband or me. One thing we do agree on is that there was a note--and we probably only agree on that because I still have it.<br><br>It is glorious and in a 1980s context that I think only people in their forties can truly understand. This note was our first communication. It reads:<br><br><i>Hello.</i><i>I think you are beautiful. If you think you are beautiful say hello and I will be your slave for life.</i><br><br>And it is signed, "The Man in the Black Suit."<br><br>Though this note was mysterious, exciting, and more than a little bit silly at the time, it has become holy to me in the context of the rest of my life. This was the beginning of my most important relationship. This represents the point in which my family began. This piece of paper was present at the moment that made all the difference in who I am today.<br><br>Our communication now is far more mundane, and, like much of your communication, it comes in bursts of 144 characters or fewer. "Love you" is a common message, as is "I'm here." To me, our text messages are just as holy as that first note, because they represent consecrated efforts to serve, cheer, comfort, and care for one another. While that first note represented exciting possibilities, these daily missives demonstrate the extraordinary reality of a family unit that tries (and sometimes succeeds) through faith, covenants, and divine promises to become something greater than the members of the family are as individuals.<br><br>Our texts are sacramental to me because they are evidence of a partnership between imperfect people and a perfect Deity who is active in our efforts to improve the daily condition of our souls. We facilitate this improvement through conversations, sometimes through texts, sometimes through emails, and often even in person.<br><br>The tools of technology that surround us are easily tasked to our benefit and refinement when they facilitate conversations rather than simply transport communications. A conversation, by definition, is an interchange--a back and forth or give and take in which we listen and respond. The best conversations that we have often become moments of private repentance, because it is often during conversations that we change our minds, find a new path, or decide to do better. The changes we make to our souls in these moments are usually small, simple, incremental, comforting, and productive.<br><br>You can often tell if the media and technology in your life are having a positive or negative effect on your soul by the quality of the media conversations you are having. We should regularly ask ourselves three questions:<br><br><b>1. Am I having media conversations, or am I simply consuming the media?</b><br><br>As a media scholar, I can tell you that simply consuming media messages is one of the most destructive things we can do to ourselves. The changes that unchallenged consumption has on your soul are also small, simple, and incremental but oriented toward your eventual destruction.<br><br><b>2. What conversations am I having about media with my family and those closest to me?</b><br><br>Any media practice that discourages conversations with others or is focused inwardly on your appetites rather than outwardly on others will rob you of your faith and prove debilitating to your soul.<br><br><b>3. What am I doing to improve the conversations around me when I use media to communicate?</b><br><br>Remember, you can find ways and you can go to places and you can create circumstances in which you can unite symbolically with your Heavenly Father. In so doing, you can gain moment-to-moment access to His power.<br><br>As I said before, I know that you are good. Your potential for greatness and beauty and everything exciting and happy and wonderful is palpable to me and almost overwhelming. However, I also know that many of you now, and all of you eventually, will come to a place of trial and desperation. That is the moment in which I hope your faith is sufficient for you to ask for your own miracle.<br><br>When I had been married for ten years, I reached the shores of my own personal Red Sea. My thwarted desire to become a mother had slowly turned my gaze inward and changed my vision until I began to see only bitter disappointment. Wanting a family is certainly not an inappropriate desire, but the focus of my wanting was inward on what I was lacking and on what I believed heaven was denying me.<br><br>My frustration began to have a tremendous impact on my faith. I was no longer in a position to receive answers to my prayers because my gaze was locked on my discontent and my struggle to push that discontent further and further inside my broken heart. Feeling cut off from God, my prayers became mechanical, as Ifeared even asking for what I wanted most.<br><br>I know that "soul searching" is usually the prescription that we receive in such circumstances, but I had searched my soul and found no solutions. However, a gentle bit of family inspiration led my husband and me to change our gaze and seek the vision of the Lord. We resolved to look outward to the souls of those around us. We threw ourselves into our Church callings, reasoning that if we were faithful in our responsibilities we could at least feel comfortable as we approached the throne of God and asked for a miracle.<br><br>That is when I learned that the primary way that our Heavenly Father delivers miracles is through the souls of other beings. We have a familiar term for those beings--we call them angels. In this circumstance, my angel's name was Julia Mattson, and it turns out that the answer to my prayers wasn't found through soul searching but through visiting teaching. Julia was a medical student at the University of Illinois and my visiting teaching companion. Her inspired questioning, patient listening, and knowledge of medical practices and insurance company peculiarities opened the door to precisely the miracle I had been seeking. Because of Julia Mattson, the right doctors were found, the proper measures were taken, and whispered prayers were answered.<br><br>Our twin daughters were born the following year at the end of my first semester as a professor at BYU. They arrived two months early. They were in the neonatal intensive care unit; they were in heavily monitored incubators; and they were fighting to breathe, even to live. Our loved ones were deeply concerned for us and for them, but my husband and I were happy--even fearless in the face of these challenges. We had experienced our own personal parting of the Red Sea; we knew we had entered our own promised land.<br><br>Your promised lands await you, but faith is required to get there--and that faith must be developed through your everyday practices in your everyday world. That world of yours is filled with mountains of information and floods of messages that vie for your attention and present unprecedented challenges. But really, it is still just a matter of agency, just as italways has been. And I have faith in you.<br><ul><br> 	<li>Choose to be a record keeper: it will build your faith and the faith of those around you.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Choose to engage in active media conversations and avoid passive media consumption.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Choose to consecrate your every day--your thoughts, communications, and actions.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Choose to look outward in service to others for answers to your prayers.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Choose to "find ways and go to places and create circumstances where [you] can unite symbolically with [our Father] and ... gain access to His power" to help you navigate through the choices and challenges of your generation.</li><br></ul><br>For this is life eternal, that you in your world, with the tools of your day and the practices of your everyday life--that<i>you</i>will come to know the true and living God, and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent (see John 17:3).<br><br>Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Amy Petersen Jensen was chair of the BYU Department of Theatre and Media Arts when this devotional was given on 20 March 2012.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>Education - to April 2012 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the privilege of celebrating this long-awaited day not only with those of you graduating but also with your teachers, supervisors, parents, families, and friends. They, too, have experienced great anticipation for what this rite of passage signifies for those of you who have achieved the recognition identified in the program of the day. We all add our congratulations and best wishes, which we will appropriately repeat not only today and tomorrow but also on occasion throughout your lives. It is a great honor to participate with all who are involved and have contributed to the cause for this great celebration.<br><br>As is usually the case with the graduating class, there is not only diversity in background, disciplines studied, and future plans but also great consistency in the basic goodness and extraordinary capacity for accomplishment and service in those we honor. As I have the opportunity to reflect on the significant collective attainments of this wonderful group we honor today--and also on what you will yet achieve in your personal lives and in ­service to families, churches, communities, and nations--I find great evidence for confidence in the future. I am satisfied that the tremendous investment made in your BYU education by you students, your families, the faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and our loyal and generous donors is more than justified. In this we are reminded of the scriptural injunction familiar to all of us: "For of him [or her] unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). In more casual discourse, we occasionally hear it said that "where much is given, much is expected." While still true, the scriptural wording is stronger and clearer. Inherent in all that we do at BYU is the expectation and even the mandate that the efforts of students, professors, family members, friends, tithe payers, and thoughtful donors will all bear productive and valuable fruit.<br><br>Hopefully we are clear that the confidence and blessings bestowed upon us as the result of our BYU experience raises much more than a suggestion that we will "go forth to serve" with commitment, effectiveness, and appreciation. While I have not visited with all of you by any means, I am satisfied by my interactions with many that you both understand and are fully committed to contribute a high return on the investment made in each of you. Thank you for your goodness, your devotion, and your determination to fulfill your great potential in making the world a better place. I am very pleased to recognize and endorse to Elder Dallin H. Oaks and his associates on our board of trustees your present and future contributions.<br><br>In accord with the prophecies made about this institution by our Church leaders from the very beginning of our institution, Brigham Young University is progressing toward the goal of becoming the very fine university prophetic predictions have envisioned. While still needing to do many more things better than we do them today, we are now consistently in the top ten in this nation of all baccalaureate degree–granting institutions in producing graduates who go on to earn PhD degrees as well as professional degrees in dentistry, law, and medicine in addition to other fields. Our students and faculty continue to be widely recognized and saluted for their integrity and accomplishments.<br><br>But there are also some very important things about BYU that have not changed and must never change. In the remarkable history of our first one hundred years by Wilkinson and Skousen entitled<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny,</i>I read the following statement:<br><br><i>Certainly one of the most distinguishing features of Brigham Young Academy was the attention it gave to teaching, as part of the daily curriculum, the doctrines, practices, and principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The original 1875 deed of trust provided that "the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants shall be read and their doctrines inculcated in the Academy." The deed and grant of property of 1 June 1877 also provided that "no book shall be used therein that misrepresents, or speaks lightly of the Divine Mission of our Savior, or of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or in any manner advances ideas antagonistic to the principles of the Gospel." These instructions were strictly followed.</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen,<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), 106]<br><br>And, I add, they continue to be.<br><br>This coming week we will be visited on campus by an accrediting team from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. As a campus community and in our preparation for our report and this visit, we have spent considerable time and effort studying the BYU Aims and Mission statements. While eloquent and possessing more detail than that found in the statement I just read, the fundamentals and basics have not changed. From the very beginning BYU has been an institution that has done its best to "be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).<br><br>It is our prayer and aspiration for each of you as you complete this BYU experience that you will continually keep the mission and aims of your BYU education front and center in your minds and in your hearts so that they are inextricably connected with who and what you are. May this ever be so for each of us, Ihumbly pray and testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 19April 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1> Banner High: The Mark of Brigham Young University - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates and all who rejoice with you on this occasion: I enjoy commencement exercises. These are happy times for graduates, for parents, for friends, for teachers, and for administration. These are times to acknowledge past accomplishments and take proud notice of goals attained. These are also times to take notice of potentials certified and to anticipate future achievements.<br><br>Commencement exercises are also occasions to celebrate graduates' progress from one status to another. That is what "commencement" signifies. It is a rite of passage, like a christening, a baptism, or a wedding reception. I am pleased to join in such a happy occasion.<br><h2><b>I.</b></h2><br>Custom decrees that we dress up in robes for a commencement exercise and that graduates parade before the assembly to hear the reading of their names and to receive well-earned congratulations.<br><br>Custom also decrees that you receive ­written evidence of your new status--a diploma. Here I deviate from normal commencement rhetoric by calling attention to some embarrassing moments BYU has suffered in the preparation of these diplomas.<br><br>A minor example was reported in the<i>Daily Universe</i>seventeen years ago. Every student who received a master's degree in the April commencement in 1995 received a diploma in which the seal of the university contained the wrong date for its founding (see "Defective Y Diplomas Discovered, Replaced,"<i>Daily Universe,</i>20 September 1995, 1). Replacements were, of course, provided.<br><br>The report of that mistake, which I found in my files as I did research for this talk, reminded me of an even greater embarrassment that occurred during my own time as president of BYU. This one has never been reported, but since nearly forty years have now passed and since I do not want to continue selfishly concealing my unique knowledge of this matter, I choose to share it now.<br><br>In April 1974, BYU conferred an honorary degree on our beloved apostle Elder LeGrand Richards. Honorary degrees are titled by the awarding institution. Most frequently they are titled Doctor of Laws. In a creative moment, our BYU administration and board of trustees decided to give a unique title to Elder Richards' degree: Doctor of Christian Service. The diploma was prepared and put into my hands, suitably framed in a presentation folder. With loving formality I presented it to Elder Richards in the commencement exercise.<br><br>As we took our seats, Elder Richards opened the folder and examined the diploma, which I had neglected to do. As the program went forward, he quietly handed me the opened folder and I read the beautifully inscribed degree: Doctor of Christian Science. Typical of that great gentleman, he never said anything about this embarrassing mistake. As for me, I quietly retained possession of the erroneous document, and we soon provided the correct one. Perhaps we will now have to endure the publicity we avoided in 1974, but I suppose we are now more suited to do so.<br><h2><b>II.</b></h2><br>Custom also decrees that, as part of a graduation ceremony, graduates listen to speeches acknowledging the obvious fact that the mere gaining of knowledge and skill is only a partial view of the significance of education. Of even greater importance is how educational attainments will be used. As a result, commencement addresses commonly give graduates advice and take notice of the needs of the world in which they will serve.<br><br>You graduate in challenging times. We live in times of wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, recession, and the prospect of further financial disaster. Values and standards honored for thousands of years are being denied or cast aside. Evil is being called good, and good is being called evil. Selfishness is rampantly replacing service.<br><br>Though men's hearts are failing them, you should take heart. There have always been challenging times. We, the generations of your predecessors, have survived daunting challenges, and so will you. The answer to all of these challenges is the same as it has always been. We have a Savior, and He has taught us what we should do. At the end of His ministry He declared: "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>As His witness I testify that His teachings are true and that the way He has marked out is the way to peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come.<br><h2><b>III.</b></h2><br>Now, what is your role in all of this?<br><br>Almost forty years ago President Marion G. Romney stood at this pulpit and spoke these words to graduates at a BYU commencement exercise:<br><br><i>You all have a mark upon you after today. . . . You will be known as a graduate of Brigham Young University,</i>[which is]<i>part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The people who know you and see you will judge the Church by you. Your great mission is to hold the banner high.</i>["Concluding Remarks," BYU commencement address, 20 April 1973, 1]<br><br>You "have a mark upon you." We all have marks or labels upon us. Our names and many characteristics of our appearance, such as family similarities, are marks. So is our speech. These marks are involuntary. Other marks are voluntarily assumed, like religious symbols that various faiths use on their apparel, which we honor, and tattoos, which we discourage. Our Savior is the model for a self-imposed mark of the utmost significance. Isaiah spoke messianically as he voiced the Savior's declaration: "I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:16). In their own ways, each of these marks--holy and mundane--is a ­banner that sends a signal.<br><br>The mark you receive as a BYU graduate is neither involuntary nor self-imposed. You sought this mark, and it is put upon you by proper authority. After today you have more than a new line on your résumé. You have been marked. As a BYU graduate, you are, as we say, a marked man or woman.<br><br>The significance of a mark is twofold. First, like a banner, it will be visible and it will have an effect on others. "He" or "she" is a BYU graduate, some will say, and that statement will identify expectations or disappointment.<br><br>But the most important effect of the mark put upon you today is not the signal it sends to others but the influence it should have upon you. A mark can and should be a reminder of our relationship to those who put the mark upon us and also of the responsibilities we have assumed as a result of the certifications they have given us. These are the meanings probably intended when the apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians about their responsibilities as followers of Christ and concluded with his personal testimony that "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus" (Galatians 6:17).<br><br>Paul's marks may have been scars from persecution suffered in the service of the Master. Your marks from BYU may be academic to others, but to you the mark of a BYU degree should be a continuing reminder.<br><br>Foremost among the things you should remember from your years at BYU are the teachings you have received about the things of eternity and the principles of right and wrong that have been up-front in your religion classes and pervasive in many others. I will remind you of some of these teachings and do so in an unusual way. At Brigham Young University it seems appropriate to quote the teachings of the founder, Brigham Young. He spoke as an extraordinarily wise leader, and he also spoke as a prophet.<br><h2><b>IV.</b></h2><br>Here are some of Brigham Young's wise words about practical living:<br><br><i>Some think too much, and should labor more, others labor too much and should think more, and thus maintain an equilibrium between the mental and physical members of the individual; then you will enjoy health and vigor, will be active, and ready to discern truly, and judge quickly.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>261]<br><br><i>There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven. Sweet harmonious sounds give exquisite joy to human beings capable of appreciating music. . . . Every sweet musical sound that can be made belongs to the Saints and is for the Saints.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>242–43]<br><br>Brigham Young was an aggressive teacher of self-reliance. Here are some of his words on that subject:<br><br><i>Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>293]<br><br><i>While we can help ourselves, it is our duty to do so.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>155]<br><br><i>Have I any good reason to say to my Father in Heaven, "Fight my battles," when he has given me the sword to wield, the arm and the brain that I can fight for myself? Can I ask him to fight my battles and sit quietly down waiting for him to do so? I cannot. . . . To ask God to do for me that which I can do for myself is preposterous to my mind.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>426]<br><br><i>Ye Latter-day Saints, . . . learn to do without that which you cannot purchase and pay for; . . . you must and will live within your means.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>293]<br><br>Beyond Brigham Young's wisdom--so ­necessary to lead the Saints in ­supporting themselves and in building their homes and society in a barren wilderness--he was foremost a prophet of God. He taught eternal truths and guided the Saints to apply them in their mortal circumstances.<br><br><i>Our existence here is for the sole purpose of exaltation and restoration to the presence of our Father and God, where we may progress endlessly.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>37]<br><br><i>The Gospel brings intelligence, happiness, and glory to all who obey it and live according to its precepts.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>53]<br><br><i>The Lord has revealed to us a plan by which we may be saved both here and hereafter. God has done everything we could ask, and more. . . . The errand of Jesus to earth was to bring his brethren and sisters back into the presence of the Father; he has done his part of the work, and it remains for us to do ours. . . . He is now King of kings and Lord of lords, and the time will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess, to the glory of God the Father, that Jesus is the Christ</i>. [<i>DBY,</i>27]<br><br>In establishing the Academy that was to grow into Brigham Young University, this great founder taught that education was an imperative in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>All our educational pursuits are in the service of God, for all these labors are to establish truth on the earth, and that we may increase in knowledge, wisdom, understanding in the power of faith and in the wisdom of God, that we may become fit subjects to dwell in a higher state of existence and intelligence than we now enjoy.</i>["Remarks by President Brigham Young" (6 October 1870),<i>Deseret News,</i>Semi-Weekly, 25 October 1870, 2; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1997), 317]<br><br><i>Man is organized and brought forth as the king of the earth, to understand, to criticize, examine, improve, manufacture, arrange, and organize the crude matter, and honor and glorify the work of God's hands. . . . It is good for mortals to search out the things of this earth.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>49–50]<br><br>Brigham Young also taught that we have a responsibility to search out the things of God. And, typical of his philosophy of self-reliance, he taught that we have a duty to know these eternal truths for ourselves.<br><br><i>I do not want men to come to me or my brethren for testimony as to the truth of this work; but let them take the Scriptures of divine truth, and there the path is pointed out to them as plainly as ever a guideboard indicated the right path to the weary traveler. There they are directed to go, not to . . . any Apostle or Elder in Israel, but to the Father in the name of Jesus, and ask for the information they need. Can they who take this course in honesty and sincerity receive information? Will the Lord turn away from the honest heart seeking for truth? No, he will not; he will prove to them, by the revelations of his Spirit.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>429–30]<br><br>Here is what Brigham Young said about this responsibility of personal revelation:<br><br><i>How are we to know the voice of the Good Shepherd from the voice of a stranger? Can any person answer this question? I can. It is very easy. To every philosopher upon the earth, I say, your eye can be deceived, so can mine; your ear can be deceived, so can mine; . . . but the Spirit of God filling the creature with revelation and the light of eternity, cannot be mistaken--the revelation which comes from God is never mistaken. When an individual, filled with the Spirit of God, declares the truth of heaven, the sheep hear that, the Spirit of the Lord pierces their inmost souls . . . and they see and understand for themselves.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>431]<br><br>How was that individuality to be reconciled with the commandment to follow a prophet, even in the weighty exercise of authority ­necessary to settle the wilderness and hold back the world?<br><br><i>The Lord Almighty leads this Church, and he will never suffer you to be led astray if you are found doing your duty. . . . If</i>[your leaders]<i>should try to</i>[lead you astray]<i>the Lord would quickly sweep them from the earth.</i>[DBY, 137]<br><br>The next teaching I will quote is reminiscent of the Master's teaching that man cannot serve two masters (see Matthew 6:24). In teaching the Saints how to conduct their lives in harmony with the gospel in a world that pursues other values, Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The man or woman who enjoys the spirit of our religion has no trials; but the man or woman who tries to live according to the Gospel of the Son of God, and at the same time clings to the spirit of the world, has trials and sorrows acute and keen, and that, too, continually.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>348]<br><br>As BYU graduates and other Saints suffer worldly criticism and perhaps even persecution, they will do well to remember Brigham Young's declaration:<br><br><i>Every time they persecute and try to overcome this people, they elevate us, weaken their own hands, and strengthen the hands and arms of this people. And every time they undertake to lessen our number, they increase it. And when they try to destroy the faith and virtue of this people, the Lord strengthens the feeble knees, and confirms the wavering in faith and power in God, in light, and intelligence.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>351]<br><br>Finally, Brigham Young had an inclusive attitude toward his fellowmen that all should understand and emulate:<br><br><i>It has never altered my feelings towards individuals, as men or as women, whether they believe as I do or not. Can you live as neighbors with me? I can with you; and it is no particular concern of mine whether you believe with me or not.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>278–79]<br><br><i>Our religion is adapted to the capacity of the whole human family. It does not send a portion of the people to howl in torment for ever and ever, but it reaches after the last son and daughter of Adam and Eve, and will pluck them from the prison, unlock the doors, and burst the bonds and bring forth every soul who will receive salvation.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>389]<br><br>These are some of the teachings of the great founder of this university. These are the ideals for which it still stands. I testify to you that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that He stands at the head of the church that sponsors this institution. And as His servant I invoke His blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<br>
Elder Oaks, President Samuelson, distinguished guests, friends, family, and fellow graduates: Good afternoon.<br><br>I love the word<i>microcosm.</i>Webster's Dictionary says that it means "a little world"-- some small reflection of a larger existence. I have thought, lately, about the many microcosms in my life: the "little worlds" that mirror my bigger existence. Our universe, I think, is a microcosm of something larger. And so is Earth. And so is Provo. And so, I think, is BYU.<br><br>In the BYU microcosm, I was "born" in May Hall. When I was "growing up," my friends and I enjoyed staying up late, playing games, and riding our bicycles. We managed to subsist almost entirely on string cheese and Pop-Tarts, on account of a thing we called "Dining Plus." We were kids, and we learned how to have fun.<br><br>Then the economics midterm came back with a bright red "66" at the top. My first D. It was time to learn how to study. And so, in a secluded carrel on the fourth floor of the library, the BYU-world childhood taught me that too.<br><br>After two years in Southeast Asia, in another microcosm of life, I found myself back on campus. In the BYU world I was a young and very single adult, and it was time for me to learn new things, starting with choosing a major and learning how to date.<br><br>I awkwardly asked a friend from ninth grade if she would come to an International Cinema movie with me. She said yes, and a couple of years of marriage and a six-month-old little boy later, I've begun to learn how to love.<br><br>I had a midlife crisis (Do I really want to major in this?) and even learned how to teach a Sunday School lesson.<br><br>And over the past four years, like each of you, I have continued learning these same lessons--and others--as I've grown and matured in this microcosm of ours.<br><br>But now, in the BYU world, we've grown old. I, for one, have developed a bad habit of parking my car at the RB and then walking over to the Tanner Building so I can take the elevator up to campus rather than huff and puff up the stairs as young, spry freshmen bound ahead of me. We've reached the end of this little world. We have done--here at least--our fair share of learning.<br><br>And all of that learning we owe to others. I speak for my class as I address spouses, parents, classmates, professors, the donors of this university, and God in heaven: Thank you. We could not have done it without you.<br><br>Ultimately, our experiences here should really just have taught us to become microcosms ourselves. We typically use the word<i>microcosm</i>to reference experiences, places, or things. But the Oxford English Dictionary reveals a much older meaning. It says that microcosm means "human nature or experience [regarded as the representation] in miniature of divine or universal nature." Paracelsus wrote, "Man is . . . a microcosm, or a little world, because he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament, from the earth and the elements; and so he is their quintessence."<br><br>We are in the world--and we have come to this university--so that we ourselves might become microcosms of the Divine, that we might have "the image of God engraven" not only upon our countenances but also upon our very existences (Alma 5:19). Of all the microcosms in the world, surely the greatest is the man or woman who strives to become a reflection of the Savior.<br><br>"Enter to Learn," the sign says. I have. I have learned a little biology, a little Chinese, and a lot of economics. But I am not sure that that is all of what the sign means. And so, now, as we together don our mortarboards to wander off to some other microcosm of life, let's take the larger lessons with us: how to have fun, how to study, how to love, how to better worship Jesus Christ and become microcosms of the Divine. Because BYU is more than just a university--it's a little world. And we've learned life lessons, not just classroom ones.<br><br>Congratulations, fellow graduates, and thank you.<br><br><i>Stephen R.B. Richards spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 19April 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>mple Things - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What an impressive sight! I'm gazing out at a sea of blue caps and gowns--striking evidence of your success as students at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I'm especially pleased to see Sharron Martin Kunz in your ranks. She started her degree forty-six years ago, interrupting her formal education to marry Calvin Kunz and raise four children. She always encouraged learning and helped support her family through eight degrees at BYU. Graduating from BYU isthe fulfillment of a promise she made herself many decades ago. She has always loved Brigham Young University and what it stands for. She fostered the Spirit of the Y in her kids and loved watching them graduate from the university. She waited patiently, and now it's her turn. Well done, Sharron.<br><br>In Sharron's freshman year, 1966, President Ernest L. Wilkinson told the faculty that "our roots spring from Palmyra, rather than Cambridge. . . . If most institutions of higher learning aspire to be only communities of scholars, we are privileged to be also a congregation of disciples" (address to BYU faculty, 12September 1966, 6). As graduates of BYU you are capable of competing with the absolute best in your fields of study.<br><br>Now that you have achieved this great accomplishment, some of you may think this is the end of your BYU experience. Yet this is only the first chapter. You will be an alumnus or alumna far longer than you were a student, and you will be forever considered part of the university. You will continue to make us proud.<br><br>When you were a student, we expected you to study, work hard, and develop into a person of faith, intellect, and good moral character. We invite you to continue to grow educationally and spiritually. We also expect a few additional things from you.<br><br>These things are somewhat simple. Wear Cougar Blue often, but especially on Fridays, which is our spirit day. You never know when someone is going to strike up a conversation with you because they recognize the Y logo on your shirt or the BYU pin in your lapel.<br><br>Don't be a stranger. Return to your alma mater often, whether it's for Homecoming or a football game, for classes during Campus Education Week, or to mentor students.<br><br>Stay involved with your college. Who knows? You may be the very person to help astudent wondering what course in life he orshe could take.<br><br>Whenever possible, become involved with BYU chapters. Continue to share the Spirit of the Y with a group that shares your ideals.<br><br>Many people helped you complete your journey here. As President Cecil O. Samuelson reminded us earlier, the Savior taught, "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (Luke 12:48). I pray you will be grateful for this blessing. May the Savior's words inspire you to give back to BYU, whether through the Annual Fund or replenishment grants or to help fund scholarships and research projects as a new group of students "enter to learn; go forth to serve." As Isaid, we expect great things from you.<br><br>BYU changed the very course of my life. And as I grow older, I appreciate its value more and more. And you will too, I am sure.<br><br>I want you to live "rise and shout," because today a lot of new Cougars are out!<br><br>I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>I leave this with you, humbly, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael O'Connor was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 19April 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Precious Commodity; a Finite Resource - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor to be with you. I pray the Spirit may dwell with all of us.<br><br>Today I would like to share some thoughts about time. To illustrate some aspects of time, I wish to tell you about a few of my heroes--one from the Book of Mormon, one from the field of science, and one who is very personal. I, like you, have many heroes: the great coaches and teachers I have had, my PhD advisor, my colleagues, my brother and sister, my great parents, my sons, my sweetheart, and many, many others. These people have believed in me and have given me a chance. I will be forever in their debt, for they shared their time with me--and time is one of the most precious commodities of this life.<br><br>As a petroleum geologist, I am awed by the power of fossil fuels. Think of it: we can dump a little bit of gasoline in a tank, start up an engine, pile ten people (or undergraduates, as the case may be) into an 8,000-pound van, and drive up a mountainside at seventy miles per hour--simply by depressing a pedal a couple of inches. This alone would make fossil fuels a precious commodity, but in our modern hydrocarbon society, many of us also use them to heat our homes, cook our pancakes, and warm our morning showers. To all of us, fossil fuels are a precious commodity. Yet fossil fuels are also a finite resource. It has taken Mother Nature millions of years to deposit, generate, migrate, and trap this precious commodity in the rocks buried deeply beneath Earth's surface. Yet it is estimated that, starting from the Industrial Revolution, it will take humankind only 300 years to deplete this finite resource--a blip on even the human-history timescale.<sup>1</sup>This then begs the following questions: What is my stewardship of this resource? and How will I use it?<br><br>Today for a few moments I would like us to consider these same questions relative to<i>our time</i>on Earth--this short mortal existence. Carl Sagan, the author and great spokesman for the television series<i>Cosmos,</i>used to browbeat us by telling us that we as humankind are arrogant to assume that there is not life beyond our planet, given the immensity of space and the universe. This concept was easy enough for LDS people to grasp; yet after a lifetime of study, Sagan found no solid evidence for extraterrestrial life. In fact, in viewing our tiny blue planet from space, he said, "It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the only home we've ever known: the pale blue dot."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Before his premature death due to myelodysplasia,<sup>3</sup>Carl Sagan suggested that life on Earth is pretty precious and that we should take care of our planet. May I suggest that<i>time</i>on Earth is pretty precious. Maybe we should take better care of<i>it.</i>Indeed, just like fossil fuels, it is a precious commodity and a finite resource. The questions resurface: What is my stewardship over my time on Earth? and How will I use it?<br><br>As a geoscientist I have thought a lot about time. We geologists commonly throw around big numbers relative to time and the age of Earth. For example, with solid evidence geoscientists contend that Earth is approximately 4.7 billion years old--assuming time as we know it. Can we even comprehend what one billion years is? That is a very difficult task, so let's pare it down.<br><br>For several years my students and I have been engaged in studying a Jurassic-age formation in Utah's Colorado Plateau. The Entrada Sandstone has created the splendor of Arches National Park, Goblin Valley and Kodachrome Basin state parks, and other spectacular scenery in Utah. We have now determined that the Entrada Sandstone was deposited from approximately 162 to 165 million years ago,<sup>4</sup>so the Entrada Sandstone has been around for at least 162 million years. This is only 3.4 percent of Earth history, but it is still a big number, so let's pare it down some more.<br><br>Milutin Milankovitch, one of my scientific heroes whom I will discuss later, determined that the elliptical path that Earth carves around the sun varies. At times it is more circular, and at other times it is more elliptical. This variation in the shape of the elliptical orbit has a distinct periodicity of approximately 100,000 years.<sup>5</sup>This and other orbital variations affect the amount of incoming solar radiation and force Earth in and out of ice ages. When Earth goes into a cold glacial condition, it stores ocean water on the continents as huge ice sheets. This process of building continental-scale ice sheets effectively lowers sea level by hundreds of feet. Therefore, Earth's oceans rise and fall at a precise periodicity of 100,000 years--a mere 0.0021 percent of Earth history. One hundred thousand--still too big of number to comprehend? Let's get closer to home.<br><br>Have you ever wondered why our campus is so flat when it is located literally a mile from the Wasatch Front, which quickly rises to 11,000 feet above sea level?<sup>6</sup>It turns out that our campus was created when the Provo River deposited its sediment as a delta into a great freshwater lake called Lake Bonneville. Yes, just a mere 15,000 years ago,<sup>7</sup>if you were sitting exactly where you are now, you would be under sixty feet of water watching fish and an occasional iceberg float over your head. As the climate changed during the past 15,000 years, due primarily to Milankovitch orbital variations, Lake Bonneville began to dry up and shrink, effectively concentrating her salt into what is now the Great Salt Lake. So our campus was created just 15,000 years ago. Its existence represents only 0.00032 percent of Earth history.<br><br>Let's go one more time with the analogy. The life expectancy of the average person in the United States is 78.49 years.<sup>8</sup>So if you are average--and I know all of you are exceptional--you will be part of only 1.7x10<sup>-6</sup>percent of Earth history. That's 0.0000017 percent. No, I am not trying to make you feel like a zero--but, in a relative perspective, life is short!<br><br>The scriptures teach us that our time (here on Earth) is not the same as God's time. To help me comprehend time, I think in terms of being sent to this earth life and being placed within an envelope of time. When this life is over, we are plucked out of that envelope and returned to Heavenly Father's realm--a place in which time as we know it does not exist. In this way I can barely get my head around the eternal nature of God and man.<br><br>One of my heroes in the Book of Mormon is King Benjamin. In my mind he was a man's man, because he taught by example. He walked the walk. He was focused on a clear eternal perspective. He knew what he was about. And what was he about? He described himself in Mosiah 2:14:<i></i>"And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you."<i></i>He taught that service to our fellow men is inseparable from service to God. He taught this principle by example. He used his time to serve others by teaching and leading through word and action. He also taught that this time in life is given to us from day to day and moment to moment:<br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i>[Mosiah 2:21]<br><br>The question returns: If my time is given to me from one moment to another, even from breath to breath, what will I do with it? King Benjamin chose to serve others.<br><br>A little more than a year ago a former graduate student, Shane Long, returned to campus to recruit geoscientists for his company. In a presentation that I had requested he give to our students, he shared an experience that had changed him. This story also had a profound impact on me.<br><br>Shane was on assignment for his company in Lagos, Nigeria, the eighth-most-populous country in the world and one in which there is much poverty. As he was driven in a bulletproof vehicle from the airport to the meeting facility, people and children were abundant in the streets. Shane spent three and a half hours in that vehicle, as progress was slow. During those hours he had time to observe and ponder what was around him just outside of the vehicle. At one point he observed two little girls in the dusty street. They were playing hand games. Shane's attention to them intensified because he recalled a similar experience he had had just a couple of weeks earlier. It was his own daughter who, while waiting to be picked up from her swimming lessons, was playing similar hand games with a friend. The circumstances of these two experiences, however, were vastly different, and, in Shane's words, "the contrast could not have been more striking." In those precious, quiet moments, clarity came to him. He received a vision, or personal revelation, that told him directly that, from that moment on, he was to be a steward over his salary. He fully internalized how he was a product of hard work, good people, and the blessings of circumstance. He was to be wiser and more caring with the gifts that were given him. In that poignant moment he resolved to change.<br><br>I have thought a lot about the experience of this great young man. I have thought about his willingness to share that experience with our present students. I have thought about the degree to which I serve others by sharing my gifts--my time being the most precious of them all. Am I doing my part? Am I serving my God by serving others to the extent that I should? Or do I waste a lot of the most precious gifts that are given me? When was the last poignant moment that I had wherein I resolved to change? Maybe it's about time.<br><br>President Marion G. Romney said:<br><br><i>Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Service, then, is the ultimate way of spending our time.<br><br>Let's examine a way in which another one of my heroes spent his time. Milutin Milankovitch was a Serbian mathematician. As a young man in the early 1900s he got caught up in the fervor of the possibility that Earth had experienced more than one ice age.<sup>10</sup>Encouraged by the work of several predecessors, including Scotsman James Croll, Milankovitch realized that several variations in Earth's orbit around the sun affected the amount of incoming solar radiation that hit Earth. This variation in solar radiation, he reasoned, could throw Earth in and out of ice ages. The mathematical proofs, however, were difficult to develop. Indeed, it took thirty years of his life to finally produce and conclude these proofs and associated graphical curves.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Milankovitch died in 1958 at the age of seventy-nine at a time when most geologists had rejected his theory of the ice ages. Almost three decades after his death, with technological advances that were unheard of during his time, geoscientists finally proved that Milankovitch was right all along. Unfortunately, Milankovitch was long gone. Time had deprived him of the experience of knowing that his geological colleagues fully acknowledged the validity of his theory.<br><br>Milankovitch's theory has now been widely accepted and evidenced from a variety of disciplines. His calculations have been shown to be the driving mechanisms of the great ice ages of the geological past. They are now considered fundamental in understanding Earth's past climates. Furthermore, they have been extremely useful in petroleum exploration because as Earth stores vast quantities of ocean water on the continents in the form of massive continental ice sheets, global sea level drops. When Earth enters a warm interglacial period, the ice melts. That meltwater runs back to the ocean, and sea level rises again. This fluctuation in sea level is around 400 vertical feet. Therefore, the shorelines and great deltas of the world shift their locations over 200 miles across the continental shelves from sea level's lowstand position during cold glacial maximums to its highstand position during warm interglacials. The great deltas of the world are prolific in producing accumulations of oil and natural gas. A knowledge of the driving mechanisms of these movements through time has greatly aided in the discovery of fossil fuels on the world's continental shelves. So, in a very broad sense, Milutin Milankovitch has affected each of our lives. Certainly the time he spent on his calculations has served mankind well.<br><br>On a more personal note, Milankovitch directly affected my life because as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, I studied Milankovitch cycles in the Arctic Ocean. Upon graduation I was fortunate enough to be given several offers of employment by oil companies while my colleagues, many of whom were brighter than I, struggled to get even one offer. I quickly realized that the multiple job offers were not a result of my sterling personality but were indeed a direct reflection of my knowledge of Milankovitch theory. Milankovitch helped me to secure my first real job, which has trickled down to other opportunities, including my present position here at BYU.<br><br>There is one more story about Milutin Milankovitch that gives him hero status in my life and directly addresses the topic of time. I stated that it took Milankovitch thirty years of his life to produce his mathematical proofs. Early in this process he was confident that his theory was correct. All he needed was time to make the necessary calculations. Then, to his dismay, World War I broke out. The invading army captured him and took him to a fortress. He spent the next six months in confinement as a prisoner of war.<br><br>Of the day he was put into prison, he later recalled:<br><br><i>The heavy iron door was closed behind me. The massive rusty lock gave a rumbling moan when the key was turned. . . . I adjusted to my new situation by switching off my brain and staring apathetically into the air. After a while I happened to glance at my suitcase. . . . My brain began to function again. I jumped up, and opened the suitcase. . . . In it I had stored the papers on my cosmic problem. . . . I leafed through the writings, . . . pulled my faithful fountain pen out of my pocket, and began to write and count. . . . As I looked around my room after midnight, I needed some time before I realized where I was. The little room seemed like the nightquarters on my trip through the universe</i>.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Milankovitch was focused on his goals and his life purpose. He knew what he was about. He despaired only momentarily before awakening himself. He chose not to waste his time, so to speak. He turned his circumstance around and seemingly relished the six months he spent in confinement as a prisoner of war.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, do we relish our time on Earth? Do we have enough purpose in our lives to shake off despair and apathy? President Uchtdorf recently challenged us to prioritize all of the "good" things we do in order to do the best things we can.<sup>13</sup>I have found that on occasion it is healthy for me to step back and contemplate what I really want to gain from this life and the precious time that I have. It often invigorates me and gives me more focus.<br><br>When I was recently discussing time as a precious commodity and a finite resource with one of my bright undergraduate students, the student blatantly stated, "Doc, we don't have time to make mistakes in this life. It's too short, and we lose the opportunity to accomplish something good." How profound.<br><br>Please permit me to tell you about one last hero of mine--one who is very personal. This story also started with a moment of despair. In 1990 my wife and I were blessed with the birth of our third son, Connor. Within moments of his birth he was whisked away by the nurses for cleaning up and ordinary checkups. Soon thereafter, however, a solemn doctor returned to my wife's recovery room to inform us that our son had Down's syndrome. As the words came out of his mouth, I vividly remember the deep despair that sank through my body. I felt ill and turned away from the doctor and prayed silently to Heavenly Father, asking Him to turn back time and to not let the doctor say those words. It didn't happen; time went on.<br><br>Over the course of the next two days I was in deep despair, thinking of all the challenges that the future would hold. On the morning of that third day, I said a prayer asking Heavenly Father to deliver me from despair. I felt like I couldn't go on, and I needed His help. That afternoon a good neighbor and friend came to visit. He took me aside and told me that our little boy needed a name and a blessing and then prodded me to go with him to the hospital and give him one. I agreed, and as we finished the blessing, I watched our little Connor in the incubator struggling for life. In that instant these words came to my mind: "One day at a time, Tom. One day at a time."<br><br>The despair seemingly melted away. I had my answer. My little boy was fighting for life. I was surely going to give him my best--one day at a time. Since that moment I have never worried too much about the future with Connor. We've taken it one day at a time--moment by moment. Connor taught me to not be overwhelmed and fall into despair but instead to break life down into bite-size pieces, chew hard, and savor the moment.<br><br>For nearly twenty-two years our life's ride with Connor has been awesome. I have often thought that all I have to do is provide him with a good life and then hang on to his coattails, for he will surely whisk me back to the celestial kingdom. He is a perfect example of unconditional love. He has been the glue to our family. He has made each of us a better person--especially his Papa Bear. And may I add that he is a great field assistant and a superb fishing partner! Connor seems to know what he is about. He wastes no time in sharing his talents: smiles, hugs, and unconditional love to all he meets.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 60:13 the Lord instructs his early missionaries to "not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known." This instruction seems fitting as we soldier on through life, one day at a time.<br><br>My three heroes have provided great insight into the use of time. King Benjamin used his time to serve others and thereby his God by word and action. His many acts of service led to the strength of his words. He knew what he was about.<br><br>Milutin Milankovitch was also focused on his life's work. He found little time to despair. He plowed forward, sometimes with delight, even under seemingly dire circumstances.<br><br>And, finally, Connor has taught me that life comes at us one day at a time. He taught me to not become overwhelmed with problems that might happen in the future but to instead use our gifts and talents from moment to moment and savor our precious time together.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, our life on Earth may be our best chance to prove our mettle. It comes at us one day at a time. What will we do in this life? this year? this day? this moment?<br><br>Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have given us this time. They believe in us. They have given us all a chance. They are the real heroes. May we have the wisdom, purpose, and drive to know what we are about and to take advantage of our time here on Earth. May we reflect often and prioritize our time, for time is a precious commodity--a finite resource. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas H.

<h1>ings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I was pondering what to say here today, the phrase "make a difference in the world" kept coming to mind. We often hear this phrase in this season of graduation proceedings and commencement addresses; it's commonly used at a university. When I searched this phrase on the BYU website, I got over five thousand results. It's a phrase that is often expressed in the context of future opportunities and actions, frequently suggesting something extraordinary. In this context, when students hear that they are preparing now to make a difference in the world, they might assume that the difference they are to make somehow lies dormant until after graduation, so that when they do go out into the world, they are prepared to make a big impact.<br><br>Today I would like to look at this phrase in a different way. I would like to discuss making a difference in the world in the context of the here and now and the small and simple.<br><br>Wanting to make a difference in the world, Mother Teresa founded the Congregation of the Missionaries of Charity in 1950. The mission of her small organization was to help "the poorest of the poor" in the slums of Calcutta, India, by educating and meeting the needs of the destitute and starving. She wanted to bring comfort to the sick and dying who often felt unloved, uncared for, and unwanted.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Some twenty years later the BBC sent an award-winning journalist to interview Mother Teresa about her work. The journalist reported that Calcutta was a scene of suffering and despair, the streets crowded with naked, hungry, homeless people whose needs stretched far beyond what the Missionaries of Charity could provide. The journalist suggested that a government agency would be better equipped than Mother Teresa to handle the destitute in the slums of Calcutta.<sup>2</sup>He stated, "Statistically speaking, what she achieves is little, or even negligible."<sup>3</sup>He thought--as he later revealed--that the difference she was making was so insignificant that it was hardly worth the bother.<br><br>Responding to the criticism directed at the "insignificant scale" of her work "by comparison with the need," Mother Teresa noted that "welfare is for a purpose--an admirable and a necessary one--whereas Christian love is for a person."<sup>4</sup>She told the journalist that the one was about numbers, the other about Christ.<sup>5</sup>She explained that what the poor need as much as food and clothing is to be wanted and loved.<sup>6</sup>Her simple purpose was to provide that love. She served the one within her reach, doing the best she could with what she had.<br><br>At another time Mother Teresa said: "What we do is nothing but a drop in the ocean. But if we didn't do it, the ocean would be one drop less."<sup>7</sup>Through her humble service, Mother Teresa made a difference in the world, drop bydrop.<br><br>After the interview the journalist concluded: "Christianity is not a statistical view of life. That there should be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over all the hosts of the just, is an anti-statistical proposition."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Jesus Christ taught us to love and serve the one within our reach. Sitting by a well in Samaria, Jesus spoke with a woman from the local village (see John 4:4–28). He spent time with her. He listened. He answered questions. He showed respect. The teachings and miracles of Jesus attracted crowds. People in need--like the woman who reached out and touched His clothes to be healed--pressed about Him, seeking His individual attention. Some tried to bring little children to Him, wanting Him to put His hands on them and bless them. When some of His disciples tried to send the children away, Jesus stopped them and asked that the children be brought to Him. He took time out of His busy schedule to be with them. "He took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them" (Mark 10:16; see also Matthew 19:14).<br><br>Jesus spent time in the home of His friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. On one such occasion He listened patiently to the complaints of an anxious and perhaps weary Martha, who felt she was carrying more than her fair share of the burden of hosting guests. Jesus responded with kindness, understanding, and love (see Luke 10:41). Later, when Lazarus became sick, Mary and Martha sent for Jesus (see John 11:1–35). When Mary heard that Jesus was near, she ran to meet Him, fell down at His feet, and said, "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died" (v. 32). When Jesus saw her weeping, the scriptures tell us that "he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled" (v. 33) and that He "wept" (v. 35). He showed great compassion in mourning with and comforting those around Him. Near the end of his mortal ministry Jesus said, "A new commandmentI give unto you, That ye love one another; as Ihave loved you" (John 13:34).<br><br>While Jesus sat at the well or visited with friends in their homes, the streets of Jerusalem were filled with the homeless, the hungry, the crippled, the blind, and those with leprosy, but there was nothing negligible about His services. There's nothing negligible about the simple acts of kindness and assistance that you and I offer to those around us on a daily basis. At BYU the one within our reach might be the roommate who has had a difficult day and needs someone to listen, the professor who is having an off day teaching and needs a little patience and understanding, or the guy in the lane next to us who needs us to give him a break by slowing down to let him over so that he doesn't miss his turn ahead. Every day in our homes, in our communities, and in our classrooms right here on campus we can find the one within our reach who needs our assistance. It may only be a drop, but it does make adifference in the lives of those around us.<br><br>President David O. McKay was fond of the nineteenth-century quote "Life is made up not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually are what win and preserve the heart and secure comfort."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Mother Teresa said:<br><br><i>It is never too small. We are so small we look at things in a small way. But God, being Almighty, sees everything great. Therefore, even if you write a letter for a blind man or you just go and sit and listen, or you take the mail for him, or you visit somebody or bring a flower to somebody–small things–or wash clothes for somebody or clean the house. Very humble work that is where you and I must be. For there are many people who can do big things. But there are very few people who will do the small things.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>We read in the Book of Mormon "that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6). This is illustrated beautifully in the birth of Christ. The Savior of the world was born in a simple stable in an obscure village to a woman of no great standing in the world. Out of these simple, small circumstances proceeded the Lord's great work of salvation. One of the most recognizable symbols of the Christmas season is the Nativity, with a small babe lying in straw and surrounded by animals. It is a reminder to us all that "out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>When celebrating the birth of Christ, we surround ourselves with symbols to remind us of what life is really all about, why we're here, and what we're supposed to be doing with our lives. There are two very similar fictional stories that have become a part of the Christmas tradition in the United States. One is Frank Capra's film<i>It's a Wonderful Life;</i>the other is Charles Dickens' novella<i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been adapted for film and theater. Ibelieve the broad appeal of these simple stories lies in their ability to remind us of things that we so easily forget but really want to remember. They help us rediscover the small things that get misplaced in the clutter around us. I know it's a little off-season, but I hope you'll indulge me in referring to these stories to remind us today of some things.<br><br>The main characters in these two stories--George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge--live their lives in relative obscurity, interacting on a daily basis with the people in their neighborhoods and communities and going about the mundane tasks of life. Both are businessmen in the profession of lending money--a trade that brings them into daily contact with individuals who need assistance. Like his father did before him, George Bailey runs his business with his heart rather than his head. He puts people before profits. His purpose in running a building and loan company is to help people get out of the slums. Kindness and respect characterize his daily interactions with those around him. On the other hand, Ebenezer Scrooge is described by Dickens as "a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!" He conducts business with his head rather than his heart--a head that Dickens says is as "hard and sharp as flint."<sup>11</sup>Profits come before people. Despising the poor, Scrooge is perfectly content to keep them in the slums.<br><br>Despite their differences, these two characters are very much alike. Both have forgotten the significance of their simple, daily interactions with others: the powerful, cumulative effect of daily living is lost on them. They don't get it--not until there is Christmas Eve intervention to remind them of things they probably already know in their hearts but have forgotten in their heads.<br><br>George feels like a failure because he did not pursue his dreams of becoming an architect and world traveler. He has lived out his life in the same small town where he was born, doing the same small things day in and day out. He feels like he has made no difference in the world. Looking back on his life, he can find no meaning or purpose to it, and he contemplates ending it.<br><br>George's life, however, is saved by an angel named Clarence who has come as an answer to the prayers of George's family--and to earn his wings. Clarence's job is to show George the impact of those small things he did day in and day out. Clarence sets out to prove to George that he really has had a wonderful life by giving him a vision of what life would have been like for others had George never been born.<br><br>Visiting that same small town as a stranger who has never lived among them, George finds people without hope living in the slums. He finds unhappiness and despair. He hasn't been there to offer a hand up, and no one else has bothered. George realizes that his little deeds of goodness, his habits of selfless service--his small drops--have brought a better life to those around him and beyond. He's astonished at the reach of his small gestures. George had made a difference in the world without having ever left his hometown.<br><br>Ebenezer Scrooge also has Christmas Eve visitors. The first is the ghost of Jacob Marley, Ebenezer's former business partner. He appears "captive, bound, and double-ironed"<sup>12</sup>with a long chain wound about him made of "cashboxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel."<sup>13</sup>The ghost explains to Ebenezer that he wears the chain he "forged in life," having made it "link by link, and yard by yard"<sup>14</sup>through the choices he made, being eternally linked to that which he valued most in life. He explains that he is now required to walk the earth and witness what he could not now share "but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness."<sup>15</sup>Shocked, Ebenezer exclaims, "But you were always a good man of business, Jacob."<sup>16</sup><br><br>The remorseful ghost says, "Business! . . . Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the . . . ocean of my business!"<sup>17</sup><br><br>And Ebenezer doesn't get it. He doesn't comprehend how the big things count so little nor how the small things matter so much. He cannot get that flint head of his around it. In the course of that long night he is visited by the spirits of Christmas past, present, and future. They come to show Scrooge that his cold-hearted, tight-fisted ways--his drops--have brought misery and unhappiness to those around him. His single-minded focus on his business has gradually resulted in his turning his back on his family and friends and in rejecting the needs of those in his community.<br><br>Both George and Ebenezer have Christmas epiphanies that bring them back to that simple stable in an obscure village. They come to realize that "by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls" (Alma 37:7). They remember, as we do through their stories, that the essence of life is in the small and seemingly insignificant daily interactions we have with others.<br><br>We are busy people here at BYU. There are appointments to be kept, projects to be finished, papers to be written, assignments to be graded, and any number of things to be organized on any given day. In the rush of our daily lives, we--like Marley and Scrooge--can easily get our priorities mixed up and forget the small things that are the most important. The one we need to assist could be sitting right next to us, but we do not see that person. Perhaps the person needing our individual attention has worked in the same office with us for years, and yet that person is invisible to us. If we become too preoccupied with the distractions that crowd around us, we may not feel the prompting when our Heavenly Father has an assignment for us.<br><br>One of my responsibilities at the library is to meet one-on-one with students to assist them with their research. I consider it the best part of my job. I also sometimes have to write reports and attend to mundane office duties. On one occasion I was feeling the pressure of an upcoming deadline. It had been a busy week, and I wasn't sure how I was going to get everything done. On my calendar I designated a couple of hours to get a certain task done. I told the student employees at our desk not to send any students needing research assistance to me that morning. I then went into my office and closed my door.<br><br>A short while later there was a knock at the door. I was irritated at the interruption. I went to the door and opened it. The student standing there explained that he really needed to meet with me as soon as possible, and he wondered if now would be a good time. Looking at my face, his smile dropped. Whatever I was radiating that morning, it wasn't friendly.<br><br>Before I could answer him, he said, "I see you're busy. I'll come back at another time." As he started to walk away, I received a prompting--a chastisement, really. I had made a bad choice. I had gotten my priorities mixed up. Like Marley and Scrooge, I had forgotten for a moment that mankind was my business. I told the student to stay and that I would really like to meet with him now.<br><br>As we talked in my office, the student explained that he had transferred to BYU from a small college. The course work here was more difficult than he had anticipated. He was feeling discouraged and doubting his abilities. He had two papers due, and he hadn't had much experience writing research papers. He found the library to be a large, complicated, and--I'm sure, thanks to me--unfriendly place. I had nothing better to do at that moment than to orient a new student to library research and offer a little encouragement. He returned to me several times for help after that. If I had let him walk away because I was too busy for him, I'm sure he would not have returned--the prompting told me that.<br><br>I believe that our Heavenly Father has small daily tasks that He would like us to do right here at BYU to make a difference. He would like to make us instruments in His hands in helping to fulfill His work. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom. ... So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>18</sup></a><br><br>Knowing that there are angels among us attending to our needs and that no sparrow falls without the Father's notice gives us courage and faith to let go of our own troubles long enough to reach out and help others with theirs. It's a system of give and take that works best when all focus more on the giving and less on the taking. Along the way, our Heavenly Father sends us gentle reminders of the small things that are of the greatest worth.<br><br>I first arrived on this campus as a freshman nearly thirty years ago. I had only been a member of the Church for four months, and I was the only member in my family. I was over two thousand miles from my home in Virginia and knew no one here in Utah. It was a lot to get used to all at once. At times I felt like Ihad landed in a foreign country. I was overwhelmed with all there was to learn and do.<br><br>I didn't know who my roommate would be in the dorms that first year, but I assumed he would be a lifelong member of the Church who could explain to me how things worked around here. The Lord, as He often does, had something else in mind. That first roommate of mine wasn't a member of the Church. In fact, he wasn't from a Christian tradition. He was from Saudi Arabia, and he didn't speak English. He had come to participate in BYU's English as a Second Language program. I may have felt like I was in a foreign land, but he actually was. My challenges seemed trivial; his appeared to be overwhelming. He looked to me to tell him how things worked around here, and I hope he has forgiven me for not always getting it right.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley told of his experience of feeling homesick and discouraged while serving a mission in England and how he wrote home about it. His father's simple reply was "Forget yourself and go to work."<sup>19</sup>I think that's the message my Heavenly Father was trying to send me that first year. Years ago President Hinckley visited this campus and gave that very message to the students. He said:<br><br><i>If the pressures of school are too heavy, if you complain about your housing and the food you eat, I can suggest a cure for your problems. Lay your books aside for a few hours, leave your room, and go visit someone who is old and lonely. There are many such right here in this valley. Or visit those who are sick and discouraged; there are hundreds of that kind here, including not a few on this campus, who need the kind of encouragement you could give.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_forget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a><br><br>I was not left without assistance and encouragement that first year. In fact, I don't have time today to tell you of all the helpers sent my way, but I do want to mention one. Before I left home, my grandmother sat me down to determine if I was really serious about going to BYU. When--to her disappointment--she found out that I was, she said, "You might as well know, then, that your grandfather has a cousin who joined the Latter-day Saints some thirty years ago." She explained the complicated family connection, but it went over my head. She explained that in the course of those thirty years they had only seen this cousin and his wife at a few reunions and that it was her understanding that he now lived in New Mexico. She said that at one of the reunions she had heard that this cousin had a son who worked at BYU. She didn't know the son's name, but she provided me with the cousin's name. I tucked this information away in my mind, thinking that perhaps I would look this person up when I came to BYU.<br><br>That first semester I had registered for my general electives, including Biology 100. In my registration materials, the instructor of that biology class was simply listed as "staff." On the first day of class, the instructor introduced himself as Larry St. Clair. I immediately recognized St. Clair as the last name of that cousin. The thought, of course, occurred to me that I should ask him if he was the son of that cousin. However, as the class progressed that day, Istarted to talk myself out of the idea, thinking that there could be any number of people on campus with that last name and wondering how I would approach the subject since I wasn't exactly sure how we were related. The feeling that I should introduce myself persisted to the point that I felt pushed forward. At the end of class I hung back, waiting for a portion of the class that had surrounded the professor wanting to add his class. If you've ever been in a Biology 100 class, you know that this was a hundred or so people.<br><br>My turn finally came, and I introduced myself, asking him if he was the son of Jack St.Clair. When he confirmed that he was, I introduced myself as his cousin. He asked me a few questions. At this point he could have said, "Nice to meet you. Tell the folks hello," and left it at that. Instead he invited me to dinner that week so I could meet his wife, Rieta, and their children. So I went to dinner and met the St.Clair family. At that point Larry had certainly fulfilled any family obligation he might have had, and, again, he could have left it at that with a clear conscience. However, he was in tune enough to recognize the one within his reach who needed his help. He somehow realized that I was a little homesick, a lot overwhelmed, and with no family support in the Church.<br><br>The St. Clairs invited me to dinner again and again and again. They invited me over for holidays. They invited me to go to activities with them. A few months after that initial meeting Larry St. Clair bestowed upon me the Melchizedek Priesthood and ordained me to the office of an elder. A year later, Larry and Rieta accompanied me to the Salt Lake Temple for my first visit to the temple. A couple of months after that, Larry drove me to the Missionary Training Center to see me off on my mission.<br><br>Jump forward twenty years. I was two thousand miles from home--this time in the opposite direction--on the East Coast at a conference away from my family and home in Utah. I received a phone call from my wife, who was distressed. I could hear our children crying in the background. Our family had suffered a heart-breaking loss. I felt helpless, and I couldn't get home immediately. After we ended our phone call, my wife loaded the children into our van and drove to Larry and Rieta St. Clair's house. The St. Clairs found themselves with a living room full of heart-broken people. Larry took each person, one-by-one, and placed his hands on them and gave them blessings of comfort.<br><br>When we are willing to accept assignments from the Lord, they may only take a moment, but they might also take a month or a year or a lifetime. The important thing is that we are in tune enough to see the one within our reach who needs our help and that we have enough faith to accept the assignment. It won't be convenient. I hope nothing I have said here today has given the impression that I believe "small and simple" means easy, because it doesn't. But I believe these small and simple things will become our most valued university experiences.<br><br>When Mawi Asgedom, an Ethiopian native who had once lived in a Sudanese refugee camp, left for Harvard University, his mother said to him, "Always remember where you came from."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Once he arrived at Harvard he got caught up in the rush of everyday university life, which for him involved clubs, sports, a lot of classes, and a part-time job. He said, "Remembering where I had come from seemed far less important than knowing where I was supposed to be every half hour."<sup>22</sup><br><br>During his sophomore year he worked as a delivery man for the Harvard Student Agency. While waiting for a package in the office, he watched as an elderly and feeble woman walked in. She asked if there was someone there who could type a short letter for her--"such a simple, easy thing to do," Mawi later recalled.<sup>23</sup><br><br>The receptionist explained that they offered no typing services and sent her away. Looking a little confused, the woman started to turn away, but another worker in the office called her over, "gently sat her down," and then typed the letter for her.<sup>24</sup><br><br>Mawi said, "Never has a Harvard student seemed so great to me as in that moment."<sup>25</sup>Mawi began to reflect on what his mother might have meant when she advised him to always remember where he came from. He had been the recipient of many such kindnesses in his long journey from a refugee camp to Harvard University. Many angels had helped him along the way, and he had noticed that "most angels don't look like angels,"<sup>26</sup>so it shouldn't have surprised him as much as perhaps it did to find one looking like an ordinary college student at Harvard. Thinking back on those angels and their kindnesses, he realized that each had taught him something important about life and inspired him to reach out to help those around him. In their small ways they had made a difference in his life.<br><br>Mawi graduated with top honors and gave the commencement address at his graduation in 1999. Reflecting on his time at Harvard, he said in his address he had learned "many facts and formulas, many new ways of thinking, a fresh understanding of the world."<sup>27</sup>But he highlighted that seemingly insignificant act of kindness he had witnessed that day in the Harvard Student Agency as a turning point in his education, when he began to reflect on what is most important in life. He said, "While Harvard University taught me well, my true education has come from less-likely sources."<sup>28</sup><br><br>I pray we will always remember where we came from and that we will follow Christ in reaching out to those around us. Christlike love transforms our simple, everyday living into something extraordinary. It's the love of Christ that makes the difference. We don't need to leave BYU to make a difference in the world. There are people within our reach here who need us. There are assignments waiting for us here--we just need to accept them.<br><br>In the words of David O. McKay:<br><br><i>There is no one great thing which we can do to obtain eternal life, and it seems to me that the great lesson to be learned in the world today is to apply in the little acts and duties of life the glorious principles of the gospel. Let us not think that because some . . . things . . . seem small and trivial that they are unimportant. Life, after all, is made up of little things.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1> More Teachable - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Over the past month our ward has welcomed several newborn babies. Each baby comes to this earth curious and  eager to learn. They want to taste everything, chew everything, and pull on everything. I imagine that from a baby's point of view, everything in this world is new and amazing.<br><br>As we anticipated our exodus from  the spirit world, we placed great trust in the plan of salvation. We trusted Heavenly Father and our Savior. In Their wisdom, They knew that our spirits would initially flourish best in the physical form of a baby. When  our spirits were united with our physical bodies, we became helpless and totally dependent on our caregivers. We forgot our previous knowledge and relationships. It must have been a huge shock to have our spirit and  physical body unite. But we were confident in the plan of salvation--we were confident that this earthly life, including the merging of our spirit and physical body, was a necessary step in our eternal progression.  Confident in our Savior's Atonement, we came to earth knowing that we could return to our heavenly home. Each of us started our life fresh and innocent, and we began to learn the many things we needed to know in order  to function on this earth and continue our eternal progression.<br><br>We are children of our Heavenly Father; each individual who comes to this earth is given an extraordinary capacity for learning and growth. We  have opportunities in this life to learn information that would have been difficult--if not impossible--to learn in the spirit world. For instance, learning to ride a bicycle would be difficult to accomplish if we only  observed others riding their bicycles. Even more difficult would be learning to ride a bicycle if our sole preparation was merely reading books about bicycle riding. Learning by doing is an amazing process. Most of us  scraped our knees and elbows as we repeatedly tried to master cycling--without the training wheels. Most of us were successful. We now ride a bicycle without much thought regarding our initial difficulties, fears, and  injuries. Fortunately, as young children we were not faced with simultaneous challenges that overwhelmed our capacity to learn and progress. For example, on the same day--or week--that we learned to ride a bicycle, we  were not faced with learning to drive a car, pilot an airplane, and fly a rocket to the moon. Typically, as Nephi described in 2 Nephi 28:30, our learning progresses "line upon line, precept upon precept."<br><br>At  Brigham Young University, before we "goforth to serve," we "enter to learn." We read books, listen to lectures, discuss topics, write papers, and take tests. Many of you will complete a practicum or internship in which  you will apply your academic learning to real-life situations. "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain  unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the  advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Because attaining knowledge is such an important task--and a lifelong endeavor--it is important to understand the meaning and implications of being  teachable. When we are teachable, the Holy Ghost bears witness of truth and we increase in knowledge and wisdom.<br><br>In 2 Nephi 28, the prophet Nephi saw our day and warned us about the challenges of living and  learning in these latter days. Even though Nephi offered these words approximately 2,572 years ago, his vision was inspired and crystal clear regarding these perilous times. The chapter synopsis in the Book of Mormon  reads:<br><br><i>Many false churches shall be built up in the last days--They shall teach false and vain and foolish doctrines--Apostasy shall abound because of false teachers--The devil shall rage in the hearts  of men--He</i>[the devil]<i>shall teach all manner of false doctrines.</i><br><br>Likening the scriptures to my personal life, Itook this synopsis and placed responsibility on myself, the learner: In 2012  men and women shall join many false organizations--They shall learn false and foolish doctrines--Apostasy shall abound, and I will be pulled into personal apostasy if I listen to and learn from false teachers--Many will  allow the devil to rage in their hearts--I will not allow the devil to rage in my heart. I will avoid learning all manner of false doctrines from the devil's teachings.<br><br>Although the very existence of false  teachings is troublesome, our eternal progression is blocked when we accommodate and assimilate these false teachings into our beliefs and way of life. The end product is misery. As Alma warned his son Corianton,  "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). In direct opposition to Satan's false teachings, the gospel of Jesus Christ and our obedience to God's commandments help us move forward in our eternal progression (see  Mosiah 2:41). In regard to moving forward, 2 Nephi 28:30 emphasizes the importance of being teachable:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line,  precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will  givemore.</i><br><br>Today I am recommending four strategies to help us become more teachable and to help facilitate our eternal progression: (1) stick to the gospel's fundamental principles; (2) have a  grateful heart; (3) conquer pride by choosing to be humble; and (4) recalibrate and get back ontrack.<br><h2><b>Stick to the Gospel's Fundamental Principles</b></h2><br><b></b>Have you ever studied for an exam without  knowing the exact information that you would be required to know? The exam may have covered several textbooks, and the exam's grade may have factored heavily into your course grade. This uncertainty of not knowing what  to memorize or what to study can cause great anxiety because you do not know which pieces of information are the most important--or which pieces of information the professor thinks are the most  important.<br><br>Sometimes we are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available through the Internet and library resources. There are literally thousands of books available on every imaginable topic. One  important lifelong skill is the ability to prioritize information, focus on the most important pieces, and know how these pieces fit into the bigger picture. During His ministry the Savior boiled down critical  information and summarized key points to help us focus on fundamental principles. His words and actions provide a perfect model for us to follow. He emphasized the importance of obedience, and, in response to a lawyer's  question, He identified the first and greatest commandment:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great  commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew  22:37–40]<br><br>His teachings identified the gospel's fundamental principles--the very most important things we need to know and do.<br><br>In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith and recorded in  section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said, "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 42:29). Obedience is important, and--interestingly--love and obedience are paired  together. This will not change: we are expected to keep the commandments--to show our love for God we must keep His commandments. This principle is important and is reiterated by every prophet. Contrary to Satan's  teachings, being obedient is not restrictive; in fact, obedience keeps us free from spiritual bondage. Obedience allows us to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and keeps our minds open to learning and  feeling the love of our Savior and our Heavenly Father. We must stick to the fundamental principle of being obedient because obedience helps us become more teachable and facilitates our eternal  progression.<br><br>The gospel's fundamental principles--such as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance and turning from sin, obedience to the Ten Commandments, and avoidance of pride--are repeated throughout the  Book of Mormon by the prophet Abinadi, King Benjamin, Alma, and Moroni. In the scriptures several prophets and righteous men closed their earthly lives with a "parting message"--final words of wisdom that clarified the  fundamental principles of the gospel. In the movies, dying individuals also give their parting messages as a nice way to emotionally emphasize critical information and manipulate the audience's emotions, often with  dramatic music to draw some tears. However, the scriptural accounts of parting messages are accompanied by the witness of the Holy Ghost. These messages contain the gospel's fundamental teachings. These teachings are  real, not imaginary, and in no way are these messages intended to manipulate or control the listener.<br><br>Unfortunately, those who were there to hear firsthand the passionate message of a dying prophet may or may  not have benefited--everything depending on<i>if</i>the individual was teachable. Those leaving their final parting messages most often desired that the younger generation and future generations might avoid common  pitfalls and carnal behavior that stunt the ability to learn and halt eternal progression. These righteous men passed the spiritual baton on to the next generation. It is important to note these repeated messages--the  fundamentals--all of which are intended to help us prepare for our eternal exam, often referred to in the scriptures as the final judgment. When reading the scriptures, we must listen carefully and learn fundamental  lessons as if we were sitting at the prophet's knee, witnessing his final urgent message. These parting messages place an emphasis on fundamentals that are repeated by our modern-day prophets.<br><br>Listen to,  learn, and stick to the gospel's fundamental principles.<br><h2><b>Have a Grateful Heart</b></h2><br><b></b>The Lord loves a grateful heart. In November 2000 President Gordon B. Hinckley urged the youth to "be grateful"--the  first of six Bs he counseled the youth to follow. He urged them to walk with gratitude in their hearts and to express gratitude to their parents, friends, and teachers. He also counseled the youth to "thank the Lord for  His goodness to you" ("First Presidency Message: A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer for Youth,"<i>Ensign</i>, January 2001, 4). This inspired advice applies to individuals of all ages, including university students, staff,  and faculty.<br><br>A grateful heart is an important ingredient in becoming more teachable. When I came to BYU in 1999, I was awestruck by the incredible beauty of the mountains, particularly Mount Timpanogos and the  way morning's light struck the edges and angles of the rocky cliffs. Each day as I drove to campus I breathed in a deep, satisfied breath and said a prayer of gratitude for the beauty of these mountains. One day I said  to myself, "I will say a prayer of gratitude each day as I soak in the earth's beauty." Several months later I became preoccupied with my to-do list and my responsibilities. As I hurriedly pulled into BYU's parking lot  one day and gathered my things, I had a moment of clarity: It had been several days since I had even noticed the mountains, let alone said my prayer of gratitude for the beauty of those mountains. I had developed a  spiritual callus. The mountains were still there, but, sadly, and to my detriment, other things clouded my attention. I resolved to daily take time to enjoy the beauty around me and to express my gratitude to Heavenly  Father. Feelings of gratitude soften our hearts and open our minds to learning.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith spoke frequently of the importance of expressing gratitude to the Lord. Though facing challenging  situations, persecution, and the task of carrying the responsibility of opening this dispensation, Joseph Smith was inspired to share these words:<br><br><i>And ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for  whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:32]<br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an  hundred fold, yea, more.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:19]<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks.</i>[D&amp;amp;C  98:1]<br><br>In his recent April general conference address titled "Thanks Be to God," Elder Russell M. Nelson commented, "How much better it would be if all could be more aware of God's providence and love  and express that gratitude to Him. . . . Our degree of gratitude is a measure of our love for Him." He also quoted Ammon's teaching from Alma 26:8: "Let us give thanks to [God], for he doth work righteousness forever"  (<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012,<i></i>77).<br><br>Choosing to have a grateful heart is an important strategy in becoming more teachable because it prepares our hearts to be humble and open to the promptings of the  Spirit.<br><h2><b>Conquer Pride by Choosing to Be Humble</b></h2><br><b></b>In his November 2000 address President Hinckley also urged the youth to "be humble"--the fifth of the six Bs. He identified the meek and the humble as  "those who are teachable" ("Prophet's Counsel," 10). In Doctrine and Covenants 112:10, the Lord counseled Thomas B. Marsh to "be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy  prayers."<br><br>When we are humble, we are ready to listen to and follow the Lord's direction. In the April 1989 general conference, President Ezra Taft Benson spoke on a topic that remains especially relevant to  me: pride. He described pride as "the great stumbling block to Zion" ("Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 7). Pride makes us deaf to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Pride takes a heavy toll on our earthly life  and on our eternal life. When we allow pride to enter into our lives, we will not and cannot learn the most important things in this life nor in the eternities. We become hard-hearted, stiffnecked, and spiritually  blinded. President Benson observed that for those who are infected with pride, "the world shouts louder than the whisperings of the Holy Ghost" ("Beware of Pride," 5).<br><br>President Benson identified the core  ingredient of pride as enmity, which starts with competitive feelings and a desire to be better than others. Then come feelings of being offended, then contentiousness, and ultimately an intense hatred toward God and  mankind. The opposite of humility, enmity is the alluring and controlling power Satan uses. Rather than the Savior's "thy will be done, and the glory be thine," Satan's statement is "my will be done and the glory be  mine." It is a battle of the wills (see "Beware of Pride," 4–5).<br><br>What characteristics of pride impede learning? For the prideful, the purpose of life narrows down to an obsession with being better than others.  One's focus becomes warped, dark, and evil. Pride destroys unity and oneness. It destroys us and those around us. Pride keeps us from confessing our sins; it keeps us from forsaking our sins. Pride literally diverts and  squelches the physical and spiritual ability to learn. Pride leads to rebellion, hate, contentiousness, unrighteous dominion, and abusive control of others. Sadly, the prideful are easily offended, they are unforgiving,  and they will not take correction and feedback. In other words, their learning and all interpersonal relationships in this life are stunted. Even more tragic is the poor eternal prognosis for those who succumb to  pride.<br><br>Although pride is potentially a terminal condition, there is an antidote: humility. Choose to be humble. When we are humble we are teachable, opening our minds and hearts to spiritual learning. In  Mosiah 3:19 King Benjamin stated:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and  putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth  fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i><br><br>On a personal note, to help me avoid flattery and deception and the end result of sliding down the slippery slope of pride, I have  created a realistic and disturbing image: Although flattery feeds our ego, it is nothing more than a lure snatched by a starving rat now writhing on a cheese-less trap. So avoid the cheese! Once the trap snaps shut, it  is very hard to escape. In becoming teachable, we must conquer pride by choosing to be humble.<br><h2><b>Recalibrate and Get Back on Track</b></h2><br><b></b>As we recognize we are off the path and are headed in the wrong  direction, we must recalibrate and head back in the right direction. On a recent trip to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, before I left the airport in a rental car, I plugged in my GPS and proceeded to type in my  destination. I left the rental-car lot and listened carefully for directions.<br><br>"Turn left and proceed 500 feet." I carefully followed those directions. About four turns into the trip, the GPS told me to turn  left. But on my left was a barrier blockading a closed road. Luckily it was around 11:00 p.m. and no other traffic was on the road. As I started to panic, the GPS clearly stated, "Merge onto I-15 and head north,  traveling toward Salt Lake City." Now I was totally flustered. For some reason my GPS thought I was in Utah! Ipulled off the road, turned off the GPS, waited a few seconds, restarted the GPS, and retyped the Texas  address. Within a few seconds the correct set of directions was displayed, and I was guided to the intended destination--my targeted goal.<br><br>From a spiritual sense, when we realize we are going in the wrong  direction, we must stop and get back on the right track--and the sooner the better. From personal experience, I know that the best way to get back on track and keep on track is to stick to those things that I know are  right and true. For me this includes daily scripture reading, personal prayer, and attending sacrament meeting. Is this basic and simple? Yes, it is. However, when I fall short in doing those three things, my learning  is stunted, because I lose calibration and start to head off in the wrong direction.<br><br>A few years ago I attended groups sponsored by the LDS twelve-step addiction recovery program. I attended with a dear  friend, and we supported each other. These groups are held every day of the week at various locations throughout the Wasatch Front. Recovering from addiction is a lifelong challenge.<br><br>My friend and I learned  practical lessons from group members. I learned that successful days of sobriety are never lost. When you slip and fall back into old patterns of addiction, it is critical that you immediately get back on track, repent  by following the necessary steps, and move forward to add another day of sobriety to your "new history." You do not lose any of your days of sobriety. Instead, you keep those previous days of sobriety and simply add  your new days to the tally. I appreciated the fact that you keep making "new history"--what a positive way to think about getting back on track and staying on track.<br><br>Contrary to Satan's voice, which tells us  that things are hopeless, that we are worthless, and that we are forever lost, our Savior wants all of us to repent as quickly as possible, get back on track, and come unto Him.<br><h2><b>Closing</b></h2><br>It is my  prayer that we strive to become more teachable by knowing and living the gospel's fundamental principles, having a grateful heart, conquering pride by choosing to be humble, and recalibrating and getting back on track.  Living these strategies takes courage and honesty, a willingness to submit to the Lord's eternal truths, and a trust in God--that He knows each of us personally and wants us to become more teachable. He wants us to be  teachable so that we can learn of Him, make changes to be like Him, and return to Him.<br><br>The Holy Ghost bears witness of truth. Listen for that witness. If we are teachable, we will feel and hear that spiritual  witness. I bear testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, our Perfect Example, in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Melissa Heath was a BYU associate  professor of counseling psychology and special education when this devotional was given on 29 May 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>leness of the Way - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am definitely humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today. As you can imagine, I have lost a lot of sleep over this responsibility, and I'm guessing that when I am done you will probably say, "He should have slept!"<br><br>To begin with, I feel it is important to explain that for most of my life I grew up without a father's influence in the home, so I turned to the leaders of the Church for guidance. I have read over and over the talks given by the General Authorities and other leaders at general conference and other occasions. Their counsel and instruction have guided me throughout my life as a father would, so I will be using many of their quotes today.<br><br>Years ago, when I was a young father, I went downstairs one day to our oldest son's bedroom. He was very upset and had been crying. I was there to try to comfort him and find out what was wrong. As he and I talked, he confessed that he had told a fib to his mother. He said, "Dad, it's so hard to be righteous." This caused me to turn my head and smile, because he was young, but then he continued to say, "Dad, life is like climbing over a wall, isn't it?" For a moment I was completely stunned. How could he have such insight?<br><br>We continued to talk, but the rest of the conversation is a blur. I hope my part of that conversation included teaching him how the Savior made it possible for him to repent of the fib he had told his mother and any other mistakes he had made. I also hope I taught him how very important it is to listen to and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost each day of his life.<br><br>In March 1979 President Marion G. Romney, then second counselor in the First Presidency, gave a BYU devotional titled "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/marion-g-romney_guidance-holy-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance of the Holy Spirit</a>." He stated:<br><br><i>As conditions worsen, it becomes more apparent every day that we are on a collision course with disaster. I am persuaded that nothing short of the guidance of the Holy Spirit can bring us through safely.</i><br><br>He then explained some profound truths. "If you want to obtain and keep the guidance of the Spirit, you can do so by following this simple four-point program":<br><br>1. Pray<br><br>2. Study and learn the gospel<br><br>3. Live righteously<br><br>4. Give service in the Church<br><br>President Romney continued: "If you will do these things, you will get the guidance of the Holy Spirit and you will go through this world successfully, regardless of what the people of the world say or do."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/marion-g-romney_guidance-holy-spirit/"><sup>1</sup></a>What a wonderful promise that is!<br><br>As I read these words, I recall King Benjamin's address to the Nephites and their subsequent conversion:<br><br><i>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i>[Mosiah 5:2]<br><br>Before we continue, I must share a favorite quote by President Ezra Taft Benson, given here at a <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson_jesus-christ-gifts-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYU devotional</a>. President Howard W. Hunter felt it was so important that he later included it in a general conference talk. President Benson said:<br><br><i>That man is greatest and most blessed and joyful whose life most closely fits the pattern of the Christ. This has nothing to do with earthly wealth, power, or prestige. The only true test of greatness, blessedness, joyfulness is how close a life can come to being like the Master, Jesus Christ. He is the right way, the full truth, and the abundant life.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson_jesus-christ-gifts-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a><br><br>It is because of Jesus Christ and through the Holy Ghost that we can change, that we can change completely, and that we can stay changed. We do not need to be a part of this world that is on a collision course with disaster. The key is to obtain and keep the Spirit of the Lord with us continually.<br><h2><b>"That's Too Simple"</b></h2><br>While working on my doctoral degree in 1984, I took a course in education. One day my professor broke from the lecture and asked the class how one obtains the Spirit of the Lord in his own life. Many members of the class made comments, and finally I shared what President Romney had stated in 1979. I recited the four-point program for obtaining the Spirit. When I had finished, the professor leaned against the chalkboard, looked down at the ground, and said, "No, that's too simple--that's too simple."<br><br>I have reflected on his comment over and over again, and I keep thinking about the story of Moses in the wilderness when he raised the brazen serpent. The rebellious Israelites had been bitten by serpents, and the Lord told Moses to fashion a fiery serpent out of brass and place it upon a pole. All who would look upon the serpent would live. (See Numbers 21:6–9.)<br><br>The Book of Mormon carries on the narrative and explains what happened:<br><br><i>He sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.</i>[1 Nephi 17:41]<br><br>There you have it--it was too simple, therefore many perished. Remember, President Romney too spoke of the simpleness of the way when he said, "If you want to obtain and keep the guidance of the Spirit, you can do so by following this<i>simple</i>four-point program" (emphasis added).<br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>The first point is to pray. Even though the idea is simple, the process requires our whole being. President Henry B. Eyring once stated:<br><br>[The Lord]<i>offers us the covenant to always remember Him and the warning to pray always so that we will place our reliance on Him, our only safety. It is not hard to know what to do. The very difficulty of remembering</i>always<i>and praying</i>always<i>is a needed spur to</i>try harder.<i>The danger lies in delay or drift.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_always/"><sup>3</sup></a><br><br>Remember, it is not difficult to know what to do; the difficulty lies in actually doing it.<br><br>Years ago Elder Gene R. Cook of the Seventy presided at our stake conference when I was stake president. In the Saturday adult session, he challenged everyone to prayerfully select someone who would not normally attend stake conference and invite them to come to stake conference the following day. He then asked for a raise of hands as a commitment and counseled the congregation to pray themselves through the experience. Then he said something I will always remember: "We should learn to pray ourselves through each day." This has had a lasting impact on me.<br><br>Elder Cook also turned to me and asked me to prayerfully select someone whom I could bring to stake conference the following day. I would like to share that experience, with permission from the individual involved. As you can imagine, I immediately started to pray myself through that experience. During the process, the name of one of our neighbors came into my mind. She had been through some challenges, so I thought this would be a good time to challenge her. Elder Cook and I walked across the street, and I asked her if we could visit.<br><br>"President," she said, "do you know how many people have already been here?"<br><br>"No," I replied.<br><br>"Five!" she said, holding up her hand with outstretched fingers.<br><br>I remember thinking, "Well, so much for my inspiration!"<br><br>Elder Cook didn't miss a beat. He grabbed me by the arm, pulled me in close, and said, "Ask her if we can talk to her." I did, and she invited us downstairs.<br><br>As we descended the stairs, Elder Cook turned to me and asked, "Are you praying yourself through this?"<br><br>I thought to myself, "What do you think?"<br><br>When we were settled on the couch, he started to talk to her, looking her in the eye. He asked her what her maiden name was, and she told him. He then said, calling her by name, "I know your parents really well. Are you from ...?" and he named the location.<br><br>"Yes," she said.<br><br>"I know your dad. He's a stake president."<br><br>"Yes," she said.<br><br>Elder Cook then proceeded to chasten her firmly, calling her by name again and saying, "You know better."<br><br>Tears flowed, and soon commitments followed. At the beginning of that experience I thought I had made a mistake, but the Spirit had guided us there, and by praying through that experience, doors and hearts were opened.<br><br>Amulek stated the idea of continual prayer this way: "Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you" (Alma 34:27).<br><br>The Savior said, "Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat" (3 Nephi 18:18).<br><br>Recently our youngest daughter was sealed to a fine young man in the temple, and at that time they were admonished to pray next to each other, with their arms and hands intertwined. "Begin and end your day," the temple sealer said, "by giving thanks for another day together." As many of you are at this same stage in life, how important it is to pray for the Spirit of the Lord to protect and guide your little kingdom.<br><br>Prayer should be an important part of each and every day. Elder David A. Bednar has said:<br><br><i>Meaningful morning prayer is an important element in the spiritual creation of each day--and precedes the temporal creation or the actual execution of the day. Just as the temporal creation was linked to and a continuation of the spiritual creation</i>[see Moses 3:4–5],<i>so meaningful morning and evening prayers are linked to and are a continuation of each other.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/pray-always?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>Let me tell you, brothers and sisters, that my morning prayers have changed because of this counsel, and it has had quite an effect upon me.<br><br>Years ago President Spencer W. Kimball stated: "Prayer is such a privilege--to speak to our Father in Heaven. It was a prayer, a very special prayer, which opened this whole dispensation! It began with a young man's first vocal prayer."<br><br>Then he said this: "I hope that not too many of our prayers are silent, even though when we cannot pray vocally, it is good to offer a silent prayer in our hearts and in our minds."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/10/we-need-a-listening-ear?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>5</sup></a><br><br>This little bit of advice really has helped me to commune with our Father in Heaven. It has enabled me to concentrate better and speak "with" instead of "to" our Father in Heaven (see 1 Nephi 3:1). In the same message, President Kimball also suggested that we "do some intense listening"<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/10/we-need-a-listening-ear?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>6</sup></a>at the end of our prayers.<br><h2><b>Study and Learn the Gospel</b></h2><br>The second point in this formula is to study and learn the gospel. As our young family was growing up, like many of your families we would have scripture study early in the morning, and that usually meant our children were not very alert. We sometimes wondered if anyone was listening, let alone learning. My wife and I felt a little relieved when Elder Bednar shared the following statement in general conference about his family:<br><br><i>If you could ask our adult sons what they remember about family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening, I believe I know how they would answer. They likely would not identify a particular prayer or a specific instance of scripture study or an especially meaningful family home evening lesson as the defining moment in their spiritual development. What they would say they remember is that as a family we were consistent.</i><br><br><i>Sister Bednar and I thought helping our sons understand the content of a particular lesson or a specific scripture was the ultimate outcome. But such a result does not occur each time we study or pray or learn together. The consistency of our intent and work was perhaps the greatest lesson--a lesson we did not fully appreciate at the time.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a><br><br>One day our second son came home from his early years in seminary and gave me a drawing of the plan of salvation. It was well done. He had drawn the premortal existence, mortality, and life beyond the grave, including the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms. It was all there. He even had drawn himself holding hands with the Redeemer in the celestial kingdom.<br><br>I then asked him how he knew the plan so well, and he said, "I don't know, Dad, but I won a candy bar!" He then said he was the only student in the class who could do it. Hopefully he had learned it in family scripture study or in family home evening, even though we weren't sure they were learning anything at the time.<br><br>President Benson once said:<br><br><i>When</i>individual members<i>and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, ... other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/04/the-power-of-the-word?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>I know this promise is real, and I testify that it works.<br><br>Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 4:16 that the "outward man [perisheth], yet the inward man is renewed day by day." I love that scripture.<br><br>Elder Jay E. Jensen and I were once traveling together when he shared that scripture with me. He said, "That is of late my favorite scripture." I think it has become one of mine. How important it is to renew ourselves day by day. My experience has been that personal scripture study is a powerful way to renew ourselves day by day. I would encourage you not to miss a day.<br><br>Bishop Keith B. McMullin once shared something in our stake conference that I've not forgotten. He said, "You read your scriptures every day, and some days there just isn't time. Simply open the scriptures on those days and read a verse--you can do that. Just read a verse. That way you'll keep the scriptural habit going." I bear witness to that.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer once stated, "When you feel weak, discouraged, depressed, or afraid, open the Book of Mormon and read. Do not let too much time pass before reading a verse, a thought, or a chapter."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-book-of-mormon-another-testament-of-jesus-christ-plain-and-precious-things?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a><br><br>Brothers and sisters, make yourselves familiar with the scriptures; apply them to your own lives. They should feel as comfortable in your hands as a well-worn pair of tennis shoes does on your feet. I feel it a real blessing in my life to be able to teach from the scriptures at this university. I know without a doubt they are true. There is power in the scriptures, and they will help us feel the guidance of the Spirit in our lives on a daily basis--of that I am sure.<br><h2><b>Live Righteously</b></h2><br>How can we live righteously? President Romney answered, "Repent of your sins by confessing them and forsaking them."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/marion-g-romney_guidance-holy-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a>Living righteously, it seems to me, really could be summarized in one word:<i>repent!</i><br><br>Nephi taught his posterity that we are saved by grace "after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). What is all we can do?<i></i>The king of the Anti-Nephi-Lehis gave us some insight in a sermon he delivered to his people:<br><br><i>And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins ... which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was</i>all we could do to repent sufficiently<i>before God that he would take away our stain.</i>[Alma 24:11; emphasis added]<br><br>Repenting really is all that we can do.<br><br>President Eyring gave a devotional talk here at Brigham Young University that had a powerful effect on me. He told of a young man who needed to repent and had come to him when President Eyring was a bishop. After a lengthy time, Bishop Eyring interviewed him and found him worthy to hold a temple recommend. But the young man was going to be married in the temple to a young lady who was sweet and clean, and he needed to know if his sins had been remitted--if he had forgiveness from the Lord. How could he get that revelation?<br><br>Bishop Eyring said it was a good question and that he needed some time, so the young man gave him a deadline--less than two weeks.<br><br>During those two weeks Bishop Eyring went to a social function that then Elder Spencer W. Kimball also attended. Elder Kimball found Bishop Eyring and said, "Hal, I understand that you are now a bishop. Do you have anything you would like to ask me?"<br><br>President Eyring continued:<br><br><i>I said that I did, but I didn't think that was the place to talk about it. He thought it was. It was an outdoor party. My memory is that we went behind a shrub and there had our interview. Without breaking confidences ..., I outlined the concerns and the question of this young man. ... Then I asked Elder Kimball, "How can he get that revelation? How can he know whether his sins are remitted?"</i><br><br><i>I thought Elder Kimball would talk to me about fasting or prayer or listening for the still small voice. But he surprised me. Instead he said, "Tell me something about the young man."</i><br><br><i>I said, "What would you like to know?"</i><br><br><i>And then he began a series of the most simple questions. Some of the ones I remember were:</i><br><br><i>"Does he come to his priesthood meetings?"</i><br><br><i>I said, after a moment of thought, "Yes."</i><br><br><i>"Does he come early?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes."</i><br><br><i>"Does he sit down front?"</i><br><br><i>I thought for a moment and then realized, to my amazement, that he did.</i><br><br><i>"Does he home teach?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes."</i><br><br><i>"Does he go early in the month?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes, he does."</i><br><br><i>"Does he go more than once?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes."</i><br><br><i>I can't remember the other questions. But they were all like that--little things,</i>simple<i>acts of obedience, of submission. And for each question I was surprised that my answer was always yes. Yes, he wasn't just at all his meetings: he was early; he was smiling; he was there not only with his whole heart, but with the broken heart of a little child, as he was every time the Lord asked anything of him. And after I had said yes to each of his questions, Elder Kimball looked at me, paused, and then very quietly said, "There is your revelation."</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_come-unto-christ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>This is repentance: the mighty change of heart. Again, what is all that we can do? It is to repent, as this young man did, not only with our whole hearts but also with a broken heart and a contrite spirit (see 3 Nephi 9:20). The scriptures remind us of the Savior's words:<br><br><i>Repent, and I will receive you....</i><br><br><i>... Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;</i><br><br><i>Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness.</i>[Alma 5:33–35]<br><br>By repenting we are living lives of righteousness and allowing the Spirit to help us change.<br><h2><b>Service in the Church</b></h2><br>The fourth point in obtaining the Spirit is service in the Church. The question is, does service bring forth the Spirit or does the Spirit cause one to serve? The answer is yes!<br><br>One day in my office at seminary I was speaking with a student when I started to go numb down one side of my body and then the other. For some time I was in a semiconscious state. When I finally regained full consciousness, one of the aftereffects was persistent headaches that nothing seemed to help. I was the bishop of our ward at the time, and the headaches were so intense that I decided to sit down and have a talk with my stake president, William A. Cox.<br><br>I explained to him that I was experiencing extreme headaches, and even though I did not ask to be released, he knew why I was there. Finally he leaned over the desk and said, "I'm not going to release you, Bishop." He then continued, "A loaded train doesn't jump the track."<br><br>Well, that certainly made no sense to me! Fortunately, President Cox explained what he meant. He had long worked at Geneva Steel, controlling the trains that transported the steel. He said that when a train is loaded down with freight, it will not jump the track. Only when the boxcars are empty is the train liable to leave the track. He then reinforced his statement that he would not release me. I did not fully understand the principle until later. As I went to Church to conduct interviews--still with headaches--I found myself so involved in the work that I soon didn't even notice them. It wasn't long before they lessened in intensity, and I have now all but forgotten about them.<br><br>The principle in this for me is that serving others brings the Spirit into our lives and helps us to remain on the straight and narrow way, especially during times of challenge and stress.<br><br>Moroni lived during some very challenging times, and Mormon gave him some advice that is helpful for all of us to remember. Let us consider this scripture and how it applies in our lives. Mormon said:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.</i>[Moroni 9:6]<br><br>Note that his advice was much like President Cox's advice: No matter how difficult it gets, just keep working and serving. Why? The blessings will come!<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Well, there you have it--four ways to obtain and keep the Spirit in our lives: prayer, gospel study, living righteously, and giving service.<br><br>So are we on a collision course with disaster? Yes.<br><br>Must we live in fear? No.<br><br>Jesus told us, "Be not afraid, only believe" (Mark 5:36) and "see that ye be not troubled" (Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:23). As a watchman on the tower, President Romney told us that if we have the Spirit of the Lord, we can go through this world successfully, regardless of what the people of the world say or do. That is quite a promise, and it is true.<br><br>We can learn a lesson from the Israelites in the wilderness. If a prophet of God tells us we can look upon the brazen serpent and be healed, then we can look upon the brazen serpent and be healed. If an apostle of God tells us we can obtain and keep the Spirit of the Lord by following four simple points, then we should believe it! Remember, Alma taught his son Helaman that "by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know these principles are true. I am so grateful that I have had the opportunity to share them with you, and I leave this testimony with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stanley A. Johnson was a BYU professor of ancient scripture when this devotional was given on 5 June 2012.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Marion G.

<h1>oachable Master - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I came to BYU after a career in advertising, and now I'm enjoying my thirteenth year in a "career crescendo." I don't know what that means to those in music, but I've enjoyed every minute of those thirteen years so far.<br><br>The field of sports is a wonderful place to find metaphors and analogies for life, and I would like to begin with one this morning: the phrase "leaving it all on the field," which is to say that one gives everything out there on the playing field, the court, or the stage, holding nothing back. There are times in our lives when this analogy makes particular sense. For example, when serving a mission you would want to make sure that you came home with no regrets, that you "left it all" in your field of labor. There is something awfully satisfying about giving 100 percent, whatever the assignment.<br><br>But what if your pre-earth assignment was to come to the playing field of mortality, where there would be forces of opposition trying to keep you from leaving it all on the field? Such is certainly the case with earth life. But how do we then give our all? What can we do to ensure that we leave this life with the fewest possible regrets? For the next few minutes I will discuss one sure way, and that is to come under the influence of the Master--the one perfect example of someone who indeed left it all on this very playing field.<br><br>And so I have titled my remarks this morning "The Approachable Master: Life's Critical Relationship." Let me begin by putting a series of related questions to all of us:<br><br>Why is it that we do not befriend with greater intensity our Savior, "The Master of ocean and earth and skies,"<sup>1</sup>at a level that truly affects--perhaps even drives--our own personal behavior?<br><br>Said another way, why do we not capitalize on the Spirit of Christ within all of us to more completely comprehend the Master's purpose and the will of the only name under heaven by which we may gain life eternal?<sup>2</sup><br><br>Lastly, why do we not accept more openly the Savior's simple invitation to "come unto me?"<br><br>In much the same way President Ezra Taft Benson approached our tendency as a people to undervalue the positive effects of studying the Book of Mormon,<sup>3</sup>may I be bold enough this morning to suggest that the same condition may well apply for us as we come to know the Savior. There is so much more to gain by developing a truly interactive relationship with the Master. To use His own parable, could it be that we are the travelers on the highway and that the master has bid us to his wedding feast? Why would we not come?<sup>4</sup><br><br>We can learn of the Master, even love Him for all He has accomplished on our behalf, and yet still position ourselves beyond our own ability to receive many additional and ennobling blessings. It would be like joining a sports team but not going to practice, not benefiting from the coach's experience, and never actually taking the field.<br><br>Listen to the Savior's own injunction:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>And in our day, the clarion call from the Brethren is an echo from the corridors of time: "Come unto Christ." The reason this call never goes away is because once we are fully engaged with the Master, we become like the people of King Benjamin. After his landmark speech to his people, King Benjamin sent among them, desiring to know if they believed his message and if it had actually made a difference in their lives. Their unified response is an example to all of us:<br><br><i>Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>As professed Christians and practicing Latter-day Saints, we embrace the doctrines set forth in the fourth article of faith: the first principle of the gospel is "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," something that precedes all else. But, sadly, we sometimes become little more than "Facebook friends" with our Lord and Master, clicking our "like" button on Sunday and then only "visiting His page" when we have a special need or when prompted by another Sunday's arrival.<br><br>As we exhibit this symbolic behavior, it is possible for us to become our own version of what the apostle Paul described in his discourse on charity "as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."<sup>7</sup>Perhaps we could change a word or two and make the phrase a more inner-facing interrogative: Have<i>I</i>become as asounding brass or a tinkling cymbal?<br><br>So again, why is it that we move closer to the Savior on occasion, then drift away, then move closer, then drift away in an undulating kind of relationship, not unlike the movement of the tides?<br><br>Let me share some possible reasons why we might stray from a member of the Godhead who is most anxious to befriend us and most ready to receive us, regardless of our present circumstances.<br><br>An obvious place to begin is the sometimes subtle but nevertheless diabolically decreed role of the devil and his everlasting commitment to distance us from the influence of the Master. The devil will do all in his power to keep us from developing a strong personal bond with the Master that would strengthen us and guide us safely through the many vicissitudes of life. And let us remember, the further we are from the influence of the Master, the closer we are to the influence of our most formidable foe.<br><br>The adversary knows that if he can make us feel alone, even when we aren't, we become much more vulnerable to his very careful, very strategic advances. Here are two of the many strategies he uses to keep us from the Master:<br><br><b>1. He convinces us that we are unworthy--even through prayer--to enter the presence of the Master.</b>He does this using the tactics of guilt, shame, or embarrassment, knowing that we "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."<sup>8</sup>Satan reminds us that the Master is perfect and we are not, thus increasing the distance between us and the Savior.<br><br><b>2. He makes us believe that we can do all things on our own,</b>that we have no need for the Savior's help, just as a small child who responds to parental guidance by saying, "I can do it myself." This is commonly known in LDS parlance as "the pride cycle"--and it's not a good place for us to find ourselves as adults.<br><br>Some years ago, while serving with the missionaries in the Arizona Tucson Mission, I created a series of what my bride, Betty Jo, likes to call "doctrinal diagrams." The first diagram deals with what I have termed the Drift Phenomenon, where we drift closer and then farther apart from the Lord.<br><br>Say you receive a new calling in the Church and are totally overwhelmed. You need the influence of the Master in order to execute your calling. He, of course, responds with the appropriate inspiration, but, as time goes along, you get more comfortable with the calling and your ability to perform it. What may inadvertently happen is that you begin to drift away from the need for constant inspiration and toward a reliance on your own abilities. The theoretical danger zone is when we begin to depend more on ourselves and less on the Spirit. And now, for just a moment, ponder where you might place yourself on these lines in relation to your present Church assignment.<br><br>Not that you would ever plan on, or even notice, this shift happening; it just seems to be a part of what King Benjamin might have called "the natural man syndrome"<sup>9</sup>--that tendency to drift away from the Master and His influence when we are not in personal-crisis mode. Once again we become that proverbial three-year-old, saying, or perhaps indignantly shouting, "I can do it myself." We are exactly where the adversary would like us to be--out there on our own.<br><br>On the other hand, if we "lean not unto [our] own understanding"<sup>10</sup>or on "the arm of flesh,"<sup>11</sup>and as we stay close to the Master's influence, it is easy to see a dramatic difference. We might call this the Non-Drift Phenomenon or the Magnifying-Your-Calling Phenomenon, where we stay close to the Lord. Imagine the power that can come as you become increasingly proficient in your calling while enjoying an ever-increasing degree of spiritual influence from the Master. To borrow a word from a famous MasterCard advertising campaign, this power is "priceless"--suggesting a value difference between things we can buy (the temporal) and things we cannot buy (the spiritual).<br><br>Speaking of temporal things, consider the time and energy we spend at this and perhaps other institutions preparing for and advancing our careers. Let us remember that--unless I miss my guess--our careers will not rise with us in the Resurrection. Certainly I will be unemployed, since I doubt the existence of or need for billboards, TV sets, YouTube, the Internet, or i-anything on the other side of the veil. I trust that even our two surgeon sons may have to look elsewhere for employment.<br><br>A very long time ago, as an undergraduate student at BYU, I memorized this quote from Harvard philosopher James Allen that points out the danger of "going it alone":<br><br><i>Man is the causer (though nearly always unconsciously) of his</i>[own]<i>circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Making critical life decisions without the aid of the Master's direct spiritual influence is like embarking on a long sea voyage in a craft without a rudder, a helm, or perhaps even a mast.<br><br>Here are three more strategies to add to our list of ways in which the adversary keeps us from developing a broader, deeper, and more critical relationship with our Master:<br><br><b>3. He creates doubt about our own self-worth and our God-given abilities.</b><br><br><b>4. He gives us a feeling of entitlement.</b>Since we are all children of God, we are, somehow--amazingly--due a divine inheritance. Someone with the attitude of entitlement says, "It's never my fault. Surely the blame for my inability to perform to expectations must lie with another. Besides, isn't the Savior supposed to be my all-time safety net?"<br><br><b>5. He helps us develop our powers of procrastination</b>(not that we need help here). After all, there is always and forever tomorrow, right? What could possibly be the rush?<br><br>My guess is that at one time or another we have all felt these negative tuggings or feelings in our lives, and we have, to some extent, bought into some of the mortal foibles and frailties with which the adversary is so awfully familiar.<br><br>Let me now share a very personal experience from years ago that may serve to illustrate this point. I was set apart as a stake president by two General Authorities, and during the blessing, certain--as I viewed them--promises were mentioned, one of which related to the success of a new business venture I had just undertaken. But things did not go well business-wise. Unbeknownst to me, I had started an advertising agency on the cusp of a serious recession. After weeks of unease, early one morning, with many unanswered questions in my heart, a terrible uncertainty and a feeling of being alone washed over me like a waterfall of doubt. Although going into business for myself seemed like an inspired decision at the time, I had begun to second-guess the rightness of my choice, and Ieven wondered about the inspired words that had been uttered in that blessing just a few months earlier.<br><br>Fortunately I followed a common pattern and went to the scriptures and to the Lord, anxiously looking for answers--<i>any</i>answer that would mitigate my vexed state of mind. I was pondering the words in Matthew 28 about the risen Lord, specifically what the angel said to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary who were in search of the Master, searching just as I was on that morning and perhaps as you may be searching today: "He is not here: for he is risen, as he said."<sup>13</sup><br><br>The details of what followed are not important here, except to say that in my scriptures there is written in the margin a little note that says, "Special experience." The Lord blessed me that day with a powerful witness of the reality of the Savior as my personal advocate with the Father, as the Creator of heaven and earth, and as the would-be Friend of all mankind. Today I testify that He lives and that He wants nothing more than to help us perform well on this playing field of life.<br><br>Yes, the business survived the recession and, happily, all the words spoken in my blessing were fulfilled. More important, I learned something about the definition of the phrase "in the Lord's own way."<br><br>Let's look more closely into the self-doubt scenario we sometimes find ourselves in--that space between our gospel goals and our actual behavior against those goals. There is an interesting space between where we may be performing now and where we'd like to be. Let's just call it the "mortal shortfall gap." This is where many of us get into trouble, allowing self-doubt to creep in and create a series of performance stress risers and debilitative, non-productive thinking. If we are not careful, we succumb to another "flaxen cord"<sup>14</sup>and start to envision the gap widening to the point that we begin to lose faith. Once again we end up exactly where the adversary wants us: solitary and doubtful of our own abilities.<br><br>But lest we find this gap troubling, there is good news: the Master also knows full well the challenges of mortality. And, fortunately, He has both the ability and the predisposition to fill that mortal shortfall gap.<br><br>When we fully accept Christ as our personal Savior, Advocate, and Redeemer, the gap fills so completely with hope and understanding and promise that the mortal shortfall gap becomes narrower and narrower until that eventual "perfect day."<sup>15</sup>Actually, the diminishing effect of our shortfall is the emancipating and empowering effect of the Savior's Atonement. For our part, a change in attitude or a mighty change of heart<sup>16</sup>to close that gap helps our performance considerably.<br><br>Listen to what the ancient and articulate prophet Alma had to say concerning the Atonement:<br><br><i>And he will take upon him</i>[our]<i>infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>And in our day the Savior has spoken to us in the Doctrine and Covenants with these reassuring words: "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent."<sup>18</sup><br><br>For a moment now, let's revisit that potentially devastating alone feeling, a feeling I suppose has come over all of us at one time or another, whether we were physically isolated or perhaps within in a supportive group but still very much alone in our thoughts. This feeling of abject loneliness is another key tactic used by the adversary to create distance between us and our Savior.<br><br>Satan would have us believe that no one--not even the Master--can reach us and relate to us on a personal level and feel exactly how we feel in our terribly unique circumstances. But the Master knows, and He feels your<i>precise</i>pain and anguish, regardless of its source and intensity. The Savior has vicariously suffered your<i>exact same suffering.</i>Paul's marvelous discourse on this subject in Hebrews offers "grace to help in [our] time of need."<sup>19</sup>The last few verses from Hebrews have brought peace and solace to my soul over the years when I have felt particularly alone in this world, even though surrounded by friends:<br><br><i>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</i><br><br><i>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br><i>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</i><br><br><i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>I love that invitation: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." Speaking of grace, I for one believe that when it comes to our individual progress toward our goals, vector almost certainly trumps velocity. However long it takes, let us not lose our sense of direction.<br><br>Here is one way to look at the Master's limitless ability to connect to us across the entire spectrum of human emotion: As mortals, we go through life and can experience some pretty low lows and also some pretty high highs. But even though the Savior's earthly experience was every bit as real and visceral as our own, the Savior is on a scale that supersedes anything the rest of us can possibly encounter. We simply cannot get outside His ability to relate to us personally and individually. Well-meaning friends may offer their best approximate<i>sympathy,</i>but only the Savior offers ultimate and absolute<i>empathy.</i><br><br>Though I am a teaching professor and not a scientist per se, I love the way the Lord invites us to participate in the scientific process as described by Alma (who just might have been something of a scientist himself). Alma suggested that we experiment on the word in the crucible of the real world:<br><br><i>But behold, if you will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Isn't that the way of the scientist and the researcher? They gather all of the empirical evidence--all the data they can--and develop a theory; then they create a repeatable, predictable experiment that proves or disproves the theory.<br><br>The Savior, both in His own recorded words and through the words of His holy prophets, has invited us to come unto Him, to experiment for ourselves on the truthfulness of His gospel, and to claim the attendant blessings.<br><br>I appreciate so much the Savior's Intercessory Prayer in which He gives us all a glimpse of the possible glory inherent in a relationship with Him--which is a type of the oneness relationship He has with the Father. Let me share a few verses from John.<br><br>First, the Savior prayed for His apostles:<br><br><i>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>And then He prayed for the rest of us:<br><br><i>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</i><br><br><i>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>We began this morning with the analogy of leaving it all on the field. How is it possible for us to not only "take the field" of this earthly life but to also come away victorious? I suggest two ways: first, by eschewing the strategic advances of the adversary, and, second, by developing that critical, personal, interactive relationship with the Master.<br><br>May we not be found undervaluing the role of the Master, whose arms are outstretched still. We have the opportunity here and now to make Him not just a "Facebook friend" but a most personal, powerful, and influential advocate. Let us not buy into the adversary's attempts to keep us away from the everlasting peace, safety, and eventual exaltation available if we but commend our own personal will into the Lord's all-powerful hands.<br><br>I testify of the reality of the living Christ, just as the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles have declared in a modern-day proclamation.<sup>25</sup>I testify that as we boldly approach Him, our own personal performance becomes our own personal legacy. As we engage with the Master, may we leave it all on the playing field of this life, which is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Douglas R.

<h1>9;s in a Name? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am  grateful for the opportunity to speak today. The weekly devotionals and forums have been a big part of my BYU experience. I attended them when I was a  student, and my wife and I still attend them with our children who are students here. I am also grateful to my family, friends, and colleagues who have  taken the time to be with us today.<br><br>Today is my father's birthday. He is eighty-seven years old. He and my mother are in Wisconsin watching this  devotional, and if the volume on the television is turned all the way up, they are listening to it too.<br><br>My father's name is Gordon Smith. My  mother told me recently--and she reminds me often--that my father never wanted a son named Gordon, but he agreed to give me his first name as my middle name.  This is the story about why I took that name upon myself and why I have come to believe that the names we call each other are important.<br><h2><b>Why I Took My  Father's Name</b></h2><br>To understand why I took my father's name as my own, you need to know a bit about my relationship with my father. My father and  several generations before him had been dairy farmers in Wisconsin, but in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, my father, only seventeen years  old at the time, joined the navy and was assigned to serve in the South Pacific. He eventually made a career of the military, and I was born in a naval  hospital in Bremerton, Washington. Shortly after my birth he was transferred to San Diego, California, where he taught Teletype repair for five years.  Following his retirement our family returned to his childhood home of Wisconsin, and that's where I grew up. Many of my earliest memories involve feeding  and caring for cows, pigs, and chickens on our small farm, though I was temperamentally not well suited to farming.<br><br>My uneasy relationship with  farming became apparent to our whole family when our pigs disappeared. Our pigs were named Slurp and Burp. One day they were just gone, and I asked around,  "Where did Slurp and Burp go?" Nobody else seemed troubled by their disappearance. They just said that somebody had come and taken them away.<br><br>A  few weeks later, over a dinner featuring pork chops, my older sister--who introduced so much of life to me--said, pointing at my plate, "Remember Slurp and  Burp?"<br><br>Lessons about the circle of life were plentiful on that small farm. I saw my father assist in the birthing of a calf, and we drank milk  from the calf's mother. I was playing basketball in the yard one day when a rabid raccoon came toward me, and my dad shot the raccoon. (At first I was  worried I had been in trouble, and I thought he had just missed.) We learned by observation that chickens do indeed come from eggs, and we also learned by  observation what it means to "run around like a chicken with its head cut off."<br><br>Despite our humble and remote circumstances, I managed to  cultivate big dreams on that farm, in no small part because of my dad. During his last year of service in the navy he traveled the world and sent us  souvenirs from Europe, Asia, and Africa. He was gone for a year, and I remember that when he returned, I didn't know what he looked like because I was only  four years old when he left and five when he returned. But I treasured those souvenirs that he sent me, and I spent many hours in my room in Wisconsin  looking at photos of Rome or pounding on a drum from Africa or playing with toys from the Philippines, imagining what it would be like tovisit those  faraway lands.<br><br>Some of my most treasured memories from childhood involve sitting in the living room or in the backyard listening to stories about  my father's childhood or about his adventures in the navy. Like Aesop's fables, these stories almost always came with some moral that we were supposed to  take from them. My son Drew and I were recently in Wisconsin for a family reunion, and we again heard stories about the importance of hard work, competence,  and integrity.<br><br>My father also taught me--more through his reaction to war than through his words--todespise war. Although he could never speak of  combat--and he still can't to this day--one navy story inevitably connected to another, and he often found himself led to memories that he would rather  suppress. We could discern when he had reached this point because he swallowed hard, his eyes welled with tears, and he looked off into the distance. My  mother recently observed, "They don't give Purple Hearts for those wounds."<br><br>Another significant lesson--never stated explicitly but reinforced  repeatedly in his stories--was that one person could change the world. As far as I know, my dad never changed the course of the war through his naval  service, but his stories showed me why the navy always valued one more good man. During the war he was only an enlisted radioman, but I was convinced as a  young boy that, aside from Admiral Nimitz, my father was the most important person in the Pacific Fleet. To me he was--and he remains--a great  man.<br><br>As President Joseph F. Smith wrote over 100 years ago:<br><br><i>Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may  make history, but they do not make real life.</i><br><br><i>After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind,  is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.</i> ["Common-Place Things,"<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>15 December 1905, 752]<br><br>From my own experience I knew that my dad could fix anything.  Whether the problem was mechanical, electrical, or personal, he seemed to always have an answer. Like many young boys I looked up to my dad. He was one of  my heroes.<br><h2><b>Changing My Name</b></h2><br>During those growing-up years in Osseo, Wisconsin, everyone called me by my first name, Doug. Strangely, my  group of friends went through a phase in which we decided to call each other by our fathers' names. Some of those names stuck, but "Gordon Smith" did not  seem like a good fit for me at that time. And I was largely content with my name, except when my high school English teacher decided to call me "Dougie." No  one in that day was asking me to teach them "how to Dougie."<br><br>I was still Doug Smith when I arrived at BYU in August 1980. I was not a member of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but my first class in college was Religion 121: The Book of Mormon. My best friend in high school, who had  convinced me to attend BYU with him, told me I shouldn't worry about this class. He said the Book of Mormon was just a history of South America, and that  was all I knew about the course.<br><br>So I showed up on the first day, and the professor introduced the course by saying we would be covering the first  half of the Book of Mormon. He started to talk about the events that we would encounter. I wasn't worried until the guy next to me raised his hand and said,  "Will we be discussing the sons of Mosiah in this course?"<br><br>I did a double take. I thought, "How does he know anything about what's in this book?"  And I thought, "Well, the professor will provide us some context for the people who didn't read ahead." But he just answered the student as if it was a  completely natural question.<br><br>And then another student raised his hand and said, "How about Samuel the Lamanite? That guy is cool!" Everybody  laughed, and I completely missed the joke. Then another person said something, and by this point in the class I was starting to panic.<br><br>I wasn't in  the habit of praying at the time--I didn't really pray much at all--but I just decided that since I was at BYU, I would bow my head and say a little prayer:  "Please, God, make them stop."<br><br>Well, it did eventually stop, and at the end of class I approached the teacher and asked, "Did you post an  assignment for the first class?"<br><br>"No, why do you ask?"<br><br>"Well, it just seems like everybody's read ahead."<br><br>He looked me up and  down and said, "You aren't a member, are you?"<br><br>I thought about that for a second, and I responded, "A member of what?"<br><br>So we had a nice  long talk about the class, and I read the Book of Mormon in my first year at BYU.<br><br>The transition from that first day of college to my baptism in  the fall semester of my sophomore year did not require a dramatic change in my lifestyle, but my worldview was completely upended. Embracing the gospel  impelled me to look outward in a way that I never had before, to place others before myself: "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will  lose his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 16:25).<br><br>I decided to serve a mission, and one year after my baptism I was called to serve in  Vienna, Austria. I became Elder Smith. Over the past few weeks I have read my missionary journals. I don't know if any of you have done that, but it is a  horrifying experience. I'm not a great journal writer, but I was impressed by the effort I expended in trying to create a new identity for myself as Elder  Smith. I wanted to become a powerful missionary. I knew that Austria was not a high-baptizing mission, but, I thought, England wasn't a high-baptizing  mission before Wilford Woodruff got there either. Unfortunately my motives were entirely self-interested: I felt like I had a debt to pay, and I wanted to  pay it. I hadn't internalized the lesson taught by King Benjamin that even if we serve God with our "whole souls," we remain "unprofitable servants" (Mosiah  2:21).<br><br>I worked hard in Austria, and I was frustrated at my inability to reduce my debt. Every sacrifice that I made, every extra effort that I  made, was repaid many times over, and early in my mission I wrote about my frustration in my journal:<br><br><i>I have been so blessed by the Lord  . . . , and I wanted to go on a mission, in part, to show the Lord how much I love Him. To think of my mission as just something else by which I can make  myself better is offensive to me. That implies that the biggest attempt I've made in my life to be selfless has turned into the most selfish endeavor that I  have ever undertaken.</i><br><br>By the end of my mission I had come to terms with God over my indebtedness, and Ihad learned that the  most valuable lesson of my mission was to love the people. As King Benjamin said, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the  service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). During my last week in Austria I wrote the following entry in my journal while riding on a train from Vienna  toLinz:<br><br><i>Austria is a beautiful land, dotted with small villages. One of the most common sights from the train is the steeple of a  Catholic church against the background of rolling green hills. We are sitting with a lady from Vienna who is dressed in a traditional Austrian hat, blouse,  and skirt. Tradition prevents most Austrians from hearing our message. And, yet, after being rejected by thousands of people, I have learned to love these  people with a love that I have felt for no others. Somehow, I pray for them, cry for them, and hope for them as I do my own  family.</i><br><br>You can perceive in these entries a journey taken by many young people--a transition from inward-looking, self-centered  teenagers to outward-looking, empathetic adults.<br><br>When I returned to Osseo after my mission, I shed the title of Elder Smith, and, like many  returned missionaries, including my son Drew, who just came home from Ukraine, I went through that awkward phase of adjusting to being called by my first  name. In my case, however, my pre-mission name evoked thoughts about a confused young boy who had arrived at BYU three years before. "Doug" just didn't seem  to fit anymore, but I didn't do anything about it until I met a young woman at BYU the following year who was changing her name. She just decided one day to  ask people to call her by her middle name. And they did!<br><br>I thought, "Is that really all there is to it? Just tell people, 'Call me [Whatever],'  and they do it?" This was a revelation to me. I didn't have to be Doug Smith anymore. I could be anything Iwanted! After much contemplation I decided that  using my middle name would not only be the simplest change--after all, I wouldn't have to make a legal change to my name--but it would also honor my father.  What I did not fully comprehend was how that change would affect me.<br><br>Changing my name was a tremendous hassle. My wife, Sue, was supportive, and I  didn't ask our families to call me Gordon, so when we visit relatives I'm still Doug. But the real challenge was among my friends. In my first accounting  class of the fall semester, legendary accounting professor Jay Smith called on me by my first name, and I asked, "Would you mind calling me  Gordon?"<br><br>By that time I was well into my major, and both he and my classmates looked at me quizzically, wondering, "What's the punch  line?"<br><br>But I didn't have a punch line. "Um . . . I changed my name to Gordon."<br><br>In another class so many people knew me by the name Doug  that they simply wouldn't allow me to change my name to Gordon. They insisted, over my protests, that I was joking. My coworkers and supervisors in the  Reading and Writing Center split about evenly between those who made the adjustment and those who couldn't, and that just caused confusion. It was hard on  people.<br><br>Several times during the first few months I considered abandoning my project. In conversation I stumbled over my new name. More than once  I failed to acknowledge people who called me Gordon. I experimented with new signatures. I changed my driver's license. I learned to fill out forms that had  blanks for "First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name."<br><br>At the same time I was surprised to discover that when people called me Gordon, it felt  different than being called Doug. In the beginning, each reference to Gordon caused me to think about my father. I was clothing myself in his name, and I  felt obliged to wear it honorably. I didn't want to become my father, but I wanted to become a person who would make him proud. Over time I came to  associate the name Gordon with my Mormon identity and the name Doug with my pre-Mormon life.<br><h2><b>Taking Christ's Name Upon Us</b></h2><br>I have sometimes  thought of the experience of changing my name in relation to my baptism--an ordinance in which I took upon myself the name of Jesus Christ. In both instances  the name was given to me by another, but I was asked to embrace the name as my own. Now each week in taking the sacrament I reaffirm my willingness to take  upon myself the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77). What is the significance of this representation?<br><br>When I took upon myself the name of my  father, I was not using his name as a description of my character. I was not saying, "I am my father." Rather, I was using the name to honor him and to  inspire myself to develop attributes like him. Similarly, taking upon ourselves the name of Christ is not a recognition of an achievement but rather a nudge  toward improved behavior.<br><br>King Benjamin gave his people the name of Christ only after the Spirit had changed their hearts, but he gave them the  name not because they had reached some threshold and not because they had "no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). Rather,  he gave them the name so that they could remember that moment and remain "steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works" (Mosiah  5:15).<br><br>When faithful people take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ, they assume a name that is imbued with meaning. President Spencer W.  Kimball once said, "The name Jesus Christ and what it represents has been plowed deep into the history of the world, never to be uprooted" ("Why Call Me  Lord, Lord, and Do Not the Things Which I Say?"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1975, 4). This feature of the name is useful in transmitting large quantities of  information. Rather than saying that we should have "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility,  diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:6)--or any of the other myriad of attributes that we associate with Jesus Christ--we can say more simply that we take upon ourselves the  name of Christ. Moreover, because we have stories of His life, Christ's name has a richness and texture that is impossible to convey merely by listing the  attributes of His character.<br><h2><b>Name-Calling and Judging</b></h2><br>I have spoken about the positive power of naming, but naming also has a dark side.  Just as naming can inspire and direct, it can also discourage or obstruct. This is a phenomenon that we all recognize as name-calling or labeling. The line  between labeling for the purpose of providing information and labeling for the purpose of marginalizing others can be subtle, but I will strive to  illustrate a few guiding principles from my experiences as a law professor.<br><br>Each year BYU Law School attracts some of the brightest law students  in the country. I have taught at six law schools in the United States and in several programs abroad, and I know from law students. When I came to BYU five  years ago, some of my colleagues at other law schools wondered aloud whether law could be taught effectively at a school whose students who share so many  religious values.<br><br>While an outsider might imagine legal education at BYU Law School as a form of indoctrination, my experience has been quite the  contrary. The fairly high degree of religious homogeneity we experience here has actually enabled or encouraged discussions in class that are more vigorous  than those discussions that typically occur at other law schools. While students at other law schools often pass off their disagreements on the simplistic  grounds that they belong to different value groups, students at BYU's law school often feel compelled to examine the implications of their assumed shared  beliefs. This is real learning, not indoctrination.<br><br>For example, in my Contracts class, studentsexpress a range of views about the social  implications of contracting. (The following discussion draws in part on Stewart Macaulay, Jean Braucher, John Kidwell, and William Whitford,<i>Contracts:  Law in Action,</i>3rd ed. [New Providence, New Jersey: LexisNexis Matthew Bender, 2010], 491–93.) Some students enter the class with a bias in favor of  market transactions, believing that economic efficiency and respect for the liberty of individuals should compel courts to enforce almost all contracts,  regardless of the consequences. The students who hold this view sometimes invoke the gospel principle of agency, arguing that we all benefit if people are  encouraged to take responsibility for their own risk.<br><br>Other students enter the course with a bias in favor of social control, believing that  respect for the dignity of individuals should compel courts to protect the weakest members of our society. The students who hold this view sometimes appeal  to the gospel principle of charity, arguing that legal rules should ensure that contracts are fair and that people with more wealth, talent, or bargaining  skill should not be allowed to use those advantages to prey upon the weak.<br><br>Former Yale law professor Arthur Allen Leff recognized both of these  impulses and described in poetic prose why we cannot have our cake and eat it too:<br><br><i>In effect, we want to have the world so arranged that  everyone will be motivated to get as good a deal for himself as possible by being as informed and efficient as he can be, but that no one will have to get a  bad deal in the process. But the payoff for the former necessitates, indeed entails, the latter. Hence doing both is not a technical problem . . . but a  cultural one: we cannot have perfect freedom and perfect fairness at once. What we have, instead,</i>[are] . . .<i>legal device</i>[s]<i>that  </i>[allow]<i>us, inconsistently and with only symbolic impact, an occasional evasive bow in the direction of our incoherent hearts' desires.</i>["Thomist  Unconscionability,"<i>Canadian Business Law Journal</i>4 (1979–1980): 428]<br><br>Sometimes in the course of our class discussions the students  will square off in these two camps--even identifying members of the rival camp with a derogatory name--but I strive to be sensitive about the formation of  viewpoint cliques in the classroom. If students caricature their classmates--if they attempt to marginalize someone in the class as an "other"--then learning  suffers and we have to talk about the importance of empathy in learning law. We truly understand our own views only when we understand the views of those  who disagree with us. In seeking to understand those who disagree with us, my own experience has been that views evolve. This is not only acceptable but  praiseworthy.<br><br>In the April 2012 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf reminded us to "stop judging others and replace judgmental  thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children" ("The Merciful Obtain Mercy,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 75). Name-calling and  labeling are forms of judgment, and the problem with judgment is its finality. As disciples of Jesus Christ we should encourage people to change and  improve. If we believe that others have taken a wrong turn, one of the greatest acts of charity that we can perform is to give them room to  repent.<br><br>As observed by President Uchtdorf:<br><br><i>We must recognize that we are all imperfect--that we are beggars before God. Haven't  we all, at one time or another, meekly approached the mercy seat and pleaded for grace? Haven't we wished with all the energy of our souls for mercy--to be  forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have committed?</i><br><br><i>Because we all depend on the mercy of God, how can we deny to others  any measure of the grace we so desperately desire for ourselves? My beloved brothers and sisters, should we not forgive as we wish to be forgiven?</i>["The  Merciful Obtain Mercy," 75]<br><br>Thus, if we are to be like Jesus Christ--if we have truly taken upon ourselves His name--we should avoid  name-calling and labeling and stand ever ready to receive those who have strayed. My own experience has been that when we exercise influence "by persuasion,  by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41), we not only bless the lives of others but we also elevate  ourselves.<br><br>I pray that we may all come closer to that ideal, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D. Gordon Smith was associate dean at BYU's J.Reuben Clark Law School when this devotional was given  on 26June 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young  University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
<br>
We all have individual plans for our lives. Some of your plans may be very detailed; others may only be brief outlines. What I do know is that part of your plan was to come to BYU for your education.<br><br>My plan also included BYU for my undergraduate education. My father was not a member of the Church, but he was very supportive of education. He would often help us with science projects or on a variety of our homework assignments, particularly math--he was really good at math. My mother was a member of the Church, and each week she took us to Sunday meetings and made sure we had rides to the weekly youth meetings, which at that time were Primary for the children and Mutual for the teenagers. From my teachers in these Church programs I learned the basic gospel principles.<br><br>As a teenager I also learned about BYU. When the time came I applied to the colleges in my hometown of San Diego, California, as well as BYU. My plan included the study of medical laboratory science so that I could work as a technologist in a hospital setting. My plan was pretty set in stone, I thought. I actually put in my high school yearbook that I was going to go to BYU and that I was going to be a medical technologist. I do not know where this desire to be a medical technologist stemmed from. My father was a pharmacist, so there was a bit of the medical profession influence in my home, but I did not know anyone who worked as a medical technologist.<br><br>When I came to BYU I began my classes for the medical laboratory science major. Several semesters of chemistry were required, and I soon learned that I did not really love chemistry as much as a medical laboratory science major should. It was then that I realized my plan would need to change. I visited many colleges on campus and explored a variety of majors. Many were of interest to me. Each week I wrote handwritten letters home to my parents--this was before cell phones, email, and texting--and each week each letter contained a different idea regarding a possible major. I'm not sure what my parents told people I was studying, because I didn't know what I was studying either.<br><br>This situation reminds me of a poem by Robert Frost:<br><br><i>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</i><br><i>And sorry I could not travel both</i><br><i>And be one traveler, long I stood</i><br><i>And looked down one as far as I could</i><br><i>To where it bent in the undergrowth.</i><br><br>The last stanza reads:<br><br><i>I shall be telling this with a sigh</i><br><i>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</i><br><i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--</i><br><i>I took the one less traveled by,</i><br><i>And that has made all the difference.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I did not know which road to take, and when I finished my freshman year I returned home to San Diego, discouraged because I had not settled on a major. Near the end of the summer I received a letter with a BYU return address. It was an acceptance letter from the College of Nursing for the fall semester. In my search for a major I had visited the College of Nursing, but I didn't realize I had applied. In today's world I can assure you that would not happen, but what an opportunity that was for me. My plan was changing!<br><br>After consulting with my parents I decided to change my major to nursing. This change in my plan has had life-altering effects for forty years. I've been a nurse for more than thirty-eight years--now don't start counting how old I am, but yes, that's a long time--and I've done a variety of other things with my major. I've enjoyed the profession of nursing, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here at BYU. I'm anxious to begin serving in a new role as the dean of the College of Nursing, and I'm sure that after I finish this talk, being dean will cause more anxiety than speaking does right now. But I know I can be of service, and I'm greatly appreciative of the opportunity to do so.<br><h2><b>Of Posies and Making Plans</b></h2><br>Another part of my plan is always to enjoy the beauty of the world, particularly flowers. Ienjoy flowers in many ways: as posies, which is a small bouquet of flowers; in flower gardens; and in artwork such as paintings and sculptures of flowers. The BYU campus has outstanding floral displays throughout the year. When I walk across campus I often stop and admire the flowers. Wherever I am and wherever I travel, Istrive to take advantage of the opportunities to visit gardens, take pictures, and admire God's creations.<br><br>I have special feelings for some flowers. Daffodils in the spring remind me of the renewing of life and new beginnings. They have always been a favorite of mine. When I was a young woman in Mutual we earned felt seals, or emblems, to mark our progress in the program. The felt seals were sewn onto blue bandalos, or sashes, which we wore each week. I created a felt daffodil to add to my bandolo to remind me of renewal and new beginnings. There are also two flowers that remind me of my mother: purple pansies and poinsettias. My mother would sing the Primary song "Little Purple Pansies" to us, and she often had pansies in her garden. Her birthday was in December, and whenever I see poinsettias I am reminded of her.<br><br>I would also like to share another favorite flower. Clematis flowers grow on climbing vines that twist and curl around supporting structures to anchor the plant as it climbs. I took a picture in France not far from Giverny, where the French impressionist painter Claude Monet lived and maintained beautiful gardens. The clematis vines were thick with gorgeous blossoms and covered the building. A few years ago I searched for a home to purchase, and one of my requirements was a nice yard with flower beds. That year I closed on a home in November and was excited to find two clematis vines in the backyard. I thought the plan included two gorgeous vines on either side of the back steps the next spring and summer. The plant on the left side has many blossoms, but the right vine has not done well. Some of the leaves have died, yet the plant is persistent and occasionally has a few small blossoms. These blossoms are purple--a little bit of a different color from the other vine's flowers. I am sure when the previous owner planted these vines, the plan was to have full, beautiful vines on each side of the steps. There has been a bump in this plan.<br><h2><b>Persistence, Perseverance, and Progress</b></h2><br>Most of our plans have bumps along the way. Your plan may include an education program that because of limited resources cannot admit all applicants. Your bump may be that you are not able to get into your program or that you have to apply to it more than once. Maybe you will find some of your courses especially challenging. This is when persistence and patience are particularly helpful.<br><br>Persistence is a stick-to-it attitude, even when things are difficult. Consistent individual actions show persistence. As you practice persistence, such as by daily studying for that challenging course or by completing the necessary tasks to reapply to a program, your daily persistence develops into perseverance.<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin spoke regarding perseverance:<br><br>Perseverance<i>means to continue in a given course until we have reached a goal or objective, regardless of obstacles, opposition, and other counterinfluences. . . .</i><br><br><i>Perseverance is a positive, active characteristic. It is not idly, passively waiting and hoping for some good thing to happen. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Perseverance is vital to success in any endeavor, whether spiritual or temporal, large or small, public or personal. Think seriously of how important perseverance, or the lack of it, has been in your own endeavors, such as Church callings, schooling, or employment. I believe that essentially all significant achievement results largely from perseverance. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Perseverance is essential to us in learning and living.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Sometimes persistence is needed for the short term in completing a difficult assignment or course. At the time it may feel overwhelming, yet with patience and sincere effort we can complete the goal. Sometimes we need to be persistent and persevere over a long period of time--maybe over a lifetime.<br><br>A woman I know--I will call her Suzanne--has persisted daily in a very different plan than she ever imagined as a young woman. She has an optimistic and positive attitude, finding joy in the ups and downs of life. She completed her degree in nursing, married, and began her family, which eventually included three daughters. As her second daughter began to grow, Suzanne realized she was not developing normally. After a period of time her daughter was diagnosed with a form of autism that severely affected her social and communication skills. The plan for Suzanne's family was altered. A few years later Suzanne delivered her third daughter, who eventually was also diagnosed with autism. Suzanne's husband was a supportive, involved father, and together they altered their plan, knowing that they could handle this challenge. When the girls were ages eleven, thirteen, and eighteen, their father unexpectedly passed away from a heart attack while out on his daily run. Again Suzanne's plan was greatly altered. She continues to find joy as she has realized that life doesn't have to be perfect to be wonderful. She is persistent and will continue to persevere over her lifetime.<br><br>We often are admonished to endure to the end, as in Matthew 24:13, "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved"; and in Doctrine and Covenants 50:5, "Blessed are they who are faithful and endure, . . . for they shall inherit eternal life." For many years I struggled with the word<i>endure</i>because "to the end" seemed so far off and overwhelming. I came to realize that what I really needed was persistence as I worked on my daily to-do list.<br><br>In the last general Young Women meeting President Thomas S. Monson offered this suggestion:<br><br><i>Seek heavenly guidance one day at a time. Life by the yard is hard; by the inch it's a cinch. Each of us can be true for just one day--and then one more and then one more after that--until we've lived a lifetime guided by the Spirit, a lifetime close to the Lord, a lifetime of good deeds and righteousness.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>As we strive to live our lives by the inch we must examine the contents of our daily to-do lists. We all want to be successful, but continuing to focus on the wrong to-do items puts us on the wrong plan or road and will only slow our progress. C. S. Lewis wrote:<br><br><i>We all want progress. . . . If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>If life is not what you would like, this is where the concepts of Alma 5 come into play. Alma 5 is the "personal inventory" chapter:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</i>[Alma 5:14–16]<br><br>So I ask myself, and I ask all of you: Are the right things on our to-do lists? Are we focusing on the tasks that will have the outcomes we desire so that our behavior is an example of who we desire to be? Do the expressions on our faces show that we have His image on our countenances? If we need to make changes, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf reminded us that it is much easier to make minor course corrections along the way. But if we are way off course, there is a way back. President Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>No matter how terribly off course you are, no matter how far you have strayed, the way back is certain and clear. Come, learn of the Father; offer up a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Have faith, and believe in the cleansing power of the infinite Atonement of Jesus the Christ.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>I urge you to strive to stay focused on a plan that is in line with the basic gospel principles. The gospel principles sound so simple. We know them from Primary and Sunday School:<br><ul><br>	<li>Read and study the scriptures and conference talks.</li><br>	<li>Consistently pray.</li><br>	<li>Obey the commandments.</li><br>	<li>Attend and be actively engaged in Church meetings and callings.</li><br>	<li>Keep your covenants.</li><br>	<li>Attend the temple.</li><br></ul><br>The gospel principles are foundational to happiness in our individual plans. Elder M.Russell Ballard said:<br><br><i>The Church is a mooring in this tempestuous sea, an anchor in the churning waters of change and division, and a beacon to those who value and seek righteousness. The Lord uses this Church as a tool in pulling His children throughout the world toward the protection of His gospel.</i><sup>6</sup><br><h2><b>The Patience to Reach Your Goals</b></h2><br>Another important thing to remember is to not allow your enthusiasm to be stifled by the discouragement that will inevitably come to you. As we are persistent and persevere in living the gospel principles, we also must trust Heavenly Father and His timing. We don't always know His plan for us. We must be patient and continue in faith to understand.<br><br>President Uchtdorf spoke of patience:<br><br><i>Brigham Young taught that when something came up which he could not comprehend fully, he would pray to the Lord, "Give me patience to wait until I can understand it for myself." And then Brigham would continue to pray until he could comprehend it.</i><br><br><i>We must learn that in the Lord's plan, our understanding comes "line upon line, precept upon precept." In short, knowledge and understanding come at the price of patience.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The principles of persistence and patience have served me well in my life. After I changed my major to nursing, I first obtained an associate degree and then continued on to complete my bachelor's degree in my early married life. I had a goal to return to school for a master's degree. When I had five children I began the nursing administration master's program at BYU. I took one class a semester. People often would say, "How can you take one class per semester? You may never finish." Well, I knew that if I continued I would. I was persistent and patient, and after five years I finished the degree. Twenty-five years after beginning my college education at BYU, I again returned to school, this time at the University of Utah to earn a doctorate degree. My plan has been different than that of many others, but with persistence, patience, and faith I have enjoyed the journey--the hard times and especially the easy and rewarding times.<br><br>Now, back to the posies. Of the two clematis vines in my backyard, even with persistence and patience the one has not prospered. I have added fertilizer and water; it has not flourished, but I still have enjoyed the few flowers it has produced. The vine is not perfect, but it is still wonderful in its own way. I urge you to be persistent and persevere and exercise patience to find your plan and reach your goals.<br><br>I have a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel. I know that Joseph Smith served as the Lord's instrument to restore the true gospel to the earth. The Book of Mormon is the word of God, and it contains the gospel principles that, if followed, will lead us back to Heavenly Father. I am very grateful for Jesus Christ, who is my Redeemer and Savior. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Patricia Ravert was associate dean of the BYU College of Nursing when this devotional was given on 10July 2012.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>Chariots, and the Lord of Hosts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The title of my presentation is "Angels, Chariots,  and the Lord of Hosts."<sup>1</sup>Please know that I have, through various means, sought for the  Spirit of the Lord. Please know also that the Lord's angels exist and are empowered by Jesus Christ  through His infinite Atonement.<br><h2><b>The Ministry of Angels</b></h2><br>Since the days of Adam and Eve  angels have had significant responsibilities in the Lord's great plan of happiness. Angels figure  prominently in ancient and modern scripture. Angels have ministered to or communicated with such  notables as Adam, Hagar (see Genesis 16:7–11), Manoah's wife (see Judges 13:3, 6, 19–21), Daniel,  Mary the mother of Jesus (see Luke 1:26–38), Mary Magdalene, Salome, Joanna, Mary the mother of  James, other women (see Mark 16:4–6; Luke 24:2–4; John 20:11–12), Peter, Paul, John the Revelator,  and many others. Angels have also ministered to Book of Mormon characters, including Nephi (see  1Nephi 11:14; 2 Nephi 4:24), King Benjamin (see Mosiah 3:2), Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:10–11;  Alma 8:14), Amulek (see Alma 10:7), Samuel the Lamanite (see Helaman 13:7), and  others.<br><br>Furthermore, in our own dispensation prophets and apostles have testified of the  eminence and considerable standing of angels. In fact, our dispensation has been a period of  extraordinary angelic activity. Joseph Smith received dozens of communications from angels.  Additional Church authorities and others have been recipients of angelic  communications.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was restored, in part,  when angels imparted revelations and truths to the Prophet Joseph Smith. A passage in the Doctrine  and Covenants summarizes:<br><br><i>The voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel,  and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring  their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power  of their priesthood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:21]<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reminded us that  it is appropriate to speak about angels. He wrote, "Ibelieve we need to speak of and believe in and  bear testimony of the ministry of angels more than we sometimes do."<sup>2</sup><br><br>For a  definition of angels, see the Bible Dictionary. In this presentation I will refer to the Lord's  angels unless otherwise stated.<br><h2><b>The Angels of the Lord of Hosts</b></h2><br>How many angels are  there? There are<i>hosts</i>of angels. The Old Testament expression "Lord of hosts" sometimes  refers to the Lord of hosts of angels. The Bible Dictionary states: "The Lord of Sabaoth was a title  of Jehovah; the hosts were the armies of Israel (1 Sam. 17:45), but also included the angelic armies  of heaven."<sup>3</sup>Hebrew lexicons agree with this interpretation. One prominent Hebrew lexicon  states that the term<i>Lord of hosts</i>sometimes refers to "the heavenly beings" of the  Lord<sup>4</sup>or "the heavenly entourage" of the Lord.<sup>5</sup>Another Hebrew lexicon agrees  with this definition, referring to a host as an "(organized body) of  angels."<sup>6</sup><br><br>The title "Lord of hosts" is so important that it is found some 250  times in the Old Testament; Isaiah alone used the term about fifty times. This title, then, is a  frequent reminder that the Lord has hosts of angels. How many angels belong to the Lord of hosts of  angels? The singular<i>host</i>, by definition, refers to "a large number of people or  things."<sup>7</sup>The plural,<i>hosts,</i>multiplies this number. The Lord of hosts of angels  refers to immense numbers.<br><br>Other passages of scripture also indicate that there are great  numbers of the Lord's angels. For example, Lehi envisioned "God sitting upon his throne, surrounded  with numberless concourses of angels" (1 Nephi 1:8). Two passages of scripture--Hebrews 12:22 and  Doctrine and Covenants 76:67--use the expression "an innumerable company of angels." Furthermore,  John the Revelator recorded:<br><br><i>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels  round about the throne . . . : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and  thousands of thousands.</i>[Revelation 5:11]<br><br>Indeed, ten thousand times ten thousand  angels, which equals 100 million, symbolizes a great number. To sum up, there are numberless  concourses of angels, an innumerable company of angels, and hosts of angels--all of whom are in the  service of our Lord and God.<br><h2><b>Angels as Agents of Power</b></h2><br>Angels are agents of power.  Each of the Lord's angels possesses extraordinary capabilities and powers, making them formidable  beings. Their power ultimately exists because of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Consider the  following examples of the power of angels:<br><br>When Daniel was cast into the lions' den, a  stone was placed over the den's opening to prevent Daniel's escape. Then, to ensure that possible  coconspirators with Daniel would not remove the stone without detection, the king and his officers  used their signets to seal the stone (see Daniel 6:17). Had the seals been broken during the night,  the king and his officers could have claimed deception or trickery on the part of Daniel. But  neither the rock nor the seals prevented the angel from entering the den and stopping the lions'  mouths. We note that the angel was not only empowered to save Daniel but that the angel himself was  also immune from the lions' destruction. Because of Daniel's faith and righteousness, the angel  saved him from a horrific death. Daniel would later testify, "My God hath sent his angel, and hath  shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in  me" (Daniel 6:22).<br><br>We live during a day of wars and rumors of wars. News organizations  regularly report conflicts taking place in various parts of the world. However, we as Latter-day  Saints should have a high degree of comfort in knowing the power of the Lord's angels with regard to  such conflicts. The Bible sets forth the following account of a powerful angel.<br><br>During the  reign of King Hezekiah the Assyrian army was advancing toward Jerusalem with the intent of  conquering it. With scores of thousands of enemy soldiers camped outside of Jerusalem's gates,  waiting to destroy the city's inhabitants, Hezekiah petitioned the Lord through prayer in the  temple. In response to Hezekiah's humble prayer, the Lord sent his prophet Isaiah to the king,  promising deliverance from the Assyrian army. Soon thereafter "the angel of the Lord went forth, and  smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand" (Isaiah 37:36; see  also Isaiah 37:33–35; 2 Chronicles 32:21). It is sometimes difficult to comprehend such  extraordinary dominance: one angel versus some 185,000 disciplined soldiers--and the angel was  victorious. Such an angelic operation is permitted only according to the Lord's divine  will.<br><br>In addition to these two examples of angels operating as agents of power during the  Old Testament period, I will provide a modern example of a powerful heavenly messenger in the life  of President Harold B. Lee. When President Lee was serving as the president of the Church, he shared  an experience that occurred while he and his wife were traveling on an airplane. They had been  visiting a mission, and both were impressed to return home earlier than they had planned. As  President and Sister Lee were sitting in the airplane, homeward bound, President Lee received a  blessing from an unseen person. He related:<br><br><i>As we approached a certain point en  route, someone laid his hand upon my head. I looked up; I could see no one. That happened again  before we arrived home, again with the same experience. Who it was, by what means or what medium, I  may never know, except I knew that I was receiving a blessing that I came a few hours later to know  I needed most desperately.</i><br><br>. . .<i>Shortly</i>[after we arrived home],<i>there came  massive hemorrhages which, had they occurred while we were in flight, I wouldn't be here today  talking about it.</i><br><br><i>I know that there are powers divine that reach out when all other  help is not available. . . . Yes, Iknow that there are such  powers.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The unseen person who gave President Lee a blessing  demonstrated extraordinary powers: he remained invisible, he knew where to find President Lee, he  knew of President Lee's physical condition and of his need for a blessing, and he blessed the  prophet with priesthood power. Additionally, it is my opinion that this unseen person did not board  the plane as did other passengers, obtaining a passport, ticket, and boarding pass; showing his  photo ID; dealing with airport security; and so forth. It is entirely possible, knowing of the vast  power of angels, that this unseen person entered the plane through miraculous means. Such is the way  of heavenly beings.<br><h2><b>Angels as Protectors of the Righteous</b></h2><br>Not only are angels agents  of power, but they also serve as protective and reassuring forces for the righteous, as shown by the  symbol of chariots of fire. During my research on angels I have collected a number of accounts that  feature angels, horses, and chariots of fire. I will now provide a few examples.<br><br>We recall  from the Old Testament the attempt of Syria's king to capture Elisha. During the night the king  surrounded Dothan with soldiers, horses, and chariots. When Elisha's assistant awakened early in the  morning, he saw the armies that surrounded the city and cried out to Elisha, "Alas, my master! how  shall we do?"<br><br>Elisha replied by saying:<br><br><i>Fear not: for they that be with us  are more than they that be with them.</i><br><br>[After this reply,]<i>Elisha prayed, and said,  Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man;  and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about  Elisha.</i>[2 Kings 6:15–17]<br><br>This account signifies a demonstration of great power  and supremacy--a mountain full of horses and chariots of fire providing courage and protection to  Elisha and his servant.<br><br>Church authorities and others often liken this account to us.  President Henry B. Eyring, for example, provided us with the following  encouragement:<br><br><i>I know that the promise of angels to bear us up is real. You  might want to bring to memory the assurance of Elisha to his frightened servant. That assurance is  ours when we feel close to being overwhelmed in our service. Elisha faced real and terrible  opposition. . . .</i><br><br><i>Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those  you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal  eyes.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland related the account of Elisha and  then applied this important story to each of us:<br><br><i>In the gospel of Jesus Christ  we have help from both sides of the veil. When disappointment and discouragement strike--and they  will--we need to remember that if our eyes could be opened, we would see horses and chariots of fire  as far as the eye can see, riding at great speed to come to our protection. They will always be  there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham's seed.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The  account of Elisha reminds us also of when Elijah and Elisha were walking and talking near the Jordan  River, and "there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and  Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." When Elisha witnessed this scene, he cried out, "My  father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof" (2 Kings 2:11–12). For multiple  reasons this is a marvelous and incredible show of power: a chariot of fire, horses of fire, and  Elijah ascending to heaven in a whirlwind create a magnificent scene.<br><br>On April 3, 1836,  this same Elijah visited Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. Joseph wrote,  "Another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven  without tasting death, stood before us" (D&amp;amp;C 110:13).<br><br>The protective theme of horses  and chariots of fire continues in our day. Some individuals who attended the dedication of the  Kirtland Temple beheld angels, horses of fire, and chariots. The Prophet Joseph Smith recorded: "The  heavens were opened unto Elder Sylvester Smith, and he, leaping up, exclaimed: 'The horsemen of  Israel and the chariots thereof.'"<sup>11</sup><br><br>Additionally, Joseph Smith wrote that<br><br><i>Elder Roger Orton saw a mighty angel riding upon a horse of fire, with a flaming  sword in his hand, followed by five others, encircle the house</i>[temple],<i>and protect the  Saints, even the Lord's anointed, from the power of Satan and a host of evil spirits, which were  striving to disturb the Saints.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>This account makes it unmistakable  that the angels who encircled the temple did so to protect the Saints from Satan's host of evil  spirits. This account also features angels with swords in their hands--a demonstration of angels'  power to protect us from harm and danger.<br><br>Angels with swords are found in the Old  Testament as well as in accounts during the Restoration. We are reminded, for instance, that Joseph  Smith envisioned<br><br><i>Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange land, in the far south  and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the midst of about a dozen men . . . , who appeared  hostile. He was preaching to them in their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head,  with a drawn sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it.</i><sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Angels  in This Dispensation</b></h2><br>Many of the accounts of angels that I have shared today are  exceptional or unique. Most of us will never be protected by an angel in a lions' den, nor will the  majority of us be privileged to see horses and chariots of fire. But we should bear in mind that  angelic communications are not reserved for those who lived during the ancient periods of the Old  Testament or the Book of Mormon, nor are such communications reserved only for prophets, apostles,  or notable women such as Hagar or Mary the mother of Jesus. Indeed, several of our Church  authorities have clearly taught that we who are laypersons may receive angelic communications  according to the divine will of our loving Heavenly Father. To this end I will cite President Boyd  K. Packer and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.<br><br>President Packer provided the following significant  statement:<br><br><i>Angels attend the rank and file of the Church. . .  .</i><br><i>Who would dare to say that angels do not now attend the rank and file of the  Church who--</i><br><i>answer the calls to the mission fields,</i><br><i>teach the  classes,</i><br><i>pay their tithes and offerings,</i><br><i>seek for the records of  their forebears,</i><br><i>work in the temples,</i><br><i>raise their children in  faith,</i><br><i>and have brought this work through 150  years?</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>This statement of President Packer's clearly shows that  angels attend the Church's rank and file as they raise children in faith, pay tithing, conduct  sacred temple work, teach classes, and more.<br><br>It is my understanding--based on more than  twenty years of research--that operations and ministrations of angels are largely unknown to mortals.  Angels can move about the earth conducting the Lord's divine work, and they serve, minister, and  mingle among mortals, usually without our awareness. Most of us in mortality will never see an  angel. As Parley P. Pratt instructed, angels can "be present without being visible to  mortals."<sup>15</sup>And Paul wrote, "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some  have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:2).<br><br>Before I cite Elder Oaks, I want to  share a personal item. During the 1990s my parents had a landline telephone that was state of the  art, high tech, and ultramodern. It was so technologically advanced that it had an internal memory  that would remember up to twenty phone numbers. After my parents entered the phone numbers of  friends or family into the phone's memory, all my parents had to do was lift the receiver and push  the appropriate button, and the phone would automatically dial any of their children. What an  amazing miracle! Dad and Mom could be in contact with any one of their children in  seconds.<br><br>I will now refer to Elder Dallin H. Oaks' conference talk. Elder Oaks presented  specific teachings on how angels may communicate to us who are mortals. His teachings apply to you  and to me:<br><br><i>The ministering of angels can also be unseen. Angelic messages can be  delivered by a voice or merely by thoughts or feelings communicated to the mind. . .  .</i><br><br><i>Nephi described three manifestations of the ministering of angels when he  reminded his rebellious brothers that (1) they had "seen an angel," (2) they had "heard his voice  from time to time," and (3) also that an angel had "spoken unto [them] in a still small voice"  though they were "past feeling" and "could not feel his words" (1 Ne. 17:45). . . . Most angelic  communications are felt or heard rather than seen.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Compared to the  aforementioned telephone, which is now a relic of the past, angelic communications are astounding  and remarkable. They are wonderful gifts from a loving Heavenly Father: visitations from beyond the  veil--unseen angels communicating to mortals by thoughts or by feelings--are spectacular gifts. As the  Book of Mormon teaches, "It is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men" (Moroni 7:37). The  telephone, of course, does not work by faith.<br><br>My research has uncovered instances in which  angels have provided temporal assistance to mortals. An angel, for example, provided food and water  to the prophet Elijah when he fled for his life from Jezebel (see 1Kings 19:1–7). And here is a  modern example of an angel providing temporal assistance: Elder Heber C. Kimball related an occasion  when he and Brigham Young traveled together, conducting the Lord's work. They started out with only  $13.50, but along the way they paid for a number of items, including travel, lodging, and meals. In  fact, they paid out over $87.00, although they had only had $13.50. Elder Kimball  stated:<br><br><i>Brother Brigham often suspected that I put the money in his trunk or  clothes, thinking I had . . . money which I had not acquainted him with, but this was not so. The  money could only have been put in his trunk by some heavenly messenger who administered to our  necessities daily, as he knew we needed.</i><sup>17</sup><br><h2><b>Angels as Agents of  Love</b></h2><br>All angels minister with heavenly love, and every angelic communication to the Saints  is a message of love. Oliver Cowdery personally witnessed the love of John the Baptist when John  appeared to him and Joseph Smith. Sometime after John's visitation Oliver wrote that this angel's  "love enkindled upon our souls."<sup>18</sup>Decades later, in the April 1916 general conference,  President Joseph F. Smith spoke of the love of heavenly messengers:<br><br><i>I believe we  move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not  separate from them. . . . I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous  for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. . . .</i><i>Their love for us and their desire  for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for  ourselves.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>I will now share two stories wherein angels  communicated love to mortals. At one point in his life Parley P. Pratt remained captive for months  in a Missouri dungeon. He was very discouraged. After fasting and praying for a number of days,  Elder Pratt experienced a powerful answer to his prayer. He wrote:<br><br><i>A personage . . .  stood before me with a smile of compassion in every look, and pity mingled with the tenderest love  and sympathy in every expression of the countenance. . . . A well known voice saluted me, which I  readily recognized as that of the wife of my youth, who had for near two years been sweetly sleeping  where . . . the weary are at rest.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>This personage, as an angelic  messenger, delivered her message to Elder Pratt and then departed.<br><br>While on the subject of  female angels, I will share an important statement by President Brigham  Young:<br><br><i>Suppose that a female angel were to come into your house and you had the  privilege of seeing her, how would she be dressed? . . . She would be neat and nice, her countenance  full of glory, brilliant, bright, and perfectly beautiful, and in every act her gracefulness would  charm the heart of every beholder. There is nothing needless about  her.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>The second account of an angel who communicated love comes  from President Ezra Taft Benson, who recounted an eternal love story of his wife's parents. His  father-in-law, Carl Christian Amussen, a convert from Denmark, was a watchmaker and jeweler in Utah.  He passed away in 1902, leaving his wife, Barbara, a widow for forty years. In 1942 the deceased  Carl came to his wife to inform her of her approaching death. What a great blessing it was for her  to see her eternal companion for the first time in so many years. Carl appeared to Barbara and  informed her that she would pass away on the following Thursday. Barbara had no doubt that her  husband had appeared to her, nor did she doubt that she only had less than a week to live; in fact,  she began to make concrete plans for her death. On Sunday at church she bore her testimony and bid  the ward members good-bye. During the coming days she withdrew her savings from the bank, ordered  her casket from a local mortuary, paid her bills, and even had the power and water turned off at her  home. Then she went to her daughter Mabel's home to await her passing.<br><br>President Benson  concluded:<br><br><i>On the day of her passing, Mabel came into the room where her mother  was reclining on the bed. Her mother said, "Mabel, I feel a little bit drowsy. I feel I will go to  sleep. Do not disturb me if I sleep until the eventide."</i><br><br><i>Those were her last words,  and she peacefully passed away.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>It is my testimony that angels are  agents of love, light, and power. The Lord's angels exist because of Jesus Christ and His infinite  Atonement. I testify that angels appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I also testify that the  sacred work of angels continues in our day. In the name of Jesus Christ,  amen.<br><br><i>Donald W. Parry was a professor of the Hebrew  Bible in the BYU Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages when this devotional was given on 31 July 2012.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ions and Memories - August 2012 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am always grateful to participate in these  commencement activities and once again add my commendations and congratulations to those being  honored as well as to all who have supported and continue to support, encourage, and commend our  graduates. I see not only many happy and proud faces but also some signs of significant relief and  perhaps even a little apprehension with respect to what the future holds. For some, this special  celebration is being shared in a rather brief period of time with other cardinal life events, such  as an engagement, a marriage, the birth of a child, a new job, or a move to a new and distant place.  For all, this is a wonderful time to both celebrate and remember.<br><br>As is always the case, our  graduates are diverse in age, experience, birthplace, citizenship, major, and many other ways. All,  however, share the singular achievement of a Brigham Young University degree, which will help guide  and define each one for the rest of mortality. Beyond that, I have no specific information to  share.<br><br>I have been attending commencement and graduation exercises for many years. Some  are much more memorable than are others. For a number of you here today--and this includes more than  the graduates honored--this occasion will have an influence on the rest of your lives. It will have  nothing to do with what I or the others on the program will say. You will receive good counsel,  well-deserved commendation, and encouragement. I suggest you listen carefully, because all the  messages have been thoughtfully and prayerfully prepared. Nevertheless, they likely will not be the  primary source of the memories you will cherish, except, perhaps, for the speakers themselves and  their families. Let me illustrate what I mean, if I may, with a very personal experience that has  had great influence on my family andme.<br><br>I was about ten years old when I had the  privilege of attending the commencement in which my father received his PhD degree. He, like many of  you here, was not a traditional student in that he had not gone directly from high school to the  university and progressed through undergraduate and graduate studies without interruption, except  for perhaps a mission.<br><br>No one in my father's family had ever gone to college or a  university before. After he graduated from high school, my dad spent a year in business college and  obtained employment as a bookkeeper. Even though this was the time of the onset of the Great  Depression, because of his tremendous frugality, hard work, and planning and also because of the  efforts of his parents--my grandparents--he was able to serve a full-time mission when relatively few  others had that opportunity. When he returned home, he was again gainfully employed but harbored a  rather closely held dream of a university education. After his mission Dad met my mother, and things  obviously developed as they should, since you see me standing here.<br><br>As my father shared  his dreams with my mother, already a university graduate and a schoolteacher herself, she encouraged  him to proceed with his education, although he was not receiving the same encouragement from his  parents, siblings, or friends. Most thought he was very fortunate just to have a job when few others  did.<br><br>One very important detail in understanding my parents' situation is that at that time  married women were not allowed to teach school. Since they had no other obvious means for financial  support if Dad quit his job to go to college and Mother quit her teaching to get married, they made  the decision to delay marriage so that both could live at home with their parents while Mother  taught and Dad studied. By the way, we do not recommend this as an ideal approach and are grateful  that there are additional alternatives available today, as many of you have  demonstrated.<br><br>Dad began college as a twenty-five-year-old freshman, and Mother taught and  saved what she could. He graduated in three years, going year-round, and shortly thereafter they  were married. I arrived about a year and a half later, and my four siblings took their turns joining  the family. Mother stayed home and Dad worked in various areas of education and administration while  working on his master's degree, which he received a year or two later. Rather than satisfying him,  however, his university experience only increased his desire for learning and helped focus his  ambition of becoming a university professor. Thus--again with Mother's encouragement--he began a PhD  program while working full-time.<br><br>As I look at you doctoral candidates, you will best  understand what I next explain. When the time arrived for the dissertation, it became clear that my  father would need to work on it full-time if he ever wished to complete his degree. So he resigned a  very good administrative leadership position at a vocational school to finish his dissertation.  Because by this time he had four children with another on the way, he also found the need to work  nights as a laborer so that his days would be free for his academic work and his children could  still eat and wear shoes. I see some of you nodding knowingly.<br><br>Well, he successfully  completed his work and received his PhD. I remember his smile, my mother's grateful tears that this  was all over, and my feeling of tremendous pride in his achievement, even though I had precious  little understanding of what it really meant. Now, decades later, I realize that this struggle to  reach an important academic goal, celebrated in a happy commencement exercise, has had broad and  lasting influence. Many of his descendants have followed with similar achievements in education,  law, business, medicine, and other fields, but with fewer obstacles and discouragements because of  the examples they have been able to follow. Even today one of the participants in our stage party is  wearing my father's doctoral robe and hood.<br><br>Please remember that while none of you will  have exactly the same experience or story as that which I have just related, all of you have a story  and are part of a grand legacy that will bless not only you and those with you today but will reach  on through the generations and over space to bless many others for years to come.<br><br>And as  we think of your sacrifices and those of your families and others who deserve credit with you for  your accomplishments, we must never forget those throughout the world who may feel as my father did  in his late teens. Although they may not have the opportunity for a university education or a BYU  experience themselves, they still faithfully pay their tithes and offerings, which allow us to  study, learn, grow, and serve at this unique and wonderful institution known as Brigham Young  University.<br><br>May God bless you and yours and all who play a role in the tremendous  enterprise of education in this unique university sponsored and supported by the Lord's apostles and  prophets. Our Father in Heaven and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, live and direct Their important  work upon the earth today. I know you join me in sustaining and thanking our prophet leaders for the  privileges we enjoy here. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham  Young University when this commencement address was given on 9August 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young  University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>d at Our Doorstep - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, Brother Beck, distinguished visitors, faculty, friends, family, and fellow graduates: I am honored to be here today. I am a native of Provo. My dad is a professor here at BYU, and I grew up in and around campus, eating at the Cougareat and attending Saturday Safari at the Bean Museum. But when it came time for me to apply to college, BYU was at the bottom of my list. I wanted to go out and see the world. The last thing I wanted to do was spend another four years in Provo.<br><br>Yet, four years later, here I am, and I can ­honestly say that I am honored and grateful to be a graduate of Brigham Young University. As you entered campus today, you might have seen a sign proclaiming, "The world is our campus." If you've spent a lot of time here, you may have also heard a parody of that motto: "The world is our campus--and campus is our world." Well, both of these are true--in very positive ways.<br><br>When I first arrived at BYU, I did everything I could to get away and see the world--without actually leaving BYU. On campus, I lived in the German House--living, speaking, and even cooking in a foreign language. From among BYU's fifty languages I also chose to study Welsh, Tibetan, and Turkish. I studied abroad in the United Kingdom and in Sweden. The wonderful--and ironic--thing is that despite my initial reluctance to come to BYU, it was BYU that enabled me to have those world experiences I longed for.<br><br>But BYU had even more to offer. At the start of my junior year I had just returned from a summer in Sweden. I was reluctant to come back to "boring, old Provo." I was really antsy; I wanted to go places and do things all the time. So I did that the only way I could--by turning my wanderlust toward something closer to home. Campus became my world. Istarted exploring every corner of BYU: from Wymount to the Maeser Building and the neighborhoods south of campus. And as I looked at everything with new eyes, I found itjust as beautiful and fascinating as more exotic locations.<br><br>At the same time, I was anxious to replace the relationships I had made in Sweden. I started talking more with my classmates and professors, making new friends and paving the way for research opportunities. I also enrolled in a family history class. The more I learned about my heritage, the more interested I became in other people's life stories and the more easily I made connections with others. I began to see that it really wasn't the where that mattered, it was my attitude and perspective that made all the difference. Campus was my world, but when I really looked, what a world it was!<br><br>Last summer I was "stranded" in Provo. A younger me might have gone stir-crazy, but the older me had learned better. I took up a new hobby: visiting as many pioneer museums as I could from here to Cedar City--and I made my younger sister come with me. Nearly every town has a little cabin dedicated to the town's original settlers. I thought my sister would quickly tire of seeing cabin after cabin of pioneer artifacts that tended to look the same no matter where you were. But after a few weeks of this, she and I both looked forward to each new cabin--not necessarily because of the artifacts but because of the caretakers, who were often both incredible old people and incredibly old people.<br><br>Through stories of both the long dead and the very much alive, we learned about the strength of human endurance and the capacity to live joyously. In Alpine a man reverently described his ancestor's long wintry treks to Salt Lake City. In Mona a couple cheerfully shared story after story from their own lives, such as when the young husband tried to help his wife milk the cow and sent her into a pile of manure instead, or the time the wife had gotten tired of the family's pet goat and served it to them for dinner.<br><br>At those tiny museums the historic surroundings were the backdrop for something far more important. As we listen to the stories of others, we form invisible connections that bind us to our ancestors and to strangers. These connections can be both fulfilling and compelling, driving us to strengthen relationships, to develop new friendships, and, ultimately, to make the world a better place. Perhaps the greatest learning we will have achieved at BYU comes from the experiences of interacting with others: learning about the world, learning how to learn, and developing our character in preparation for going out into the world.<br><br>So now I encourage you to do just that. Go out into the world, no matter how large or small that may be for you. Find a passion. Learn from your fellow men and women. Make a difference. I believe in you, Class of 2012.<br><br><i>Julianne Long spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 9August 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
The sight of this  sea of blue robes is impressive and inspiring, and this collective vision is the evidence of your  individual dedication and sacrifice. We recognize that your graduation today was not easily  accomplished. But then, you did not come to BYU because it was easy.<br><br>As the rover  <i>Curiosity</i>begins the exploration of Mars this week, let us look back already fifty years ago,  when President JohnF. Kennedy challenged the Rice University student body and the nation to seek  new and difficult horizons. He proposed the conquest of literally reaching for the moon. He said:<br><br><i>Some say, . . . why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest  mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</i>[Why does BYU play  Utah, Boise State, George Tech, or Notre Dame?]<br><br><i>. . . We choose to go to the moon in this  decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that  goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge  is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to  win.</i>[John F. Kennedy, "Moon Speech" to Rice University, 12September 1962, Houston, Texas;  http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm]<br><br>Our audience in the Marriott Center today is filled  with students who were not willing to accept anything less than the challenge of a BYU  education--even when such an education seemed unlikely or even impossible.<br><br>Only 56 percent of  the freshmen who applied for BYU's upcoming class were ­admitted--the lowest acceptance rate  ever. One of your fellow graduates, Megan Nelson Olsen, was a casualty of the tough admissions  standards at BYU as a freshman, but she refused to abandon her dream of graduating from this  university. She persevered and ­developed a new plan. Her goal was clear, and, even when she  got discouraged, she relied on prayer and never stopped believing in her goal. After excelling in  her studies, Megan was admitted to BYU winter semester 2010. Megan's experiences at BYU and, also  important, the process of getting into BYU, were life changing. Once admitted, she was an  enthusiastic student body member. She felt it was a blessing to study here and never took her  opportunities for granted.<br><br>Another student, Bryon Glazier, is also graduating today, having  completed the executive MBA program. This program allowed Bryon to return to BYU after eight years  and pursue an advanced degree while supporting his wife and their growing family. His wife, Sherry,  had previously postponed her own BYU experience when she discovered a cancerous tumor in her leg  just weeks before her freshman year was to begin. When Bryon entered the program, Sherry was  pregnant and caring for their four-year-old twins. Bryon sacrificed sleep, time with his family, and  even attending BYU sporting events. Everyone who knows Bryon knows this was a tremendous sacrifice.  (Although he does admit to missing one class to see Jimmer play in his last home game.) Through the  perseverance often required by struggling young student families, Bryon and Sherry learned they  could do hard things in the short-term to achieve success in their long-term goals. Although  graduation diplomas are individually awarded, they are often the result of a combined  effort.<br><br>Many of your sacrifices mirror the experiences of these students. Make sure you take  time today to thank all those who have helped you to be here today. Congratulations to Megan, Bryon,  and all of the graduates for your tremendous accomplishments.<br><br>Allow me to share some counsel  that President Gordon B. Hinckley offered at BYU's 1999 commencement:<br><br><i>Go forward now with  your lives. Take from this institution the faith that has nurtured and sustained you while you have  been here. Take with you the great values under which you have lived while you have been here--not  only the knowledge that you have gained in your classrooms but also that inner thing which speaks  and says, "I can do a little better than I have been doing." Take that with you, please.</i>[BYU  commencement remarks, 12 August 1999]<br><br>Continue to give your all in all that you do. Take with  you the pride of being a BYU graduate. Give back to the university whenever and however you can.  Take a moment to reflect how far you have come.<br><br>A BYU education is not easy to accomplish. But  you have retooled, refocused, and refined yourselves by experiencing a university that blends  secular and spiritual truths. Congratulations, Cougars.<br><br>As president of the Alumni  Association, Ihereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University  Alumni Association. Again, we offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association  of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful  activities associated with the university.<br><br>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,  amen.<br><br><i>Michael O'Connor was president of the BYU Alumni  Association when this commencement address was given on 9August 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>tity and Our Destiny - Tad R. Callister - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In keeping with the theme of this week, Iwould like to discuss with you a vision of who we are and what we may become. At a recent training session for General Authorities, the question was asked: "How can we help those struggling with pornography?"<br><br>Elder Russell M. Nelson stood and replied, "Teach them their identity and their purpose."<br><br>That answer resonated with me, not only as a response to that specific question but as an appropriate response to most of the challenges we face in life. And so today I speak of the true nature of our identity and a correct vision of our divine destiny.<br><br>First, our identity. There is a sentiment among many in the world that we are the spirit creations of God, just as a building is the creation of its architect or a painting the creation of its painter or an invention the creation of its inventor. The scriptures teach, however, a much different doctrine. They teach that we are more than creations of God; they teach that we are the literal spirit offspring or children of God our Father.<sup>1</sup>What difference does this doctrinal distinction make? The difference is monumental in its consequence because our identity determines in large measure our destiny. For example, can a mere creation ever become like its creator? Can a building ever become an architect? A painting a painter? Or an invention an inventor? If not, then those who believe we are creations of God, rather than His spirit offspring, reach the inevitable conclusion that we do not have the capacity to become like our creator, God. In essence, their doctrine of identity has defined and dictated a diminished destiny.<br><br>On the other hand, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that we are the spirit offspring of God with inherited spiritual traits that give us the divine potential to become like our parent, God the Father. As to this identity, President Packer has written:<br><br><i>You are a child of God. He is the father of your spirit. Spiritually you are of noble birth, the offspring of the King of Heaven. Fix that truth in your mind and hold to it. However many generations in your mortal ancestry, no matter what race or people you represent, the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line. You are a child of God!</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>It is this doctrine of identity that defines our potential destiny of godhood. If one does not correctly understand his divine identity, then he will never correctly understand his divine destiny. They are, in truth, inseparable partners.<br><br>What, then, has God revealed to us about our destiny? He has spoken clearly and frequently and forthrightly on this subject from the very beginning. When Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, they lived in a state of innocence--meaning they only had a limited knowledge of good and evil. Lehi described their condition as follows: "Wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin" (2 Nephi 2:23).<br><br>Suppose for a moment my wife and I invited one of you good Saints from California to drive to our home in Utah. Further suppose I asked you to drive in neutral.<br><br>You might smile and respond, "That's not possible."<br><br>What if I further replied, "Just push the accelerator all the way to the floor--you know, as they say, 'Push the pedal to the metal.'"<br><br>You might respond, "That would make no difference. I cannot reach your destination until I put my car in gear."<br><br>So it was with Adam and Eve. They were in a state of spiritual neutral and could not progress toward their divine destiny until they were cast out of the garden and thus put in spiritual gear.<br><br>When Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden ofEden, they traded their innocence, meaning a lack of knowledge of good and evil, for the prospect of perfection--that was the deal. Innocence and perfection are not the same. An infant may be innocent but certainly not perfect in the sense that he or she has acquired all the attributes of godliness. Once Adam and Eve were cast from the garden, we read in the book of Genesis that God Himself said, "Behold,<i>the man is become as one of us</i>[meaning like the gods]" (Genesis 3:22; emphasis added). How could that be? God then tells us why this new destiny was possible--because men now "know good and evil." Being immersed in a world of good and evil, having the capacity to choose, and being able to draw upon the powers of the Atonement resulted in man having unlimited opportunities to progress toward his destiny of godhood.<br><br>We learn a great doctrinal truth in these series of events surrounding the Garden of Eden: unfallen man would have remained in a state of innocence--safe, but restricted in his progress. On the other hand, fallen man ventured into a heightened arena of risk, but, blessed with the Atonement of Jesus Christ, he gained access to unlimited possibilities and powers and potential. Speaking of the effect of the Atonement on fallen man, C. S. Lewis remarked:<br><br><i>For God is not merely mending, not simply restoring astatus quo.<b> Redeemed humanity is to be something more glorious than unfallen humanity would have been,</b>more glorious than any unfallen race now is. . . . And this super-added glory will, with true vicariousness, exalt all creatures.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, God can exalt all His children--meaning empower them to become like Him.<br><br>But one might ask, "Why does God want us to become like Him?" In order to answer that question, one must first understand why man exists. Lehi gave the short and simple answer: "Men are, that they might have joy" (2Nephi 2:25). President David O. McKay confirmed that fundamental doctrinal truth: "Happiness is the purpose and design of existence."<sup>4</sup>If I were to ask you who is the happiest being in all the universe--the one with the most joy--you would no doubt respond, "God." Accordingly, God wants us to become perfect like Him so we can experience His quality of joy and thus best fulfill the measure of our existence. That is why His plan for us is sometimes called "the plan of happiness" (see Alma 42:8, 16).<br><h2><b>Our Quest for Godhood</b></h2><br>In spite of God's altruistic aims on our behalf, perhaps no doctrine, no teaching, no philosophy has stirred such controversy as has this: that man may become a god. It is espoused by some as blasphemous, by others as absurd. Such a concept, they challenge, lowers God to the status of man and thus deprives God of both His dignity and divinity. Others claim this teaching to be devoid of scriptural support. It is but a fantasy, they say, of a young, uneducated schoolboy, Joseph Smith. Certainly no God-fearing, right-thinking, Bible-oriented person would subscribe to such a philosophy as this.<sup>5</sup>While some of these advocates are hardened critics, others are honest and bright men who simply disagree with us on this doctrine. So wherein lies the truth? Hopefully the following will invite the Holy Ghost to whisper the quiet but certain truth to all those who honestly seek it.<br><br>For our search of truth, we will turn to five witnesses--first and foremost to the testimony of the scriptures; second, to the witness of the early Christian writers; third, to the wisdom of those poets and authors who drink from the divine well; fourth, to the power of logic; and fifth, to the voice of history.<br><h3><i><b>Scriptures</b></i></h3><br>First, the scriptures. Did not an angel appear unto Abraham and extend to him this heavenly mandate: "Walk before me, and be thou perfect" (Genesis 17:1)?<br><br>"That is true," interjects the critic. "Perfect as compared to other men, other mortals--certainly not perfect as compared to God. The word was used in its relative, not absolute sense."<br><br>"Is that so?" comes the reply. "Let us then pursue the use of the word<i>perfect</i>as used by the Savior Himself."<br><br>It was in the Sermon on the Mount when the Savior declared, "Be ye therefore perfect,<i>even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect"</i>(Matthew 5:48; emphasis added).<sup>6</sup>Was the Savior inviting men to be perfect as compared to other men--other mortals--or as compared to God Himself? This command was consistent with the Savior's high priestly prayer. Speaking of the believers, He petitioned the Father:<br><br><i>That they may be one, even as we are one:</i><br><br><i>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</i>[John 17:22–23]<br><br>In accord with that request for perfection, Paul taught that a critical purpose of the Church was "for the perfecting of the saints . . . till we all come . . . unto a perfect man,<i>unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"</i>(Ephesians 4:12–13; emphasis added). Note the measuring rod: not man, not some form of mini-Christ or quasi-God, but rather that we should become "a perfect man, [and then he gives us the standard we should strive for] unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." Does that sound relative to you?<br><br>The critic is momentarily quiet. Sheepishly he responds, "Certainly those scriptures must mean something else."<br><br>The scriptures supporting this doctrine, however, continue to roll forth with repeated and powerful testimony. At one point the Savior was about to be stoned by the Jews for blasphemy. He reminded them of His good works and then asked, "For which of those works do ye stone me?"<br><br>They replied that they were not stoning him for good works "but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,<i>makest thyself God."</i><br><br>To this He readily acknowledged that He was and declared that they should be likewise: "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" (John 10:32–34; emphasis added). In other words, He said not only am I a god, but all of you are potential gods. He was referring to His own Old Testament declaration, with which the Jews should have been familiar: "Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High" (Psalm 82:6). The Savior was merely reaffirming a basic gospel teaching that all men are children of God, and thus all might become like Him.<br><br>Paul understood this principle, for, when speaking to the men of Athens, he said: "Certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring" (Acts 17:28). Paul knew the consequences of being the offspring of God, for, while speaking to the Romans, he declared:<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,<b>and joint-heirs with Christ.</b></i>[Romans 8:16–17; emphasis added; see also 1 Corinthians 3:21–23 and Revelation 21:7]<br><br>Not subordinate heirs, not junior, not contingent, but joint, equal heirs with Christ Himself, to share in all that He shall share. After all, is not that the same promise made by the Lord to the Apostle John? "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne" (Revelation 3:21).<br><br>Is it any wonder that Paul should write to the Saints of Philippi, "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 3:14). Paul, who understood so very well our destiny, was striving for the reward of godhood. Peter, who also understood this doctrine, pled with the Saints that they might become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4), meaning recipients of godhood. That is exactly what Jesus ordered when speaking to the Book of Mormon Saints: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27; see also 1 John 3:2). And it is exactly what the Savior promised in this dispensation for all faithful Saints: "Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 132:20; see also verse 19; see also D&amp;amp;C 76:58–60).<br><br>The critic, still shaking his head, responds, "But such a concept lowers God to the status of man and thus robs Him of His divinity."<br><br>"Or, to the contrary," comes the reply, "does it elevate man in his divine-like potential?"<br><br>Paul well knew this argument of the critic and silenced it once and for all ages ago. Speaking to the Saints of Philippi, he said:<br><br><i>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</i><br><br><i>Who, being in the form of God,<b>thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</b></i>[Philippians 2:5–6; emphasis added]<br><br>The Savior knew that for Him to be a god and for us to be thus minded would not rob God of His divinity. That makes good sense. After all, who is greater: that being who limits or that being who enhances man's eternal progress?<br><br>One might ask, Who can give greater honor and glory to God--a creature of lower or more exalted status? Can an animal offer the same honor or worship with the same passion and intensity as a human? Can a mere mortal express the empyreal feelings or exercise the spiritual fervency of a potential god? One's capacity to honor and worship is magnified with one's intellectual, emotional, cultural, and spiritual enlightenment. Accordingly, the more we become like God, the greater our ability to pay Him homage. In that process of lifting men heavenward, God simultaneously multiplies His own honor and glory and thus is glorified more, not less.<br><br>Brigham Young addressed this issue:<br><br>[Man's godhood]<i>will not detract anything from the glory and might of our heavenly Father, for he will still remain our Father, and we shall still be subject to him, and as we progress, in glory and power it the more enhances the glory and power of our heavenly Father.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>That is the irony of the critic's argument--godhood for man does not diminish God's status; to the contrary, it elevates it by producing more intelligent, more passionate, more spiritual Saints who have enlarged capacities to understand, honor, and worship Him.<br><br>The Savior's soul-stirring and thought-provoking injunction to "be ye therefore perfect" was more than the sounding of brass or tinkling of cymbals (see 1 Corinthians 13:1). It was a divine-like invitation to rise up to our full potential and become like God our Father. C.S.Lewis, as a rampant advocate of this simple but glorious truth, wrote:<br><br><i>The command</i>Be ye perfect<i>is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command. He said (in the Bible) that we were "gods" and He is going to make good His words. ... The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Could it be any clearer?<br><h3><i><b>Early Christian Writers</b></i></h3><br>Second, early Christian writers likewise wrote of our divine destiny.<sup>9</sup>As early as the second century, Irenaeus (A.D. 115–202) noted: "We have not been made gods from the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods."<sup>10</sup>On another occasion Irenaeus clarified that exalted man would not be relegated to some type of glorified angel but literally become a god: "Passing beyond the angels, and be made after the image and likeness of God."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Clement of Alexandria (A.D. 160–200), a contemporary of Irenaeus, spoke of the reward of godhood that followed long preparation: "Being destined to sit on thrones with the other gods that have been first put in their places by the Saviour."<sup>12</sup>This same Clement of Alexandria then added this unequivocal statement about the man who lives a righteous life: "Knowing God, he will be made like God. . . . And<i>that man becomes God, since God so wills."</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Hippolytus (A.D. 170–236), bridging the second and third centuries, spoke of the unlimited potential of faithful Saints in this life: "And thou shalt be a companion of the Deity, and a<i>co-heir</i>with Christ. . . .<i>For thou hast become God: . . . thou hast been deified,</i>and begotten unto immortality."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Cyprian (A.D. 200–258), a well-known Christian leader of the third century, reaffirmed that men can become like Christ: "What Christ is, we Christians shall be, if we imitate Christ."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Origen (A.D. 185–255), also of the third century, wrote: "The true God [referring to the Father], then, is 'The God,' and those who are formed after Him are gods, images, as it were, of Him the prototype."<sup>16</sup><br><br>And in the fourth century St. Athanasius of Alexandria (A.D. 295–373) explained that "[God] was made flesh in order that we might be enabled to be made gods."<sup>17</sup><br><br>For several centuries this doctrinal truth survived, but eventually the Apostasy took its toll, and this doctrine in its purity and expansiveness was lost. The doctrine of man's potential for godhood as taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith was not his invention--not his creation, not conjured up by some fertile mind. It was simply and solely a restoration of a glorious truth that had been taught in the scriptures and by many early Christian writers of the primitive Church.<br><h3><i><b>Poets and Authors</b></i></h3><br>The third witness--inspired poets and authors. We may look to the wisdom of selected poets and authors who are men of integrity and spiritual insight. It was C. S. Lewis who again and again reaffirmed this divine proposition:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which . . . you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no ordinary people.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>How right he was. There are no ordinary people, only potential gods and goddesses in our midst.<br><br>It was Victor Hugo, that masterful author, who said, "The thirst for the infinite proves infinity."<sup>19</sup>What a powerful and sublime thought. Perhaps the thirst for godhood likewise proves godhood. Would the God you and I know plant the vision and desire for godhood within a man's soul and then frustrate him in his ability to attain it? Shakespeare had a flash of this insight, for, when speaking through the lips of Hamlet, he said:<br><br><i>What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god!</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Robert Browning's vision that so often pierced the mortal veil did so once again in these lines from his poem<i>Rabbi Ben Ezra:</i><br><br><i>Life's struggle having so far reached its term.</i><br><br><i>Thence shall I pass, approved</i><br><br><i>A man, for aye removed</i> <i>From the developed brute--a god, though in the germ.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>This insightful poet saw the seeds and germ of godhood in every man.<br><h3><i><b>Logic</b></i></h3><br>The fourth witness is the power of logic. Do not the laws of science teach us that like begets like, each after its kind? Science has taught us that a complex genetic code transferred from parent to child is responsible for the child attaining the physical attributes of his parents. If this be so, is it illogical to assume that spirit offspring receive a spiritual code giving to them the divine characteristics and potential of their parent--God--thus making them gods in embryo? No, it is but a fulfillment of the law that like begets like. This is the same truth taught by the prophet Lorenzo Snow:<br><br><i>We were born in the image of God our Father; He begat us like unto Himself.<b>There is the nature of Deity in the composition of our spiritual organization.</b>In our spiritual birth, our Father transmitted to us the capabilities, powers and faculties which He possessed, as much so as the child on its mother's bosom possesses, although in an undeveloped state, the faculties, powers and susceptibilities of its parent.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>President Boyd K. Packer told of coming home one day and helping his children gather new chicks in the barn. As his little four-year-old daughter held a baby chick in her hands, he said something like, "Won't that be a beautiful dog when it grows up?"<br><br>His daughter looked at him in surprise.<br><br>And then he said something like, "Or perhaps it will be a cat or even a cow."<br><br>His little daughter wrinkled her nose, as if to say, "Daddy, don't you know anything? It will grow up exactly like its parents."<br><br>Then he observed how this little four-year-old girl knew, almost instinctively, that the chick would grow up to follow the pattern of its parentage.<sup>23</sup><br><br>The Gospel of Philip, an apocryphal book, makes this simple statement of logic: "A horse sires a horse, a man begets man, a god brings forth a god."<sup>24</sup>The difference between man and God is significant--but it is one of degree, not kind. It is the difference between an acorn and an oak tree, a rosebud and a rose, a son and a father. In truth, every man is a potential god in embryo, in fulfillment of that eternal law that like begets like.<br><h3><i><b>Voice of History</b></i></h3><br>Fifth, and finally, the voice of history will likewise verify this truth. I recall the story of the large milk truck that drove past the pasture of cows. Written on the side of the vehicle in large letters were the words "Homogenized, Pasteurized, Vitamins A and D Added."<br><br>One cow looked at the sign, turned to the other, and said, "Makes you feel kind of inadequate, doesn't it?"<br><br>I admit that is how I feel when I look at the distance between God and me, but I take comfort when I contemplate what is accomplished in the short space of a mortal life. I paraphrase these thoughts of B.H.Roberts: From the cradle have risen orators, generals, artists, and workers to perform the wonders of our age. From a helpless babe may arise a Demosthenes or Lincoln to direct the destinies of nations. From such a babe may come a Michelangelo to fill the world with beauty. From such a beginning may come a Mozart, a Beethoven to call from silence the powers and serenity of music. From such a helpless babe may arise a Joseph Smith to give light in a world of darkness.<sup>25</sup><br><br>Contemplate for a moment what can be accomplished in the short space of a mortal life. Suppose now that you were to remove from man the barriers of death and grant him immortality and God for his guide. What limits would you then want to ascribe to his mental, moral, or spiritual achievements? Perhaps B. H. Roberts expressed it best when he said:<br><br><i>If within the short space of mortal life there are men who rise up out of infancy and become masters of the elements of fire and water and earth and air, so that they well-nigh rule them as Gods, what may it not be possible for them to do in a few hundreds or thousands of millions of years?</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>A glimpse beyond the veil tells us that the records of history do not end at death but continue to mark man's unlimited achievements. Victor Hugo, with an almost spiritual X-ray, saw the possibilities after death:<br><br><i>The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. . . . For half a century I have been writing my thoughts in prose and verse; history. ... I have tried all. But I feel I have not said a thousandth part of what is in me. When I go down to the grave, I can say, like so many others, "I have finished my day's work," but I can not say, "I have finished my life." My day's work will begin again the next morning. The tomb is not a blind alley; it is a thoroughfare. . . . My work is only beginning.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Perfection is a quest on both sides of the veil. The scriptures remind us, "Wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected" (D&amp;amp;C 67:13).<br><h2><b>The Divine Possibility Becomes a Divine Reality</b></h2><br>The scriptures, early Christian writers, poetry, logic, and history testify not only of the divine possibility but of the divine reality that man may become as God. The Doctrine and Covenants refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, declaring, "And because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, ... and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods" (D&amp;amp;C 132:37). For these men the divine possibility became the divine reality. This does not mean they became gods who replaced our Father in Heaven but rather exalted men who have enlarged capabilities to honor and glorify Him. Our Father in Heaven will forever stand supreme as our God, whom we will love and revere and worship, worlds without end.<br><br>But how is it possible that you and I, with all our faults and weaknesses and shortcomings, could ever become a god? Fortunately, a loving Heavenly Father has given us resources to lift us above our mortal restraints and propel us to divine heights. I mention but two such resources, both made possible because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, whose crowning aim is to assist us in our pursuit of godhood--so that we might be "at one"--not only with Him but also "at one" like Him. First, I mention the saving ordinances of the kingdom.<br><br>Joseph Smith received a revelation that explained the relationship between ordinances and godhood:<br><br><i>Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i><br><br><i>And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:20–21]<br><br>In other words, participation in the saving ordinances unlocks and unleashes certain powers of godliness in our lives that are not available in any other way. These powers help refine us and perfect us. The five saving ordinances and the corresponding powers of godliness are as follows:<br><br><i>First, baptism by immersion (and the corollary ordinance of the sacrament).</i>Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, this ordinance cleanses us from our sins and helps make us holy, thus aligning our life more closely with the Savior's.<br><br><i>Second, the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i>This gift helps us know "the will of the Lord [and] the mind of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 68:4) and thus makes possible our acquisition of a more godlike mind.<br><br><i>Third, the priesthood.</i>This ordinance transfers to a mere mortal the power to act for God on earth as though He Himself were present. In essence, it is a spiritual power of attorney to be God's agent and to invoke His power, thus helping us learn how to exercise divine powers in righteousness.<br><br><i>Fourth, the endowment.</i>This ordinance is a gift of knowledge from God as to how we might become more like Him, accompanied by covenants to inspire us in that endeavor. There is an old saying, "Knowledge is power." Accordingly, the righteous use of this knowledge received in the endowment ordinance results in more godly power in our own lives. That is why the Doctrine and Covenants says, "I design to endow those whom I have chosen with power from on high" (D&amp;amp;C 95:8).<br><br><i>Fifth, the sealing ordinances.</i>Death, with all its mighty power, cannot destroy those relationships sealed in a temple--which relationships can now continue beyond the grave and allow us, like God, to have eternal increase.<br><br>The saving ordinances are much more than a checklist of actions we must satisfy to gain entrance to the celestial kingdom--they are the keys that open the doors to heavenly powers that can lift us above our mortal limitations.<br><br>The second resource to assist us in our pursuit of godhood is the gifts of the Spirit. What are the gifts of the Spirit? We know them as love, patience, knowledge, testimony, and so on.<sup>28</sup>In essence, each gift of the Spirit represents an attribute of godliness. Accordingly, each time we acquire a gift of the Spirit, we acquire a potential attribute of godliness. In this regard Orson Pratt taught:<br><br><i>One object</i>[of the Church]<i>is declared to be<b>"For the perfecting of the Saints." . . . The . . . plan ... for the accomplishment of this great object, is through the medium of the spiritual gifts. When the supernatural gifts of the Spirit cease, the Saints cease to be perfected,</b>therefore they can have no hopes of obtaining a perfect salvation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . In every nation and age, where believers exist, there the gifts must exist to perfect them.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>No wonder the Lord commands us to "covet earnestly the best gifts" (1 Corinthians 12:31); "seek ye earnestly the best gifts" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8); and to "lay hold upon every good gift" (Moroni 10:30).<br><br>President George Q. Cannon spoke of man's shortcomings and the divine solution. Recognizing the link between spiritual gifts and godhood, he fervently pleaded with the Saints to overcome each manifested weakness through the acquisition of a countermanding gift of strength known as the gift of the Spirit. He spoke as follows:<br><br><i><b>If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect. . . .</b>No man ought to say, "Oh, I cannot help this; it is my nature." He is not justified in it, for the reason that God has promised to give strength to correct these things, and to give gifts that will eradicate them. . . . He wants His Saints to be perfected in the truth. For this purpose He gives these gifts, and bestows them upon those who seek after them, in order that they may be a perfect people upon the face of the earth, notwithstanding their many weaknesses, because God has promised to give the gifts that are necessary for their perfection.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>What was the Lord's response to Solomon's prayerful request for the gift of an understanding heart? The scriptures record, "The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing," and then the Lord noted, "Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart" (1 Kings 3:10, 12).<br><br>When was the last time we prayed for a gift of the Spirit that would lift us above our mortal weakness and further our pursuit of godhood? Again and again the Lord has both invited and promised, "Ask, and it shall be given you" (Matthew 7:7).<br><br>Why is it so critical to have a correct vision of this divine destiny of godliness of which the scriptures and other witnesses so clearly testify? Because with increased vision comes increased motivation. Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote, "No doctrine is more basic, no doctrine embraces a greater incentive to personal righteousness . . . as does the wondrous concept that man can be as his Maker."<sup>31</sup>And why not possible? Do not all Christian churches advocate Christlike behavior? Is that not what the Sermon on the Mount is all about? If it is blasphemous to think we can become as God, then at what point is it not blasphemous to become like God--90 percent, 50 percent, 1 percent? Is it more Christian to seek partial godhood than total godhood? Are we invited to walk the path of godhood--to "be ye therefore perfect,<i>even</i>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect"--with no possibility of ever reaching the destination?<br><br>As we better understand our potential destiny, our level of self-worth and confidence and motivation is greatly heightened. Youth will understand that it is shortsighted at best to take easy classes and easy teachers rather than ones that will stretch them toward godhood. They will catch the vision that it is godhood, not grades, for which they are striving.<br><br>And what of our more elderly members? They will understand there is no such thing as a retirement farm, no day when the work is done. Like Victor Hugo, they know their work has only begun. There are yet thousands of books to read and write, paintings to enjoy, music to score, and service to render. They understand the Lord's revelation to the Prophet Joseph: "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18).<br><br>What about those of us who feel weaknesses in our life? We can take renewed hope in the words of the Lord to Moroni: "For if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27).<br><br>And what about those who believe they have sinned beyond Christ's redeeming grace? They can take comfort in His promise: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). Or perhaps there are some who believe their lives are shattered beyond repair. Can they not have renewed hope in these words of the Savior: "[I will] give unto them beauty for ashes" (Isaiah 61:3)? There is no problem, no obstacle to our divine destiny, for which the Savior's Atonement does not have a remedy of superior healing and lifting power. That is why Mormon said, "Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ" (Moroni 7:41).<br><br>How could we not have increased faith in God and in ourselves if we knew He had planted within our souls the seeds of godhood and endowed us with access to the powers of the Atonement? "<i>Godhood?</i>" If not, the critic must answer, "Why not?"<br><br>Perhaps we could suggest three answers for the critic's consideration: Maybe man cannot become like God because God does not have the power to create a divine-like offspring. It is beyond his present level of comprehension and intelligence.<br><br>"Blasphemous," responds the critic. "He has all knowledge and all power."<br><br>Perhaps then He has created a lesser offspring because He does not love us.<br><br>"Ridiculous, absurd," is his reply. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" (John 3:16).<br><br>Well, perhaps God has not planted within us the divine spark because He wants to retain godhood for Himself; He is threatened by our progress. He can only retain His superiority by asserting man's inferiority.<br><br>"No, no," laments the critic. "Have you ever known a loving, kindly father who didn't want his children to become all that he is and more?"<br><br>And so it is with God, our Father.<br><br>I testify there are no ordinary people, no ciphers, no zeros--only potential gods and goddesses in our midst. While many witnesses testify of this truth, the most powerful of all are the quiet whisperings of the Spirit that confirm both to my mind and to my heart the grandeur and truth of this glorious doctrine. As Jacob so taught, "The Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13).<br><br>I pray we will recognize our true identity as literal sons and daughters of God and grasp a vision of our divine destiny as it really may be. I pray we will be grateful to a loving Father and Son who made it so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Tad R.

In so doing we referred to an oft-cited scripture of the critics, Isaiah 43:10, which states, "Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me." Therefore the critics conclude that if there is no God before or after the Father, then man certainly could not become a god.<br><br>As fate would have it, several days thereafter one of our younger missionaries was knocking on a door. A distinguished man invited him in. The missionaries soon learned he was a theological professor at a local university. The man was polite but stated adamantly that Mormon doctrine was incorrect because it taught that a man might become a god, and, after all, the Bible teaches there is no god before or after the Father.<br><br>This fine young missionary was not taken back one bit. He simply replied, "Sir, do you know where that scripture is found?"<br><br>The man hesitated, "I can't recall exactly, but it is in the Bible."<br><br>The young missionary replied, "It is in Isaiah 43:10, but it is also found in Isaiah 44, 45, and 46." He further asked, "Do you recall the context in which it was given?"<br><br>The professor could not remember.<br><br>"Then," said the young missionary, "let me help you. God was reprimanding the Israelites because they were worshipping graven images and statues made with man's hands. On repeated occasions the Lord declared in these chapters that none of these images or statues, whether formed in the past or in the future, would ever be a god." In essence this young missionary explained that these verses had everything to do with the incapacity of graven images to become gods and absolutely nothing to do with man's capacity to become a god. He invited the professor to learn more about the truth concerning man's potential, but the invitation was declined.<br><br>6. The word<i>perfect</i>as used in this scripture comes from the Greek word<i>telios.</i>Some have suggested this might be translated as "finished" or "completed," resulting in a connotation other than moral perfection--perhaps meaning a complete or mature Saint. While this might be one interpretation, the scripture does not preclude a reference to moral perfection. In fact, when read in context, this passage seems to require moral perfection. It specifically delineates the type of completeness or perfection to which it is referring when it makes the comparison "<i>even</i>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (emphasis added). God is not perfect like a mature Saint or in a relative sense. He is absolutely perfect. It is of interest to note that both the King James Version and the New International Version of the Bible translate the word<i>telios</i>as "perfect."<br><br>7.<i>JD</i>10:5.<br><br>8. C. S. Lewis, "Counting the Cost,"<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), 174–75.<br><br>9. Some might contend that some references by early Christian writers to man's potential for godhood were simply alternative phrases for man's immortality, and in some cases this interpretation may be correct, but there are certainly multiple references by the early Christian writers to also evidence that these references to godhood were qualitative, not just quantitative, statements.<br><br>10.

<h1>e University in All of the World” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>In October 1975, President Spencer W. Kimball visited campus for the centennial celebration of Brigham Young University. As part of that celebration, President Kimball delivered a landmark address entitled "The Second Century of Brigham Young University." His charge, as he stated in the introduction, was to share "thoughts and impressions [he had] concerning Brigham Young University as it enter[ed] its second century."<sup>1</sup> That was thirty-seven years ago. We are now a third of the way through the second century, and one could legitimately ask where we are in achieving President Kimball's vision.</p><br><p>The university has changed rather significantly in those thirty-seven years. When President Kimball's address was delivered, BYU had 986 full-time faculty. Today our faculty complement is 1,562, over half again the size of the faculty in 1975. In fall semester of 1975, the university enrolled just over 26,000 students. Today there are nearly 33,000 students enrolled. There were 6,565 new-student applications for fall of 1975, of which 90 percent were admitted; 4,970 of those admitted enrolled for study.</p><br><p>I've heard President Samuelson share his recollection that "in the old days" General Authorities visiting stakes around the Church were encouraged to recruit students for attendance at BYU. What a stark contrast to today's environment where the university must advise interested LDS high school students about all options for pursuing a university education. This year there were a record 12,400 new-student applications, of which just 56 percent could be admitted--our lowest acceptance rate ever. The credentials for entering students have also changed since President Kimball delivered his second-century address. The freshman class of 1975 had an average ACT composite score of 22.9 and high school GPA of 3.3. The freshmen admitted this year have an average ACT score of 28.3 and a high school GPA of just over 3.8.</p><br><p>I don't share these statistics to boast but to illustrate the university's evolution in this second century and to highlight the tremendous challenge we face in accommodating more and more students who are better and better prepared. Because of our enrollment ceiling, we face the prospect of denying admission to students who would likely be successful here. Like me, I'm sure you hear this summary of applicant credentials and feel pressure to deliver an educational experience that is worthy of our student body. BYU's yield rate--the percentage of admitted students who enroll--is over 80 percent, the highest in the nation. Students are anxious to be here, and, if fortunate enough to be admitted, they come. I will share later some specific reasons our students seek to be here.</p><br><p>President Kimball began his second-century address with the following declaration and charge:</p><br><p><i>There are many ways in which BYU can tower above other universities--not simply because of the size of its student body or its beautiful campus, but because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world. . . . While you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i><sup>2</sup></p><br><p>Near the conclusion of President Kimball's address, he stated:</p><br><p><i>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"</i><sup>3</sup></p><br><p>This final declaration of President Kimball has been selected as the theme for this year's annual university conference, and in my remarks today I wish to try to articulate some of the dimensions in which we aspire to be unique and some ways in which we <i>are</i> unique relative to others in the academy. I emphasize that we share many of the same aspirations as the finest academic institutions across the country. We are anxious to provide an extraordinary academic experience for an extraordinary student body. Students who come to BYU could be educated very well at other universities, but, in the words of President Kimball, "Education on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with 'education for eternity.'" <sup>4</sup></p><br><p>Dr. George Lynn Cross was the longest-serving president of the University of Oklahoma, leading the university from 1943 to 1968 during a period of impressive growth. In describing Oklahoma's academic aspirations in relation to the university's strong athletic tradition, particularly as a football powerhouse, President Cross once told the Oklahoma state senate, "We want to build a university of which the football team can be proud." <sup>5</sup> We love our athletic teams at BYU and, tongue in cheek, might articulate the same aspiration for our academic programs. This humorous quip illustrates that the motivation for what we do at Brigham Young University is, in many defining ways, different from that which drives other institutions and faculty who hold appointments there.</p><br><p>In discussing today the distinctive nature of BYU, I hope to draw on university statements, prophetic declarations, personal observations, and a number of selections from a significant body of survey data collected and analyzed by the Office of Planning and Assessment. The survey data will come from four sources:</p><br><p>1. The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) is conducted by an independent national organization and invites input annually from our students and other university students across the nation. The survey gives us a chance to compare the BYU student experience, from our students' own responses, with that of other students in the national sample. The 2011 survey included 412,046 first-year and senior students from public and private universities covering all disciplines, including 5,217 BYU students.</p><br><p>2. The BYU Senior Survey is administered annually four to six weeks before graduation to all BYU students who are registered for graduation in December, April, and August. This survey focuses on dimensions of our students' experience that are of particular importance to us. Fifty percent of the 6,900 seniors who graduated in 2010–11 responded to the survey.</p><br><p>3. The Alumni Questionnaire is administered by BYU three years after graduation to alumni who were granted degrees. The questionnaire gives a snapshot of our students' impressions after they have completed their time here and have entered their immediate post-graduation pursuits. The most recent questionnaire was conducted for the 2008 graduation cohort and included surveys sent to 8,258 students, of which 45 percent responded.</p><br><p>4. The Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA surveys faculty every three years at colleges and universities that elect to participate. The 2010–11 HERI survey included responses from nearly 24,000 permanent faculty members of all ranks from 417 institutions of higher education. Data I will present today from that survey will be drawn only from our peer norm group: four-year public and private universities.</p><br><p>In presenting these survey results I express gratitude to Jim Gordon, Danny Olsen, and others in Planning and Assessment who collect and synthesize these data and who have provided them to me.</p><br><p><b>Mission and Aims</b></p><br><p>I begin with what is perhaps the most fundamental element in our uniqueness at BYU--our mission statement. Stated boldly on our website and in our promotional materials and declared to our accrediting body and other constituencies, "The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." <sup>6</sup></p><br><p>This statement might be seen as quite ambitious--perhaps even preposterous--by our colleagues at academic institutions elsewhere. Despite our shared faith in the restored gospel, the mission statement causes us on the faculty to swallow hard as we think about our contribution to this vision. But the mission statement guides fundamentally all aspirational and operational aspects of Brigham Young University: faculty hiring and retention, student admissions, care of the physical facilities, educational philosophy, student interactions both inside and outside the classroom, expectations for students and faculty in their personal and professional lives, management of resources, faculty scholarship and its contribution to our disciplines, and so on. The mission statement shapes how we view our students. In a sobering way our mission articulates the university's responsibility as stewards of the some 6,500 new students who arrive on campus each year.</p><br><p>The published aims of a BYU education are intimately aligned with the mission, as stated in our foundation documents:</p><br><p><i>BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives. . . .</i></p><br><p><i>. . . A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.</i><sup>7</sup></p><br><p>These aims are an offshoot of our doctrine. President Joseph Fielding Smith affirmed in an address to a BYU audience that "knowledge comes both by reason and by revelation." <sup>8</sup> It is to this lofty objective that we hold ourselves as faculty in our own learning, and we seek to equip and inspire our students to do the same.</p><br><p><b>Resources</b></p><br><p>The Church's significant and stable support of BYU and its programs is uncommon in the world of higher education. Not only has church support for religiously affiliated colleges and universities diminished over time, but, as a rule, public institutions are no longer resourced in a majority way from state legislatures. It is quite common for state appropriations to constitute less than half--often less than one-quarter--of the operating budget of public universities of our size. The remainder must be sought from tuition and soft revenue sources. By contrast, Church support for BYU is, by deliberate board-of-trustees decision, far above that. Isn't it interesting that in an era of increasingly tight resources we have enjoyed this stable ongoing resource support? I will mention this again later. Toward the end of an accreditation visit to campus recently, one of the site visitors, himself an administrator at a state university elsewhere, joked, "How can my university join the Church Educational System?"</p><br><p>In the past year it has been my responsibility to visit with teams invited from fine institutions elsewhere to review our academic programs in their areas of expertise. These reviewers are uniformly astonished to learn that we enjoy full salary support for all 1,500-plus faculty at the university. Elsewhere, university support often provides only a portion of faculty salary, and faculty are under pressure to find the remainder of their salary support from externally funded research. In addition to this faculty support, we at BYU are the beneficiaries of generous capital equipment support, regular computer replacement, travel, and needed supplies. The physical environment on campus is so extraordinarily well maintained, largely because of the Capital Needs Analysis (CNA) program, which carefully tracks and addresses facilities-related needs ranging from major power infrastructure to single light fixtures. Similar generous provision is made for maintaining technology through the Information Technology Infrastructure (ITI), Information Technology Software (ITS), and Information Technology Development (ITD) programs, designed to respond to hardware and software infrastructure needs on campus. These programs are a unique model among institutions of higher education. I express gratitude to Brian Evans, administrative vice president and chief financial officer, and Kelly Flanagan, chief information officer, for their management of these programs that benefit the campus community and particularly our academic operations. As I believe Brian and Kelly would both attest, the resources provided by the Church in these programs are the envy of their counterparts at universities elsewhere.</p><br><p>Given our unique mission--as President Kimball put it, to educate for eternity<sup>9</sup>--it should not surprise us that classrooms used to teach sociology and art history and biology during the week are home to sacred expressions of faith on Sunday. The campus tables used to administer the sacrament on the weekend are used during the week for laboratory demonstrations in the physical sciences and for display and study of archaeological artifacts. And those students who crowd campus sidewalks with overstuffed backpacks Monday through Friday populate the sidewalks carrying scriptures on the Sabbath. The Church's support for our facilities is a seamless integration of our desire to combine the sacred and the secular.</p><br><p><b>Students</b></p><br><p>BYU's student population is also distinctive, and increasingly so, in the world of higher education in a number of important ways. We've all smiled at BYU's place atop the Princeton Review's list of stone-cold sober schools (for fifteen years running) <sup>10</sup> and most religious students (for the seventeenth time in twenty years). <sup>11</sup> But our students are unique academically as well. I alluded earlier to differences between entering freshmen of 1975 and those admitted in 2012, and to the increasing challenge of trying to accommodate well-qualified applicants to the university. Of those admitted to the university this year, 45 percent bring a high school GPA above 3.9, 35 percent have achieved a composite ACT score of 30 or above, and 18 percent rank in the top five of their high school graduating class. Over 96 percent of those admitted to the university graduated from seminary, with roughly half attending early-morning seminary. Just over five in six received advanced placement credit for AP exams taken as part of high school coursework. There were 167 high school student body presidents in the freshman admits of 2012. Nine percent are first-generation college students in their family.</p><br><p>While the credentials of admitted students are impressive, the question we might ask is whether we are adding value to their superb pre-BYU preparation. The 2011 NSSE survey of university students reveals, not surprisingly, that a significantly higher number of BYU seniors have enrolled in foreign language coursework, and, in what can only be described as "off the charts" relative to university students on other campuses, our students have participated in activities to enhance their spirituality. <sup>12</sup> Ninety-three percent of freshmen felt BYU places substantial emphasis on academics, and 56 percent of them worked harder than they thought they could to meet faculty expectations. Both freshmen and seniors felt that exams strongly challenged them to do their best work at a rate somewhat above the report of the national sample. Interestingly, the survey also shows that while our freshmen and seniors report having written more papers of length shorter than five pages than the national cohort, fewer reported writing papers of twenty pages or longer. Further, somewhat fewer BYU students than their national counterparts report having worked on a paper that required integrating ideas or information from various sources. More BYU students indicate they have come to class without having completed readings or assignments. With their academic preparation prior to arriving on campus, one might ask whether BYU students would be below average in any of these categories, and this information is food for thought as we prepare our syllabi. By their senior year, half of our students report having participated in experiential learning--a practicum, internship, field experience, co-op, or clinical assignment. This is nearly identical to the national sample. Eighty-four percent of our seniors indicate that they have at least occasionally discussed career plans with faculty, and 30 percent have done research with a faculty member. This engagement with faculty in the classroom, in faculty offices, and in the studio and lab is a distinguishing feature of BYU.</p><br><p>With all of these curricular and extracurricular activities, our students still find time to work. Last year a record-number 14,000 BYU students were hired on campus--nearly half of the student body. This is compared to 10 percent of students nationally who are employed by the college or university they attend. <sup>13</sup> We are blessed that the university provides unusually strong financial support for teaching and research assistants. And, of course, I acknowledge the army of hardworking and disciplined students who are on campus at 4:00 a.m., keeping buildings clean and clearing snow from the sidewalks.</p><br><p>As part of the alumni questionnaire, former students are asked about factors that affected their choosing BYU. The data shown in figure 1 are from the most recent study of 2008 graduates. Our students' overwhelming expectation for rigorous intellectual stretching here is reflected by the fact that 85 percent of alumni rated as "extremely important" or "very important" developing intellectual skills as their reason for choosing BYU. Not far behind in importance, 73 percent give the same weight to obtaining a spiritual, religiously based education. To our students, the combination of a spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging educational experience, stated explicitly in our aims, is paramount. Roughly two-thirds of BYU alumni (68 percent) also acknowledge the importance of preparing for a career as their reason for choosing BYU. Forty-four percent confessed that it was important to come to BYU for the social life and 32 percent to find a spouse. One in six (16 percent) report having chosen BYU to satisfy expectations of parents or family. The fraction who came to BYU because of the university's reputation in their area of interest was 38 percent, which is a historical increase from 26 percent back in 1998. These data confirm that the university's mission and aims are central to the objectives of students who seek a BYU education. <sup>14</sup></p><br><p>The BYU 2010–11 Senior Survey provides revealing information as to activities students indicate have enhanced their spiritual development. The top ten activities enhancing their spiritual growth are shown in figure 2. It is not surprising that a significant majority of students indicate that church attendance, enrollment in religion classes, personal and individual service to others, and attendance at BYU devotionals were key in their spiritual development. However, notice that nearly half of BYU seniors indicated that "practical, applied experience related to [their] discipline" promoted spiritual growth in their lives. Further, the students suggest that courses that included community service; focused on disciplinary theoretical foundations; and focused on techniques, methods, and procedures contributed in significant ways to spiritual development. <sup>15</sup> These data illustrate how so many BYU faculty achieve this charge from President Kimball in his second-century address:</p><br><p><i>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As LDS scholars, you must speak with authority and excellence . . . in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i><sup>16</sup></p><br><p>It is heartening that speaking the language of both the secular and the sacred is so important to our faculty and that students report such success in the integration of the two in their BYU experience. This is especially critical in light of the fact that students come here with an implicit trust in the faculty, expecting that they will never need to question the faculty's fundamental values with regard to faith and testimony.</p><br><p>Another distinguishing feature of our students is drawn from the 2008 alumni questionnaire and shown in figure 3, which summarizes the post-graduate activities of BYU students. Three years beyond graduation, 22 percent of our students are enrolled in a graduate program and 17 percent have already completed one. It is astonishing that only three years after graduation, 39 percent of our students--nearly two in five--have either completed or are enrolled in graduate study. <sup>17</sup> There is evidence that suggests that this figure may be roughly one-third higher than for students at other universities. <sup>18</sup> Beyond those who have already completed or are enrolled in a graduate program, another 30 percent are planning on graduate school but have not yet enrolled. I find it remarkable that 69 percent of our students firmly have advanced training as their objective. BYU students' deep commitment to graduate study is reflected by the number who pursue PhDs. For PhDs awarded at all U.S. research institutions in the ten years prior to 2009 (the year for which national data are most recently published), BYU ranks tenth in the nation as a university of baccalaureate origin. In other words, of all PhDs awarded from 2000 to 2009 who did their undergraduate study in the United States, BYU is tenth on the list of supplying universities. For PhDs awarded in the five-year period prior to 2009, we are number five, and for the year 2009 alone, BYU is number four. <sup>19</sup> This is truly remarkable--sobering--that our students are so inclined and receive this kind of preparation and encouragement from BYU faculty. The HERI survey of faculty indicates that 85 percent of our faculty give high importance to preparing students for graduate or advanced education, above that of faculty at both public (72 percent) and private (77 percent) universities elsewhere. <sup>20</sup></p><br><p>In an age of deteriorating ethics, our students are young men and women of integrity. The U.S. Department of Education provides information on federal student loan defaults for borrowers who have entered loan repayment status. For the 2009 academic year--the most recent data available--the national average student loan default rate was 8.8 percent for all institutions. <sup>21</sup> The default rate for BYU alumni was 0.5 percent. At the site visit this spring of the Northwest Commission of Colleges and Universities accreditation team, one of the inspecting team members suggested that there must be a typographical error in the university's report of the student loan default rate. She wondered if it was perhaps more accurately 5 percent or even 15 percent. When the figure as reported was confirmed, she expressed amazement and wondered how we achieve such a low default rate. It is difficult for our colleagues elsewhere to understand such commitment among university-age students.</p><br><p>With such outstanding students it would seem that they would be uniformly self-confident, self-sustaining, self-motivating, and successful. Sadly, however, this is not the case. Some of our students struggle, and, gratefully, faculty are anxious to help. An astonishing 96 percent of BYU faculty indicated that they are interested in students' personal problems, compared to 74 percent and 77 percent of faculty at private and public universities, respectively. Ninety-six percent of BYU faculty indicated they are strongly interested in the academic problems of undergraduates, relative to 82 percent of faculty at both private and public institutions. <sup>22</sup> This strong interest in students among our colleagues is consistent with President Gordon B. Hinckley's declaration to the BYU community at the inauguration of President Cecil O. Samuelson in September 2003:</p><br><p><i>We should not have failures on this campus. We are more than teachers. We are shepherds. And we know that the spirit of shepherding resides in the hearts of those who serve here as members of the great Brigham Young University faculty.</i><sup>23</sup></p><br><p>It is in the spirit of providing an educational experience equal to our very fine students that the university undertook a significant initiative in the development of its own learning management system, the BYU Learning Suite. The Learning Suite was rolled out spring term of this year, and despite a discouraging challenge in our campus network storage in June, the rollout was considered successful. A survey of student users of the Learning Suite revealed that they were overwhelmingly satisfied with most elements of their Learning Suite experience. Faculty adoption of the Learning Suite in the rollout period was roughly double that of the use of Blackboard in identical courses in spring and summer terms last year. As of today, most of all faculty teaching fall semester have already created a Learning Suite course--2,400 new courses created in total. Refinements to the Learning Suite suggested by faculty having used the system were added in the recent release this month. The Center for Teaching and Learning has trained some fifty student implementation assistants, who have migrated all Blackboard courses archived in the past year to the Learning Suite platform and who have spent time in faculty offices helping with their adoption of the product. These implementation assistants will be available for one-on-one visits with faculty throughout fall semester. We are deeply grateful for the collegial atmosphere that prevails at BYU that facilitated the successful OIT-CTL collaboration in the development of the Learning Suite.</p><br><p><b>Faculty</b></p><br><p>I now turn to our unique faculty at BYU. Faculty play a central role in our distinctive mission, and, consistent with that mission, extraordinary faculty bring to the university a unique combination of faith in the restored gospel and superb disciplinary credentials. Each new hire has received the review of the board of trustees, which is evidence of the board's interest in what we do here and the place Brigham Young University holds in building the kingdom. The expectation of faculty to be qualified and prepared both in their disciplines and in their faith reflects long-ago-established and frequently reiterated prophetic vision about our work. Many of our colleagues express feeling heaven's hand in their coming to BYU. Many, perhaps most, come to the university and remain here at some sacrifice.</p><br><p>After a two-year hiring freeze, departments began recruiting faculty hires in January 2011. Last year I cautioned us to proceed deliberately in our recruiting efforts, ensuring that we invite faculty to join us who are excellent in their disciplines and who can fully embrace the university's distinctive mission. The university hired fifty-four CFS-track faculty for the academic year 2011–12, and this year sixty-seven new CFS-track faculty have been appointed. Departments have recruited and interviewed carefully during this time, often deciding to hire visitors when no qualified permanent hires could be identified. Some faculty postponed their retirement during the freeze to avoid leaving their departments shorthanded, and, consequently, retirements have been a bit higher this year than historically. The net result is that the university still has 11 percent of its faculty positions that are not filled with CFS-track faculty. Despite vacancies, we have benefited from the use of salary funds permitting us to hire temporary help in our teaching while we continue to search for permanent hires. I recently had the opportunity to visit with a candidate interviewing on campus who currently holds a faculty appointment at a state-sponsored university in the Midwest. He shared with me that there are 300 vacant faculty positions at his institution, and this year they have been authorized to hire twenty. I am grateful for the board's assurance that we will return to our full faculty complement, and I support and applaud you in your careful and thoughtful approach to hiring.</p><br><p>Because of their commitment to the mission of BYU, faculty who come here generally come to spend their careers. The average tenure at BYU for faculty who retire here is twenty-seven years. This underlines the critical importance of the hiring decisions we make. They are three-decade decisions. Available sources suggest that the median time full-time faculty members nationally spend at a single location is about eleven years. <sup>24, 25</sup> Faculty elsewhere are rather mobile. Roughly nine out of ten BYU faculty reported in the HERI survey that they would definitely or probably join the faculty at BYU again if they were starting their career.</p><br><p>Here's a piece of data that many will find both interesting and amusing. A little over half of faculty across the nation report that faculty meetings are a source of stress in their lives. While BYU faculty report lower levels of stress due to faculty meetings, it is not significantly lower. These meetings are where the difficult work of curriculum, hiring, rank and status, and graduate admissions is done. I am thankful that despite the passion we have for progress and improvement, these discussions are largely undertaken collegially here.</p><br><p>Stress comes in other ways to the professoriate as well. The difficult economic environment of the past few years has challenged higher education across the United States. However, BYU faculty cite institutional budget cuts as a source of stress with half the frequency as their colleagues at public universities elsewhere. </sup>26</sup> <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> recently reported a reduction in state support for public universities, concluding that "adjusted for inflation, the drop in state funds for the top 101 public research universities in the United States from 2002 to 2010 was 10 percent, with nearly three-quarters of the universities losing some state support." </sup>27</sup> The stable, ongoing support of our sponsoring church creates the atmosphere of confidence in budgetary support we enjoy here.</p><br><p>Faculty at BYU are bound by a common vision for the university and its students that fosters loyalty to the institution and its purposes. That vision guides their teaching, their scholarship, and their committee work. While that vision includes personal commitment to excellence in the classroom and superb scholarship, I believe it goes well beyond personal professional aspirations. Generally well above their colleagues elsewhere, faculty at BYU respond nearly unanimously that they are committed to the welfare of the institution and that their values are congruent with the dominant institutional values. <sup>28</sup> My evidence is only anecdotal, but, despite often dealing with very difficult and potentially divisive issues, it seems that relative to faculties elsewhere, BYU colleagues are generally more anxious to achieve unity in council settings, more accommodating of differing viewpoints, more respectful in a variety of settings, more unselfish in the shared use of resources, and more focused on student and program needs than their own. This, I believe, is the byproduct of a communal commitment to the university's ambitious mission.</p><br><p>Faculty at BYU are very similar to their counterparts in the national sample of the 2010–11 HERI survey with regard to faculty commitment to student growth and development, as illustrated in figure 4. Faculty here and elsewhere report themselves to be unanimously committed to helping students learn to think critically and by overwhelming majority seek to help students master knowledge in their discipline, evaluate the quality and reliability of information, and promote their ability to write effectively. BYU faculty are somewhat more committed to helping students develop creative capacities than elsewhere. Despite these commonalities, figure 5 shows features of our faculty's commitment to the student experience that distinguish us from others. Eighty-five percent of you report having worked with an undergraduate on a research project--higher than reported by either public or private universities. Significantly more of you (81 percent) have engaged undergraduates on your own research. And your commitment to fine teaching is reflected in the fact that more of you have participated in a teaching enhancement workshop. Further, you are much more interested in developing leadership abilities among our students than your colleagues elsewhere--nearly double that of public universities.</sup>29</sup></p><br><p>It is unfortunate that only one in seven faculty at public and private universities nationally have the feeling that good teaching is rewarded. Still troublingly low, only about one-fourth of BYU faculty feel that their being good teachers is rewarded. While perceptions are difficult to manage and change, I wish to emphasize here our unflinching and unqualified support for outstanding teaching at BYU. I am pleased to state that teaching is carefully considered and heavily weighted at the university level in all rank and status decisions. The University Rank and Status Council carefully reviews all student evaluations of faculty in retention and promotion deliberations, including both numerical ratings and student comments. Further, we continue to explore ways to effectively and efficiently provide quality, in-depth peer reviews of teaching. The Student Ratings Task Force has been working for over two years to produce an evaluation instrument that will provide more meaningful numerical data, that will provide more student narrative feedback, and that will be more closely focused on evaluating success at achieving our learning outcomes. I would hope that superior teaching would be the norm at BYU. May it never be said of us what has been said of the stereotypical university professor, that he or she is someone who talks in someone else's sleep.</p><br><p>In ways that I believe are unique to BYU, faculty across campus combine their commitment to superb teaching with strong emphasis on scholarship. When asked about their publication efforts in the past two years in the HERI survey, faculty across the country declared their scholarly productivity as illustrated in figure 6. Shown in the figure is the number of publications reported by faculty for the prior two-year period in the numerical categories: None, one to two, and so on. I emphasize that the comparison made here is with what I believe is our peer group--four-year public and private universities that presumably have both teaching and research expectations. Compared to the national sample, fewer BYU faculty report having no publications in the past two years. The number of those who report having published one to two papers in the last two years at BYU is slightly above their peers at public universities and slightly below those at private universities. Combining the remaining categories, the data show that more BYU faculty (62 percent) reported three or more publications in the last two years than did faculty at private institutions (61 percent) and public institutions (48 percent) nationally. <sup>30</sup> For those in disciplines where juried exhibitions or performances are the tradition (not shown in the figure), about the same number of BYU faculty reported one or more exhibitions or performances as did faculty at both public and private universities in the national sample. <sup>31</sup> The historical changes in these data for BYU are also revealing. As I mentioned earlier, the HERI survey of faculty is conducted every three years. The trend in the last six administrations of this survey--a 20-year period--is shown in figure 7. <sup>32</sup> Faculty at BYU who report having published no papers in the previous two-year period have declined in the last two decades. The fraction who report having published one to four papers has remained nearly constant, and those publishing five or more papers has increased appreciably. While these data do not address the issue of quality of scholarly contributions, they do suggest that faculty can give energetic attention to excellent teaching <i>and</i> contribute to their disciplines through scholarly efforts.</p><br><p>We would like to provide a BYU experience to as many LDS young single adults as possible. The population of college-age students in the Church reached a minimum in 2012 after two decades of decline and is now on a rather steep rate of increase. One might then wonder why the board of trustees is so supportive and encouraging of scholarly activity among the faculty. It might be argued that time devoted to scholarship could profitably be directed to accommodating more students at the university. Anticipating this increase in college-age Latter-day Saints who will seek a BYU experience, eighteen months ago we empaneled what we have called the Academic Innovation Task Force to explore broadly ways to be more efficient in our educational delivery. Implicit in that initiative is our recognition that the board of trustees understands the importance of faculty engagement in scholarship and that the fundamental course we are on has been set. At President Samuelson's inauguration, President Hinckley made the following statement confirming that course:</p><br><p><i>We must continue to strengthen our scholarship in every discipline that is followed here. But with that we must never let down on our determination to teach faith in the Living God; to build testimony of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; to teach the validity of the Holy Bible and of its companion scripture, the Book of Mormon; and to build conviction concerning the restoration of the gospel in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</i><sup>33</sup></p><br><p>With such competing demands on our most valuable university resource--you, the faculty--one might ask why scholarship is so important to BYU's unique mission. Excellence in our own research activity, in the way it is so often pursued at BYU, clearly enhances the student experience. Our students are better prepared for post-graduate opportunities as they engage with scholarly faculty. We simply cannot expect more of our students as learners than we do of ourselves. Further, we contribute to our disciplines in distinctive ways, we engage in the pursuit of answers to difficult questions, and we bring faith to our disciplines. Finally, we cannot understate the importance of students learning from faculty who themselves are engaged to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118). With that in mind, we continue to move higher, to hold ourselves to higher expectations in our scholarly efforts, and to give attention to scholarly productivity and quality. We will continue to pursue scholarly efforts that engage students and shape our disciplines.</p><br><p>As a reflection perhaps both of the strong resource support we enjoy at the university and the faculty's loyalty and commitment to the mission of the university, there is considerable satisfaction among faculty with the academic environment here compared to our colleagues at public and private universities elsewhere. The 2010–11 HERI survey compares how faculty rate as "satisfactory" or "very satisfactory" several aspects of their academic appointment, summarized in figure 8. <sup>34</sup> Note the contrast in how BYU faculty report their satisfaction with the quality of students relative to both public and private universities elsewhere. Ninety-one percent of BYU faculty are satisfied with the quality of the students. (A related statistic, not shown here, is that while 89 percent of BYU faculty believe students are well prepared academically, only 67 percent of faculty at private universities make the same observation, and 31 percent of faculty at public institutions nationally feel their students are well prepared.) BYU faculty also express greater overall job satisfaction, enjoy professional relationships with their colleagues much more, and are more satisfied with office and lab space. BYU faculty express satisfaction with opportunities for scholarly pursuits at a rate considerably higher than those at both public and private universities. With our fundamental emphasis on undergraduate teaching and despite the competing demands for faculty time, BYU faculty satisfaction with teaching loads is slightly above that of faculty at private universities and significantly higher than our counterparts at public universities.</p><br><p>Despite what most view as quite a lean staff organization here, BYU faculty express significantly greater satisfaction with the clerical/administrative support than elsewhere. It is also encouraging that BYU faculty are more content with departmental leadership, significant in the context of BYU's model of rotating academic leadership. I heard someone once joke relative to academic leaders: "What do you call an administrator with half a brain? Gifted." The survey data seems to suggest that this attitude is not held here, that faculty support and appreciate the sacrifice and difficult work of the department chair. Finally, BYU faculty express substantially higher satisfaction relative to job security, health benefits, retirement benefits, and salary than elsewhere. I view this as a reflection of faculty contentment with the generous support from the Church and deep commitment to the mission of the university.</p><br><p>The HERI survey reveals that BYU faculty express strong support for their professional development. Ninety-three percent of BYU faculty agree that there is adequate support for faculty development--roughly half again higher than our colleagues elsewhere. Ninety-five percent of BYU faculty have received travel funds paid by the university, compared to roughly 70 percent elsewhere. Eighty-one percent of BYU faculty report having received internal grants for research, compared to 50 percent at public and private universities. We are uniquely well resourced in our scholarly activity. <sup>35</sup></p><br><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><br><p>Brigham Young University is a very different institution than its peers across the country. Our mission is to educate students both academically and spiritually. We look to the prophetic guidance of the board of trustees in charting the course for achievement of this mission. But the board trusts us to see that the university's prophetic destiny is reached. Our relationship with the Church is unusual in so many ways--ways that are central to who we are.</p><br><p>In the accreditation site visit to one of our very fine programs on campus, the visiting team leaders--both deans at other prestigious universities--were complimentary of BYU and its unique faculty, students, and programs. Quite interestingly, the positive observations of both of these deans came despite each having lost in the last year outstanding young faculty who left their positions to join the faculty at BYU. The written report by the accrediting team characterized the program's relationship with the Church this way:</p><br><p><i>The . . . bond with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an enormous and unique advantage. In fact, without that bond [the program] could never have reached the quality it has achieved.</i></p><br><p>These esteemed colleagues recognized the resources, networking, qualified student pipeline, faculty commitment, and other advantages that accrue to this program because of the Church's sponsorship of BYU, but they don't understand the half of it. Our mission is core to who we are and is the motivation for resource allocation and management, curriculum development, faculty hiring and retention, evaluation, and so on. Our students are outstanding, and they come to the university with this same mission orientation in that they seek and expect to find dimensions of their education well beyond what they will learn in traditional disciplines. Faculty are strong, loyal, unselfish, and committed to this distinctive mission. In remarkable ways they combine the sacred and the secular, and their influence on development of the "whole student" is evident. One senior student wrote in the 2010–11 senior survey:</p><br><p><i>Seeing the examples of my professors and what they valued had a large impact on me. I realized that school and careers are important, but there are things that come before careers.</i><sup>36</sup></p><br><p>Another student noted:</p><br><p><i>I learned how to think about important issues in the world around me and how those things can affect me. I learned them through wonderful teachers who had a strong background in the subject matter and really cared about their students and how they learned.</i><sup>37</sup></p><br><p>We value much of what our colleagues elsewhere value in providing a strong education, but beyond that we place high priority on dimensions of student growth that others care little about. We concern ourselves energetically with what students know and how they think, but we are also determined to influence what they become. We are anxious to contribute influentially to our disciplines, and we invite students to be partners in that enterprise. What we do here at BYU is really more difficult than the education our colleagues elsewhere seek to provide. It demands a level of consecration--in the broadest sense of the word--that BYU faculty are anxious to give.</p><br><p>I find such commendation of this faculty and their work in President Hinckley's remarks at President Samuelson's inauguration:</p><br><p><i>Here we are doing what is not done in any other major university of which I am aware. We are demonstrating that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular. It is more than an experiment. It is an accomplishment.</i><sup>38</sup></p><br><p>I am grateful to be here among colleagues who share this vision for Brigham Young University. BYU has indeed become "a unique university in all of the world," and it will be more unique in the years ahead. I wish you a year of rigor and success, of energy and influence. May the thirty-eighth year of BYU's second century be one of distinction.</p><br><p><b>Notes</b></p><br><p>1. Spencer W.

<h1>We Doing? To the Faculty of BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<strong>How Are We Doing? To the Faculty of BYU</strong><br><br>Once again, as we approach the beginning of another  fall semester, it is my pleasure and privilege to welcome all of you here this morning. I am grateful for you who have retired and yet return to  stay in touch with BYU; for those of you who have been here before, whether for one year or five decades; and especially for those of you just  beginning your BYU career as a member of the faculty or staff. I trust all of you know that Brigham Young University is a very special place, and I  am confident that if we are observant, whatever our personal responsibilities or assignments, these months ahead will bring additional evidence  that this assertion is true.<br><br>As is usually the case on this occasion, I plan to report rather briefly on a number of events and initiatives  currently or shortly underway. For me, and I hope for all of us, this is a time for preparing and planning for the new academic year. It is also a  time that deserves reflection on our progress, on our current circumstances, and particularly on our future. BYU is not a static enterprise. We  have had prophetic guidance and promises which should give us confidence that we have the opportunity to make BYU better than it has ever been, and  I thank all of you who join me in the commitment to make it so.<br><br>No longer, if ever it was the case, is higher education considered to be  the province of only colleges and universities. Politicians and concerned citizens also have more than a passing interest in what we are and what  we do because of the complexities facing our society and the entire world; in the very great expense of keeping and maintaining institutions of  higher learning; and in the acknowledged role and responsibility these educational enterprises have for the improvement and welfare of our  communities and countries.<br><br>In the unique case of BYU, we are financed, supported, and encouraged by our sponsoring church. The Brethren  give us needed guidance with respect to the basic priorities and principles that frame our charter and leave to us the specifics and particular  applications in the various fields, departments, and disciplines that constitute this remarkable university. Not only do the leaders of the Church  have a deep interest in who we are and what we do, but the faithful tithe payers of the Church and our many loyal friends and donors also care  greatly for us and about us. All have high expectations and hopes that we will fulfill the prophetic promises that have led BYU from the  beginning.<br><br>We live in a wonderful age when the stature of Brigham Young University has never been higher within the Church and throughout  the world. As the Church grows and the number of faithful young Latter-day Saints continues to increase even more rapidly, we need to think about  and do the necessary things to be sure that we not only justify the tremendous investment that is being made in BYU but also do what we need to do  to shape the university for the future.<br><br>I will share a little of our current thinking and activity but will defer a number of the  specifics to Academic Vice President Brent Webb as he addresses the faculty this afternoon. As I do, let me refer to a quote attributed to James A.  Garfield, the twentieth president of the United States. As a young man he had been a student of Mark Hopkins at Williams College in Massachusetts  and was tremendously influenced by this great teacher of the nineteenth century. Said Garfield: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of  a log and a student on the other [end]" (popular paraphrase of a remark in Garfield's address to Williams College alumni, New York,  28December 1871).<br><br>I have had a particular interest in Mark Hopkins because of a few similarities in our careers and background. By  training he was a medical doctor as well as an educator and college president. He was also an ordained Congregational Church minister and was well  known and regarded as a lecturer and writer on moral and religious matters. President Garfield was only one of the prominent national leaders to be  positively influenced byHopkins.<br><br>I believe we have a faculty at BYU equally impressive as Mark Hopkins and perhaps the finest students  to be found on any campus anyplace. Likewise, I would not suggest that BYU is just a "log," or a typical university, but this institution is  today's mechanism for connecting remarkable faculty members with outstanding students in the Lord's own way (see D&amp;amp;C  104:16).<br><br>What should the log that Garfield references--meaning the university--look like in 2012 and 2022 and even further down the  road? We are thinking a lot about this and encourage all of you to join with us in the endeavor. I will report on a number of ongoing efforts,  projects, and developments at BYU, but, before doing so, please let me attempt to place them in proper context.<br><br>Lest anyone believe I am  announcing or planning dramatic changes in the university, let me promise you that I am not doing so. But let me also assure you that as our  circumstances change and the needs of our students and community differentiate, so must the way in which the university conducts its teaching,  learning, and other businesses be responsive to our current environment. As I make this observation, I am reminded of an experience President Henry  B. Eyring shared with some ofus a few years ago.<br><br>President Henry B. Eyring in his early years in Church Educational System leadership  was asked by President Spencer W. Kimball to chair a committee of educators to think about and report on the distant future of education in the  Church. As he visited with the prophet, President Eyring opined that universities would likely not exist in the Millennium as we know them today.  He was stopped by President Kimball, who disagreed and made the case to Brother Eyring that universities had developed in ways that had resulted in  great good over many years and likely would be found in recognizable ways for a very long time. I believe President Kimball convinced young Brother  Eyring of this likelihood, and I know he and the other presiding Brethren feel the same today.<br><br>I also know that our board of  trustees--presided over by the First Presidency and including three members of the Twelve and other general officers--also concurs with the many  prophecies about what BYU needs to become in the future. Often, in this very meeting, a number of the prophecies and charges to our faculty and  administration have been repeated at our annual university conference. In past years I have referenced them in my comments and am inclined to do so  again today, although I am also sensitive to time constraints that make a comprehensive review impossible or at least impractical. I have recently  read again<i>Educating Zion,</i>and Iendorse this as a worthwhile endeavor for all of us as we begin a new academic season.<br><br>Because I  was given my current assignment by President Gordon B. Hinckley, I think about and very often reread his counsel and charge to me with respect to  what is expected of us during our relatively short periods of responsibility in the extended history of Brigham Young University. Nine years ago he  said the following from this pulpit:<br><br><i>Here we are doing what is not done in any other major university of which I am aware. We are  demonstrating that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular. It is more than an experiment. It is an  accomplishment.</i><br><br><i>We must continue to strengthen our scholarship in every discipline that is followed here. But with that we must  never let down on our determination to teach faith in the Living God; to build testimony of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; to teach the  validity of the Holy Bible and of its companion scripture, the Book of Mormon; and to build conviction concerning the restoration of the gospel in  this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Here character building becomes an even greater concern than imparting knowledge of secular  subjects, although we shall never neglect this knowledge.</i><br><br>President Hinckley continued:<br><br><i>To the staff who  work with you in creating and maintaining this beautiful environment we extend our congratulations and a charge to keep them beautiful, clean, and  conducive to habits of order in the lives of those who use these facilities.</i><br><br><i>To the faculty we express gratitude for your  dedication in sharing with a large body of anxious and eager students the vast volume of learning that you have accumulated and to which you have  added with distinction. There is a spirit of fellowship on this campus between teacher and student that is wonderful and in many respects unique. I  am reminded of the occasion recorded in the book of Acts when Peter and John went into the temple at the hour of prayer. A cripple was brought  daily to the gate of the temple, where he asked for alms from those going into the temple.</i><br><br><i>And Peter, fastening his eyes  upon him withJohn, said, Look on us.</i> <i>And he gave heed unto them, expecting toreceive something of them.</i> <i>Then Peter  said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</i> <i>And he  took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and anklebones received strength. [Acts 3:4–7]</i><br><br>Then  President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Yours is the great opportunity and the very precious responsibility, in effect, of reaching down to  lift up those who come to learn and prepare for a productive and meaningful life. Most have been sent here by hopeful parents who pray night and  morning for their success. Great sacrifice has been made to enable them to come. They long for success. And it is your opportunity and your  responsibility to see that they do not fail.</i>["Remarks at the Inauguration of President Cecil O. Samuelson," 9 September  2003]<br><br>There is not a day that goes by--and quite often not a night, I might add--that I do not reflect on this and other counsel  that we have received from President Hinckley, from President Thomas S. Monson, and from our other leaders. This is a place like nowhere else, and,  likewise, the opportunities, blessings, challenges, and responsibilities are not usual or trivial.<br><br>And while our institutional mission  and destiny are not in doubt, how we each participate and understand our individual responsibilities requires constant attention, effort, and  vigilance. BYU will progress and prosper, but our individual success is not guaranteed without our own personal best efforts and worthily received  blessings. Professor Clayne Pope put it this way in 1975:<br><br><i>It is fine for us to remind ourselves of the destiny of the University,  but we must understand the need for patient progress. We should soberly ask ourselves if we at BYU are committed to the trek or simply enthralled  with the idea of a destiny.</i>["No Shortcuts to Greatness,"<i>Monday Magazine</i>(<i>Daily Universe</i>weekly), 27 January 1975, 2; quoted  in Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen,<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976),  798]<br><br>We do have a marvelous destiny, and we have the opportunity, usually in small ways, toadvance it.<br><br>We are making  progress, in my judgment, but we have a long way yet to go, and our commitment must not be fleeting or episodic. As has been said before by wise  teachers, the responsibility of prophets is to prophesy and the duty of the rest of us is to work so that the prophecies are  fulfilled.<br><br>Now, please let me report on some of the happenings, changes, and initiatives on our campus this year. Our log, to use the  Garfield-Hopkins metaphor, is stable, fundamentally solid, and in place for the ages, but it is also improving and adapting for current challenges  as well as for those of the years ahead.<br><br>Perhaps most evident is the building taking place on campus. For several years we have talked  about the beautiful new Heritage housing units on the east side of campus. Several hundred students now live in new quarters, other buildings are  under construction, and we anticipate yet further phases in this gigantic project.<br><br>Construction on the new, large, and state-of-the-art  Life Sciences Building is well underway on the south of campus. This significant new structure will eventually replace the Widtsoe Building and  greatly enhance our abilities to teach, mentor, research, and learn as we take our rightful place on the frontiers of the life  sciences.<br><br>Much of the necessary planning and preparatory work has been completed for the Bean Museum expansion. The funding has been  contributed, and, as soon as some vital storage issues for museum materials have been resolved, formal construction will commence. As you may know,  the museum is temporarily closed while this work moves forward.<br><br>The utility tunnel projects are continuing on pace with our multiyear  efforts to protect and provide safety and access to the essential infrastructure supplies that are required for this complex and advanced campus.  Likewise, you see the impressive work on our overpass system that will increase safety and convenience. Because we can't do all we wish to do at  one time, we will be involved in many projects like these in the years to come that will include traffic patterns, life safety, and aesthetic  concerns that will contribute to the beauty and utility of this unique BYU neighborhood.<br><br>In a different but similar vein, our Student  Wellness program, which formally began one year ago, has been warmly received. Our Student Fitness Center was remodeled and upgraded, and there has  been significant collaboration with academic units working on fitness and nutrition with several good examples of advising and coaching. Although  activity courses are no longer required, more than 10,000 students participated in these classes this last academic year. A large number are  already enrolled for fall classes with almost 2,500 more students on a waiting list. We are learning how to accommodate all who are interested, and  the student response has been enthusiastic.<br><br>Another development is the new seating in a portion of the Marriott Center behind me where  bleachers have been replaced with chair seating. The original benches--state of the art forty years ago--have aged and become dangerous. Like the  rest of the nation, members of the BYU community seem a little larger individually than when the building was constructed, and thus the changes  were made to bring this part of our seating to current standards and codes. Other seating in the years ahead is likely to be replaced and improved  as we strive to keep our commitment of maintaining the Marriott Center as close to ideal as possible.<br><br>Those familiar with our campus will  also notice that some changes are occurring with various support activities that fit under the rubric of our auxiliaries. Because these enterprises  are not supported by appropriations from the Church, each is required to operate on a break-even basis. Like the early days in Utah when the Church  operated department stores, hospitals, insurance companies, banks, and so forth, BYU also has various services not directly part of our educational  mission that support our campus family and the broader community as well.<br><br>The BYU Bookstore is one example where the business model and  demand have changed dramatically in recent years with textbooks being more widely available in the community and online. Our flower shop, print and  mail services, barber and salon activities, and food outlets are only a few of our some thirty-six auxiliaries on campus. You have seen, and will  continue to see, changes in what we need to do.<br><br>In all of this we recognize how difficult change is for many of us. We hope all  understand that we do not have the resources or mechanisms to subsidize favorite and long-standing services and activities that are no longer  self-sustaining. Most of what we do and have done will persist in more effective and responsive ways because our people are absolutely committed to  our missions of service and support. But we must recognize that changes have and will come as our circumstances evolve over time.<br><br>One  area perhaps not widely understood but very much appreciated by an important part of our university community is the University Accessibility  Center. Almost 1,000 students were served last year. Although the spectrum of challenges facing our students is very broad, it appears that  students with emotional and attention disabilities are the most rapidly growing population helped by this office and our campus community.  Wonderfully encouraging to me is that about 1,600 BYU students have rendered more than 16,000 hours of service to fellow students with  disabilities.<br><br>As has been the case for many years, our graduates do very well. Last year more than 20 percent of our graduating class  applied for professional schools with a two-thirds or better acceptance rate in all categories. An even larger cohort of our students goes on to  prestigious graduate programs with similar high levels of success. Much attention and significant resources have been dedicated to advising in  recent years, and the results include better placement for our graduates as well as the smallest number of students in academic difficulty in at  least the last twenty years.<br><br>A continuing issue facing BYU and all other higher education institutions is accreditation. I am happy and  grateful to report that BYU is in excellent shape with recognition and commendation from the Northwest Commission, which is our general accrediting  agency. We also have many discipline-specific accreditation relationships, and all are in good standing. Professor Jim Gordon, assistant to the  president for Planning and Assessment, coordinates and leads these efforts with his outstanding staff and superb effort and support from throughout  the entire BYU community. For those interested in these matters, our University Strategic Plan is available on the Office of Planning and  Assessment webpage, and the Commendations and Recommendation from our recent site visit and review are also available.<br><br>As with other  matters mentioned, much is also happening in academics as we attempt to smooth, strengthen, and improve the BYU version of Hopkins' log. This  afternoon Academic Vice President Brent Webb will address these and other matters in more detail, but I will mention just a few that I consider to  be very important.<br><br>An Academic Innovation Task Force was created a year ago. Its charge is to examine how the university might with more  innovation better fulfill its academic mission utilizing the best pedagogies and technologies. Its charge also involves asking and answering how  the university might do these things in such a way that serves more students without a commensurate increase in facilities, faculty, and other  expensive resources.<br><br>One of the early outcomes of this initiative is a pilot project that will create the opportunity for students  already taking classes on campus to enroll in at least one of our "bottleneck" courses online without additional cost to the students. Many  details deserve and require great attention in evaluating the potential for broadening our offerings, but our primary focus in this regard will  remain with our oncampus students.<br><br>For a number of important reasons BYU has decided to develop its own learning management system called  the BYU Learning Suite. It is a set of online tools with intuitive controls and user interfaces. These modular tools are integrated at a  fundamental level with each other and with the university's academic data systems while allowing each the ability to be independently updated or  replaced. With the Learning Suite, faculty will be able to create courses, provide feedback, display test results, share files with students and  colleagues, and submit grades automatically. Likewise, students not only will be able to display their best work but also collaborate with, mentor,  and provide feedback to each other. You will hear more about this from those who know the details better than I do. We deem this to be a very  significant and positive development for BYU.<br><br>As most will remember, for a number of years I have felt the need to address the economy  generally and such matters as the hiring freeze that we experienced for two years. Happily, the board of trustees lifted the freeze about eighteen  months ago. We are grateful that they supported us in making vital selective hires during this difficult period and in also keeping our budgets  stable. At the height of the freeze, approximately ninety-five staff and administrative positions and about 180 full-time faculty positions were  vacant. Since then departments and colleges have begun actively recruiting highly qualified faculty candidates to fill these positions. Because of  our need to identify those not only excellent in their disciplines but also highly motivated to participate in BYU's special mission, hiring has  and will continue to proceed deliberately and carefully. We anticipate that returning to our full faculty complement will likely take an additional  three to five years.<br><br>We are grateful for the tremendous support of those who sacrificed and served during this challenging time and also  are very excited about the new faculty members who have joined recently or will soon arrive. I also add that we, as well as our board of trustees,  are increasingly impressed and grateful for the quality of so many academically well-prepared potential faculty members who also understand the  mission of BYU and wish to be part of it.<br><br>As with our new and prospective faculty members, the quality and qualifications of our students  and applicants continue to increase. This past admission cycle we had more applicants than ever before with increasingly stronger credentials. By  all measures, many of our students could be and are accepted at the most rigorous universities in the country. We are grateful that they choose to  come to BYU and are sensitized to the responsibility to make their experience here a wise choice.<br><br>Because of our strict enrollment  ceiling, we have the very unhappy and difficult responsibility of turning away hundreds of students with good qualifications who likely could  succeed at BYU if there were a place for them. I commend our strong and committed admissions officers and committee members who labor diligently to  identify those students not only academically qualified but who have also demonstrated that they understand and value the unique aspects of a BYU  experience, like our Honor Code and opportunities to have spiritually strengthening and testimony-building experiences as well as exposure to  scholastic excellence. I cannot, however, overstate the pain that all feel in dealing with disappointed applicants and their families and  friends.<br><br>Last summer we dedicated our new BYU Broadcasting facility. BYUtv continues to grow and expand its influence around the world.  As it helps millions to "see the good in the world," it also broadens and strengthens the influence and message of the university and the  Church. Not all who watch BYUtv are Church members, but it does cause an increasing number to investigate the Church because of what they see that  is interesting, inspiring, morally clean, and uplifting. We are grateful for those who support our efforts and who carry this work forward. We are  making more friends in new ways not otherwise possible.<br><br>In athletics, our independence in football has allowed us to develop the  tremendous relationship we enjoy with ESPN, which provides national exposure for virtually every home game and many road games via that family of  networks and BYUtv. In most other sports we have a solid and productive relationship with the West Coast Conference. These schools in the  conference are serious, selective, and accomplished academically. They also remain true to the religious values and traditions of their related  churches in addition to providing successful athletic programs in the sports in which they compete.<br><br>We are very proud of our student  athletes and many others in virtually all of our academic disciplines for the recognitions and awards they have received. Increasingly, BYU is  becoming widely known as a great university with a record of broad excellence and achievement on the part of our faculty, students, and  alumni.<br><br>With so many positive developments and progress, we must never forget that we still have much yet to do. Our external higher  education environment continues to have increasing complexities with such things as progressively onerous regulation; financial crises, including  unsustainable student debt loads; fewer jobs for graduates with the poor economy; and the list goes on. Happily, our general levels of student debt  are much lower than national averages because the Church's remarkable support keeps our tuition very low in comparison with other universities.  Also, our students have very low--only a fraction of the national average--default rates on their loans. Sadly, we still have more than a few  students and families who, in spite of their best efforts, do financially struggle mightily tocomplete their educations.<br><br>As our  sponsoring church continues to come "out of obscurity and out of darkness" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30), we will try to do our part. Many are interested in  BYU because of what our students and faculty do and have done. Most would not be surprised that the serious candidacy for the presidency of the  United States of one of our distinguished graduates has also brought increased interest and attention to BYU. More than ever the actions and  behavior of members of our community--both the good and the rare bad--tend to be magnified in their impact on our work and that of the  Church.<br><br>While some of these phenomena and events may be distracting or occasionally encouraging, we must not forget that the mission of  Brigham Young University will never be altered or changed from the prophetically charted course we have been directed and blessed to follow. We are  on the way and, I believe, on target, but we have not yet arrived. At this event over the years my predecessors and I have frequently quoted the  prophetic statements of our leaders. You recognize that I have already done so again today. As Iconclude, let me once again share the words of  President John Taylor, who was quoted by President Spencer W. Kimball many years ago here at BYU. Said President Taylor:<br><br><i>You will  see the day that Zion will be far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to  religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100; quoted in Spencer W.  Kimball, "Education for Eternity," pre-school address to BYU faculty and staff, 12 September 1967, excerpted in "Climbing the Hills Just  Ahead: Three Addresses" (pages 43–63) in John W. Welch and Don E. Norton, eds., <i>Educating Zion</i>(Provo: BYU Studies, 1996),  55]<br><br>We still believe this, and our prophet leaders still believe Brigham Young University has this remarkable potential and  responsibility. We are grateful that so many in our community and throughout the Church and the world also subscribe to these promises and their  attendant charges to us. It is indeed a tremendous blessing to have roles of responsibility for and at this very special institution that has such  a significant place in those things we hold dear.<br><br>May the Lord continue to guide us and bless us as we do our very best to move Brigham  Young University forward in its ordained charge to bless Heavenly Father's children here and throughout the world I pray, in the name of Jesus  Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young  University when this address was given atthe BYU annual university conference on 21August 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Unique University in All of the World&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In October 1975, President Spencer W. Kimball visited campus for the centennial celebration of Brigham Young University. As part of that celebration, President Kimball delivered a landmark address entitled "The Second Century of Brigham Young University." His charge, as he stated in the introduction, was to share "thoughts and impressions [he had] concerning Brigham Young University as it enter[ed] its second century."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/"><sup>1</sup></a>That was thirty-seven years ago. We are now a third of the way through the second century, and one could legitimately ask where we are in achieving President Kimball's vision.<br><br>The university has changed rather significantly in those thirty-seven years. When President Kimball's address was delivered, BYU had 986 full-time faculty. Today our faculty complement is 1,562, over half again the size of the faculty in 1975. In fall semester of 1975, the university enrolled just over 26,000 students. Today there are nearly 33,000 students enrolled. There were 6,565 new-student applications for fall of 1975, of which 90 percent were admitted; 4,970 of those admitted enrolled for study.<br><br>I've heard President Samuelson share his recollection that "in the old days" General Authorities visiting stakes around the Church were encouraged to recruit students for attendance at BYU. What a stark contrast to today's environment where the university must advise interested LDS high school students about all options for pursuing a university education. This year there were a record 12,400 new-student applications, of which just 56 percent could be admitted--our lowest acceptance rate ever. The credentials for entering students have also changed since President Kimball delivered his second-century address. The freshman class of 1975 had an average ACT composite score of 22.9 and high school GPA of 3.3. The freshmen admitted this year have an average ACT score of 28.3 and a high school GPA of just over 3.8.<br><br>I don't share these statistics to boast but to illustrate the university's evolution in this second century and to highlight the tremendous challenge we face in accommodating more and more students who are better and better prepared. Because of our enrollment ceiling, we face the prospect of denying admission to students who would likely be successful here. Like me, I'm sure you hear this summary of applicant credentials and feel pressure to deliver an educational experience that is worthy of our student body. BYU's yield rate--the percentage of admitted students who enroll--is over 80 percent, the highest in the nation. Students are anxious to be here, and, if fortunate enough to be admitted, they come. I will share later some specific reasons our students seek to be here.<br><br>President Kimball began his second-century address with the following declaration and charge:<br><br><i>There are many ways in which BYU can tower above other universities--not simply because of the size of its student body or its beautiful campus, but because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world. . . . While you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Near the conclusion of President Kimball's address, he stated:<br><br><i>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>This final declaration of President Kimball has been selected as the theme for this year's annual university conference, and in my remarks today I wish to try to articulate some of the dimensions in which we aspire to be unique and some ways in which we<i>are</i>unique relative to others in the academy. I emphasize that we share many of the same aspirations as the finest academic institutions across the country. We are anxious to provide an extraordinary academic experience for an extraordinary student body. Students who come to BYU could be educated very well at other universities, but, in the words of President Kimball, "Education on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with 'education for eternity.'"<sup>4</sup><br><br>Dr. George Lynn Cross was the longest-serving president of the University of Oklahoma, leading the university from 1943 to 1968 during a period of impressive growth. In describing Oklahoma's academic aspirations in relation to the university's strong athletic tradition, particularly as a football powerhouse, President Cross once told the Oklahoma state senate, "We want to build a university of which the football team can be proud."<sup>5</sup>We love our athletic teams at BYU and, tongue in cheek, might articulate the same aspiration for our academic programs. This humorous quip illustrates that the motivation for what we do at Brigham Young University is, in many defining ways, different from that which drives other institutions and faculty who hold appointments there.<br><br>In discussing today the distinctive nature of BYU, I hope to draw on university statements, prophetic declarations, personal observations, and a number of selections from a significant body of survey data collected and analyzed by the Office of Planning and Assessment. The survey data will come from four sources:<br><br>1. The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) is conducted by an independent national organization and invites input annually from our students and other university students across the nation. The survey gives us a chance to compare the BYU student experience, from our students' own responses, with that of other students in the national sample. The 2011 survey included 412,046 first-year and senior students from public and private universities covering all disciplines, including 5,217 BYU students.<br><br>2. The BYU Senior Survey is administered annually four to six weeks before graduation to all BYU students who are registered for graduation in December, April, and August. This survey focuses on dimensions of our students' experience that are of particular importance to us. Fifty percent of the 6,900 seniors who graduated in 2010–11 responded to the survey.<br><br>3. The Alumni Questionnaire is administered by BYU three years after graduation to alumni who were granted degrees. The questionnaire gives a snapshot of our students' impressions after they have completed their time here and have entered their immediate post-graduation pursuits. The most recent questionnaire was conducted for the 2008 graduation cohort and included surveys sent to 8,258 students, of which 45 percent responded.<br><br>4. The Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA surveys faculty every three years at colleges and universities that elect to participate. The 2010–11 HERI survey included responses from nearly 24,000 permanent faculty members of all ranks from 417 institutions of higher education. Data I will present today from that survey will be drawn only from our peer norm group: four-year public and private universities.<br><br>In presenting these survey results I express gratitude to Jim Gordon, Danny Olsen, and others in Planning and Assessment who collect and synthesize these data and who have provided them to me.<br><h2><b>Mission and Aims</b></h2><br>I begin with what is perhaps the most fundamental element in our uniqueness at BYU--our mission statement. Stated boldly on our website and in our promotional materials and declared to our accrediting body and other constituencies, "The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>6</sup><br><br>This statement might be seen as quite ambitious--perhaps even preposterous--by our colleagues at academic institutions elsewhere. Despite our shared faith in the restored gospel, the mission statement causes us on the faculty to swallow hard as we think about our contribution to this vision. But the mission statement guides fundamentally all aspirational and operational aspects of Brigham Young University: faculty hiring and retention, student admissions, care of the physical facilities, educational philosophy, student interactions both inside and outside the classroom, expectations for students and faculty in their personal and professional lives, management of resources, faculty scholarship and its contribution to our disciplines, and so on. The mission statement shapes how we view our students. In a sobering way our mission articulates the university's responsibility as stewards of the some 6,500 new students who arrive on campus each year.<br><br>The published aims of a BYU education are intimately aligned with the mission, as stated in our foundation documents:<br><br><i>BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>These aims are an offshoot of our doctrine. President Joseph Fielding Smith affirmed in an address to a BYU audience that "knowledge comes both by reason and by revelation."<sup>8</sup>It is to this lofty objective that we hold ourselves as faculty in our own learning, and we seek to equip and inspire our students to do the same.<br><h2><b>Resources</b></h2><br>The Church's significant and stable support of BYU and its programs is uncommon in the world of higher education. Not only has church support for religiously affiliated colleges and universities diminished over time, but, as a rule, public institutions are no longer resourced in a majority way from state legislatures. It is quite common for state appropriations to constitute less than half--often less than one-quarter--of the operating budget of public universities of our size. The remainder must be sought from tuition and soft revenue sources. By contrast, Church support for BYU is, by deliberate board-of-trustees decision, far above that. Isn't it interesting that in an era of increasingly tight resources we have enjoyed this stable ongoing resource support? I will mention this again later. Toward the end of an accreditation visit to campus recently, one of the site visitors, himself an administrator at a state university elsewhere, joked, "How can my university join the Church Educational System?"<br><br>In the past year it has been my responsibility to visit with teams invited from fine institutions elsewhere to review our academic programs in their areas of expertise. These reviewers are uniformly astonished to learn that we enjoy full salary support for all 1,500-plus faculty at the university. Elsewhere, university support often provides only a portion of faculty salary, and faculty are under pressure to find the remainder of their salary support from externally funded research. In addition to this faculty support, we at BYU are the beneficiaries of generous capital equipment support, regular computer replacement, travel, and needed supplies. The physical environment on campus is so extraordinarily well maintained, largely because of the Capital Needs Analysis (CNA) program, which carefully tracks and addresses facilities-related needs ranging from major power infrastructure to single light fixtures. Similar generous provision is made for maintaining technology through the Information Technology Infrastructure (ITI), Information Technology Software (ITS), and Information Technology Development (ITD) programs, designed to respond to hardware and software infrastructure needs on campus. These programs are a unique model among institutions of higher education. I express gratitude to Brian Evans, administrative vice president and chief financial officer, and Kelly Flanagan, chief information officer, for their management of these programs that benefit the campus community and particularly our academic operations. As I believe Brian and Kelly would both attest, the resources provided by the Church in these programs are the envy of their counterparts at universities elsewhere.<br><br>Given our unique mission--as President Kimball put it, to educate for eternity<sup>9</sup>--it should not surprise us that classrooms used to teach sociology and art history and biology during the week are home to sacred expressions of faith on Sunday. The campus tables used to administer the sacrament on the weekend are used during the week for laboratory demonstrations in the physical sciences and for display and study of archaeological artifacts. And those students who crowd campus sidewalks with overstuffed backpacks Monday through Friday populate the sidewalks carrying scriptures on the Sabbath. The Church's support for our facilities is a seamless integration of our desire to combine the sacred and the secular.<br><h2><b>Students</b></h2><br>BYU's student population is also distinctive, and increasingly so, in the world of higher education in a number of important ways. We've all smiled at BYU's place atop the Princeton Review's list of stone-cold sober schools (for fifteen years running)<sup>10</sup>and most religious students (for the seventeenth time in twenty years).<sup>11</sup>But our students are unique academically as well. I alluded earlier to differences between entering freshmen of 1975 and those admitted in 2012, and to the increasing challenge of trying to accommodate well-qualified applicants to the university. Of those admitted to the university this year, 45 percent bring a high school GPA above 3.9, 35 percent have achieved a composite ACT score of 30 or above, and 18 percent rank in the top five of their high school graduating class. Over 96 percent of those admitted to the university graduated from seminary, with roughly half attending early-morning seminary. Just over five in six received advanced placement credit for AP exams taken as part of high school coursework. There were 167 high school student body presidents in the freshman admits of 2012. Nine percent are first-generation college students in their family.<br><br>While the credentials of admitted students are impressive, the question we might ask is whether we are adding value to their superb pre-BYU preparation. The 2011 NSSE survey of university students reveals, not surprisingly, that a significantly higher number of BYU seniors have enrolled in foreign language coursework, and, in what can only be described as "off the charts" relative to university students on other campuses, our students have participated in activities to enhance their spirituality.<sup>12</sup>Ninety-three percent of freshmen felt BYU places substantial emphasis on academics, and 56 percent of them worked harder than they thought they could to meet faculty expectations. Both freshmen and seniors felt that exams strongly challenged them to do their best work at a rate somewhat above the report of the national sample. Interestingly, the survey also shows that while our freshmen and seniors report having written more papers of length shorter than five pages than the national cohort, fewer reported writing papers of twenty pages or longer. Further, somewhat fewer BYU students than their national counterparts report having worked on a paper that required integrating ideas or information from various sources. More BYU students indicate they have come to class without having completed readings or assignments. With their academic preparation prior to arriving on campus, one might ask whether BYU students would be below average in any of these categories, and this information is food for thought as we prepare our syllabi. By their senior year, half of our students report having participated in experiential learning--a practicum, internship, field experience, co-op, or clinical assignment. This is nearly identical to the national sample. Eighty-four percent of our seniors indicate that they have at least occasionally discussed career plans with faculty, and 30 percent have done research with a faculty member. This engagement with faculty in the classroom, in faculty offices, and in the studio and lab is a distinguishing feature of BYU.<br><br>With all of these curricular and extracurricular activities, our students still find time to work. Last year a record-number 14,000 BYU students were hired on campus--nearly half of the student body. This is compared to 10 percent of students nationally who are employed by the college or university they attend.<sup>13</sup>We are blessed that the university provides unusually strong financial support for teaching and research assistants. And, of course, I acknowledge the army of hardworking and disciplined students who are on campus at 4:00 a.m., keeping buildings clean and clearing snow from the sidewalks.<br><br>As part of the alumni questionnaire, former students are asked about factors that affected their choosing BYU. The data shown in figure 1 are from the most recent study of 2008 graduates. Our students' overwhelming expectation for rigorous intellectual stretching here is reflected by the fact that 85 percent of alumni rated as "extremely important" or "very important" developing intellectual skills as their reason for choosing BYU. Not far behind in importance, 73 percent give the same weight to obtaining a spiritual, religiously based education. To our students, the combination of a spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging educational experience, stated explicitly in our aims, is paramount. Roughly two-thirds of BYU alumni (68 percent) also acknowledge the importance of preparing for a career as their reason for choosing BYU. Forty-four percent confessed that it was important to come to BYU for the social life and 32 percent to find a spouse. One in six (16 percent) report having chosen BYU to satisfy expectations of parents or family. The fraction who came to BYU because of the university's reputation in their area of interest was 38 percent, which is a historical increase from 26 percent back in 1998. These data confirm that the university's mission and aims are central to the objectives of students who seek a BYU education.<sup>14</sup><br><br>The BYU 2010–11 Senior Survey provides revealing information as to activities students indicate have enhanced their spiritual development. The top ten activities enhancing their spiritual growth are shown in figure 2. It is not surprising that a significant majority of students indicate that church attendance, enrollment in religion classes, personal and individual service to others, and attendance at BYU devotionals were key in their spiritual development. However, notice that nearly half of BYU seniors indicated that "practical, applied experience related to [their] discipline" promoted spiritual growth in their lives. Further, the students suggest that courses that included community service; focused on disciplinary theoretical foundations; and focused on techniques, methods, and procedures contributed in significant ways to spiritual development.<sup>15</sup>These data illustrate how so many BYU faculty achieve this charge from President Kimball in his second-century address:<br><br><i>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As LDS scholars, you must speak with authority and excellence . . . in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>It is heartening that speaking the language of both the secular and the sacred is so important to our faculty and that students report such success in the integration of the two in their BYU experience. This is especially critical in light of the fact that students come here with an implicit trust in the faculty, expecting that they will never need to question the faculty's fundamental values with regard to faith and testimony.<br><br>Another distinguishing feature of our students is drawn from the 2008 alumni questionnaire and shown in figure 3, which summarizes the post-graduate activities of BYU students. Three years beyond graduation, 22 percent of our students are enrolled in a graduate program and 17 percent have already completed one. It is astonishing that only three years after graduation, 39 percent of our students--nearly two in five--have either completed or are enrolled in graduate study.<sup>17</sup>There is evidence that suggests that this figure may be roughly one-third higher than for students at other universities.<sup>18</sup>Beyond those who have already completed or are enrolled in a graduate program, another 30 percent are planning on graduate school but have not yet enrolled. I find it remarkable that 69 percent of our students firmly have advanced training as their objective. BYU students' deep commitment to graduate study is reflected by the number who pursue PhDs. For PhDs awarded at all U.S. research institutions in the ten years prior to 2009 (the year for which national data are most recently published), BYU ranks tenth in the nation as a university of baccalaureate origin. In other words, of all PhDs awarded from 2000 to 2009 who did their undergraduate study in the United States, BYU is tenth on the list of supplying universities. For PhDs awarded in the five-year period prior to 2009, we are number five, and for the year 2009 alone, BYU is number four.<sup>19</sup>This is truly remarkable--sobering--that our students are so inclined and receive this kind of preparation and encouragement from BYU faculty. The HERI survey of faculty indicates that 85 percent of our faculty give high importance to preparing students for graduate or advanced education, above that of faculty at both public (72 percent) and private (77 percent) universities elsewhere.<sup>20</sup><br><br>In an age of deteriorating ethics, our students are young men and women of integrity. The U.S. Department of Education provides information on federal student loan defaults for borrowers who have entered loan repayment status. For the 2009 academic year--the most recent data available--the national average student loan default rate was 8.8 percent for all institutions.<sup>21</sup>The default rate for BYU alumni was 0.5 percent. At the site visit this spring of the Northwest Commission of Colleges and Universities accreditation team, one of the inspecting team members suggested that there must be a typographical error in the university's report of the student loan default rate. She wondered if it was perhaps more accurately 5 percent or even 15 percent. When the figure as reported was confirmed, she expressed amazement and wondered how we achieve such a low default rate. It is difficult for our colleagues elsewhere to understand such commitment among university-age students.<br><br>With such outstanding students it would seem that they would be uniformly self-confident, self-sustaining, self-motivating, and successful. Sadly, however, this is not the case. Some of our students struggle, and, gratefully, faculty are anxious to help. An astonishing 96 percent of BYU faculty indicated that they are interested in students' personal problems, compared to 74 percent and 77 percent of faculty at private and public universities, respectively. Ninety-six percent of BYU faculty indicated they are strongly interested in the academic problems of undergraduates, relative to 82 percent of faculty at both private and public institutions.<sup>22</sup>This strong interest in students among our colleagues is consistent with President Gordon B. Hinckley's declaration to the BYU community at the inauguration of President Cecil O. Samuelson in September 2003:<br><br><i>We should not have failures on this campus. We are more than teachers. We are shepherds. And we know that the spirit of shepherding resides in the hearts of those who serve here as members of the great Brigham Young University faculty.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_remarks-inauguration-president-cecil-o-samuelson/"><sup>23</sup></a><br><br>It is in the spirit of providing an educational experience equal to our very fine students that the university undertook a significant initiative in the development of its own learning management system, the BYU Learning Suite. The Learning Suite was rolled out spring term of this year, and despite a discouraging challenge in our campus network storage in June, the rollout was considered successful. A survey of student users of the Learning Suite revealed that they were overwhelmingly satisfied with most elements of their Learning Suite experience. Faculty adoption of the Learning Suite in the rollout period was roughly double that of the use of Blackboard in identical courses in spring and summer terms last year. As of today, most of all faculty teaching fall semester have already created a Learning Suite course--2,400 new courses created in total. Refinements to the Learning Suite suggested by faculty having used the system were added in the recent release this month. The Center for Teaching and Learning has trained some fifty student implementation assistants, who have migrated all Blackboard courses archived in the past year to the Learning Suite platform and who have spent time in faculty offices helping with their adoption of the product. These implementation assistants will be available for one-on-one visits with faculty throughout fall semester. We are deeply grateful for the collegial atmosphere that prevails at BYU that facilitated the successful OIT-CTL collaboration in the development of the Learning Suite.<br><h2><b>Faculty</b></h2><br>I now turn to our unique faculty at BYU. Faculty play a central role in our distinctive mission, and, consistent with that mission, extraordinary faculty bring to the university a unique combination of faith in the restored gospel and superb disciplinary credentials. Each new hire has received the review of the board of trustees, which is evidence of the board's interest in what we do here and the place Brigham Young University holds in building the kingdom. The expectation of faculty to be qualified and prepared both in their disciplines and in their faith reflects long-ago-established and frequently reiterated prophetic vision about our work. Many of our colleagues express feeling heaven's hand in their coming to BYU. Many, perhaps most, come to the university and remain here at some sacrifice.<br><br>After a two-year hiring freeze, departments began recruiting faculty hires in January 2011. Last year I cautioned us to proceed deliberately in our recruiting efforts, ensuring that we invite faculty to join us who are excellent in their disciplines and who can fully embrace the university's distinctive mission. The university hired fifty-four CFS-track faculty for the academic year 2011–12, and this year sixty-seven new CFS-track faculty have been appointed. Departments have recruited and interviewed carefully during this time, often deciding to hire visitors when no qualified permanent hires could be identified. Some faculty postponed their retirement during the freeze to avoid leaving their departments shorthanded, and, consequently, retirements have been a bit higher this year than historically. The net result is that the university still has 11 percent of its faculty positions that are not filled with CFS-track faculty. Despite vacancies, we have benefited from the use of salary funds permitting us to hire temporary help in our teaching while we continue to search for permanent hires. I recently had the opportunity to visit with a candidate interviewing on campus who currently holds a faculty appointment at a state-sponsored university in the Midwest. He shared with me that there are 300 vacant faculty positions at his institution, and this year they have been authorized to hire twenty. I am grateful for the board's assurance that we will return to our full faculty complement, and I support and applaud you in your careful and thoughtful approach to hiring.<br><br>Because of their commitment to the mission of BYU, faculty who come here generally come to spend their careers. The average tenure at BYU for faculty who retire here is twenty-seven years. This underlines the critical importance of the hiring decisions we make. They are three-decade decisions. Available sources suggest that the median time full-time faculty members nationally spend at a single location is about eleven years.<sup>24, 25</sup>Faculty elsewhere are rather mobile. Roughly nine out of ten BYU faculty reported in the HERI survey that they would definitely or probably join the faculty at BYU again if they were starting their career.<br><br>Here's a piece of data that many will find both interesting and amusing. A little over half of faculty across the nation report that faculty meetings are a source of stress in their lives. While BYU faculty report lower levels of stress due to faculty meetings, it is not significantly lower. These meetings are where the difficult work of curriculum, hiring, rank and status, and graduate admissions is done. I am thankful that despite the passion we have for progress and improvement, these discussions are largely undertaken collegially here.<br><br>Stress comes in other ways to the professoriate as well. The difficult economic environment of the past few years has challenged higher education across the United States. However, BYU faculty cite institutional budget cuts as a source of stress with half the frequency as their colleagues at public universities elsewhere. 26<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>recently reported a reduction in state support for public universities, concluding that "adjusted for inflation, the drop in state funds for the top 101 public research universities in the United States from 2002 to 2010 was 10 percent, with nearly three-quarters of the universities losing some state support." 27 The stable, ongoing support of our sponsoring church creates the atmosphere of confidence in budgetary support we enjoy here.<br><br>Faculty at BYU are bound by a common vision for the university and its students that fosters loyalty to the institution and its purposes. That vision guides their teaching, their scholarship, and their committee work. While that vision includes personal commitment to excellence in the classroom and superb scholarship, I believe it goes well beyond personal professional aspirations. Generally well above their colleagues elsewhere, faculty at BYU respond nearly unanimously that they are committed to the welfare of the institution and that their values are congruent with the dominant institutional values.<sup>28</sup>My evidence is only anecdotal, but, despite often dealing with very difficult and potentially divisive issues, it seems that relative to faculties elsewhere, BYU colleagues are generally more anxious to achieve unity in council settings, more accommodating of differing viewpoints, more respectful in a variety of settings, more unselfish in the shared use of resources, and more focused on student and program needs than their own. This, I believe, is the byproduct of a communal commitment to the university's ambitious mission.<br><br>Faculty at BYU are very similar to their counterparts in the national sample of the 2010–11 HERI survey with regard to faculty commitment to student growth and development, as illustrated in figure 4. Faculty here and elsewhere report themselves to be unanimously committed to helping students learn to think critically and by overwhelming majority seek to help students master knowledge in their discipline, evaluate the quality and reliability of information, and promote their ability to write effectively. BYU faculty are somewhat more committed to helping students develop creative capacities than elsewhere. Despite these commonalities, figure 5 shows features of our faculty's commitment to the student experience that distinguish us from others. Eighty-five percent of you report having worked with an undergraduate on a research project--higher than reported by either public or private universities. Significantly more of you (81 percent) have engaged undergraduates on your own research. And your commitment to fine teaching is reflected in the fact that more of you have participated in a teaching enhancement workshop. Further, you are much more interested in developing leadership abilities among our students than your colleagues elsewhere--nearly double that of public universities.29<br><br>It is unfortunate that only one in seven faculty at public and private universities nationally have the feeling that good teaching is rewarded. Still troublingly low, only about one-fourth of BYU faculty feel that their being good teachers is rewarded. While perceptions are difficult to manage and change, I wish to emphasize here our unflinching and unqualified support for outstanding teaching at BYU. I am pleased to state that teaching is carefully considered and heavily weighted at the university level in all rank and status decisions. The University Rank and Status Council carefully reviews all student evaluations of faculty in retention and promotion deliberations, including both numerical ratings and student comments. Further, we continue to explore ways to effectively and efficiently provide quality, in-depth peer reviews of teaching. The Student Ratings Task Force has been working for over two years to produce an evaluation instrument that will provide more meaningful numerical data, that will provide more student narrative feedback, and that will be more closely focused on evaluating success at achieving our learning outcomes. I would hope that superior teaching would be the norm at BYU. May it never be said of us what has been said of the stereotypical university professor, that he or she is someone who talks in someone else's sleep.<br><br>In ways that I believe are unique to BYU, faculty across campus combine their commitment to superb teaching with strong emphasis on scholarship. When asked about their publication efforts in the past two years in the HERI survey, faculty across the country declared their scholarly productivity as illustrated in figure 6. Shown in the figure is the number of publications reported by faculty for the prior two-year period in the numerical categories: None, one to two, and so on. I emphasize that the comparison made here is with what I believe is our peer group--four-year public and private universities that presumably have both teaching and research expectations. Compared to the national sample, fewer BYU faculty report having no publications in the past two years. The number of those who report having published one to two papers in the last two years at BYU is slightly above their peers at public universities and slightly below those at private universities. Combining the remaining categories, the data show that more BYU faculty (62 percent) reported three or more publications in the last two years than did faculty at private institutions (61 percent) and public institutions (48 percent) nationally.<sup>30</sup>For those in disciplines where juried exhibitions or performances are the tradition (not shown in the figure), about the same number of BYU faculty reported one or more exhibitions or performances as did faculty at both public and private universities in the national sample.<sup>31</sup>The historical changes in these data for BYU are also revealing. As I mentioned earlier, the HERI survey of faculty is conducted every three years. The trend in the last six administrations of this survey--a 20-year period--is shown in figure 7.<sup>32</sup>Faculty at BYU who report having published no papers in the previous two-year period have declined in the last two decades. The fraction who report having published one to four papers has remained nearly constant, and those publishing five or more papers has increased appreciably. While these data do not address the issue of quality of scholarly contributions, they do suggest that faculty can give energetic attention to excellent teaching<i>and</i>contribute to their disciplines through scholarly efforts.<br><br>We would like to provide a BYU experience to as many LDS young single adults as possible. The population of college-age students in the Church reached a minimum in 2012 after two decades of decline and is now on a rather steep rate of increase. One might then wonder why the board of trustees is so supportive and encouraging of scholarly activity among the faculty. It might be argued that time devoted to scholarship could profitably be directed to accommodating more students at the university. Anticipating this increase in college-age Latter-day Saints who will seek a BYU experience, eighteen months ago we empaneled what we have called the Academic Innovation Task Force to explore broadly ways to be more efficient in our educational delivery. Implicit in that initiative is our recognition that the board of trustees understands the importance of faculty engagement in scholarship and that the fundamental course we are on has been set. At President Samuelson's inauguration, President Hinckley made the following statement confirming that course:<br><br><i>We must continue to strengthen our scholarship in every discipline that is followed here. But with that we must never let down on our determination to teach faith in the Living God; to build testimony of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; to teach the validity of the Holy Bible and of its companion scripture, the Book of Mormon; and to build conviction concerning the restoration of the gospel in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>With such competing demands on our most valuable university resource--you, the faculty--one might ask why scholarship is so important to BYU's unique mission. Excellence in our own research activity, in the way it is so often pursued at BYU, clearly enhances the student experience. Our students are better prepared for post-graduate opportunities as they engage with scholarly faculty. We simply cannot expect more of our students as learners than we do of ourselves. Further, we contribute to our disciplines in distinctive ways, we engage in the pursuit of answers to difficult questions, and we bring faith to our disciplines. Finally, we cannot understate the importance of students learning from faculty who themselves are engaged to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). With that in mind, we continue to move higher, to hold ourselves to higher expectations in our scholarly efforts, and to give attention to scholarly productivity and quality. We will continue to pursue scholarly efforts that engage students and shape our disciplines.<br><br>As a reflection perhaps both of the strong resource support we enjoy at the university and the faculty's loyalty and commitment to the mission of the university, there is considerable satisfaction among faculty with the academic environment here compared to our colleagues at public and private universities elsewhere. The 2010–11 HERI survey compares how faculty rate as "satisfactory" or "very satisfactory" several aspects of their academic appointment, summarized in figure 8.<sup>34</sup>Note the contrast in how BYU faculty report their satisfaction with the quality of students relative to both public and private universities elsewhere. Ninety-one percent of BYU faculty are satisfied with the quality of the students. (A related statistic, not shown here, is that while 89 percent of BYU faculty believe students are well prepared academically, only 67 percent of faculty at private universities make the same observation, and 31 percent of faculty at public institutions nationally feel their students are well prepared.) BYU faculty also express greater overall job satisfaction, enjoy professional relationships with their colleagues much more, and are more satisfied with office and lab space. BYU faculty express satisfaction with opportunities for scholarly pursuits at a rate considerably higher than those at both public and private universities. With our fundamental emphasis on undergraduate teaching and despite the competing demands for faculty time, BYU faculty satisfaction with teaching loads is slightly above that of faculty at private universities and significantly higher than our counterparts at public universities.<br><br>Despite what most view as quite a lean staff organization here, BYU faculty express significantly greater satisfaction with the clerical/administrative support than elsewhere. It is also encouraging that BYU faculty are more content with departmental leadership, significant in the context of BYU's model of rotating academic leadership. I heard someone once joke relative to academic leaders: "What do you call an administrator with half a brain? Gifted." The survey data seems to suggest that this attitude is not held here, that faculty support and appreciate the sacrifice and difficult work of the department chair. Finally, BYU faculty express substantially higher satisfaction relative to job security, health benefits, retirement benefits, and salary than elsewhere. I view this as a reflection of faculty contentment with the generous support from the Church and deep commitment to the mission of the university.<br><br>The HERI survey reveals that BYU faculty express strong support for their professional development. Ninety-three percent of BYU faculty agree that there is adequate support for faculty development--roughly half again higher than our colleagues elsewhere. Ninety-five percent of BYU faculty have received travel funds paid by the university, compared to roughly 70 percent elsewhere. Eighty-one percent of BYU faculty report having received internal grants for research, compared to 50 percent at public and private universities. We are uniquely well resourced in our scholarly activity.<sup>35</sup><br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Brigham Young University is a very different institution than its peers across the country. Our mission is to educate students both academically and spiritually. We look to the prophetic guidance of the board of trustees in charting the course for achievement of this mission. But the board trusts us to see that the university's prophetic destiny is reached. Our relationship with the Church is unusual in so many ways--ways that are central to who we are.<br><br>In the accreditation site visit to one of our very fine programs on campus, the visiting team leaders--both deans at other prestigious universities--were complimentary of BYU and its unique faculty, students, and programs. Quite interestingly, the positive observations of both of these deans came despite each having lost in the last year outstanding young faculty who left their positions to join the faculty at BYU. The written report by the accrediting team characterized the program's relationship with the Church this way:<br><br><i>The . . . bond with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an enormous and unique advantage. In fact, without that bond [the program] could never have reached the quality it has achieved.</i><br><br>These esteemed colleagues recognized the resources, networking, qualified student pipeline, faculty commitment, and other advantages that accrue to this program because of the Church's sponsorship of BYU, but they don't understand the half of it. Our mission is core to who we are and is the motivation for resource allocation and management, curriculum development, faculty hiring and retention, evaluation, and so on. Our students are outstanding, and they come to the university with this same mission orientation in that they seek and expect to find dimensions of their education well beyond what they will learn in traditional disciplines. Faculty are strong, loyal, unselfish, and committed to this distinctive mission. In remarkable ways they combine the sacred and the secular, and their influence on development of the "whole student" is evident. One senior student wrote in the 2010–11 senior survey:<br><br><i>Seeing the examples of my professors and what they valued had a large impact on me. I realized that school and careers are important, but there are things that come before careers.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>Another student noted:<br><br><i>I learned how to think about important issues in the world around me and how those things can affect me. I learned them through wonderful teachers who had a strong background in the subject matter and really cared about their students and how they learned.</i><sup>37</sup><br><br>We value much of what our colleagues elsewhere value in providing a strong education, but beyond that we place high priority on dimensions of student growth that others care little about. We concern ourselves energetically with what students know and how they think, but we are also determined to influence what they become. We are anxious to contribute influentially to our disciplines, and we invite students to be partners in that enterprise. What we do here at BYU is really more difficult than the education our colleagues elsewhere seek to provide. It demands a level of consecration--in the broadest sense of the word--that BYU faculty are anxious to give.<br><br>I find such commendation of this faculty and their work in President Hinckley's remarks at President Samuelson's inauguration:<br><br><i>Here we are doing what is not done in any other major university of which I am aware. We are demonstrating that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular. It is more than an experiment. It is an accomplishment.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br>I am grateful to be here among colleagues who share this vision for Brigham Young University. BYU has indeed become "a unique university in all of the world," and it will be more unique in the years ahead. I wish you a year of rigor and success, of energy and influence. May the thirty-eighth year of BYU's second century be one of distinction.<br><br><i>Brent W.

<h1>he Dragons - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Greetings! And welcome to fall semester 2012. This assembly is a wonderful sight, and I always enjoy greeting Brigham Young University students at the beginning of a new school year. You bring your talents, goals, experiences, and perceptions from your homes--some merely a few blocks away from campus and others in faraway places across the globe. Your classmates come from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, six territories, and 106 countries. Your desire to learn in an environment of faith will afford you many opportunities to teach and support each other as you become classmates, roommates, neighbors, leaders, listeners, mentors, and friends. Discover the world and all its wonders from each other. Contribute in as many positive ways as you can during your time here. When you leave, take all you have experienced and go forth into the world prepared to bless others with your acquired spiritual and temporal knowledge.<br><br>One learns about so many varied aspects of life from different cultures and countries as well as their inhabitants. Mankind has always been filled with curiosity concerning unfamiliar peoples and territories. I can recall watching in awe as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon over forty-three years ago. Recently we witnessed a rover landing millions of miles away on Mars--a planet that has continually fueled the imaginations of science-fiction writers as well as serious scientists. Now we await the pictures it will send to earth to show what the Red Planet looks like and possibly find the answer to the question, "Could there be life or some form of intelligence on Mars?"<br><br>We are all fascinated by stories about the unknown and the dangers it may hold. Men and women throughout history have sought--often at peril to their lives--to explore mysterious and strange lands and places of which they had little or no information. These individuals would marvel at the use of a GPS, Google Earth, and MapQuest today.<br><br>Historically, cartographers used their skills and limited knowledge to produce maps of their time period. These maps were not necessarily very accurate but were archaic prototypes of those we use today. Found among myths and legends are stories of medieval European mapmakers placing the phrase "Here Be Dragons" on the edges or other locations of their maps to indicate unknown, strange, and/or dangerous areas--in other words, the end of the known world. Areas beyond their geographical knowledge contained the warning "Here Be Dragons."<br><br>Dragons, sea serpents, and other mythical and frightening creatures were placed on later maps to warn people of areas to be avoided or entered into at their own risk. Sometimes the phrase might be included and written in Latin or English.<br><br>Why most often dragons? A dragon is a fearsome creature that appears in folklore in most countries. Haven't you all grown up with stories of brave and courageous knights fighting dragons to save the hapless princesses or dragons prowling the earth destroying villages and cities? I would surmise that some of your childhood nightmares included fire-breathing dragons chasing you through dense forests. Even though you have met timid, reluctant, and huggable dragons, such as Puff in children's literature and movies, the fearful ones are those you probably remember the most and would want to give a wide berth to at all costs.<br><br>Today you are making decisions and choosing courses to take on the many maps and pathways presented to you. We read in the scriptures that Isaiah declared, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" (Isaiah 5:20; see also 2 Nephi 15:20). Our society seems to exemplify what is described in this scripture. The paths your lives take today have areas that could be marked by the phrase "Here Be Dragons" as a warning that you should and must avoid them. A firm testimony of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ is so necessary to maintain the proper perspectives and withstand the buffetings of the adversary that can and often will bombard you from all directions.<br><br>What are some of the "dragons" that can have harmful effects if you venture into their territories of influence? The early explorers often lacked the insight and knowledge about what they would find in the areas marked by dragons, but you young people have knowledge they didn't. You are warned by loved ones as well as by prophets and other leaders concerning what may await you in these lairs. Let me just mention some dragons I believe are tempting forces of destruction for each of you.<br><br>The Internet and social and other media can be dragons if they are not used properly. Speaking to a group of BYU–Hawaii students, Elder M. Russell Ballard gave this warning:<br><br><i>Now some of these tools--like any tool in an unpracticed or undisciplined hand--can be dangerous. The Internet can be used to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and can just as easily be used to market the filth and sleaze of pornography. Computer applications like iTunes can be used to download uplifting and stirring music or the worst kind of antisocial lyrics full of profanity. Social networks on the Web can be used to expand healthy friendships as easily as they can be used by predators trying to trap the unwary. That is no different from how people choose to use television or movies or even a library. Satan is always quick to exploit the negative power of new inventions, to spoil and degrade, and to neutralize any effect for good. Make sure that the choices you make in the use of new media are choices that expand your mind, increase your opportunities, and feed your soul.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>You live in a world of technology and cannot avoid it with all the laptops, iPhones, iPads, iPods, and so forth that you find essential in your lives. I had a friend recently text me that she had just acquired an iPhone and hoped she could figure out how to use it. I sent her a picture of three of our grandchildren playing children's games on their parents' iPhones and iPad. I sent her the message "If these youngsters can do it, you can too." Now when our grandchildren come to visit us, and after we share hellos, hugs, and kisses, they inevitably ask, "May I use your iPhone?" This is not only our world today, but it is also a glimpse into the future in which there will be inventions you cannot now envision. How will you use technology to bless your lives and also avoid the dragons it can represent? That is for you to decide.<br><br>There is also the dragon of immorality. President Thomas S. Monson once stated:<br><br><i>You live in a world where moral values have, in great measure, been tossed aside, where sin is flagrantly on display, and where temptations to stray from the strait and narrow path surround you. Many are the voices telling you that you are far too provincial or that there is something wrong with<b>you</b>if you still believe there is such a thing as immoral behavior.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The teachings and admonitions you have received up to this point in your lives are very clear on the importance of acceptable behavior. Beware of being tempted into a dragon's lair in this area of your life.<br><br>In our culture today it seems that the traits of honesty and integrity are often lacking or absent in individuals, governments, politics, businesses, and even athletics. Unfortunately, honor, trustworthiness, and incorruptibility are traits that take a backseat to winning and aspirations of high position and/or wealth. You have the choice to be honest and ethical or not. Remember the thought "Here Be Dragons" when you enter the realm in which choices can lead to a path of dishonesty and a lack of integrity. You have made covenants with your Heavenly Father to be honest. President James E. Faust once taught:<br><br><i>Honesty is a principle, and we have our moral agency to determine how we will apply this principle. We have the agency to make choices, but ultimately we will be accountable for each choice we make. We may deceive others, but there is One we will never deceive. From the Book of Mormon we learn, "The keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name." [2 Nephi 9:41]</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>My dear friends, be examples of honesty and integrity wherever and in whatever you do. Brigham Young University students are known for being examples of these attributes. Once when my husband had an important decision to make concerning a change in his professional path, he sought the advice of an individual he admired and respected concerning the matter. The counsel received was very short and concise. It was that at all costs he should protect his integrity. Once lost, your integrity and reputation for honesty are very difficult to regain. Steer clear of the dragons that would take them from you.<br><br>You are blessed to have the teachings of the gospel to help you shy away from the areas in which dangers and forces of evil can enter and put you in peril of losing your faith and testimony. Sometimes you may think that you can get close to a dragon and escape in time because you are strong enough to fight him when necessary and can easily ignore any temptation he might place before you. Your curiosity and questions about the unknown may lead you to say to yourself, "I can always choose when to stop and turn around. I know I can." Do not be fooled. The adversary is deceptive and will seek to ensnare you with such thoughts.<br><br><i>There is an oft-told story of three men who applied for the job of driving the coaches for a transportation company. The successful applicant would be driving over high, dangerous and precipitous mountain roads. Asked how well he could drive, the first one replied: "I am a good, experienced driver. I can drive so close to the edge of the precipice that the wide metal tire of the vehicle will skirt the edge and never go off."</i><br><br><i>"That is good driving," said the employer.</i><br><br><i>The second man boasted, "Oh, I can do better than that. I can drive so accurately that the tire of the vehicle will lap over, half of the tire on the edge of the precipice, and the other half in the air over the edge."</i><br><br><i>The employer wondered what the third man could offer, and was surprised and pleased to hear, "Well, sir, I can keep just as far away from the edge as possible." It is needless to ask which of the men got the job.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>You should be like the third driver. Just as he wisely chose to avoid danger, you should too. Hold on to the iron rod--the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is your only way to have sure footings as you make your way on the roadways of life. Releasing your firm grip on the iron rod will surely put you in danger of being entangled in the river of water, the mist of darkness, or the great and spacious building as described by Lehi and Nephi (see 1 Nephi 8). Their dragons, which were not too different from yours in this century, included the temptations of the adversary and the pride, wisdom, and vain imaginations of the world. Do not be fooled and lured by the dragons that will confront you as you make choices and decisions each day. It can be too easy to fall over the edge if you are not diligent in safely shunning it.<br><br>If you find that you have indeed fallen over the edge or have become burned by the fires of a dragon, you are blessed with the knowledge that your Savior has given you His gift of the Atonement. It is a message of love, hope, and mercy. He has provided a way for you to overcome any sins or their consequences. If you have entered an area in which you were warned there were dragons, you do have a way to find the correct path out, and that is God's plan of salvation, which includes repentance and forgiveness. His love for you is boundless and provides a way for you to return to Him.<br><br>I have a testimony of the significance of the Atonement and know that the Lord loves each one of you. He desires that you remain unwavering and firm in your testimonies of Him and steadfast and immovable in your choices and behavior. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>r: The Example of James E. Talmage - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. I appreciate this opportunity to add my welcome to all gathered today as we begin the new fall semester. It is a season of anticipation, planning, excitement, and perhaps even a little trepidation for those adjusting to all that goes on in this special place. We are very glad that you have chosen BYU and are qualified to be here.<br><br>At Brigham Young University we must always remember, reflect upon, and recall our fundamental purposes for being at this unique institution. As the semester progresses, all of us will likely be increasingly consumed with the demands and details of our daily tasks, which, at least superficially, are similar to or even much the same as we would encounter at another serious university. If we are not careful, papers, presentations, examinations, and other expectations will crowd out the higher or greater purposes for which BYU was established and the reasons for which we each decided to come and devote our time and energy.<br><br>Over the years I and many others have spoken at length and in some detail about the Aims of a BYU Education. I hope and expect we will continue to do so. I think virtually everyone seriously committed to BYU and our view of education will be able to recite without difficulty the expected outcomes of the BYU experience, which are that it should be spiritually strengthening, intellectually enlarging, and character building, and then leading to a lifetime of learning and service.<br><br>Without apology, I recognize that I have frequently emphasized the spiritually strengthening aspect of our efforts because it is unique in the world of higher education. Likewise, I have taken seriously and publicly the charge from our prophet leaders to make sure our academic and intellectual pursuits are of the highest order and quality. In addition, it is my perception that in our devotional services we are frequently reminded of the responsibilities and opportunities to provide meaningful service now and in the future. I continue to endorse and commend these initiatives and efforts.<br><br>Today I wish to focus my remarks on the importance of our individual character and on what we need to do to build and strengthen it as envisioned by the Savior and His duly selected prophet leaders. There are many definitions of character, but one simple idea articulated by someone long ago seems most satisfactory to me: "A man's reputation is the opinion people have of him. His character is what he [or she] really is" (Jack Miner).<br><br>I hope in our time together this morning we can think carefully and seriously about what we really are and, more important, what we desire and need to become. I am satisfied that this aim of a BYU education--to build character--cannot be neglected or diminished because all of the aims and the mission of this great university are so intimately related to one another.<br><br>While growing up I remember the rather constant counsel from parents, teachers, Church leaders, and others to guard one's reputation. Most of us learned rather early that it was not a good thing to have a bad reputation about anything. While I still think this is good advice, I also believe that character--real character--is more important than just a good reputation. The reason for this assertion is that each of us is in complete control of our actual character while public opinion, slander, and misrepresentation on the part of others may influence one's reputation.<br><br>For example, it is not too rare to learn in the media of someone with an apparently stellar reputation who has been found involved in a large variety of unsavory activities that usually demonstrate that the person has taken advantage of another in ways unfair and often illegal. On the other side, there are those like the Prophet Joseph Smith and others even in our day who have impeccable character but suffer regular unfair and untrue assaults on their reputation. Such, for example, might occur during a political campaign.<br><br>In a similar vein, I have always liked the observation made in various settings by Elder Neal A. Maxwell that it is better to have character than to be one (see "The Disciple-Scholar," in Henry B. Eyring, ed.,<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995], 21; also "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_sharing-insights-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing Insights from My Life</a>," BYU devotional address, 12 January 1999). I admit that some of my favorite people are both.<br><br>As a young man, I was impressed by the comments often made by President David O. McKay about the importance of good character. Let me share just a couple of examples. First, in answer to the question "What do you consider is the most important purpose of life?" he responded, "To develop a noble character" (quoted in Gregory A. Prince and Wm. Robert Wright,<i>David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism</i>[Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 2005], 11). Second is a statement very close to home as we think about the Aims of a BYU Education. Said he:<br><br><i>Character is the aim of true education; and science, history, and literature are but means used to accomplish this desired end. Character is not the result of chance, but of continuous right thinking and right acting. True education seeks to make men and women not only good mathematicians, proficient linguists, profound scientists, or brilliant literary lights, but also, honest men</i>[and women],<i>with virtue, temperance, and brotherly love. It seeks to make men and women who prize truth, justice, wisdom, benevolence, and self-control as the choicest acquisitions of a successful life.</i>[David O. McKay, quoted in<i>Rise of Modern Mormonism,</i>160]<br><br>I believe it fair to say that President McKay felt character building was of equal rank with spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging as primary educational goals for both individuals and institutions. From the very beginning this attitude has also prevailed with the administration and faculty of BYU. Karl G. Maeser was known for his deep, unswerving commitment to all three legs of the BYU stool that are now known as our Aims. As was the case then, and so it remains today, our students, staff, and faculty do not arrive as blank pages, and so we must always give great credit to families, preparatory schools, and the Church for the quality of people who come and so readily adopt the Aims of a BYU Education, including the necessity of character building.<br><br>One such product of the early Brigham Young Academy was James E. Talmage. He was recognized quickly for his great intellect, spiritual strength, and outstanding character. As he concluded his studies at BYA, he became a member of the faculty and then left for a few years to obtain his graduate education at Lehigh University and Johns Hopkins University before returning to BYA and the Church Educational System. Of course his crowning appointment was to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and his many contributions are widely known and appreciated throughout the Church.<i>Jesus the Christ</i>and<i>The Articles of Faith</i>are two books that continue to be classics in Church literature and deserve our careful and regular study in our libraries of "best books" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Two accounts of his character (perhaps showing that he also was a character) are found in<i>The Talmage Story,</i>the biography written by his son, John. These accounts have been favorites of mine for many years, and some of you are likely familiar with these experiences. I believe they deserve retelling because they not only reveal much about Brother Talmage but also give significant insights into important dimensions of character.<br><br>Let me go directly to the experiences as the younger Brother Talmage recorded them. Both occurred when James Talmage was a mature man. The first was shortly after he left the Church Educational System and became president of the University of Utah at the encouragement of the First Presidency. He had obtained a bicycle, which was then the newest fad in transportation during the 1890s. These are his son's words:<br><br><i>James acquired one of the new machines, not as a hobby or physical conditioner but as a practical means of transportation. . . .</i><br><br><i>Some time after James had achieved reasonable proficiency in handling his machine on standard roads, he showed up at the front door one evening a full hour late for dinner and scarcely recognizable.</i><br><br><i>May</i>[his wife]<i>nearly went into shock, for her husband was a frightening sight. Battered, bruised, and bleeding profusely, clothes torn in a dozen places and covered with dust and mud, James looked as though he had been caught in a riot, or at least a fight of unusual violence. Neither, it developed, had been the case.</i><br><br><i>Half a block from the Talmage home a single-plank footbridge crossed the ditch of running water that separated the street from the footpath. Until now, James had dismounted when he reached this point in a homeward journey, and crossed the narrow bridge on foot. Today, he had decided that he had reached the point in his development as a cyclist where he should no longer resort to this prudent maneuver, but rather ride over the bridge in the manner of an accomplished veteran of the two-wheeler.</i><br><br><i>Having so decided, James approached the bridge resolutely, confident that he would negotiate the tricky passage in a manner to be proud of and to impress neighbors, if any should chance to be watching, with his skill and casual daring. He turned sharply from the road toward the bridge with scarcely any diminution of speed. The result was spectacular, and observers, if any there were, must indeed have been impressed, but in a very different way from that intended. The professor's bicycle went onto the plank at an oblique angle and quickly slid off the side, throwing its rider heavily into the ditch bank.</i><br><br><i>Dazed, bruised, bleeding, and humiliated, Dr. Talmage was not convinced that the difficult maneuver was beyond his skill. Rather, he was stubbornly determined to prove that he could and would master the difficulty.</i><br><br><i>For the next hour,</i>[James]<i>might have been observed trundling his bicycle fifty yards or so down the road from the bridge, mounting and riding furiously toward the plank crossing, turning onto it with grim-lipped determination--and plunging off it in a spectacular and bone-shaking crash into the rough ditch bank. Uncounted times this startling performance was repeated, but in the end mind triumphed over matter, willpower over faltering reflexes, and the crossing was successfully made. Not just once, but enough times in succession to convince James that he was capable of performing the feat without mishap at any time he might desire to do so. From then on, he never again dismounted to cross the bridge, albeit he never made the crossing without experiencing deep-seated qualms which he kept carefully concealed from any who might be watching.</i>[John R. Talmage,<i>The Talmage Story: Life of James E. Talmage--Educator, Scientist, Apostle</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1972), 138–40]<br><br>This is an interesting insight into a man who believed something likely trivial to most people was not only worth doing but worth doing well. This same unfailing determination was demonstrated much later in a more widely recognized sense when Brother Talmage literally lived in the Salt Lake Temple as he wrote his famous and beloved book<i>Jesus the Christ</i>at the direction of the First Presidency. His absolute commitment to completing a task he determined to be important, whatever anyone else might think, served him very well throughout his life and, in turn, blessed and continues to bless countless others.<br><br>The other account I will share--which most will also likely find amusing--occurred while he was serving as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Although usually a strength, his dogged determination and almost complete focus on his work was also a cause for worry on occasion not only for his family but also for the top leadership of the Church. Let me again return to the account recorded by John Talmage:<br><br><i>In later years, James' long hours of work, unrelieved by periods of recreation, were cause for real concern among family, friends, and associates. President Heber J. Grant</i>[the president of the Church],<i>for one, repeatedly urged Dr. Talmage to take up some form of sport, if only for its therapeutic value. Himself an enthusiastic golfer, President Grant tried to get his friend to try that sport, confident (as are all golfers) that if anyone were once thoroughly exposed to golf he would be captivated by its subtle but powerful attractions.</i><br><br><i>As President Grant's urgings increased in frequency and intensity, so did Dr. Talmage's demurrers on the grounds of lack of interest and lack of ability to master a complicated skill so late in life. President Grant was certain the skill could be mastered and that interest would automatically follow. Finally a compromise was reached, and a test agreed upon: James would give the game of golf an honest trial, and work at it until he was able to hit a drive which President Grant would rate as satisfactory, "a real golf shot."</i><br><br><i>"If you hit just one really good drive, nature will do the rest," President Grant assured his pupil-to-be. "You won't be able to resist the game after that."</i><br><br><i>It was agreed that James would make his own choice after he had acquired the skill to hit the specified shot. If he felt the fascination of the game, as President Grant was certain he would, he would take up golf and play with reasonable regularity. If, after giving the game a fair trial, James still felt no interest, President Grant would cease his efforts to get Dr. Talmage to play.</i><br><br><i>On an appointed day, the two, accompanied by a number of others of the General Authorities who played golf and who had joined the friendly argument on the side of President Grant, proceeded to Nibley Park for James' first session in what was expected to be a series of lessons.</i><br><br><i>James removed his coat and was shown how to grip the club and take his stance at the ball. The coordinated movements involved in making a golf stroke were carefully explained and then demonstrated by President Grant and by others. Finally it came James' turn to try it himself.</i><br><br><i>What followed astonished all those who watched, and probably James himself. Instead of missing the ball completely, or weakly pushing it a few feet along the grass, James somehow managed to strike the ball cleanly and with substantial force. It took off in a fine arc and with only a minimum amount of slice. Some who saw it described it later as "a truly magnificent drive," which was probably a considerable exaggeration. However, there was consensus that the ball went close to 200 yards and stayed in the fairway. It was a drive that would have gladdened the heart of any golfer short of the expert class, and it bordered on the phenomenal for a novice.</i><br><br><i>The spectators were momentarily struck dumb, then burst into enthusiastic applause.</i><br><br><i>"Congratulations," said President Grant, rushing forward, beaming, with outstretched hand. "That was a fine shot you will remember for the rest of your life."</i><br><br><i>"You mean<b>that</b>was a fully satisfactory golf shot?" James asked, cautiously.</i><br><br><i>"It certainly was!" said President Grant.</i><br><br><i>"Then I have fulfilled my part of the agreement?"</i><br><br><i>"You have--and don't you feel the thrill of excitement? Now you'll be playing regularly. As a matter of fact, we can go into the clubhouse now and I will help you select a set of clubs."</i><br><br><i>"Thank you," said James, putting on his coat. "If I have carried out my part of the agreement, then I shall call on you to live up to yours. You promised that if I hit a satisfactory drive and did not feel the spontaneous desire to play, you would stop urging me to do so. Now I should like to get back to the office, where I have a great deal of work waiting."</i><br><br><i>So far as is known, James never again struck a golf ball, or made the attempt.</i>[<i>The Talmage Story,</i>226–28; emphasis in original]<br><br>It is very clear that Brother Talmage was always absolutely supportive and obedient to the prophet on matters of doctrine, principle, and Church practice or procedure, but he did not consider his loyalty to the Brethren to extend to their love of golf!<br><br>Brother Talmage was his own man, but he was also a man of impeccable character. He decided to do what he considered was really important and deflected those things of lesser or no priority. Perhaps there is a lesson here for us with respect to video games, social media, television, and other activities you might think about.<br><br>At BYU we have the good fortune of being surrounded by many impressive examples of people with genuine, sterling character. Might we each do what we must to ensure that our own personal character comes as close as possible to that of the Savior, whom we know to be of perfect character, even the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom I testify, in His sacred name, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 4 September 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>-Stones and Stumbling Blocks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During the westward migration, early pioneers encountered landmarks that marked the progress of their journey west. Prominent rock formations such as Chimney Rock and Independence Rock are examples of such landmarks.<br><br>Such features have special prominence in our own Church history. Rocky Ridge and Rock Creek Hollow have deep meaning for the handcart pioneers who struggled across the high plains of Wyoming in early snowstorms that terrible winter of 1856.<br><br>Hole-in-the-Rock and Dance Hall Rock bring to mind the tenacious faith of those called to settle southeastern Utah. Their expedition stymied by towering cliffs overlooking the Colorado River, these courageous settlers built a road through a cleft in the cliff wall, which even today seems to defy possibility.<br><br>My remarks today involve other kinds of rocks. I would like to speak of the stepping-stones and stumbling blocks that define our own spiritual journey through life.<br><br>On October 19, 1856, nearly two weeks before the terrible days at Martin's Cove, the Martin Handcart Company faced the prospect of making their last crossing of the Platte River. Extremely low on food and supplies, they also faced the prospect of crossing the icy river during a fast-approaching storm. Because of the weakness of the teams that pulled wagons accompanying the handcart company, all of the sick who were able to walk were required to enter the icy water. Thomas Durham recorded, "All the sick that could walk at all had to get out of the wagons and walk through the river, some of them falling down in the river several times, not being able to stand up in it being so weak" (Thomas Durham journal, 1854–1871, 15).<br><br>While the place of crossing was a known location to ford the river, the freezing water was at least waist deep to most of the 200 to 300 souls who waded and swam the river.<br><br>Josiah Rogerson recalled the experience years later by writing, "I rolled up my trousers and waded that cold river, six or eight rods wide, slipping betimes off the smooth stones and boulders into deeper water" ("Strong Men, Brave Women and Sturdy Children Crossed the Wilderness Afoot," in <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> 4 January 1914, n.p.).<br><br>Between the last crossing of the Platte River and the arrival of the advance party of rescuers, fifty-six members of the handcart company perished. Many more lost their lives during those horrible days at Martin's Cove as they waited for the main rescue party.<br><br>Because of the horrible suffering experienced by the Willie and Martin handcart companies, a few of the survivors lost their faith and left the Church. But to many who suffered, this experience proved to be the refiner's fire.<br><br>Forty-eight years later, in a Sunday School class in Cedar City, Utah, class members were offering criticism of the Church and its leaders for permitting the handcart companies to cross the plains so poorly equipped and so late in the season. Francis Webster, now an old man, listened as long as he could and then stood and said the following:<br><br><i>I ask you to stop this criticism for you are discussing a matter you know nothing about. ... Mistake to send the handcart company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it. ... We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation. But did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? ... Every one of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives, for we became acquainted with him in our extremities....</i><br><br><i>Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor one moment of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come to Zion in the Martin Handcart Company.</i> [William R. Palmer, "Pioneers of Southern Utah: VI. Francis Webster," <i>Instructor,</i> May 1944, 217–18; see also David O. McKay, "Pioneer Women," <i>Relief Society Magazine,</i> January 1948, 8]<br><br>How can there be such different responses from individuals who undergo difficult and trying circumstances in this mortal existence? Why do some wander off and become lost? Why are some ashamed and fall away into forbidden paths and become lost? (See 1 Nephi 8:23, 28.) Others, however, like Francis Webster, find their faith strengthened and their devotion increased.<br><br>How do we turn adversity into a stepping-stone and not a stumbling block? How can we make a bad experience become a learning experience? Part of the answer lies in perspective. How we choose to lead our lives and how we make faith part of our lives ultimately helps us face the challenges that come to everyone in this earthly existence.<br><br>In Hebrews 11:1 we read: "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<br><br>The Joseph Smith Translation gives us further insight into this scripture. The Prophet teaches us that faith leads to an assurance. This assurance begins with a belief, or, as Alma described it in the Book of Mormon, a "desire to believe" (Alma 32:27). In order for belief to become assurance, it requires action on our part. Every missionary knows an investigator must take action before obtaining a testimony, even if that investigator has a strong desire to believe. Someone who hears the gospel for the first time must not just believe but must take action for there to be a witness or assurance. For a new investigator this means study, prayer, and attending Church. Only after making commitments and acting upon them does an investigator obtain a testimony of the restored gospel. These actions become a series of stepping-stones leading to a testimony.<br><br>The pattern is the same with those of us who have been in the Church for many years. We must continue to step forward on the stepping-stones that will increase our faith. As our study and prayer continue, we accept new callings in the Church that cause us to stretch and grow. We serve others through home or visiting teaching. We prepare for and keep covenants made in the temple. As we continue on this path of learning, serving, and growing, we touch on the stepping-stones that strengthen our faith and ultimately lead us to an assurance or witness of truth.<br><br>From this spiritual growth we are then more prepared to face and overcome the adversity that is part of our mortal probation.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer has said:<br><br>[Today's children] <i>will see many events transpire in the course of their lifetime. Some of these shall tax their courage and extend their faith. But if they seek prayerfully for help and guidance, they shall be given power over adverse things. Such trials shall not be permitted to stand in the way of their progress, but instead shall act as stepping-stones to greater knowledge.</i> ["Do Not Fear," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 77]<br><br>So, in a marvelous way, by using the stepping-stones of faith, prayer, study, and service, we prepare ourselves to overcome the challenges and trials life undoubtedly holds in store.<br><br>The scriptures often refer to these challenges and trials as stumbling blocks. In Isaiah we read: "Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people" (Isaiah 57:14).<br><br>As we contemplate the straight and narrow path that returns to the presence of our Heavenly Father, invariably that path will contain stumbling blocks that can, if ignored, become trials, even crises in our lives. Now, please understand: the trail of life is strewn with stumbling blocks placed there to test us and to try us. Sometimes it seems we are literally stumbling through life as we deal with the challenges and trials of this mortal existence. The stumbling blocks of which I speak are those that we can avoid if we are obedient, plan ahead, and remain vigilant.<br><br>My list is only a short one and does not begin to include the many stumbling blocks the adversary has stored in his quarry of sin and misery. The ways he can trip us up are limited only by our imaginations. Nonetheless, here is a list of stumbling blocks you will want to avoid.<br><br>First, beware of the stumbling block of pride. While we are proud of you and we hope you take pride in your accomplishments, it is important to not be prideful.<br><br>Pride can blind us from danger. If we are caught up in ourselves and our own well-being, we become more susceptible to the enticements of the adversary. Pride prevents us from serving and giving and causes us to become self-centered and demanding. Pride interferes with relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, friends and loved ones. No one cares to be around a truly selfish person.<br><br>Nephi wrote:<br><br><i>And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have ... put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.</i> [2 Nephi 26:20]<br><br>Nephi taught 2,500 years ago that the prideful forget the poor, fail to serve, and only seek gain.<br><br>In our time, Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote:<br><br><i>Meekness helps us to surmount the stumbling blocks so that we are prepared to receive a deeper and wider view. Obviously, Philip had such meekness when he recognized Jesus as the Messiah of whom Moses had spoken. (John 1:45.) Obviously, Paul had the broad view when he described Moses as having, by choice, forgone life in Pharaoh's court for a life of service to Jesus. (Hebrews 11:24–27.) Nevertheless, the stones of stumbling are real. In fact, these offending rocks prove insurmountable unless we have the attribute of meekness.</i> [<i>Meek and Lowly</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1987), 76]<br><br>Second, be aware of the stumbling blocks of negativity and pessimism. While there are challenges and difficulties we all face, it is important to maintain an eternal perspective. Life is sometimes hard because it is supposed to be. The great plan of happiness provides for a mortal existence in which we can come to learn to overcome hard things. If we tend to focus on only those things in our lives that do not go as we intend, we will miss the marvelous blessings we otherwise would enjoy.<br><br>Be optimistic. The glass really is half full. President Gordon B. Hinckley said it best: "Save your fork. The best is yet to come!"<br><br>The story is told of a traveler in the Ozarks who passed by a general store. A hound dog was sitting out front howling his head off. The traveler stopped and asked, "Why's that ol' hound dog howling so much?"<br><br>The man standing by the store said, "Because he's sitting on a thistle."<br><br>The traveler asked, "Well, why doesn't he just sit somewhere else?"<br><br>The man answered, "Because he'd rather howl."<br><br>Don't howl and whine. Choose to be optimistic. Being optimistic is good for you. Dr. Martin E. P. Seligman, a psychologist from the University of Pennsylvania, did more than a quarter-century of research on this subject. Among his conclusions: Optimistic people are happier, healthier, and more successful than those with a negative outlook on life. Optimism results in less depression, higher achievement, and a stronger immune system.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches these same principles. When we say, "It's impossible," the Lord says, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God" (Luke 18:27).<br><br>When we say, "I'm too tired," the Lord says, "I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28; see also verses 29–30).<br><br>When we say, "Nobody really loves me," the Lord says, "I love you" (see John 13:34).<br><br>When we say, "I can't do it," the scriptures teach us, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13).<br><br>When we say, "It's not worth it," the Lord reminds us it will be worth it: "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose" (Romans 8:28).<br><br>When we say, "I'm not smart enough," the scriptures remind us that God gives us wisdom (see 1 Corinthians 1:30).<br><br>When we say, "I can't forgive myself," we are reminded that He does forgive us (see 1 John 1:9).<br><br>When we say, "I don't have enough faith," He reminds us in scripture, "God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith" (Romans 12:3).<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ is the "good news." It is for good reason we often refer to the plan of salvation as the plan of happiness. In spite of the challenges and trials of life, we must look forward with hope. As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we have within us the hope Peter refers to in the New Testament: "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear" (1 Peter 3:15).<br><br>So choose to be optimistic. Choose to look on the bright side. As you go about your day's activities, expect the best.<br><br>This is perhaps best illustrated by the following anecdote.<br><br>A little boy was overheard talking to himself as he strode through his backyard, baseball cap in place and toting ball and bat. "I'm the greatest baseball player in the world," he said proudly.<br><br>Then he tossed the ball in the air, swung, and missed. Undaunted, he picked up the ball, threw it into the air, and said to himself, "I'm the greatest player ever!"<br><br>He swung at the ball again, and again he missed. He paused a moment to examine the bat and ball carefully. Then once again he threw the ball into the air and said, "I'm the greatest baseball player who ever lived."<br><br>He swung the bat hard and again missed the ball. "Wow!" he exclaimed. "What a pitcher!"<br><br>Choose to look on the bright side.<br><br>Before I move on, let me leave a word of caution and advice. Today's events have focused a great deal of attention on the Church. The Broadway musical <i>The Book of Mormon</i> and especially the Republican primary campaign have created what <i>Newsweek</i> magazine has coined "the Mormon moment." This unprecedented attention on our Church and our beliefs has also had a downside. Never before have we received such scrutiny. Some of our beliefs, which to some may seem peculiar, have been ridiculed by a few. The ability to transmit information through the Internet and the media is unparalleled. The words of a bitter or disrespectful critic are magnified many times through the use of social media. This was a platform not available to our critics just a generation ago.<br><br>Our responsibility is to appropriately filter this rhetoric and attempt to understand why such things are said. For some critics, their crude utterances are made for political gain or entertainment. But please understand, the followers of the Savior have always been in the minority and often in history have suffered more than the simple sting of unkind and cruel words.<br><br>For a few, these verbal assaults on our religion have created a crisis of faith. They wonder if such things are true and, if so, how this could possibly be. Our history as a Church is a rich tapestry woven with beautiful threads of sacrifice, service, and devotion. The stories of early Church leaders and members are motivating and compelling. Their accounts of the remarkable and the mundane inspire us to accomplish difficult tasks. But, like all of us, they were not perfect. It is important to view the entire tapestry of our history and not just individual threads that may seem to strike us as too peculiar if not viewed in the context of time and place.<br><br>I can testify that the more I learn of our Church, its doctrine, and its history, the stronger my testimony becomes. To achieve a proper balance, I encourage you to continue to pay attention to your spiritual well-being by praying, studying the scriptures, and keeping the commandments. Touch upon the stepping-stones that will build your faith. Then, when the winds of discontent blow, you will be protected from the storm.<br><br>While there are many stumbling blocks along our path, I will conclude with just one more. Stumbling blocks are often cleverly disguised. Let the advancements of today's modern technology be a springboard in your lives, not a stumbling block. Never have we been blessed with so many tools to perform the purposes of the Church. Social media can be an effective way to share the gospel. The new Family Search has revolutionized our ability to do family history. Instantaneous communication is achieved around the world with members and non-members alike with tools like LDS.org and Mormon.com.<br><br>Unlike even a generation ago, it is impossible for you to successfully complete your studies without ownership or easy access to a computer. Cell phones and texting have changed the way we communicate. Based on its membership, Facebook is now the third-largest country in the world. The Internet, with its use of social media, has contributed to revolutions in the Middle East. It is an absolutely fascinating time, and we are just seeing the beginning of this information revolution.<br><br>Unfortunately, all of this technology does have a downside. We should not be surprised Satan has figured that out so quickly. Resist the urge to spend too much time on video games, and avoid violent and inappropriate games altogether. This kind of entertainment can become strangely addictive. In ten years we do not want to find some of you bright young people living in your parents' basements playing video games and surviving on Cheetos. Life does have greater meaning than the latest and greatest game.<br><br>Avoid online pornography at all costs. There has been a clarion call from our prophets on this matter, and you will be wise to pay careful heed to their warnings. To not do so can lead you to become ensnared in your own personal hell. Stay away from pornography.<br><br>While I appreciate the economy and efficiency of texting, don't give up on personal face-to-face communication. You don't need a battery, you don't need a signal, and you don't need a handheld device. You will be surprised what can come from a real, live conversation. Let's embrace the technology, but let's not forget the importance of personal communication. Try it. You might like it.<br><br>Well, brothers and sisters, there are many other stumbling blocks that will undoubtedly threaten your future progress. Some of you will need to maneuver around them or laboriously push them from your path. You will avoid many stumbling blocks by living wise, obedient lives and by paying attention to the stepping-stones that will build your faith. But the challenges and trials will nonetheless come. When they do, if you have prepared they will become seasons of learning in your life. Rather than times of setback and loss of faith, these experiences themselves will become stepping-stones of spiritual strength for your eternal progression.<br><br>Be meek, humble, strong, and wise. The future is bright, and you, the rising generation, will determine our course. It has ever been so. Being with you today convinces me that our future has never been in better hands.<br><br>I wish you the Lord's choicest blessings as you continue forward on this magnificent journey known as mortality. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven E.

<h1> Work of Understanding the Constitution - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very happy to be with you today. As a graduate of BYU, may I pass along some advice as you begin a new semester or as you begin your college career? I have two daughters here today who fall into those categories. Tori Strong is a senior beginning a new semester. Tanne Cait Griffith is a freshman starting her college career. I will say to all of you what I have said many times to them: make attending devotional and forum assemblies the backbone of your academic week.<br><br>Sometime soon after I arrived on campus to begin my studies forty years ago, I read an interview of an upperclassman who became a hero of mine. He still is. In that interview, Clayton Christensen, who went on to win a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford and is today one of the most influential academics in the world, was asked what he thought were the most valuable aspects of his academic experience at BYU. Clayton singled out his regular attendance at the weekly devotional and forum assemblies. I knew that there were not many things I could do to match Clayton Christensen, but this was one of them. I could attend devotionals and forums every week, and I did. To this day I count that among the best decisions I've ever made. The devotionals strengthened my testimony. The forums introduced me to fascinating people from all walks of life with different perspectives that broadened my views. So permit me this bit of counsel--no, permit me this admonition: Don't miss a devotional or a forum assembly. Go to those that look interesting. Go to those that don't. You may be surprised.<br><h2><b>Seeking Understanding in History and in Law</b></h2><br>It is a distinct honor to be with you as we mark Constitution Day. As you may know, by gathering today we act in obedience to a congressional mandate that every educational institution receiving federal funds must, sometime this week, celebrate the approval of the federal Constitution by the Philadelphia convention on September 17, 1787.<sup>1</sup>This law was sponsored by the late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who was an enthusiastic student of the Constitution. Not surprising, the law provided no funding for the celebration. In other words, it is yet another unfunded mandate. Perhaps I shouldn't mention this at the beginning of my remarks, but the law also lacks any enforcement provision. In other words, you cannot be arrested for leaving early.<br><br>I give a tip of my hat to those who came today knowing in advance the title of my remarks: "The Hard Work of Understanding the Constitution." Hard work rarely attracts any but the most rugged souls. For those who didn't get the word about my topic, please stay. This will be the first test of your commitment to attend all forums!<br><br>Before I get to the "hard work" part of my talk, let me begin by saying that I applaud the recent trend in the United States to bring the Constitution into public debate. I cheer the fact that our political leaders, candidates, pundits, and talking heads frequently invoke the Constitution in support of their competing ideas. It is common for people in Washington, D.C., to carry a pocket copy of the Constitution, and I think that is a good thing too. Here's mine.<br><br>But here's some bad news: it's hard work to understand the Constitution. At least it's hard work if you try to understand what it meant to those who wrote and ratified its provisions. In my view, that is the understanding we must seek. Many of the provisions in the Constitution were agreed to by citizens who lived in the eighteenth century--a world in which the language, customs, understandings, and problems were, in many ways, different from ours. Understanding their language can be hard work: What is a "letter of marque and reprisal" anyway? Or how about a "bill of attainder"? More difficult still is understanding the problems they were seeking to address. It's been a while since we've labored under a monarchy or were compelled by law to give financial support to an established church. Do you really think of a standing military as a threat to your liberty? And what of the argument of the day in the 1780s that the new United States should mimic the unified island nation of England and Scotland rather than the federated cantons of Switzerland? According to Professor Akhil Amar of Yale Law School, this particular view of things "informed much of the ... Constitution's overall structure and many of its specific words."<sup>2</sup> But what if you are not up to speed on the "general geostrategic vision"<sup>3</sup>of Americans in the late eighteenth century?<br><br>Do you get the sense that understanding the Constitution may involve more than casual reading?<br><br>Of course, there is an easy way out. Rather than wrestle with what the text of the Constitution meant to those who ratified its provisions, one can take the view that the Constitution was in large measure the work of dead, white, racist men whose views shouldn't have much, if anything, to do with how we order our society today. Under this view the Constitution is little more than a license to do what is right by our current lights, by our changing standards of decency. Some argue that we needn't be shackled today by language in the Constitution that seems obscure or by restraints that are inconvenient to modern objectives. Some speak of a "living Constitution" whose meaning changes with our times. Using the phrase "living Constitution" suggests, however, that the Constitution that has actually been ratified is not quite alive, or is, in the words of the renowned constitutional scholar Miracle Max, "mostly dead."<sup>4</sup>Proponents of the living Constitution call upon unelected, life-tenured, and politically unaccountable federal judges--like me--to keep the Constitution up to date. According to this view, federal judges should be the arbiters of the nation's evolving standards, which we should read into the Constitution. Of course, that is far easier than submitting to the cumbersome and difficult amendment process set forth in the ratified Constitution. But as is often the case with the easy way out, this approach is fundamentally flawed.<br><br>Almost all the really important issues in life are illustrated in<i>A Man for All Seasons,</i>the classic and incomparable play later made into an Academy Award–winning film that describes the martyrdom of Thomas More, the sixteenth-century English lawyer and statesman who was canonized as the patron saint of lawyers and politicians. The play and the movie create a colloquy between More and William Roper, More's son-in-law, who is a religious zealot with great confidence that he knows what is right. In this scene Roper has just urged More to seek the arrest of Richard Rich, a hanger-on in More's household whose suspicious conduct has raised concern in More's family that he might be in league with More's enemies. When More asks the grounds for the arrest, he is told that Rich is a "bad" man.<br><br><i>More: There is no law against that.</i><br><br><i>Roper: There is! God's law!</i><br><br><i>More: Then God can arrest him.</i><br><br><i>Roper: Sophistication upon sophistication!</i><br><br><i>More: No, sheer simplicity. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal not what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal.</i><br><br><i>Roper: Then you set man's law above God's!</i><br><br><i>More: No, far below; but let me draw your attention to a fact--I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain sailing, I can't navigate. I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh, there I'm a forester.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Lest I be misunderstood, you should know that I have firmly held views about right and wrong, and I call upon them to make decisions in my own life, to teach my family, and to participate actively in my faith and as a citizen of this nation--but not in my work as a judge. Through their elected representatives, the American people have made their decisions about right and wrong and have put them into law. My duty as a judge--a duty I have taken a solemn oath to abide--is to use all the skill I can muster to understand the words in the laws and apply the judgments they codify. When I do, I reinforce the most fundamental principle that undergirds the Constitution: that "we the people"<sup>6</sup>decide the rules of our society through our elected representatives. To use my own views of what is right and fair and just would not only violate my oath of office (significant transgression enough!) but would also undermine the very foundation of democratic governance. As Professor Amar observed, "No liberty was more central [to the Framers of the Constitution] than the people's liberty to govern themselves under rules of their own choice."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Judges who replace the judgments expressed in the words of the Constitution with their own views of what is right, what is fair, and what is just take from "we the people" the liberty that is most fundamental: to create government "of the people, by the people, for the people."<sup>8</sup><br><h2><b>The Hard Work</b></h2><br>Permit me a personal story that illustrates the difference between the hard way of understanding the Constitution and the easy way out. The day after the Senate confirmed my nomination to the D.C. Circuit, I was the happy recipient of many congratulatory messages in my office in the Administration Building here on campus. One came from a friend who was a former law partner--a person whose experience I value. He had served as a law clerk first to a distinguished judge on the court I was about to join and later to a storied justice on the Supreme Court. My friend asked if he could give me some advice about being a judge. I was teachable and anxious to hear what he had to say.<br><br>"The first day of my clerkship on the D.C. Circuit," he said, "my judge told me, 'This is how we go about our work: First, we learn the facts of the case. Next, we think long and hard about the fair outcome, the equitable disposition, the just result. Then we go find law to support our conclusion.' From what I have observed," my friend continued, "that is how most judges go about their work, and rightly so."<br><br>The purpose of the call was congratulatory. It was not an invitation to engage in a debate over the role of a federal judge under the Constitution, and so I simply thanked him for his words. But as I hung up the phone, I took a vow that I would never follow my friend's advice.<br><br>So this is what I tell my law clerks their first day in chambers: We, the people, have elected representatives who make the laws that govern our society. When a federal judge is called upon to resolve a dispute, he must first understand the nature of the controversy (on this count my friend's advice was sound), but then he must work to understand the meaning of the law that governs the disposition of the case. As Justice Felix Frankfurter put it, the judge is merely the "translator" of the law's command.<sup>9</sup><br><br>BYU law professor Brett Scharffs explained it best: "Following the law places a judge in a role that is, in large part, clerical, where he labors largely as a functionary, applying and implementing the law. ... The judge's primary task is to find and follow the law."<sup>10</sup>In that search, the judge must parse the words that have been put into law. Their meaning is his command, not his own views of what is right. He follows the law as it was enacted; he does not lead the law to where he believes it should go.<br><br>Thomas More was right. It takes a "forester" to work one's way through the thickets of the law. And when it comes to the Constitution, that is hard work. Well, not always. For example, it is not difficult to understand that the president of the United States must be at least thirty-five years of age, that a senator must be at least thirty, and that a member of the House of Representatives must be at least twenty-five. Nor is there any nuance in the requirement that the chief justice preside over an impeachment trial of the president in the Senate. But understanding other provisions of the Constitution requires more than simply reading the words of your pocket Constitution.<br><br>For many of us that poses a problem, because careful reading is hard work. An example from a source familiar to this audience makes this point. In the first chapter of the Book of Mosiah, Mormon describes King Benjamin, a towering figure (forgive the pun) who, a close reading of the Book of Mormon shows, dominated subsequent Nephite history. Among his many accomplishments King Benjamin is credited with something of a Renaissance in classical learning among his people. The almost 300-year period between the death of Enos and the ascension of King Benjamin to the Nephite throne seems to have been a time of cultural decline. Among the many reforms he championed, King Benjamin "caused that [his children] should be taught in all the language of his fathers."<sup>11</sup>John Welch suggests that King Benjamin "taught [his children] Hebrew, the language of his fathers, as well as Egyptian, which he himself knew. ... One can assume," Welch continues, "that he knew and taught them not only vocabulary words, but also grammar, syntax, style, form, composition, and literary appreciation."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Why did King Benjamin teach his children these skills? Mormon tells us: "That thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers."<sup>13</sup>My gloss: King Benjamin wanted his children to understand the scriptures--a task that, in his view, required significant preparation.<br><br>Some will bristle at the thought that understanding scripture might take more than sincerity of purpose--that it might also involve training. What about Tyndale's plowboy,<sup>14</sup>you say? Well, sure, a plowboy can understand the scriptures<i>if he has learned how to read them carefully.</i>At least King Benjamin thought his children needed training. Joseph Smith thought the study of Hebrew a worthwhile pursuit to better understand the Old Testament. As you may have noticed, our world is aflame with "sincere" people whose "straightforward" readings of scripture have led to mischief and worse.<br><br>My point is only this: important texts deserve careful and close reads. When we engage in that type of study, we learn things about the text's meaning that don't yield themselves to casual reading and that may be somewhat surprising. I learned much about the value of close reading from two friends on the faculty at BYU. Both philosophy professor Jim Faulconer and English professor Brandie Siegfried learned how to read a text closely under the tutelage of rabbi scholars. Professor Faulconer suggested to his tutor at Penn State that they take the entire eight-week term to read the Book of Genesis. After all, Jim wanted to study the book carefully. Jim was surprised that his professor was amazed at his proposal, certain that it was impossible to read so much in so short a time. His professor suggested they could only cover the first chapter of Genesis at most. As it turned out, they made it through chapter three, but Professor Faulconer reports that his tutor clearly felt rushed. Professor Siegfried's teacher at Brandeis wouldn't be rushed. They spent an entire month on the first verse of Genesis.<br><br>Sounds like hard work to me, and from professors Faulconer and Siegfried we get more bad news: Not only is close reading hard work, but it takes time. Much time. Much undistracted time. But BYU students should know that already. As LaVell Edwards has taught us by precept and example, "Far more important than the will to win is the will to prepare." For my purposes today I would say, "Far more important than the will to understand the Constitution is the will to prepare yourself so that you can understand the Constitution."<br><h2><b>A Close Reading of the Constitution</b></h2><br>Let's look at two examples of what a close reading of the Constitution might show. I have chosen two provisions that have been much debated of late. First we'll examine the Second Amendment. Then we'll talk about the Commerce Clause.<br><h3><b><i>The Second Amendment</i></b></h3><br>The Second Ammendment reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br><br>For years there has been a vigorous debate about whether the Second Amendment protects an<i>individual right</i>to private ownership of firearms or a<i>collective right</i>to possess firearms as a member of a state militia. In 2008 the Supreme Court took up that issue in a case called<i>District of Columbia v. Heller.</i><sup>15</sup>In Heller a citizen of the District of Columbia challenged provisions of the D.C. Code that effectively prohibited individuals from possessing handguns in their homes.<br><br>In a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court held that this law violated the Second Amendment. For my purposes today, what interests me most about the Supreme Court's ruling is not the outcome but the fact that both Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Stevens, who wrote a dissent for the minority, attempted to find the meaning of the Second Amendment using what I have called the "hard work approach" as opposed to the easy way out. Each engaged in a careful reading of the language of the Second Amendment, examining its history and context in an effort to give force to what its words and phrases meant at the time they were ratified. In their opinions, which totaled 149 pages, Justices Scalia and Stevens meticulously dissected every single word and punctuation mark of what is a comparatively brief provision of the Constitution. Their opinions delved deeply into the history leading up to the decision to adopt the amendment. Grammar, linguistics, history, and the law all converged--on two irreconcilable answers.<br><br>Five justices of the Supreme Court concluded that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to "keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense."<sup>16</sup>Four thought that it protects only a collective right to possess arms as part of service in the state militia. Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia considered numerous contemporary sources--state constitutions, laws, legal texts, dictionaries, and newspapers--to try and understand how citizens at the founding of the republic used and understood terms like "keep and bear arms." His study concluded that the Framers thought that private, individual ownership of firearms was a bulwark against tyranny, part of the right of self-defense that reached beyond one's participation in a state-sponsored militia.<sup>17</sup>Writing for the minority, Justice Stevens observed that "an issue of central concern for the Framers" was "the proper allocation of military power" between the states and the federal government.<sup>18</sup>He concluded that the Second Amendment was part of a broader scheme to protect state militias and avoid the specter of a standing federal army.<sup>19</sup>In Justice Stevens' view, this purpose limits the scope of the right it protects.<br><br>My aim is not to revisit the debate over the meaning of the Second Amendment but to show how nine thoughtful justices of the Supreme Court--acting in good faith and using the same interpretative tools--can arrive at different conclusions about the meaning of an important part of the Constitution.<br><h3><b><i>The Commerce Clause</i></b></h3><br>My next example comes from the Supreme Court's recent decision that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,<sup>20</sup>called "Obamacare" by some. The argument over the act in the courts was not about how best to provide healthcare in America. Rather, the debate was over a much larger question about the role of the federal government in our lives. That debate turns, somewhat surprisingly to many, to a provision in the Constitution known as "the Commerce Clause." This clause is set forth in Article I of the Constitution, which describes the enumerated powers granted to Congress: "The Congress shall have Power . . . to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Defenders of the act argued that the phrase in the middle of the Clause--conferring on Congress the "Power . . . to regulate Commerce . . . among the several States"--laid the foundation on which Congress rested the most controversial provision of the act: the mandate that each person must purchase insurance or suffer a monetary penalty.<br><br>You may not like the idea that a majority of Congress can tell you that you must buy health insurance or pay a penalty. After all, you're young, healthy, and free. On the other hand, you might think it's a really good idea to compel everyone to participate in a market so that people who have not been able to afford health insurance will be able to do so. But the hard work of understanding the Constitution requires more than simply asking yourself which policy you favor. And in this instance, as with the Second Amendment, the hard work of understanding the Constitution requires an understanding of some history. Follow me on a brief excursion into our economic past.<br><br>Recall that the Constitution was born out of the ashes of political failure. Our young nation first attempted to create some form of a union with the Articles of Confederation. But rather than<i>unifying</i>our thirteen ragtag colonies, the articles exacerbated the different political and economic interests "among the several States." Chief among the complaints directed at the Articles of Confederation was that they encouraged the states to protect their narrow economic interests, to the detriment of the other states. Thirteen separate political bodies authored tax codes and regulatory regimes, favoring local goods and producers over those from other regions. Virginia and the Carolinas had tobacco. Pennsylvania had wheat. Connecticut and Massachusetts had fish. New York had shipping. And so on. Such a system might enrich a few local producers but it could not create a truly national economy. And without a national economy, America would be relegated to second-tier status, always lagging behind those nations that make it easy to buy and sell across regions and oceans, enlarging their economies and enriching their citizens.<br><br>As part of an effort "to form a more perfect Union," we, the people, gave Congress the power "to regulate Commerce . . . among the several States." In other words, Congress can regulate goods that are produced in one place and sold across state lines--like wheat grown in Pennsylvania and sold in New York. And the Supreme Court said, in a case called<i>United States v. Darby,</i>that Congress can even regulate the inputs to goods that travel in interstate commerce--like the wage a farmer pays his field hand for harvesting wheat in one state and selling it elsewhere.<sup>22</sup><br><br>But in 1942, in a case called<i>Wickard v. Filburn,</i>the Supreme Court articulated an even broader scope of the Commerce Clause.<sup>23</sup> Congress, the court said, has the power to regulate activity that has a "substantial effect"<sup>24</sup>on interstate commerce. In<i>Wickard</i>Congress had enacted legislation that imposed a quota on the amount of wheat that could be grown. Administering this law, the secretary of agriculture forbade a farmer in Ohio named Roscoe Filburn from growing wheat on more than eleven acres of his farm. Filburn disregarded that directive and grew wheat on twenty-three acres. The secretary ordered Filburn to destroy the excess crops and pay a fine. Filburn challenged the secretary of agriculture in court.<br><br>Filburn grew wheat only for use as chicken feed on his own farm. He did not sell his wheat to anyone, let alone to someone across state lines. Filburn argued in court that Congress had no authority to limit the amount of wheat he grew because none of it was entering interstate commerce and Congress could not regulate his conduct that was not in interstate commerce. To the surprise and consternation of some, a unanimous Supreme Court decided that the wheat quota passed by Congress and enforced by the secretary of agriculture applied to Filburn because his decision to grow and consume his own wheat<i>substantially affected</i>the price of wheat produced for interstate commerce. As the court saw it, if Wilburn grew his own wheat for chicken feed on his farm, he wouldn't be going to the market to meet that need. Not buying that wheat on a market in which wheat was traded nationally would, in the view of the Supreme Court, substantially affect interstate commerce. Because Congress has the power to direct activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, so the argument goes, Congress had the power to tell Filburn he could not grow more wheat than the quota, even though his wheat would never enter interstate commerce.<br><br>How far does this view of Congress's power extend? Supporters of the Affordable Care Act argued that people who choose not to buy health insurance--like Filburn not buying wheat he could grow himself--drive up the price of insurance for those who<i>do</i>purchase it. Their action--or inaction--substantially affects the national market for health insurance, and the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate their inaction.<br><br>But that cannot be correct, say opponents of the act. The ability "to regulate interstate commerce"<sup>25</sup>cannot be extended so far as to encompass the ability to regulate inactivity. Stretching the Commerce Clause that far would mean that Congress could regulate anything that has even the most tenuous influence on interstate markets. There is a difference, they argue, between regulating someone who is participating in a market and forcing someone to enter a market.<br><br>These two competing views of the Affordable Care Act reflect a debate as old as our nation. Proponents of a broad view of the Commerce Clause generally trust Congress, as representatives of we, the people, to regulate anything<i>it</i>determines has an aggregate effect on interstate commerce. Skeptics of congressional power, on the other hand, distrust Congress to police the limits of its own power. They see a fox guarding the chicken coop.<br><br>Five justices ultimately decided that, because the Affordable Care Act regulated inactivity, it exceeded Congress's power to regulate commerce.<sup>26</sup>And yet the act was ultimately upheld under Congress's power to tax.<sup>27</sup>This decision goes to show that just when you think you've muddled through the hard work of deciphering one small phrase in one small section of the Constitution, another one pops right up to complicate things. This is frustrating, and yet it keeps me employed.<br><br>The arguments over the Second Amendment and the Commerce Clause, as well as debates over the extent to which the First Amendment recognizes a zone of religious liberty, what the Fourteenth Amendment means when it speaks of "the equal protection of the laws," and the power of the president to engage our military in hostilities or protect the homeland from espionage, involve the hard work of studying the text and structure of the Constitution and history--a lot of history. What was the problem the Framers were trying to address? Why did they choose the language they did? What did they think they were legislating? What did those who ratified the provision of the Constitution understand it to mean?<br><h2><b>The Responsibility of Citizenship</b></h2><br>I'm sorry to be the bearer of this bad news of hard work, but remember what Susan W. Tanner taught us repeatedly and so well when she was president of the Young Women organization: "I can do hard things."<sup>28</sup>And our system of constitutional government supposes that you and I will engage in this hard work. The serious study of the Constitution is a lifelong endeavor. Writing in the<i>Ensign</i>magazine, Elder Dallin H. Oaks repeated what he called his "favorite prescription for patriotism," which comes from Adlai Stevenson, the former governor of Illinois, who was twice the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party: "Patriotism . . . is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime."<sup>29</sup><br><br>Being a citizen is a great honor with significant responsibilities--responsibilities not discharged by merely watching<i>The Daily Show.</i>To be sure, Jon Stewart should be part of the mix of the information you ingest, but so also should be reading the<i>New York Times,</i>the<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>the<i>National Review,</i>the<i>New Republic,</i>and other journals of opinion and analysis in which the serious debate about our nation is carried on. It's a lot to do, I know, but citizenship is serious business that requires effort.<br><br>This idea has ancient and venerable roots. Aristotle understood citizenship to be more than simply reaping the benefits of others' participation in the civic and political life of the community. The work of citizenship, he taught, is hard work that calls upon us to use our best thinking, our most careful study, and our most rigorous analysis.<sup>30</sup>Theodore Roosevelt may have been channeling Aristotle when he said, "The first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight."<sup>31</sup><br><br>I have another purpose in my remarks, and it may be more important than anything else I've said. I began by applauding the increased use of the Constitution in our public discourse. But there can be a danger in invoking ultimate authority like the Constitution in support of an argument. If we are not careful, we may lose sight of one of the most important civic virtues: humility.<br><br>The incomparable Judge Learned Hand captured this sense of humility by quoting Puritan revolutionary Oliver Cromwell: "I beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think ye may be mistaken." Judge Hand then added: "I should like to have that written over the portals of every church, every school, and every court house, and, may I say, of every legislative body in the United States."<sup>32</sup><br><br>Judge Hand also wisely noted, "The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women."<sup>33</sup><br><br>I have noticed that some of the political debate in our community has lost sight of Judge Hand's observations. I distance myself from the foolish nonsense that to be a Latter-day Saint in the United States today requires or even tends toward a particular partisan affiliation. Quoting one of his former professors, Harold Macmillan--prime minister of Great Britain and chancellor of Oxford University from 1960 to 1986--described the primary purpose of a university education to a graduating class at Oxford:<br><br><i>Nothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you in after life--save only this--that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when<b>a man is talking rot,</b>and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole purpose, of education.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>If your education at BYU hasn't helped you see that such partisan talk is "rot," then you have failed in your studies. And I'm not kidding.<br><br>Disagreement is critical to the well-being of our nation. But we must carry on our arguments with the realization that those with whom we disagree are not our enemies; rather, they are our colleagues in a great enterprise. When we respect each other enough to respond carefully to argument, we are filling roles necessary in a republic.<br><br>About civility, Peter Wehner wrote:<br><br><i>Civility has to do with . . . the respect we owe others as . . . fellow human beings. It is both an animating spirit and a mode of discourse. It establishes limits so we don't treat opponents as enemies. And it helps inoculate us against one of the unrelenting temptations in politics (and in life more broadly), which is to demonize and dehumanize those who hold views different from our own.</i><br><br><i>. . . Civility, properly understood, advances rigorous arguments, for a simple reason: it forecloses ad hominem attacks, which is the refuge of sloppy, undisciplined minds.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>As he frequently does, C. S. Lewis puts it best and in language this audience will understand: "Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbour is the holiest object presented to your senses."<sup>36</sup><br><br>And so, as we engage in the challenging and vexing work of citizenship, and especially as we debate fundamental principles of how best to carry out the unique calling that is America's, keep in mind the counsel, nay the plea, of our greatest president, delivered at the most perilous time in our nation's history:<br><br><i>We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</i><sup>37</sup><br><br>Thank you very much. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.<br><br><i>Thomas B. Griffith was a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit when this BYU forum address was given on 18 September 2012.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> and Joy in the Gospel of Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesn't begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I can't help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.<br><br>I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.<br><br>Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!<br><br>Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.<br><br>What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I don't know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naïve sometimes about life. I can't remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:<br><br><i>Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.</i><br><br>I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so much to be happy about in this world. And when we fail to see the world around us for the wonder and joy that it has to offer and when we refuse to see the hope and the light everywhere around us, we are not seeing the world as it truly is. We are not seeing the world as Heavenly Father sees it.<br><br>I have to tell you about something that happened to me just last Tuesday afternoon when I was writing down this very idea of needing to see the good in the world. I stood up for a moment to take a break from my writing, and I looked out my fifth-floor window in the Tanner Building, which has a perfect view of the walkway that rises from Helaman Halls up past the Tanner Building. As I looked down, I saw a young man in a wheelchair who was wheeling himself up that long, steep walkway. And just as I started thinking about how much effort that must take, I saw another young man just slightly ahead on the walkway turn around and notice this young man in the wheelchair. I don't know if they knew each other or if they were complete strangers, but in that moment the one young man walked quickly around and behind the wheelchair, and he pushed the other young man up the rest of that long walkway. In fact, he practically ran as he pushed him up that hill.<br><br>This simple moment in time--1:30 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon--witnessed to me again how much light and goodness are everywhere around us if we will just look. So today I want to share with you five lessons that I have learned in my life about how to be positive in a world filled with negativism. Each of these lessons is based on experiences I have had as a husband and a father. Now, I am fully aware that Elder Steven E. Snow spoke two weeks ago from this very pulpit about optimism, but as much as I tried to steer my thoughts to another topic, the Spirit kept bringing me back to this one. So I can only trust that Heavenly Father thinks we could use a double dose of this particular topic--and perhaps even more at times.<br><h2><b>Righteousness Does Not Mean Perfection</b></h2><br>The first lesson about being positive in a negative world is that righteousness does not mean perfection. A humorous experience from when our family was younger taught me this lesson. I say humorous--it is now, but it wasn't then. When my oldest daughter, Ashlyn, was almost ten years old, we were camping at Palisade State Park in the mountains above Manti, Utah. With my kids so young, they weren't a whole lot of help setting up our massive tent with those flexible, fiberglass poles that you have to push through the sleeves in the tent and then try to lift all at once to get the tent to rise. While my wife was unloading our vehicle and setting up the rest of camp, I was struggling to get the tent off the ground on my own. Then, suddenly, with one of my pushes on the poles to get the tent to rise, I snapped the pole. I am ashamed to admit that at that moment I let slip from my mouth a colorful word that I dare not repeat here. Oh, it wasn't a horrible word, but my daughter clearly recognized it to be a swear word. I continued on in my battle to set up the tent and eventually succeeded with the help of some duct tape and other makeshift efforts to get the tent up.<br><br>Unbeknownst to me at the time was the conversation that followed between my daughter and my wife. Melinda later told me that my daughter approached her with a troubled look on her face and said, "Mommy, I thought Daddy was perfect."<br><br>My immediate reaction was to feel horribly ashamed for having crushed my daughter's perception of me. My second reaction was to think, "Wow, I managed to get my daughter all the way to ten years old convinced that I was perfect!"<br><br>But all humor aside, I felt pretty bad for what I had done. And then came the teaching moment. My dear wife said simply to my daughter, "Daddy is not perfect, but he is righteous." It was one of those moments when I was profoundly reminded that I had married an angel, for who else could have come up with such a simple teaching in that moment?<br><br>Perfection can sometimes be the enemy of righteousness. When we get so caught up worrying about being perfect--about being a perfect spouse, a perfect son or daughter, a perfect parent, a perfect teacher, or a perfect friend--it's easy to become discouraged, because none of us will ever be perfect in this life. Even though our Savior commanded us to be perfect like Him and our Heavenly Father (see 3 Nephi 12:48), He has no expectation that we will accomplish that in this life. It's impossible. Remember, He taught Moroni that He gives unto us weaknesses so that we can be humble. And if we humble ourselves, His grace is sufficient to make those weaknesses become strengths (see Ether 12:27) but not perfections.<br><h2><b>Keep Trying Anyway</b></h2><br>The second lesson about being positive in a negative world is that life really is hard sometimes, and you've got to keep trying anyway. My son Tanner taught me this one day when he was eight years old. Tanner had decided to switch from skiing to snowboarding that year, and it was his first day on the slopes. Now, those of you who have snowboarded know that the first day is typically horrible and painful. In fact, most instructors say that you can't make a decision about whether you like snowboarding unless you've tried it three days, because most people still hate it after the first two days. I still haven't tried snowboarding, and I'm not sure I ever will. But if I do, I will have to rent one of those giant sumo costumes with all the extra padding just to protect myself from all the falls! I haven't done it yet.<br><br>Well, Tanner's first day on the snowboard proved to be like most first days--very painful and frustrating. Initially he started down the mountain with his older brother, who knew how to snowboard. But every two or three feet Tanner would fall down, catching a toe and landing on his stomach or sliding his heels too far and landing on his rear end. He was crying and yelling the entire way down the mountain! He got to the point where he didn't even want to try standing up anymore; instead he just slid down the mountain on his bum. And after what seemed like two hours, he finally reached the bottom of the hill. He was exhausted physically and mentally. He was in pain, and I was very tired of dealing with my cranky son.<br><br>Fortunately we were staying in a lodge at the base of the resort, so we decided to take a break. I figured Tanner was done for the day anyway. So, after a good lunch and sitting around a bit, I was surprised when Tanner said he wanted to go out again. I asked him if he remembered what the morning had been like. But he said he wanted to try again anyway. I don't know what happened, but that afternoon his attitude was completely different. He kept getting up every time he fell, and by the end of the day he could butter down the hill pretty well. And today he can carve a line down any hill his older brothers can ride.<br><br>Life sometimes really is hard, and all we can do is get back up on the snowboard, even though we know perfectly well how easily that snowboard can slide out from under us. Some of you know what it's like to struggle with addictions, and getting back up after falling off those particular snowboards can be very frustrating. You may wonder if you will ever be able to overcome that addiction. When you feel this frustration--the physical and mental anguish from trying and failing and trying again--please remember this wonderful counsel recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 123:<br><br><i>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:17]<br><br>When you're sitting there wondering if you can stand back up again, remember that sometimes the test is not about overcoming but about whether we will keep trying no matter how hard things seem to be. Never give up. Do all things cheerfully that lie in your power, and then stand still with the assurance that God will help you.<br><h2><b>Keep Your Focus on Heavenly Father</b></h2><br>The third lesson about being positive in a negative world is to keep your eyes focused on Heavenly Father. When my youngest daughter, Maleah, was nearly two years old, she was playing in the cultural hall of our church in New Canaan, Connecticut. You know those doors that open up under the stage where we store chairs and tables? Maleah was playing with those doors and accidentally closed both doors at the same time really hard with her thumb in between them. She just cried and cried, our sweet little girl. When she finally settled down, we noticed that her thumb was stuck in a bent position. After visiting the emergency room and then a hand specialist a week later, we learned that Maleah had what is called congenital trigger thumb, in which the tendon that flexes the thumb is stuck in its sheath, holding the thumb in a bent position. We waited a few weeks at the doctor's recommendation to see if it might heal itself. And when that didn't happen, we scheduled a time for surgery.<br><br>Early that morning at the hospital, our little girl--who normally bounces off walls, wrestles with her older brothers, and generally causes havoc wherever she goes--was pretty subdued. We dressed her in the cutest yellow hospital clothes they had and found some fluffy red socks to keep her feet warm. Then the nurse took us down to a closet where Maleah chose a cute pillow-soft teddy bear to take with her into the surgery prep room. Then I put on some scrubs, we said good-bye to Melinda, and I carried my sweet little girl down the hall to the prep room, her arms tightly around my neck.<br><br>I was so worried that she might not let go and that she would be scared to go into surgery. But when we arrived in the room, I gave her a big hug and then gently laid her down on the table onto a nice warm blanket. The nurse put another warm blanket over Maleah while I talked with her, kept her calm, and placed her little teddy bear--which she snuggled closely--under her arm. I looked at her right in the eyes, and she looked at me while I explained that the doctor was going to put a mask over her face and that she was going to fall asleep. While holding my hand and looking into my eyes, she watched the doctor place the mask over her mouth and nose. Shortly after, I whispered to her that I loved her, and I watched her little lips inside the mask speak the words "I love you too." Then her little lips started to quiver, and she closed her eyes to sleep. My sweet little girl who bounces off walls had calmly gone into surgery listening to my voice and looking deeply into my eyes. It was one of the most sacred experiences of my entire life.<br><br>From this and many other experiences as a father and as a bishop, I have learned how deeply Heavenly Father loves each one of us. He is always nearby when we are going through tough times, but it's up to us whether we will look into His eyes and listen to His voice. We look into His eyes and we listen to His voice when we immerse ourselves in the scriptures and we converse with Him in daily, meaningful prayer. I testify to you that by keeping our focus on Him and listening to His voice, we will see the goodness and wonder that surrounds us, even in the most difficult of circumstances.<br><h2><b>Heavenly Father's Approval Matters Most</b></h2><br>The fourth lesson about being positive in a negative world is that Heavenly Father's approval is the only approval that matters. I was reminded of this lesson this past spring when I took my boys to a place called Snogression--an indoor practice facility in Salt Lake City for skiers and snowboarders. It has trampolines everywhere and a massive foam pit so that skiers and snowboarders can practice their tricks without having to worry about landing perfectly. The coolest feature of this facility is the practice ramp. A person stands up at the top, holds onto a bar, and, when ready, clicks a button. The bar pulls them down the ramp, accelerating them into the jump so they can go flying out into the foam pit. This foam pit is pretty huge too--it's about fifty by fifty feet. It's an enormous place. You're not going to get hurt, but you'll have a hard time getting out of it. It's really deep.<br><br>Dallin, my thirteen-year-old son, was the most excited to go to this facility. He wants to be a professional free skier someday, and he could probably spend every day at Snogression and never get bored. But on this first day he was a little bit timid. He'd probably be the first to tell you that he was worried about looking foolish to all the other cool kids who were there. Their approval mattered a lot to him. As a result, he hadn't tried anything really hard during the whole session. Then, on his last chance of the day, I yelled up to him from by the foam pit (where I was filming) that he should try a backflip. I knew he could do it because I'd seen him do much more difficult tricks on our trampoline, but I wasn't sure he'd have enough courage to try with so many others watching him. Well, watch and listen carefully to this video clip to see what happened next. [A video of Dallin doing a backflip was shown.]<br><br>What you see here is Dallin jumping up and down, trying his best to relax and loosen up. Then he grabbed the bar and hit the button. I couldn't believe my eyes as Dallin completed a near perfect backflip. Everyone there was cheering with excitement--and no one louder than me. Dallin floated around on cloud nine for the rest of the day.<br><br>Why do we care so much about the approval of others? Why do we "aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 121:35) and forget that Heavenly Father's approval is all that matters in the end? When we allow our decisions to be influenced by the approval of others, we put ourselves at the mercy of fickle mobs, ever-changing fashions, and the devil's whirlwinds. If instead we seek our Heavenly Father's approval only, we build our foundation upon a rock that cannot be moved (see Helaman 5:12). And I can think of nothing that will bring us more stability and optimism than building our foundation upon the rock of our Redeemer.<br><br>When we got home from our trip to Snogression, we took out the video camera and watched Dallin's flip forward and backward, in fast and slow motion. And we listened as well. It was then that I realized what I nut I had been when Dallin threw that trick. I was a little embarrassed at first, but later I thought to myself, "This has to be how Heavenly Father feels when we stop worrying about what others think of us and try to use the talents He has given us." I think He is just as excited in celebrating our accomplishments as I was with Dallin's jump. I testify to you that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are our greatest cheerleaders and fan section. We will feel more joy and hope in this world when we do our best to seek and obtain Their approval.<br><h2><b>Look for and Remember the Joy in Our Lives</b></h2><br>The last lesson about being positive in a negative world is that we must look for and remember the joy in our lives. When was the last time you felt true joy? How long ago was it? Do you remember the details of that moment, and do you think of it often? As my final story today, I want to tell you about a time this summer when I felt true joy, brimming over and impossible to contain.<br><br>My son Tate is fifteen years old, and he practices the piano about three to four hours per day on school days and closer to six hours per day during the summer. This past spring he set a goal to play with the Utah Symphony in their Salute to Youth Concert, which is held each fall. It is a statewide competition that draws some of the best young pianists each year. Tate spent countless hours practicing and refining a fifteen-minute Chopin concerto and eventually submitted his best recording to the judges in late June in hopes that he would be selected to play in the final round of the competition later that summer. The finalists were to be announced the morning of July 20, which happened to be the day that our youth would be pulling handcarts up Rocky Ridge in Wyoming.<br><br>Time went by slowly, and we prayed as a family every day that Tate would make it to the final round of the competition. Eventually the youth trek began, and Tate seemed to forget the impending announcement amidst the excitement of pulling a handcart in the 95-degree Wyoming sun, crossing rivers, square dancing, and singing songs with his handcart brothers at the tops of their lungs.<br><br>On that Friday morning, soon after we sent our handcart company off toward Rocky Ridge, I received an unexpected text message from Melinda out in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming. Tate had been selected to play in that final round of the competition. I couldn't wipe the smile from my face, and I couldn't prevent the tears that came with it. That has to be one of the greatest emotions in the world--tears and smiling at the same time. I still remember the sweetness of how that moment felt and how I couldn't wait until noon, when I would be able to tell Tate personally. Here's what I recorded in my pioneer journal that evening about the events of that day:<br><br><i>Because I was taking lunches to the trekkers today, I got to catch up to Tate after he hiked Rocky Ridge. He looked so good coming into the break area, so strong and pure. After he had eaten</i>[lunch],<i>I asked him to come talk with me. I walked with him just a little ways from everyone so we could be alone, and I asked him if he was ready to hear the decision. He looked</i>[very]<i>concerned, and he said he wasn't sure he wanted to know because he didn't want to ruin the rest of his trek. I just looked at him in the eye, and I said, "You won't be disappointed." His look registered complete disbelief at what he had just heard. So I clarified, "Tate, you get to play in the final round of the competition." His face was an expression of pure joy, and he couldn't contain it. He reached out to me and hugged me like he has never hugged me before. He was in tears with joy. He even picked me up and swung me around, he was so excited. He walked off a little ways and just looked over the plains. He couldn't contain all that joy. He was so adorable to watch with his friends as they found out. Tate just kept smiling and crying. I experienced true joy for those precious minutes.</i><br><br>All of the stories I have shared with you today came from my personal journal. I have learned from my own experience that I feel greater joy and optimism in my life when I am keeping a daily journal. Now, I know that keeping a journal is an overwhelming challenge for most people. As one of my friends told me, he doesn't like keeping a journal because he writes too much about each day, and that ends up taking too long, and eventually he stops again. So, I have a recommendation for you to help you with this fifth and final lesson.<br><br>In October 2007 President Henry B. Eyring told of how he kept a journal for years by asking himself a single question every day. He said:<br><br><i>I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: "Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?" As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</i>["O Remember, Remember,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2007, 67]<br><br>This final lesson is perhaps the most important lesson of them all. To look for joy in our lives we need only look for the ways in which God's hand has touched us or our family or our friends that day. Sometimes He touches us through tender mercies. Other times He touches us with wonderful humor. And frequently we will see His hand in our lives by the way in which He prompts us to serve someone that day or to lift someone else who is struggling. We don't have to write lengthy, mundane journal entries about our days. Instead, we can simply write one or two lines in which we identify the hand of God in our lives that day. As we do this, we will see more clearly how blessed our lives really are. We will be filled with gratitude and optimism. We will see the world more in the way our Heavenly Father sees the world. We will see the world as it really is and be filled with joy and hope.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I testify to you that this world is a good world and that Heavenly Father sees it that way. He is a God of hope, of joy, of excitement, of enthusiasm, and of optimism. With all the negativism in the world, we can sort it out and see the world as Heavenly Father sees it. Let us not confuse righteousness with perfection. Let us get back up every time we fall. Let us keep our focus on Heavenly Father and listen to His voice. Let us seek His approval and not the approval of the world. And let us look for and remember the joy and the touch of God's hand in our lives every day. After all, the gospel is good news. The Savior has overcome the world, and He has prepared the way for us to do the same. That we may we feel the optimism and joy of His gospel every day of our lives is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>T.

<br>
<i>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. ... Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.<br><br>In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn "Count Your Blessings." I quote from the second verse:<br><br><i>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?</i><br><i>Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?</i><br><i>Count your many blessings; ev'ry doubt will fly,</i><br><i>And you will be singing as the days go by.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact--not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: "I can live for two months on a good compliment."<sup>3</sup><br><h2><strong>The Study of Gratitude</strong></h2><br>It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:<br><br><i>It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift--from friends, from family, from God--and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people's lives.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.<sup>5</sup><br><br>For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events that had happened to them each week; and the third group was simply asked to list five events, but they were not told to emphasize the positive or the negative. Before each participant wrote about their blessings or hassles, they completed a daily journal in which they rated their moods, their physical health, and their overall well-being. The moods they rated included feelings like distress, excitement, sadness, stress, and happiness, while their physical health included ratings such as headaches, sore muscles, stomach pain, nausea, coughing, sore throat, and poor appetite. The participants also rated how they felt about their lives, selecting from descriptions ranging from terrible to delighted.<br><br>The results of the ten-week study are impressive for the gratitude group. The gratitude participants felt better about their lives and were more optimistic about the future than people in the other two groups. The gratitude group also reported fewer health concerns, like headaches, and spent significantly more time exercising than people in the other two groups. According to the scale Dr. Emmons used to calculate well-being, the people in the gratitude group were a full 25 percent happier than the participants in the hassles or neutral groups.<sup>6</sup><br><br>In subsequent studies Dr. Emmons also reported that people who regularly kept a gratitude journal and were in the habit of recognizing and expressing gratitude for their blessings reported feeling closer and more connected to people, had better relationships, were more likely to help others, felt less lonely, felt less depressed, slept better, and were more pleasant to be around.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Another psychologist, Dr. Jeffrey Froh, summarized the practice of gratitude in this way:<br><br><i>As gratitude involves wanting what one has rather than having what one wants, instilling a sense of gratitude may help people appreciate the gifts of the moment and experience freedom from past regrets and future anxieties.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Indeed, over the past decade there has been a growing body of scientific literature linking the practice of consistent or "chronic" gratitude with a host of positive outcomes for our lives. Said one researcher, "The practice of gratitude is incompatible with negative emotions and may actually diminish or deter such feelings as anger, bitterness, and greed."<sup>9</sup>It is little wonder, then, that both ancient and modern philosophers recognized the value of gratitude--from the Roman philosopher Cicero, who stated that gratitude is "not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others"<sup>10</sup>to David Steindl-Rast, a Benedictine monk who penned these beautiful words: "The root of joy is gratefulness. ... It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful."<sup>11</sup><br><h2><strong>God's Constitution of Gratitude</strong></h2><br>I appreciate the academic contribution to our understanding of gratitude and its impact on our well-being. I also know that the scriptures and the words of prophets and apostles, both ancient and modern, teach us a great deal about gratitude and the need to cultivate a grateful heart. Through studying "the doctrine of gratitude" we can be instructed and motivated to develop a "gratitude attitude" in our lives. Remember Mormon's commentary regarding Alma's mission to the Zoramites:<br><br><i>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>What, then, is the virtue of the word of God as it relates to gratitude? Given our time today, I would like to look at three scriptures (and a few supportive passages) that I believe form a central part of what I would like to call "God's Constitution of Gratitude."<br><h3><b><i>Rendering Our Heartfelt Thanksgiving</i></b></h3><br>My first scripture: Psalm 24:1–2:<br><br><i>The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</i><br><br><i>For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.</i><br><br>In a similar statement, the Psalmist also wrote, "The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them."<sup>13</sup><br><br>The earth and all of its creations--everything--belong to God. He has ownership and blesses us with His possessions--even the gift of life. Yet, I sometimes feel a sense of entitlement and find myself thinking about what I created, what I purchased, and what I own: property, car, food, clothing, and my health. But, in reality, brothers and sisters, I have created nothing; I own nothing. As the Psalmist proclaimed, the rightful owner is Heavenly Father--He who graciously bestows His creations (including the air I breathe) for me to use in the short season I am here in mortality. That kind of heavenly, divine benevolence deserves our highest gratitude and praise!<br><br>King Benjamin clearly understood this principle of God's ownership and our indebtedness to Him, as he so beautifully explained in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i><br><br><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i><br><br><i>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>King Benjamin also said (and I'm paraphrasing) that if we were to muster up all of the thanks and praise we could possibly give, that would still be insufficient, given the multitude of blessings we receive from God.<sup>15</sup>King Benjamin was not saying, "Well, you can't possibly thank God for what He has given you, so why even try?" On the contrary, I believe he was saying that we ought to do our very best in thanking God and rendering our heartfelt thanksgiving to Him every day of our lives. In relation to this, I like what President Joseph F. Smith said:<br><br><i>The grateful man sees so much in the world to be thankful for, and with him the good outweighs the evil. Love overpowers jealousy, and light drives darkness out of his life. Pride destroys our gratitude and sets up selfishness in its place. How much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!</i><sup>16</sup><br><h3><b><i>Grateful People Are Happier People</i></b></h3><br>My second scripture: Doctrine and Covenants 59:7, 21:<br><br><i>Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things....</i><br><br><i>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</i><br><br>Does God need our thankful hearts and praise? Is Heavenly Father dependent upon our gratitude? Do our thankful prayers make God holier, wiser, or more omniscient? Absolutely not. Why, then, is it a commandment to be thankful in all things and acknowledge God's hand in our lives? I believe Joseph Smith gave us the answer to that question when he stated:<br><br><i>As God has designed our happiness--and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has--He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In short, we are commanded to thank God in all things because it promotes our happiness and well-being. Grateful people are happier people. If that were not the case, God would not command us to express our thanks to Him and to others. He loves us and desires our happiness, and He knows that expressions of gratitude to Him and to those around us will bring positive changes to our lives. As our Father, that pleases Him.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson understands the connection between gratitude and happiness and often speaks about this topic. In a recent conference address he stated, "Sincerely giving thanks not only helps us recognize our blessings, but it also unlocks the doors of heaven and helps us feel God's love."<sup>18</sup>President Monson also said that "to express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven."<sup>19</sup>I love President Monson's choice of words: Gratitude "unlocks the doors of heaven" and "to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven." As I have tried to live with a more grateful heart, I have felt the divine, experienced God's love, and been humbled.<br><br>I have also witnessed and felt gratitude's heavenly touch through other people, like an elderly Catholic nun my wife and I met in the city of Bethlehem. From 2007 to 2009 my wife and I had the privilege of working and teaching at the BYU Jerusalem Center. During that time we met a host of wonderful people (Christians, Muslims, and Jews) who influenced our lives in profound ways. On one occasion we were invited by one of the Jerusalem Center service couples--who oversaw the Church's humanitarian program in the Holy Land--to visit an orphanage in Bethlehem. The purpose of their visit was to determine needs and the appropriate assistance from the Church.<br><br>The orphanage was located in a residential neighborhood in Bethlehem near the Church of the Nativity. As we entered the building, the first sounds I heard were those of little children. We passed several rooms filled with small beds and noticed newborn infants lying in cribs and small children playing with one another. I also noticed a shortage of adult staff compared with the number of children I could see.<br><br>Our meeting was with the director of the orphanage--one of the most impressive people I have met in my Middle East travels: a diminutive, elderly, Catholic nun from France. Though small in stature, she was large in heart and spirit. As we visited with her we learned about the history of the orphanage, the number of children cared for, and the challenges of feeding and clothing so many precious children. There was no doubt the orphanage had its challenges. I noticed, however, that as she described the needs of the children and the problem of the shortage of staff and materials, there was not one word of complaint. Her speech was often punctuated with "Thanks be to God; thanks be to God."<br><br>After the humanitarian couple had assessed needs, they asked this little nun if the orphanage could use supplies like powdered milk, newborn kits, and other necessities for older children. She excitedly replied, "Anything will help us; anything will help us." As arrangements were being made for shipping and delivery of the needed goods, she sat quietly in front of us with hands clasped, as though she were in the act of praying, and repeated the words "thank you, thank you, thank you." Her gratitude was real and heartfelt. Her expressions of thankfulness touched me deeply, and I often think of this experience when I want to relive a moment when I saw gratitude's divine nature. Her example of a grateful heart amplified the words of the Psalmist when he declared, "O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever."<sup>20</sup><br><h3><b><i>Counting Your Blessings--Even in Adversity</i></b></h3><br>My third scripture: 1 Thessalonians 5:16–18:<br><br><i>Rejoice evermore.</i><br><br><i>Pray without ceasing.</i><br><br><i>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</i><br><br>Do you wonder what God would like you to be doing every day? The Apostle Paul declared that it is to rejoice, to pray, and to give thanks in everything. Paul's writings are filled with admonitions to be grateful, to give thanks, and to live in thankfulness. His counsel encouraging us to be more thankful is especially inspiring when you stop to consider that he was a Church leader who was scourged (receiving thirty-nine lashes); beaten with rods; left for dead after being stoned by his countrymen; shipwrecked three times--spending one night and a day in the water; bitten by a deadly snake; betrayed by those he thought were his friends; and falsely imprisoned and who suffered weariness, hunger, thirst, and cold and was in peril of robbers.<sup>21</sup>And I've been depressed over losing two football games!<br><br>I believe Paul's statement that we should "in every thing give thanks" is his counsel to recognize our blessings and practice gratitude in the worst of times--even in adversity. Yet you and I know that finding and counting our blessings during challenging times can be difficult. As someone once said, "The hardest arithmetic to master is that which enables us to count our blessings."<sup>22</sup>The gratitude math can sometimes be difficult when life assaults us with unexpected hardships and trials. Life's challenges--some serious, some less so--are common to all of us. In those challenging times when there does not seem to be much to be grateful for, President Monson has wisely counseled us:<br><br><i>Our realization of what is most important in life goes hand in hand with gratitude for our blessings.</i><br><br><i>Said one well-known author: "Both abundance and lack [of abundance] exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend ... when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance that's present--love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature, and personal pursuits that bring us [happiness]--the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience heaven on earth."</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Studies have shown that focusing on the negative in times of adversity--using derogatory or critical words as we talk to ourselves or others--can darken our mood and, much like a virus, infect the moods of those we interact with. Consciously choosing to fill our minds with thoughts of our blessings and feeling appreciation for those blessings can change the way we feel and brighten our spirits during difficult times. Even spending a few minutes thinking about our blessings--even numbering them--as we walk from class to class can add a little sunshine and encouragement to our lives. It's so simple, yet so powerful.<br><h2><strong>Increasing Our Gratitude</strong></h2><br>What, then, are some of the ways we can recognize our blessings, increase our thankfulness, and practice gratitude? Briefly, I would to like to suggest five:<br><h3><b><i>1. Try Keeping a Gratitude Journal</i></b></h3><br>Think of three to five blessings you have experienced throughout the day or the week and record them in a gratitude journal. Look for blessings from the mundane to the magnificent. Before writing in his gratitude journal, President Henry B. Eyring pondered the following question: "Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?"<sup>24</sup>As he faithfully kept his gratitude journal, President Eyring said:<br><br><i>Something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Remember, looking for our blessings will help us focus on what we have rather than on what we do not have. As the Greek philosopher Epictetus reminded us, "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has."<sup>26</sup><br><h3><b><i>2. Add More Thank-Yous to Your Vocabulary</i></b></h3><br>Saying "thank you" to someone brightens your day by affirming your positive feelings. It also lifts the spirits of those who are deserving of your thankfulness.<br><h3><b><i>3. Take Time to Write Thank-You Notes and Letters of Appreciation to People Who Have Blessed Your Life</i></b></h3><br>John Kralik, an attorney with a struggling law practice and personal family problems, determined to reverse the cycle of negative thinking through writing and sending one thank-you note each day of the year--365 thank-you notes in total. His note-writing endeavor taught him a valuable lesson: blessings can be easily overlooked unless we are consciously thinking about them each day.<sup>27</sup>To that end, note writing helps us identify, remember, and express our blessings.<br><h3><b><i>4. Live in the Present Moment and Try to Give Thanks for Small Blessings Encountered Every Day of Your Life</i></b></h3><br>As busy students, it is easy to get caught up in the tomorrow: next week's exam, next week's project, the paper due next Tuesday, the upcoming holidays. And while it's healthy to plan and prepare for future events, if you are too consumed with the tomorrows, there is a chance that you will miss something small and wonderful that is happening to you in the present moment. David Steindl-Rast posed this question: "Are we thankful or are we grateful? ... Could it be that the mystic gratefulness in the depth of every human heart sings with 'a still, small voice,' and is easily drowned out by the noise we endure and the noise we make?"<sup>28</sup>Sometimes living in the future can produce just enough noise to miss the still, small voice of gratitude we could find in the present moment.<br><br>A short illustration: A few weeks ago I was waiting in the Chicago O'Hare Airport for a connecting flight to Salt Lake City with two of my colleagues: Blake Boatright and Vance Theodore. As we were seated near our gate, reading and relaxing before the last leg of our journey, I was interrupted by a rather enthusiastic black Labrador dog sniffing around my briefcase and other belongings I had on the floor. A police officer was standing nearby, and I immediately recognized the dog as a "sniffer" dog looking for drugs or the residue of explosive materials. While the dog moved rapidly from person to person, sniffing purses and carry-ons, it returned to my briefcase for a second check. After a few sniffs and what seemed like 100 wags of its tail, the dog and the police officer disappeared. A short time later, a second sniffer dog stopped by our gate to check things out as well.<br><br>Now, I could have dismissed the experience and continued to focus on my reading or think about needed preparations for the following week in school. Instead, my mind turned to the present moment, and I began to think about the two dogs and their training. They were there to make sure everything was in good order. They were there to ensure my safety and the safety of others who would be flying that day. After contemplating this, I quietly expressed thanks to Heavenly Father for trainers and dogs with wildly wagging tails who were there to bless my life. As mundane as that might sound to you, it was an enriching feeling--one that I have thought of frequently. Look for blessings in the now or the present moments of your life.<br><h3><strong><i>5. Thoughtful Prayer</i></strong></h3><br>Prayer awakens our grateful heart. Forgetfulness is an obstacle to being grateful while "awareness is a precondition" to having a grateful heart.<sup>29</sup>Our personal prayers provide us with sacred time to ponder our blessings and express gratitude to Heavenly Father. As we thank Him daily, our gratitude should be centered on God's greatest gift to us: the gift of His Beloved Son, who ransomed us through the shedding of His blood.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, gratitude is a heavenly, spiritual gift and a spiritual force in our lives. May we have hearts that can feel, ears that can hear, and eyes that can see our blessings and live in continual gratitude toward God and those around us is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ray L.

<h1> Forgive Grievous Harms: Accepting the Atonement as Restitution - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I must say I never imagined myself at this podium. But I have imagined myself on this playing floor--and<i>imagined</i>is the right word. I've wondered what it would have been like to be Danny Ainge, who, during my freshman year at BYU, went coast-to-coast in the closing seconds of a Sweet Sixteen game against Notre Dame and scored over Orlando Woolridge. I've dreamed what it would be like to drain a three from just inside half-court, like Jimmer Fredette did against Utah. Unfortunately, my actual skill set wasn't a match for such imagined heroics. I'm quite sure it's not a match for this podium either. Still, I consider it a great honor to have this opportunity to speak to you this morning.<br><br>I love this university. I love the cool, crisp air of a late fall football game and the soft, golden light that falls on Y Mountain and Rock Canyon just before sunset. I even love wandering the stacks in the Harold B. Lee Library. BYU has had a great impact on my life.<br><br>My first experiences at BYU were in the late 1960s. Each summer my mother, my brother, and I came to BYU from our home in Pebble Beach, California, for spring or summer term so that my mom could work on completing her degree. We lived in Heritage Halls, or, to be more precise, we lived in what is now called "Classic Heritage" when it was almost new Heritage.<br><br>My mother ended up completing her English degree, and our home was forever enriched by what she learned at BYU. I mention my mom's education at BYU partly because important parts of my thinking on today's topic are derived from her thinking and writing on this topic.<sup>1</sup><br><h2><strong>The Doctrine of Forgiveness</strong></h2><br>The title of my remarks is "Faith to Forgive Grievous Harms: Accepting the Atonement as Restitution." Now, to some, any talk from a lawyer that focuses on forgiveness may seem odd. Don't lawyers depend upon a lack of forgiveness to function? In lawyerspeak, is a talk on the necessity of forgiveness an admission against interest?<br><br>I am convinced that practicing law with civility and integrity is a noble endeavor and fully compatible with a forgiving heart, and I'll have a bit more to say about this later. Indeed, before you become too critical of lawyers, listen to the words of my good friend Jim Gordon: "It is true that some lawyers are dishonest, arrogant, greedy, venal, amoral, ruthless buckets of toxic slime. On the other hand, it is unfair to judge the<i>entire</i>profession by a few hundred thousand bad apples."<sup>2</sup>Such quips can be a bit tough for those of us who are attorneys, but how much worse can it get, given the number of us whose parents, when we decided to go to law school, made sure to scrape off their car the "Ask me about my children" bumper sticker?<sup>3</sup><br><br>Turning to the concept of forgiveness, let me start with a familiar scripture. Matthew 18:21–22 reads:<br><br><i>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</i><br><br>Have you or a family member or a friend ever been terribly hurt by someone and found it difficult to forgive even once, let alone "until seventy times seven"? In such cases, do we say to ourselves, "The Lord can't really mean that I should forgive that sort of sin or abuse"?<br><br>Yet it seems clear that the Lord really does mean it. Our very salvation depends upon us being willing to forgive others. As Christ taught:<br><br><i>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</i><br><br><i>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>[Matthew 6:14–15]<br><br>That our own forgiveness should be conditioned on forgiving others can be a hard doctrine, particularly if the sin against us is horribly wrong and out of all proportion to any harm we've ever committed. Even harder, the Lord has indicated in modern revelation that "he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin" (D&amp;amp;C 64:9). This is a very strong statement: if we refuse to forgive, there remaineth in us the greater sin. How can this be? As I hope to explain, our salvation is conditioned on forgiving others because when we refuse to forgive, what we are really saying is that we reject, or don't quite trust, the Atonement. And it is our acceptance of the Atonement that ultimately saves us.<br><br>Why is it that we sometimes have trouble accepting the Atonement as recompense for the harms we suffer at others' hands? My experience is that we can sometimes forget that the Atonement has two sides. Usually, when we think about the Atonement we focus on how mercy can satisfy the demands that justice would impose upon us.<sup>4</sup>We are typically quicker to accept the idea that when we sin and make mistakes the Atonement is available to pay our debts.<br><br>Forgiveness requires us to consider the other side of the Atonement--a side that we don't think about as often but that is equally critical. That side is the Atonement's power to satisfy our demands of justice against others, to fulfill our rights to restitution and being made whole. We often don't quite see how the Atonement satisfies our own demands for justice. Yet it does so. It heals us not only from the guilt we suffer when we sin, but it also heals us from the sins and hurts of others.<br><h2><strong>The Analogy of the Forgiving Landlord</strong></h2><br>To help explain the two sides of the Atonement, let me try a rather homely analogy. Like most analogies and metaphors, it is not perfect in all respects. I hope, though, that it can aid understanding.<br><br>Suppose I find myself in a home built for me by a very generous landlord. It is a nice home. He encourages me to maintain and improve the home and gives me a number of instructions for making the home a nice place to live.<br><br>Over the years I sometimes improve the home, but other times, through my negligence, I make it worse. One time I flood the home when I fail to set the faucets to drip during a freeze. Another time my kitchen catches fire because I fail to turn off a burner on the stove. A couple of times I lose my temper and put my fist through a wall.<br><br>In each instance the landlord forgives me and encourages me to pay a little closer attention to my home and to his instructions for making the home a joyful place to live. He does not charge me for the damage caused by my mistakes. Instead, sometimes he is patient while I figure out how to fix things on my own; sometimes he sends someone over to fix the problem; and sometimes I wake up and things are fixed in ways I don't quite understand.<br><br>This same landlord happens to have a son who is quite wayward. The son is always up to no good, and I don't particularly like or respect him. One night the landlord's son, as a prank, sets fire to the shed attached to the back of my house. The fire gets out of control, and the entire house burns down. I lose the home. I lose all of my possessions, including some particularly valuable possessions that I can't replace, such as photos and heirlooms.<br><br>I'm angry and distraught. I want the no-good son to pay. I want him to fix things and to make me whole. A part of me knows he can't really make it better. He may not have the resources to rebuild the house, and, even if he could rebuild the house, he can't retrieve the photos and heirlooms. And that makes me even angrier.<br><br>As I sit in anger, the landlord comes to visit me. He reminds me that he has promised to take care of me. He promises me that he is willing to rebuild my house. In fact, he says that he will do more than that: he will replace my house with a castle and then give me all that he himself has. He says that this might take a while, but he promises it will happen.<br><br>"What's the catch?" I say.<br><br>"Here are the conditions," he says. "First, you need to put your faith in me and trust that I really will build you that castle and restore all that you have lost. Second, you need to continue to work on implementing the instructions I gave you about keeping up your house. Finally, you need to forgive my arsonist son, just as I have forgiven you all these many years."<br><br>That sounds easy enough and seems like an obviously great deal, but why might it be hard for the tenant to accept the landlord's offer? Or, to move away from the analogy, why is it sometimes so hard for us to forgive others? Let me suggest some reasons:<br><br>First, we are probably angry. We want the arsonist to pay. But if we harbor this sort of anger, we may spend so much time pursuing the person who burned down our house that we don't get around to rebuilding our house. As someone once said: "Resentment is like taking poison and hoping the other person dies."<sup>5</sup><br><br>It might also be hard to forgive because we can't quite believe that the landlord will fulfill his promise. He's never failed us when we've messed up the house before, but what about this time? Besides, it is usually easier for us to believe that the Lord will forgive our mistakes. This time it is someone else's mistake.<br><br>Trust can be particularly difficult if the rebuilding project will take time. We want things fixed now, not later. Trust may also be hard in the case of losses and hurts that do not seem easily fixable. Perhaps the landlord can rebuild the home, but can he really replace the photos and heirlooms? What if we lost a child in the fire? Can he really take away that pain?<br><br>My testimony is that the Atonement really can make us completely whole, even for those things that seem like they can't be fixed or repaired. As Isaiah foretold of the Savior: "The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, . . . to comfort all that mourn; . . . to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning" (Isaiah 61:1–3).<br><br>I recognize that this doctrine--that the Atonement can heal us from the hurts of others--is well established.<sup>6</sup>Yet, in my experience, it remains difficult to trust and accept that the Atonement serves this purpose. My hope is that I can add to what has previously been said on this topic and help remove some barriers to forgiveness by offering some reasons why we should trust the Lord's promise.<br><h2><strong>The Atonement Fulfills the MosaicLaw's Restitution Requirement</strong></h2><br>I turn first to the Mosaic law and to an insight I owe to my mother.<sup>7</sup>Remember that Paul taught that the Mosaic law "was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" (Galatians 3:24). Remember also Christ's statement to His disciples in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</i><br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</i> [Matthew 5:17–18]<br><br>Think about Christ's statement for a minute. Christ was comforting His faithful disciples--those who loved and revered the law of Moses. He was making sure they knew that His plan was to fulfill all the terms of the Mosaic law. But what exactly were those terms that He would fulfill?<br><br>Our answer to this question typically focuses on the portion of the Mosaic law that addressed Israel's obligation to make sacrifices.<sup>8</sup>We tend to emphasize the Savior's admonition that "your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away" and that instead we should "offer for a sacrifice . . . a broken heart and a contrite spirit" (3Nephi 9:19–20). Our usual focus on the law of sacrifice is again on ourselves--what sacrifices we need to offer up to access the power of the Atonement and heal our feelings of guilt and remorse.<br><br>But the law of sacrifice was just one component of the Mosaic law. The Mosaic law also included dietary laws and criminal laws--remember the<i>lex talionis</i>of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<sup>9</sup>It also included family law and various civil laws that we today might recognize as tort or contract law.<br><br>Isn't it plausible that when the Savior said He came to fulfill the law, He was talking about more than just the law of sacrifice? Shouldn't we take Him at His word that "one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled"? Although I am not an expert on the Mosaic law and surely do not understand exactly how Christ fulfilled the law in all its dimensions, let me suggest that the Atonement did, in fact, answer other demands of the Mosaic law.<br><br>Specifically, I want to focus on the civil law component of the Mosaic law and its requirement that restitution be made to persons harmed by the wrongful actions of another. I do so because the restitution requirement is so important to understanding the doctrine of forgiveness. Exodus 21 and 22 set forth several such restitution requirements. Consider two of many examples: If a person caused a fire to break out so that "the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire" was required to "make restitution" (Exodus 22:6). Similarly, if someone caused his livestock to graze in the field or vineyard of another, he was obligated to "make restitution" out "of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard" (Exodus 22:5).<br><br>This concept of restitution remains a key part of our law today. Under tort law, which is just another word for personal injury law, courts can award damages to persons injured by the negligence of another; similarly, under contract law, damages may be awarded to those harmed by a breach of contract. In the criminal context, many states allow crime victims and their families to prepare victim impact statements that describe the way in which they have been harmed.<br><br>The basic point is that, just like current law, the Mosaic law was not designed only to punish the wrongdoer. The Mosaic law also existed to protect, compensate, and make whole those harmed by others, whether intentionally or negligently. If Christ came to fulfill all the terms of the law, this part of the Mosaic law should also be fulfilled by the Atonement.<br><br>If the Mosaic law schools us that Christ intended to make full restitution for the harms we suffer, it does not indicate how that could happen. Just as it is difficult to understand exactly how the Atonement satisfies the demands of justice for our sins, it is challenging to grasp how the Atonement works to make restitution to us for the sins of others. As is the case with most such "how" questions in the gospel, we must ultimately fall back on our faith and trust the Lord that His promises are true even if the mechanism is uncertain. But as an aid to our faith, let me suggest a couple of ways in which the Atonement can be understood as making restitution.<br><br>First, even for something as horrible as losing a child because of another's sin, the Atonement ensures significant restitution through the Resurrection. We are promised that "every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame" (Alma 11:44). In addition, just like the wealthy landlord in my analogy promised not only that he would build the tenant a castle but also give the tenant all that he had, in scripture after scripture the Lord promises us all that He has.<br><br>D&amp;amp;C 88:107 states: "And then shall the angels be crowned with the glory of his might, and the saints shall be filled with his glory, and receive their inheritance and be made equal with him."<br><br>D&amp;amp;C 84:37–38 provides: "He that receiveth me receiveth my Father; And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him."<br><br>If we can inherit all the Father has and if all will be restored to its perfect frame, is there a reason we should insist that the person who hurt us pay us back? Hasn't justice been satisfied?<br><h2><strong>Forgiveness: Maximizing Faith Rather Than Minimizing Harm</strong></h2><br>It is critical to understand that forgiving others is not just a practical virtue. It is a profound act of faith in the Atonement and the promise that the Savior's sacrifice repays not just our debts to others but also the debts of others to us.<br><br>In our live-and-let-live society, we may believe that being forgiving is just etiquette and good manners. It is not. We may think that forgiveness requires us to let mercy rob justice. It does not. Forgiveness does not require us to give up our right to restitution. It simply requires that we look to a different source. The non-judgmental worldly phrases "don't worry about it" and "it's no big deal" are not illustrations of the doctrine of forgiveness. On the contrary, when a person sins against us, it can be a very big deal.<sup>10</sup>The point is that the Atonement is very big compensation that can take care of very big harms. Forgiveness doesn't mean minimizing the sin; it means maximizing our faith in the Atonement.<br><br>My greatest concern is that if we wrongly believe forgiveness requires us to minimize the harms we suffer, this mistaken belief will be a barrier to developing a forgiving heart. It is okay to recognize how grave a sin is and to demand our right to justice--if our recognition triggers gratitude for the Atonement. Indeed, the greater the sin against us--the greater the harm we suffer--the more we should value the Atonement. Consider Christ's parable of the two debtors from Luke 7:41–43:<br><br><i>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</i><br><br><i>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</i><br><br><i>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</i><br><br>If Simon is correct that the greater sinner will love the Lord even more, doesn't the same reasoning suggest that our love for the Savior will increase when He pays a particularly large debt owed to us? There is little value in claiming that a wrong against us is slight. Instead, if we give the wrong its full weight, we are better able to give the Lord a full measure of gratitude for making us whole.<sup>11</sup>And when we understand that the Lord promises us restitution, we can recognize that our anger at our victimizer is ultimately unnecessary. This in turn helps free us to love our enemy as the Savior commanded (see Matthew 5:43–44).<br><br>In sum, the principle of forgiveness does not require that we give up our right to justice or that we give up our right to restitution. Christ answers the demands of the law for our sins and for the sins of others. We just have to be willing to accept that He has the power to do so.<br><h2><strong>Forgiveness and the Lawyer</strong></h2><br>Now, let me return briefly to the subject I raised at the beginning of my remarks. Specifically, some may still be wondering whether focusing on the commandment of forgiveness is an admission against interest for a lawyer. To place the question squarely, does the commandment that we forgive all men mean that litigation and lawsuits are inherently wrong? I believe the answer to this question is no. But it is an important question that every lawyer must ask herself and that every client should also confront. Indeed, it is often a question with which those who have been grievously harmed must wrestle.<br><br>One of the best explorations of this issue is contained in a book by Elder Dallin H. Oaks entitled<i>The Lord's Way.</i>Elder Oaks begins by rejecting what he describes as two "extreme" views: first, that a Christian should "never use courts to resolve disputes," and second, that there are "no religious restraints on participating in litigation."<sup>12</sup><br><br>As an aside, isn't it interesting how such tough questions often cannot be reduced to easy all-or-nothing answers? I hope it is not just the lawyer in me, but I have always found it simultaneously comforting and stressful that the restored gospel frequently requires us to wrestle with understanding principles in apparent tension. Thus, both faith and works are necessary for salvation; both faith and reason are the work of this university; both the body and the spirit constitute the soul of man; both personal inspiration and priesthood authority are important to understanding God's will. Whereas the world often suggests that the answer must be either/or, the restored gospel finds a way to say both/and. It seems that a core principle of the restored gospel is that we must learn by our experience to understand, obey, and navigate eternal truths that may appear to be in some tension. Perhaps, more accurately, we are expected to embrace both sides of such apparently opposing principles.<br><br>Although one might be able to categorize some lawsuits as clearly inbounds or out of bounds, Elder Oaks, unsurprisingly, largely eschews categorization and instead focuses on principles or preconditions that should govern whether to file a lawsuit. For example, he emphasizes that we must begin by forgiving our adversary and removing revenge as a motive.<sup>13</sup>We should then pursue settlement as a manifestation of the principle articulated by the Savior in Matthew 18:15: "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."<sup>14</sup>Elder Oaks also identifies another precondition--that a litigant should consider the impact a lawsuit will have on others. Again, this is simply a manifestation of the Savior's teaching of the Golden Rule: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12).<sup>15</sup><br><br>Today let me suggest one additional set of criteria by which the conduct of a lawyer should be judged. Those criteria come from section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants and its teachings on exercising power in the priesthood. Now, I recognize that a license to practice law is quite different from holding the priesthood of God. Passing the bar doesn't give someone the authority to act in God's name, although critics may occasionally wonder if that's what some lawyers believe.<br><br>Still, if one stops and thinks about it, a legal education and a license to practice law are instruments of power. The power flows not just, or even primarily, from the state's exclusive license to give legal advice but also from the refined critical- and analytical-thinking skills and problem-solving skills that cause others to look to lawyers for help with their most vexing problems.<br><br>If, as lawyers, we have power, the question is how we should use it, or, for non-lawyers, how you should expect your lawyer to use his or her power. In that regard, let me paraphrase a few familiar verses from section 121:<br><br><i>The</i>[power of a lawyer]<i>cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i><br><br><i>That</i>[a license to practice]<i>may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, . . . Amen to . . . the authority of that</i>[lawyer]. . . .<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of</i>[a lawyer's status],<i>only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:36–37, 41–42]<br><br>Much more could be said on this topic, but today I simply want to emphasize that if lawyers use their power and authority consistent with the principles of section 121 and if clients, who may have been victimized, likewise adhere to these eternal yet challenging standards, litigation need not stand in opposition to the principle of forgiveness.<br><h2><strong>Accepting Both Sides of the Atonement</strong></h2><br>As I finish, let me return to the heart of my message, which is the Savior's promise in Matthew that He will "forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12). These are two sides of the same coin. We can't have faith in only one side of the Atonement. To be efficacious--to have saving power--our faith in Christ and His Atonement must include both His power to pay for our sins and His power to pay for the sins of others.<br><br>Harking back to my landlord-tenant analogy, sometimes we burn the house down through our own carelessness--we play with fire. Sometimes the house burns down through no fault of our own--lightning strikes and there is nothing we can do about it. Sometimes our house burns down because of the sins of others--such as with the landlord's arsonist son in my analogy. The wonder of the Atonement is that it works for all three cases. But our own receipt of the Atonement is conditional on forgiving others. If we do that, accept Christ, and strive to keep His commandments, we will receive the castle and all else the Father has. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James R. Rasband was dean of the BYU Law School when this devotional address was given on 23 October 2012.</i><br><br><strong>Notes</strong><br><br>1.

<h1>Choose Liberty or Captivity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We deal with one key aspect of the remarkable plan of salvation many times each day (in reality, many times each hour): agency, or the ability to choose for ourselves. As I was preparing these remarks, I tried to think of a comparison to convey the importance of agency in the plan of salvation. First I thought of a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. Have you ever put together a jigsaw puzzle and found out there was one missing piece? It can be frustrating, and the picture isn't totally complete without every piece of the puzzle. But I realized that this is not analogous to agency in the plan because the exercise of putting the puzzle together is basically the same whether or not you have all the pieces, and the finished project looks very similar to what was intended.<br><br>A more accurate comparison would be the crankshaft in an automobile engine. The crankshaft isn't just some emissions control gadget or even a power-steering pump or air-conditioning compressor. Without a crankshaft the engine will not start. It won't function at all. The purpose of the engine--to move a car--cannot be accomplished. There is no way around it. This is more like agency in the plan of salvation. Without it, the plan would not work.<br><br>Agency is essential to our progress and ability to become like our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ. The Savior chose good over evil in every choice He made. Part of our earthly experience consists of being enticed by both good and evil and then learning how to choose good over evil. How could we become like the Savior if we did not have agency to make those choices? By using our agency to choose the right, we begin to put on the divine nature--to pattern our lives after His. We find peace, happiness, and freedom as we make right choices.<br><br>In the pre-earth life, Lucifer tried to destroy agency. The scriptures teach us that "Satan rebelled ... and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him."1 Our Heavenly Father did not allow him to destroy this precious gift of agency. In fact, his attempt to destroy it is one of the reasons he was cast out of heaven.<sup>2</sup>We also learn from the scriptures that "he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice."<sup>3</sup><br><br>This sounds a little like a contradiction. Satan tried to destroy agency. Our Heavenly Father wouldn't allow it and cast him out. Satan will now deceive and blind men, and he will lead them captive at his will. If he is leading people captive, doesn't that sound like he is destroying agency? The fact is, he couldn't destroy agency in the pre-earth life, and he can't do it now either. If he can't destroy agency, then how can he lead us captive? He does it by enticing us to sin. When we sin, we subject ourselves to him. We, in effect, give part of our agency to him. He can't take it from us, but we can relinquish it.<br><br>This concept is explained in the context of the early history here on earth: "Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation."<sup>4</sup>When we yield to temptation, we become subject to the will of the devil. Again, even though he can't destroy or take away our agency by force, we can give it up.<br><br>Listen to some of the phrases from the scriptures illustrating this important idea:<br><br>• "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."<sup>5</sup><br><br>• "To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey."<sup>6</sup><br><br>• "They chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house ..., and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Lehi taught his sons very plainly:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Lehi pleaded with his sons not to "choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith observed:<br><br><i>Satan was generally blamed for the evils which we did, but if he was the cause of all our wickedness, men could not be condemned. The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all was voluntary. Those who resisted the Spirit of God, would be liable to be led into temptation. ... God would not exert any compulsory means, and the devil could not; and such ideas as were entertained [on these subjects] by many were absurd.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Elder James E. Talmage wrote:<br><br><i>Satan exerts a mastery over the spirits that have been corrupted by his practises ...; he seeks to molest and hinder mankind in good efforts. ... Yet in all these malignant doings, he can go no farther than the transgressions of the victim may enable him, or the wisdom of God may permit; and at any time he may be checked by the superior power.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Satan's ultimate goal is to make each of us miserable like he is.<sup>12</sup>Since he can't impose this misery, he has to find a way to convince us to choose it. Does this even sound like a feasible business plan? "Convince people to choose to be miserable." It sounds more like<i>Mission Impossible:</i>"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to convince people to choose misery over joy, bondage over freedom." It just sounds ridiculous. And yet, by all observations, he has been fairly successful in the world at large. And to the degree we have chosen to commit sins, he has even been successful with each of us.<br><br>With such an implausible goal, how has he been able to convince so many to choose a path through life that leads to misery? How is he able to convince even good people who are generally choosing righteously in life to commit sins? We have to remember that for us to exercise our agency in a way to help us become more like the Savior, we must be enticed by good and evil. The evil has to be enticing or it would be no test--no challenge, no real choice--and thus we would not experience real growth. But by us choosing good in the face of an alternative that is truly enticing, our characters are shaped and we start to reap the rewards of freedom and peace. We learn more deeply that we trust in a God who cannot lie,<sup>13</sup>and our faith increases.<br><br>So what makes it possible for the adversary to make evil and sin seem enticing? How do you sell misery, bondage, and disappointment? Well, you have to lie. He is a liar. In fact, he is "the father of all lies."<sup>14</sup>The only way he can sell sin is to portray it as something it isn't. He has to convince people that evil is good, or, in other words, that sin is right, that momentary pleasure equates with long-term joy, and that sin leads to freedom and happiness instead of to bondage and misery. He also throws in the idea that good is evil and that righteousness is bondage. Satan is a master at marketing. He has been at it for a long time, but the foundation of his marketing scheme is always lies.<br><br>Let's look at a few examples from the scriptures.<br><br>Cain loved "Satan more than God."<sup>15</sup>He bought into Satan's lies and chose to sin. There is a very telling description of Cain's reaction after he killed Abel: "And Cain gloried in that which he had done, saying: I am free; surely the flocks of my brother falleth into my hands."<sup>16</sup>It is clear he had fallen for the adversary's portrayal that committing sin (although Satan doesn't call it that) will bring happiness and freedom. Cain's exclamation "I am free" has to be in the top-ten list of the most deluded statements in all of scripture. He found out very soon that he was anything but free and anything but happy because of his action. Yet how many people have felt the same thing--a burst of exhilaration or a sense of freedom when they have committed a sin--and think they've gotten away with it?<br><br>There was a time in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites had become very wicked. Samuel, a Lamanite, was sent to preach repentance to them. He explained to the people:<br><br><i>Ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>They had bought into the idea that they could find happiness in doing iniquity--the fundamental lie upon which Satan bases all of his enticements. Of course he doesn't label iniquity "iniquity." He portrays it as something good and natural. These Nephites had not learned the lesson Alma taught his son Corianton: that "wickedness never was happiness."<sup>18</sup>Corianton, for a time, had fallen for the lie that he could break the commandments and that doing so would lead to happiness.<br><br>The adversary doesn't stop after we have decided to commit one sin. He wants us in his power. He wants us to be subject to him. Some of the related terms in the scriptures include "cords,"<sup>19</sup>"bonds,"<sup>20</sup>"chains,"<sup>21</sup>"captive,"<sup>22</sup>"subjection,"<sup>23</sup>and even "seal."<sup>24</sup>The Book of Mormon teaches us about his tactics to bring people into bondage by degrees: "He leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever."<sup>25</sup>The imagery is instructive. It starts with a single cord and progresses until they are bound with strong cords. We also read, "Others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains."<sup>26</sup>He carefully leads people into bondage. It is not done in one big Faustian bargain. Just as we progress line upon line in righteousness, we move to bondage sin upon sin.<br><br>This is one reason parents and leaders are so concerned when a young person starts to make wrong choices. Once we get entangled in the adversary's cords, getting out is much more difficult than getting in.<br><br>This bondage can be powerful. In the Book of Mormon we read about a time when<br><br><i>Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world. ...</i><br><br><i>And thus ... the people</i>[were] <i>delivered up ... to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should. ...</i><br><br><i>... And all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Later, as the civilization declined in Mormon's time, he lamented that his people were "led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith to steer her."<sup>28</sup>That imagery doesn't convey much freedom, does it? When we yield ourselves to the adversary, we become "things to be acted upon"<sup>29</sup>instead of being free to act for ourselves.<br><br>I don't know what the actual mechanism is for bringing about this bondage. I don't know exactly what happens in the soul, but I do know something happens, and it is very real.<br><br>There is a tendency to use bondage to sin as an excuse for sinful behavior. For example, someone who is abusive may say that they have always had a temper and can't help it if they yell at their family members. While it may be true that a person has a weakness, giving in to that weakness strengthens its hold on us. On the other hand, if we resist the temptation, the hold on us is weakened.<sup>30</sup><br><br>One of Satan's most effective tools is to clothe bondage in the costume of liberty. Peter warned the early Saints about individuals among them who would try to pull them away from the path of righteousness. He described these wicked individuals as "having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin. ... They speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh. ... Those that were clean ... while they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."<sup>31</sup><br><br>These people tried to lure others to sin by promising them liberty even though they themselves were in the bondage of sin.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we see that Korihor tried the same stunt, with a twist. He taught doctrines that brought people to the conclusion that sinning would bring them freedom and happiness, but he also focused on convincing people that the commandments and ordinances bound them down--that belief in God, Christ, and the prophets kept them in bondage.<br><br>Now that is a lie. The truth is that living the commandments makes us free. In fact, the irony in this situation is that Korihor was the one in bondage. He was not free. We don't know all of his sins, but one that bound him down was his lying. He always knew there was a God, but he repeatedly denied this fact and lied to others about it. When Korihor denied the existence of God to Alma, Alma told him, "I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God."<sup>32</sup>Korihor had chosen to lie initially and then continued to lie repeatedly until Alma described him as possessed with a lying spirit.<br><br>Today there are many individuals promoting or condoning sin, and parts of our culture also carry these dangerous messages. For example, we see in the media a lot of modeling of sins with seemingly no negative consequences. We see meanness, law-breaking, disrespect, breaking of the law of chastity, immodesty, and profanity in an almost constant stream. Many times goodness and righteousness are portrayed as naïve and silly at best and evil at worst.<br><br>Each of us has sins that easily beset us and bind us down.<sup>33</sup>No one is exempt. You might struggle with something different than I face. Even Nephi grieved that he struggled with temptations: "And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul?"<sup>34</sup><br><br>Since each of us has sinned and thus has subjected ourselves to the will of the devil to some degree, we need to somehow be freed from the bondage of sin. The Atonement has power to break these bonds, these chains, this captivity. When the Savior began His public ministry, He referenced a prophecy about Himself and His mission: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised."<sup>35</sup>Deliverance and liberty come through Him and His Atonement.<br><br>No matter what the nature of the sins in our lives--dishonesty, pride, hypocrisy, laziness, greed, challenges with the law of chastity, addictions, anger, Word of Wisdom problems--whatever sins we struggle with, we can be freed from any degree of bondage we may be in. Each of us has experienced this as we have repented in the past. We have felt true freedom as we have been forgiven and have jettisoned the behavior that has tormented us.<br><br>Sometimes these bonds are broken in a dramatic way. They seem to burst, and we are immediately freed. At other times the cords are loosed rather than burst.<sup>36</sup>It is almost as if a little at a time the cords that are wrapped around us are unraveled. But whether this happens all at once or gradually, the long-term effect is the same: we are free! And, either way, it is miraculous.<br><br>When we obey Satan, we give him power. When we obey God, He gives us power. This is not the message we get from the world, but it is the truth. Real power, the power to become like the Savior, is only found in obedience. Real freedom is found in obedience--in subjecting ourselves to God's will rather than to the will of the flesh or the will of the devil. Freedom through obedience: this sounds like a paradox, but those who have lived this way can testify it is true. Obedience brings power, freedom, joy, peace, and hope.<br><br>While obedience does protect us from spiritual bondage and the misery associated with sin, it doesn't bring us a life without challenges. There are things in this fallen world that can bring misery and suffering, such as sickness, death of loved ones, physical pain, and the actions of others. But misery from these sources will eventually be taken care of by the Atonement, and if we endure these challenges faithfully, they will not have eternal negative consequences for us. However, the misery resulting from sin can only be completely removed if we repent.<br><br>When we are righteous, Satan has no power over us. A prophecy about the Millennium teaches us that "because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness."<sup>37</sup>This scripture is speaking about the condition that will exist in the world when the people as a whole live in righteousness, but the principle can be true today for us individually. In a description of Captain Moroni, Mormon said, "If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men."<sup>38</sup>Individually we can be free from any power the adversary would like to have over us by living righteously. He only gains power as we allow it by our choices.<br><br>If we have something in our life that has bothered us and bound us down to some degree, let's repent. Let's get rid of it and increase the freedom in our lives. If you'll pick something and work on it, I will too.<br><br>Agency--the ability to make choices--is a crucial and wonderful gift, and we rejoice that we are here on earth able to choose good over evil and to progress toward exaltation. As we use our agency to choose the right, reject evil, and love God, His grace is sufficient for us, and by that grace we will become perfected in Christ.<sup>39</sup>To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Paul V.

<h1>nal Education - Nancy Wentworth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a humbling experience to be asked to speak at a devotional, but I am happy to be with you today to share my testimony of the gospel.<br><br>I love being a teacher. I see myself as a teacher in every aspect of my life--in my work, with my family, and in my Church calling.<br><br>When I teach I like to ask questions to begin a discussion with my students. So standing in front of you as a speaker--as a lecturer--is uncomfortable for me. As I speak to you today I will ask you to think about what I am saying. You may not be able to answer me the way you would in a classroom, but you should be able to form answers in your mind--and in your heart. I hope this will help you feel the Spirit and use what I will talk about in your personal development.<br><h2><b>Our Eternal Education</b></h2><br>My first teaching assignment at BYU was a class for students in the secondary mathematics education major. The class was titled "Exploration of Teaching." On the first day of class I had a discussion with my students about how they viewed teaching and learning through the lens of several metaphors. Today I would like to share with you some of our discussion. I want to look at how each of these metaphors might help us understand the eternal education we have come here on earth to receive.<br><br>Our eternal education begins with an understanding of where we have come from, why we are here, and where we are going after this life. In many ways these are the same questions we address as educators. We want to know about our students: we want to know where they are from, what their background is, what their home life was like, what cultural experiences they've had--anything we can draw from to help us teach them in a language and with examples they will understand. We want to instill in them a vision of where they are going, encourage them to set goals for themselves, and help them to attain those goals.<br><br>Today I ask you to think about the purpose of your life here on earth. When asked why you are here, you might say, "To receive a body," "To learn how to keep the commandments," or "To become like Christ."<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks wrote:<br><br><i>We are all children of a Heavenly Father who has sent us to earth with the invitation to prepare for eternal life. Every choice, every experience, every repentance and reformation, prepares us for what is to come.</i>[<i>Life's Lessons Learned: Personal Reflections</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2011), 52]<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson has told us:<br><br><i>Clearly, one primary purpose of our existence upon the earth is to obtain a body of flesh and bones. We have also been given the gift of agency. In a thousand ways we are privileged to choose for ourselves. Here we learn from the hard taskmaster of experience. We discern between good and evil. We differentiate as to the bitter and the sweet. We discover that there are consequences attached to our actions.</i>["The Race of Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 91–92]<br><br>Today I hope I can help you see how we use our gift of agency, how we learn from experience, and how we prepare for eternal life by becoming disciples of Christ.<br><br>That first day of class I asked my students to think with me about different ways to view education and about how those views might impact how they think about teaching and learning. I had the students get into groups, and I assigned each group a particular metaphor to use as a tool for thinking about education. One group discussed education as a race, another group was assigned to think about education as a garden, and the last group was asked to use family as their metaphor.<br><h2><b>Education as a Race</b></h2><br>When I asked my students to think about a race as a metaphor for education, they began the discussion with the notion of competition. Competition--is that a positive or a negative thing in education? Some students mentioned that an athlete is willing to win at all costs. What about the idea of growth as an athlete? How does that happen? What is the role of the coach? What is the role of the athlete?<br><br>During the summer Olympics this year, a colleague said to me, "Why are we so glued to each event--even when we really don't know anything about that event or anyone competing in it?" Perhaps the reason is that we love to see people truly excel at something.<br><br>Some competitors were so sad to receive a silver medal. They wanted the gold. It was an all-or-nothing proposition for them. For some competitors success has been easy; they have continually been told how good they are and that they are the best. Others were thrilled that they achieved their personal best time at the games. They were improving and getting ­better with each race or competition.<br><br>In the classroom there are some students who feel they can never be the best student in the class--the winner--so why should they continue to work? They might think, "If I can't be number one, then there is no point in trying at all."<br><br>As teachers we try to encourage growth in our students, not just winning. Is the student or athlete trying to improve his own learning and understanding or is he only trying to beat someone else? We want students to feel that their personal improvement is a victory and that working hard is the way to improve.<br><br>In our eternal education we should remember that we are not in competition with others. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has spoken about how the success of others does not diminish our efforts. He stated:<br><br><i>Brothers and sisters, there are going to be times in our lives when someone else gets an unexpected blessing or receives some special recognition. May I plead with us not to be hurt--and certainly not to feel envious--when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon. We are not in a race against each other to see who is the wealthiest or the most ­talented or the most beautiful or even the most blessed. The race we are<b>really</b>in is the race against sin, and surely envy is one of the most universal of those.</i>["The Laborers in the Vineyard,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 31; emphasis in original]<br><br>From a spiritual perspective, are we in a race for eternal life? Elder Neil L. Andersen addressed this issue in his April 2012 conference talk:<br><br><i>Jesus's call "Come, follow me" (Luke 18:22) is not only for those prepared to compete in a spiritual Olympics. In fact, discipleship is not a competition at all but an invitation to all. Our journey of discipleship is not a dash around the track, nor is it fully comparable to a lengthy marathon. In truth, it is a lifelong migration toward a more celestial world. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherever you now find yourself on the road of discipleship, you are on the right road, the road toward eternal life. Together we can lift and strengthen one another in the great and important days ahead.</i>["What Thinks Christ of Me?"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 112]<br><br>One more area of importance for me in the race metaphor is the role of the coach and the role of the athlete. The athletes at the Olympics were grateful to their coaches, who recognized their abilities, helped them know which race would best suit their natural talents, helped them improve, advised them about a strength that needed to be built, and encouraged them as they repeated a skill until their performance and their time improved.<br><br>I asked my education students if they had ever had a really good coach. If so, how did that coach help them improve? My students talked about how a coach helped them see what they needed to do to improve. A coach saw that to get off the blocks faster, a runner needed to strengthen a particular muscle. The coach gave the runner an assignment to spend time in the weight room to strengthen that muscle.<br><br>My students also talked about how they were the ones who needed to do the work. It is one thing to have a great coach who can see just what an athlete needs to do, but if the athlete does not follow the coach's guidance, then the muscle does not get stronger. And so it is in the classroom. The teacher can help the student know what he needs to do to improve his skill in reading or mathematics, but if the student does not do the work, then there is not much improvement.<br><br>How does this apply to our eternal education?<br><br>The scriptures are replete with stories of "coaches" who have advised and guided and taught others how they might better their performance as they strive to become disciples of Christ.<br><br>In Alma 39–42 we learn about the way Alma coached his son Corianton about the plan of salvation, about his current abilities and practices, and about what he needed to do to succeed in this life.<br><br>In chapter 39 Alma pointed out to Corianton the concerns he had with his performance:<br><br><i>Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.</i>[Alma 39:9]<br><br>Alma then helped Corianton see what he needed to do next to improve:<br><br><i>And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.</i>[Alma 39:10]<br><br>In verses 11 and 12 Alma reminded Corianton that he had sinned and that he needed to turn away from that activity.<br><br>In verse 13 Alma was very direct with Corianton when he told him:<br><br><i>Turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.</i>[Alma 39:13]<br><br>Alma seems to have understood the role of a coach. He provided clear instructions to Corianton about what he needed to do, and he encouraged him to follow those instructions. Alma knew that he could not change Corianton, but he also knew that Corianton could change by following his direction. Corianton had to exercise his agency and do the work to change his behavior.<br><br>I wish I could hear from all of you now. Are you thinking about a person you have coached or someone who has coached you? Are you thinking about a time when you did the hard work a coach told you to do so that you could improve your skills? Has this idea helped you in your eternal education? Have you been instructed about what you need to do to become a disciple of Christ?<br><br>We can learn from the story of Alma and Corianton, whether we are thinking of ourselves as the coach or as the athlete. As a coach/teacher we need to be kind and loving and supportive of the person we are trying to help. As the athlete/student we are responsible for doing the work that will help us become eternal disciples of Christ. We need to be listening to those coaches in our lives who can help us develop spiritually. These people may be our bishops, home teachers, visiting teachers, family members, or friends. We need to listen to their counsel and then exercise our agency by doing the work they know will help us grow spiritually.<br><h2><b>Education as a Garden</b></h2><br>How do we grow spiritually? What does that mean to us? Perhaps we can learn about that from the garden metaphor.<br><br>My students enjoyed discussing their views of education through the lens of the garden. They described the role of the teacher to be like that of the gardener who creates an environment in which children can learn, in which each student can grow into his or her full potential, whether that is an apple or a ­pumpkin--a scientist, an artist. It is the responsibility of the gardener to create an environment in which the seed can grow and in which students can thrive and develop.<br><br>I asked my students to think about what the role of the student is in this garden metaphor. We can learn a great deal about the role of the student when we read the parable of the sower in Matthew:<br><br><i>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</i><br><br><i>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</i><br><br><i>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</i><br><br><i>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</i><br><br><i>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</i><br><br><i>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</i>[Matthew 13:3–8]<br><br>When thinking about your eternal education to become a disciple of Christ, how have you prepared yourself to receive the gospel and to grow in your potential during this lifetime? Are you ignoring the gospel and not accepting the seeds, letting the fowls devour them? Are you the stony soil on which the gospel message falls but in which the roots of the gospel do not grow deep? Are you good ground in which the seeds of the gospel can take root and bring forth fruit?<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard said in his October 2012 conference address:<br><br><i>How do we take the seed of faith that has been nurtured in our minds and plant it deep in the fertile soil of our souls? How do we make the mighty change of heart that Alma says is essential for our eternal happiness and peace?</i>["Be Anxiously Engaged,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 30]<br><br>These questions posed by Elder Ballard are important for our eternal education. What do we do to plant the seed of faith in our hearts so that we can become disciples of Christ? This is a key question in education. How do students truly learn? Is a lecture in a classroom the best way to help students gain knowledge? Can students do a few homework problems and feel confident that they know the material? Just listening to others who are experts in a field is not enough to truly know something--to have it planted in your heart.<br><br>As educators we want our students to experience learning in multiple ways. We want students to read, to practice skills, and to discuss with others how they understand what they are learning. We want them to have personal experiences with knowledge. Then understanding becomes embedded in them and makes their learning personal and real. If we are to become disciples of Christ, we need to have personal experiences with what that means. What personal experiences have you had that have helped you become like Christ?<br><br>Have you ever been asked to do something for someone when you really did not want to do it? If you did it anyway, did you feel good about it? Did you get that feeling that service is a good thing to do? One of the blessings of service is the feeling of becoming like Christ. Initially you might have served others because your mind knew that you should. You might have heard friends or family members talk about serving others, and you might have done service in a group with others. But then one day you experienced service that<i>you</i>decided was worth doing, and the seed was planted in your heart. It was planted deep in your heart, and it began to grow. From that time on it began to help you in your eternal education to become a disciple of Christ.<br><br>In Alma 41 and the story of Alma's instruction to Corianton we see that the true nature of our heart--that which is planted and growing in our heart--is the nature that will be restored to us in the Resurrection:<br><br><i>And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</i><br><br><i>And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame--mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption--raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other.</i>[Alma 41:3–4]<br><br>So our eternal education, that of becoming a disciple of Christ, requires that we plant the seed of the gospel in our hearts--and live it. The garden metaphor helps us understand that we can plant the seed of the gospel in our hearts through our personal experiences.<br><h2><b>Education as a Family</b></h2><br>The final metaphor that we discussed in my education class is that of education as a family. How does a family help us think about education in a classroom--and about our eternal education?<br><br>Elder Paul E. Koelliker stated:<br><br><i>The Father's plan designated the pattern of the family to help us learn, apply, and understand the power of love. . . .</i><br><br><i>Because of the heaven-designed pattern of the family, we more fully understand how our Heavenly Father truly loves each of us equally and fully.</i>["He Truly Loves Us,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 18]<br><br>Children start life so dependent on their parents for everything: food, warmth, and safety. Parents teach their children, and sometimes that means correcting them. A truly loving parent is not demeaning when their children make mistakes. Instead, they help their children see what they need to do to make things right or to improve and to grow.<br><br>At school children learn many things beyond skills and knowledge. They learn to share, to work hard, to experience new things, to ask questions, and to explore new ideas. They learn to care about people other than themselves. Children in school may not always want to do their homework or practice a skill, but a teacher can help them see how this work will help them grow. Like loving parents, good teachers point out the small successes of their students so that their students will want to keep trying, to keep working, and to keep growing.<br><br>In a family in which children are taught the gospel, they learn to pray, to read the scriptures, and to go to church. They have experiences in which they feel the Spirit, and those experiences can help them recognize that feeling in the future. They<i>practice</i>being a disciple of Christ so that they can<i>become</i>a disciple of Christ. In the family is where they experience the gospel.<br><br>When I think of a family, I think of love and sacrifice. Parents love their children for many reasons, partly because they serve them every day. They sacrifice for them. They give their lives for them by giving their time and their resources to ensure their children's growth and success. Parents want the best for their children. I think that most parents would say their acts of love and service are not sacrifices--rather, giving their lives for their children is a joy.<br><br>There are many ways in which we learn to serve others and sacrifice for them. The Church provides opportunities for us to be of service. Last summer, when there was a great deal of wind damage in Davis County, bishops dismissed church after sacrament meeting so that members of the Church could cut up fallen trees and remove destroyed fences--truly serving each other. Similarly, Brigham Young sent Church members out from their meetings to help those struggling on the plains. During the 2012 general Relief Society meeting, President Henry B. Eyring spoke of the kind, loving Relief Society sisters who helped a family with preparing food, cleaning, and shopping when a tiny baby was born fifteen weeks early (see "The Caregiver,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 121–22).<br><br>Are we learning to serve others from these examples? Do we see the needs of others even when Church leaders do not ask us to give service? How does the family metaphor help us answer these questions?<br><br>The family metaphor is critical to the way in which we live the gospel. We know we are all eternal brothers and sisters in an eternal family. We know we share a loving Heavenly Father and a common Savior, who is our Elder Brother. I hope that as we become more like Christ we will want the best for others in the same way we want the best for our earthly families. I hope that we can love and serve everyone around us because we see them as members of our eternal family. If we love and serve others as we do the members of our earthly family, then it is not such a sacrifice to love and serve them any more than it is a sacrifice to be a parent.<br><br>In Alma 43 we read about how Corianton had learned the lesson of the family metaphor. When Corianton came to understand all that his father, Alma, had taught him, he spent the rest of his life teaching others the gospel:<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth.</i><br><br><i>Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which they were called.</i>[Alma 43:1–2]<br><br>Corianton and his brothers and his father lived the rest of their lives sharing the gospel with others. They showed their love for their eternal family through their service. Did Corianton do this as a sacrifice or because it gave him joy? I think it gave him joy because he understood that gaining his eternal education and becoming a disciple of Christ was not a race to be won but a lifelong journey. He began to coach others in how they should live the gospel. He had planted the seed of the gospel in his heart so that it could grow and rise with him in the Resurrection. He found joy in the loving service he gave to his eternal brothers and sisters by sharing the gospel with them.<br><h2><b>"In the Path of Discipleship"</b></h2><br>It is my prayer today that you will think about what it means to gain an eternal ­education--an education in which you become a disciple of Christ.<br><br>I pray that you will remember the race metaphor--that you will know you are not in a race with others for eternal life and that you will listen to those who are like coaches and who teach you how to develop as a disciple of Christ.<br><br>I pray that you can place the seed of the gospel in your heart and that your experiences living the gospel will help that seed to grow.<br><br>I pray that you will prepare for eternal life by loving and serving all of mankind as part of your eternal family--not as a sacrifice but with joy in the service.<br><br>In the Priesthood session of general conference in October 2012, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf stated what it means to be a disciple of Christ. Let me close with his remarks:<br><br><i>Let us deepen our faith in our Lord, Jesus Christ. Let us take upon ourselves His name and commit each single day to walk anew in the path of discipleship. Let our works make our faith perfect. Through discipleship we may be perfected one step at a time by serving our family, our fellowmen, and God.</i>["The Joy of the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 60]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Nancy Wentworth was chair of the BYU Department of Teacher Education when this devotional address was given on 27 November 2012.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>d You Think to Pray?&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Some years ago I heard a story about a little boy in Primary class who was asked to say the opening prayer.<br><br>"Heavenly Father," said the boy, "I thank thee for the letter A. I thank thee for the letter B. I thank thee for the letter C."<br><br>The teacher realized this could be a very long prayer, but she restrained herself from stopping him.<br><br>He went on to give thanks for every letter of the alphabet through Z. Then he said, "And Heavenly Father, I thank thee for the number one. I thank thee for the number two." And so on he went.<br><br>His teacher nearly panicked. She didn't know how high the boy could count. She felt she had to stop him, but again something seemed to restrain her. The boy kept on praying until he reached the number twenty. And then he said, "And Heavenly Father, I thank thee for my Primary teacher, who is the only grown-up that ever let me<i>finish</i>my prayer."<br><br>I have thought of that boy's prayer often. He helped me realize that I, too, am thankful for the alphabet, the numbers, and the shapes and the colors and for everything I learned in elementary school--things so easily taken for granted, the foundation stones of all learning. I feel grateful for every miraculous gift of God, for the wonders of His love, for the beauty of His creations, for all that is good and right and true flowing down from our Father in Heaven on high:<br><br><i>For the beauty of the earth,</i><br><i>For the beauty of the skies,</i><br><i>For the love which from our birth</i><br><i>Over and around us lies.</i><br>["For the Beauty of the Earth,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 92]<br><br>I am deeply thankful for the gift of prayer, which is surely among the greatest of gifts given by our Father in Heaven to His children on earth. Prayer is the ordained means by which men and women, and even little children, come to know God. It is our channel of communication with heaven. It is a priceless privilege.<br><br>My mother grew up in the small town of Liberty, Utah. When she was young, in the 1930s, her ward had an organist who could play only one hymn. The congregation sang other hymns a cappella, but at least once every Sunday they would sing, "Ere you left your room this morning, Did you think to pray?"<br><br>I especially love the third verse of the hymn:<br><br><i>When sore trials came upon you,</i><br><i>Did you think to pray?</i><br><i>When your soul was full of sorrow,</i><br><i>Balm of Gilead did you borrow</i><br><i>At the gates of day?</i><br>["Did You Think to Pray?"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 140]<br><br>I think of "the gates of day" as the opening to a realm of eternal daylight--gates of prayer that connect us with our heavenly home and the realm of glory where God and Christ dwell. When we pray, we borrow strength, love, and light at the very door of eternity.<br><br>Yet all too easily our prayers can become repetitive and perfunctory, a mere check on a checklist of duties and tasks in a given day. "I said my prayers" can be a phrase as routine and ordinary as "I did my homework" or "I bought the groceries." But prayer was never meant to be ordinary: it can be among the most exalted of privileges we enjoy in this mortal sphere.<br><br>Several years ago our oldest son shared with me a lesson he had learned about prayer. He was a very busy student at BYU. One evening he sat down to eat a quick dinner and, out of pure habit, said, "Please bless this food to nourish and strengthen my body." He opened his eyes and looked at his food: a Twinkie and a can of soda. He realized there was no way that food was going to nourish and strengthen his body.<br><br>He later explained to me that the experience taught him the meaning of the phrase "vain repetitions." When we repeat the same stock phrases over and over in prayer, but not with real intent--when our heart and mind are not in the prayer--then we are only engaging in vain repetition.<br><h2><b>Heartfelt Prayer</b></h2><br>Moroni's admonition about praying to know the truth of the Book of Mormon applies to all prayers: namely, that we "ask with a sincere heart, with real intent" (Moroni 10:4). True prayer is<i>heartfelt:</i>the words convey our deeply felt desires and are coupled with a commitment to act on the divine guidance we receive.<br><br>Heartfelt prayer comes from the depths of the soul. Our mind and heart are directed toward God with full and complete attention. When we pray from the heart, we are not just saying words or "going through the motions"; we are seeking to draw nearer to our Father in Heaven, to commune with Him in a personal and intimate manner. Heartfelt prayer is the furthest thing from a memorized recitation. We do not simply talk<i>at</i>God; rather, we talk<i>with</i>Him. This does not imply a face-to-face conversation as Moses experienced, but it does suggest communing with God by listening to the still, small voice of the Spirit. It means allowing time both during a prayer and after a prayer to hear spiritual promptings.<br><br>In Shakespeare's play<i>Hamlet,</i>Claudius, king of Denmark, kneels in prayer to seek forgiveness, but, upon rising, he knows that his entire prayer has been insincere and in vain. He says:<br><br><i>My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:</i><br><i>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.</i><br>[<i>Hamlet,</i>act 3, scene 3, lines 97–98]<br><br>The Lord desires that we speak with Him openly, honestly, and in plain, simple words. Any attempt at pretense in prayer is pointless, for the Lord knows our hearts perfectly; indeed, insincerity in prayer can become a subtle form of hypocrisy.<br><br>Huckleberry Finn in Mark Twain's great novel learned this when he tried to pray for forgiveness for having helped his black friend, Jim, escape from slavery:<br><br><i>I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from<b>me,</b>neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing double. . . . Deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie.</i>[<i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>(1884), chapter 31; emphasis in original]<br><br>If we examine our personal prayers carefully, we may discover that we often say things we do not really mean or even desire. We are not praying truthfully. The best corrective to this is to focus on the words and phrases we use in prayer and make sure we mean what we say. It also helps to set aside adequate time for prayer so as not to be rushed; to couple prayer with meditation; and to pray, if possible, in a place of quiet solitude.<br><br>The Lord's promise "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63) captures the essence of heartfelt prayer. Heartfelt prayer is not just a list of things to give thanks for and things to ask for. It entails coming to know God. It means seeking understanding of divine truths, seeking to better understand the purposes of one's life and how to best please God; it means talking with the Lord about things that matter most, what Nephi called "the things of my soul" (2 Nephi 4:15). Such experiences in prayer are sacred and will be cherished throughout our lives.<br><br>When we truly pray from the heart, we open our innermost feelings to our Father in Heaven: we tell Him of our challenges, our feelings of inadequacy and weakness; we share our emotions and feelings about decisions that face us or trials and adversity we experience; we freely express our sorrows and joys. Now, God knows our innermost thoughts and feelings even better than we do, but as we learn to share them with Him, we make it possible for His Spirit to enter our souls and teach us more about our own selves and about the nature of God. By making ourselves totally honest, open, and submissive before God, our hearts become more receptive to His counsel and His will.<br><br>Prayer should always be reverent and respectful, but our Father in Heaven assuredly is less concerned about the outward form of our prayers than about the state of our heart. Kneeling in prayer is an expression of humility and reverence and is the manner we often assume when offering our most heartfelt prayers. Nevertheless, not all are able to kneel, and many cannot kneel for very long and still concentrate. The Lord will hear our prayers if they are said standing, sitting, or even lying on our back in a hospital bed--provided we genuinely pray from the heart. My mission president once said that some of his best prayers were said running between two foxholes during World War II.<br><br>What should we ask for when we pray? The Bible Dictionary offers this important insight:<br><br><i>Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is<b>not</b>to change the will of God.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "prayer," 752–53; emphasis added]<br><br>Prayer should never be a matter of trying to change God's mind, to persuade Him of the rightness of our request, or to counsel Him as to what is best. God's will is perfect. He knows all things and sees the end from the beginning. He knows better than we do what is best for us. Sometimes we fervently plead for the Lord to give us certain things that He knows are not ultimately in our best interest or in that of a loved one: for example, to receive a certain job offer in a specific city or to prolong the life of a terminally ill or aged family member. The first order of prayer should be to learn the will of God and be given the strength to accept it. "Thy will be done" ought to grace all prayers, as it does the Lord's Prayer.<br><h2><b>Receiving Answers to Prayer</b></h2><br>Perhaps the most frequently asked question about prayer is this: "When I am seeking an answer about a question or decision in my life, how do I distinguish between the voice of the Spirit and my own feelings and desires?" It is a good question, for the Spirit often speaks to us in the form of feelings, but then we also have feelings that come from within ourselves. How do we know the difference?<br><br>To begin with, revelation requires effort on our part. We cannot expect answers without first preparing to receive revelation. When Oliver Cowdery struggled with translating the plates, the Lord counseled him to "study it out in your mind; then . . . ask me if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). We begin by learning all that we can about our decision or problem, and then we prayerfully ponder and weigh what course may be right, seeking counsel as appropriate from parents, family members, and friends. Then,<i>after</i>we have made a decision, we go to the Lord with the proposed answer or decision and seek confirmation. Normally He will not give us revelation regarding specific questions until we have taken this step and are prepared to ask if our decision be right.<br><br>Receiving answers to prayers also requires that both mind and heart be in tune. When Oliver Cowdery first began to translate the plates, the Lord told him this:<br><br><i>Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>Notice that revelation comes both<i>in the heart</i>and<i>in the mind.</i>The feelings of the heart and the understanding of the mind come together to give us an answer. If we have a good feeling, but our minds are unsettled, we should continue to study and pray. If in our mind we have developed a plan of action that makes sense but does not feel right, we may not yet have the answer. Only when heart and mind are in accord can we be confident that we have reached the right conclusion.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught the importance of our mind in the revelatory process when he said:<br><br><i>When you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon . . . ; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>151]<br><br>It is important to understand that the feelings that come with personal revelation are not excited, agitated, or highly emotional. If we want a particular answer badly enough, we may stir up feelings of excitement or artificial enthusiasm within us and take that for an answer, but this is only a form of self-deception. The voice of the Lord comes as "a still, small voice," and we must silence our own prejudices to hear it. In this regard I believe that we can overanalyze the scriptural phrase "your bosom shall burn within you" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). In my experience this simply means a feeling of inner peace. Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught the following:<br><br><i>What does a "burning in the bosom" mean? Does it need to be a feeling of caloric heat, like the burning produced by combustion? If that is the meaning, I have never had a burning in the bosom. Surely, the word "burning" in this scripture signifies a feeling of comfort and serenity.</i>["Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1997, 13]<br><br>Another way to describe the feeling associated with revelation is a sense of correctness or rightness. The answer will feel right, rather than leaving one with a sense of uneasiness or wrongness.<br><br>One great obstacle to receiving answers from God is fear, for fear is the opposite of faith. I have heard President Boyd K. Packer teach many times, "Brethren, do not take counsel from your fears." If you are fearful about leaving Provo or the state of Utah, it will be difficult for the Lord to give you an answer to take a job elsewhere. If you are afraid of getting married, you will somehow never find the answers needed to get there. If we fear to act on the inspiration we receive, it will become more difficult in the future to receive answers. If we learn to move forward in faith as the Spirit guides, we will make progress in life and grow in the principle of revelation. Remember Paul's great counsel to Timothy: "God hath not given us the spirit of fear" (2 Timothy 1:7).<br><h2><b>A Prayer in Paris</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, sometimes circumstances will arise in our lives when we face an urgent need for divine guidance and have neither the time to study it out nor any possible way of learning more about what course we should take. In such circumstances the Lord will surely guide us if we are open to the promptings and impressions of the Spirit.<br><br>In the summer of 1976 I spent two months in the Soviet Union with 150 other American students studying Russian. When the program ended late in July, we were given a week free to travel at our own expense anywhere in Europe before catching a charter flight from Paris back to the United States. I spent that week on a shoestring budget visiting friends and converts in the Düsseldorf Germany Mission, where I had earlier served.<br><br>Unfortunately, after booking a second-class train ticket from Düsseldorf to Paris, I realized I was down to the equivalent of only $38 in cash. I had no traveler's checks or credit cards. As the train sped toward Paris, I began to worry about how I would find a place to spend the night with so little money.<br><br>Arriving at the main train station in Paris, I got off the train with my luggage and looked around. I didn't know anyone in France, and I didn't speak the language. The sun was just setting, and I knew it would soon be dark. Suddenly I felt very lonely and somewhat anxious. I offered a simple, heartfelt prayer to the Lord: "Heavenly Father, please help me find a safe place to spend the night."<br><br>An impression came to me as plain and clear as any I have ever felt:<i>Walk two blocks forward and turn left, and there will be a hotel where you can spend the night.</i>With a deep feeling of peace I walked the two blocks forward and turned left. About a hundred feet in front of me was a small sign: Hotel. I knew this was where the Lord had led me to spend the night. Entering the hotel lobby, I stepped forward to the front desk where a man was sitting. "One single room, please," I said. The man hardly looked up.<br><br>"I'm sorry," he said, "Every room is booked. We have no vacancies." He proceeded to ignore me.<br><br>I asked, "Are you sure that you have no rooms? Perhaps there's been a change or a cancellation?"<br><br>He looked up at me and said firmly, "Young man, we have no rooms. It is the peak of the tourist season, and we have been booked solid for weeks. Every hotel around has been booked for weeks. You will not find a room anywhere in Paris."<br><br>What could I do? I began to leave the hotel, but as I reached the door onto the street, I thought, I<i>can't</i>just leave. The Lord led me here. I went back to the desk and said, "Sir, could you<i>please</i>at least look in your book and verify for sure that you have no rooms available this evening?"<br><br>Somewhat miffed, the clerk stood up, almost slammed his reservation book on the desk, and began flipping the pages quickly. "You see," he said, "there is nothing. We have no rooms, we have no rooms, we have no . . ."<br><br>Suddenly he stopped and stared at the page in puzzlement for a long time. Then he became very businesslike and said, "Well, it appears after all that we do have one single room vacant. That will be $35."<br><br>I do not remember much of that night, only that I felt safe and very blessed. The next morning I learned that the bus to Charles de Gaulle Airport stopped right in front of the hotel. To my great relief the fare was only $3. I arrived at the airport in time to catch my flight to JFK Airport, where, with only a few small coins left in my pocket, I was met by my beloved fiancée, Susan.<br><br>I have reflected on that experience many times. I was no one really--one of tens of thousands of students traveling through Europe that summer. The Lord could have said, "You got yourself into this, you can get yourself out." I suppose I might have slept in the train station or just wandered the streets all night. But, instead, as a loving Father, He led me to a place of refuge when I sought it in humble prayer.<br><br>I testify that He will bless and be merciful to you, too, as you seek Him in prayer. I know that God the Eternal Father lives. I know that His Son is our Redeemer. I was eighteen years old when I first received a pure witness by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is a living being, a real person, my friend and support in every time of need. In the intervening years I have come to know that the fruits of the Spirit are joy beyond expression and a deep inner peace that passes all understanding.<br><br>May His joy and peace be with each one of you at this sacred season of the year. I offer this prayer and bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bruce D.
